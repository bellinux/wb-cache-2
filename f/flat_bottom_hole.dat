In {{order to examine}} damage mechanisms in these materials, SiC/SiC coupons were impacted with 1. 59 mm diameter steel spheres at increasing velocities from 115 m/s to 400 m/s. Pulsed thermography, a nondestructive evaluation technique that monitors the thermal response of a sample over time, was utilized to characterize the impact damage.

40|$|A common {{approach}} to characterizing {{the performance of}} Thermographie Systems for Nondestructive Testing (TNDT) employs calibrated <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> samples, in which holes of different depths and diameters are milled into {{the back side of}} a plate of a material of interest. Although this approach offers an adequate means of assessing the ability of a system to detect a thermally insulating defect, as well as its ability to discriminate between defects at different depths, it provides only limited information about the spatial resolution capabilities of the system...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is the detection and characterization of cracks in structural materials. In the development of NDE methodologies, laboratory samples containing known flaws are very useful for the experimental verification of models and algorithms. Simulated flaws made to specific design serve to check the correctness of various aspects of an NDE technique under development. In addition, model flaws are also used in the calibration of nondestructive testing equipments. A familiar example is the ubiquitous <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> test blocks...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials are finding increasing application in aerospace, marine {{and many other}} industries due to their performance and structural efficiency. Maintenance inspection of these lightweight structures {{is a relatively new}} and difficult task for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), which need robust methods to be applicable in industrial environments. In this paper, a new numerical-experimental procedure to detect size and depth of <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>holes</b> in metallic and laminated composite structures by digital shearography (DISH) is proposed. The flaw detection capabilities of DISH have been evaluated by measuring the dynamic response of defects to applied stresses. Vibration dynamic loading is used to reveal <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>holes</b> made with different sizes and placed at different depths in CFRP laminates. The shearographic methodology is based on the recognition of the (0 1) resonance mode per defect. A simplified model of thin circular plate, idealized above each flaw position, is used to calculate the natural frequency of vibrating defects. Then, the numerical difference between experimental resonance frequencies and those computationally obtained is minimized using an unconstrained optimization algorithm in order to calculate the defect depth. Considering the simplicity and rapidity of this technique, the laser shearography methodology is evaluated reliable as NDT method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the pulsed thermographic responses of delaminations tend to overestimate {{the size of the}} flaw. Since the heat diffuses in the plane parallel to the surface, the resulting temperature profile over the flaw is larger than the flaw. A variational method is presented {{for reducing the}} thermographic data to produce an estimated size for the flaw that is much closer to the true size of the flaw. The size is determined from the spatial thermal response of the exterior surface above the flaw and a constraint on the length of the contour surrounding the flaw. The technique is applied to experimental data acquired on a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> composite specimen...|$|E

40|$|Probability of {{detection}} (POD) analysis {{is used in}} assessing reliably detectable flaw size in nondestructive evaluation (NDE). MIL-HDBK- 1823 and associated mh 1823 POD software gives most common methods of POD analysis. In this paper, POD analysis is applied to an NDE method, such as eddy current testing, where calibration is used. NDE calibration standards have known size artificial flaws such as electro-discharge machined (EDM) notches and <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> (FBH) reflectors which are used to set instrument sensitivity for detection of real flaws. Real flaws such as cracks and crack-like flaws are desired to be detected using these NDE methods. A reliably detectable crack size is required for safe life analysis of fracture critical parts. Therefore, {{it is important to}} correlate signal responses from real flaws with signal responses form artificial flaws used in calibration process to determine reliably detectable flaw size...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} scientific industrial problems in recent years is automatic defect detection and characterization. Automatic defect detection can replace human operators who locate and identify defects. Detection of defects in the steam generating tubes through periodic in-service inspection is one {{of the most}} significant issues of the fast breeder reactors. Among various pipeline inspection technologies, Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) Non Destructive inspection is the most prevalent and perfect one. The image of the pipeline is obtained by MFL technique. The obtained image is undergone preprocessing. Then defect region is identified and detected by segmentation (K-means and Thresholding) techniques. The main aspire of this paper is to characterize the defects. A simple and efficient algorithm was developed to characterize the rectangular notch and <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> defects in MFL image. The length and width of the defect were obtained using the characterization algorithm...|$|E

Data recorded on metal and CFRP test specimens with <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>holes</b> (FBH) were analysed by evaluating the detectability and by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the defect signatures as a function of defect parameters. For the investigation of the influence of material properties on the spatial resolution as well as on penetration depth, test specimens made of steel and copper with crossed notches and a notch ramp were constructed and investigated.

40|$|A {{number of}} signal {{processing}} techniques exist to improve {{signal to noise}} ratio of ultrasonic signals. One such technique is called Complex Plane Split Spectrum Processing (CSSP). This technique is a modification to the Split Spectrum Processing (SSP) technique. CSSP is capable of being able to surpass SSP in terms of improvements in {{signal to noise ratio}}s, while maintaining linearity in both the amplitude and the energy content of a flaw's signal. [1] CSSP makes use of an additional mathematical dimension (the complex plane) when solving for the probability that a signal originates from a real reflector such as a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole.</b> This paper outlines work performed on laminate composite materials (carbon fibre and G 11 phenolic sheet material) to assess the efficacy of the CSSP technology on these materials. This paper also serves to formalize some of the validation steps required of CSSP such that it may be ported from the laboratory to industrial application as an ultrasonic testing technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{inspection}} of wall loss corrosion is difficult at pipe supports due to limited accessibility. The recently developed ultrasonic Multi-Skip screening technique {{is suitable for}} this problem. The method employs ultrasonic transducers in a pitch-catch geometry positioned {{on opposite sides of}} the pipe support. Shear waves are transmitted in the axial direction within the pipe wall, reflecting multiple times between the inner and outer surfaces before reaching the receivers. Along this path, the signals accumulate information on the integral wall thickness (e. g., via variations in travel time). The method is very sensitive in detecting the presence of wall loss, but it is difficult to quantify both the extent and depth of the loss. Multi-skip tomography has been developed to reconstruct the wall thickness profile along the axial direction of the pipe. The method uses model-based full wave field inversion; this consists of a forward model for predicting the measured wave field and an iterative process that compares the predicted and measured wave fields and minimizes the differences with respect to the model parameters (i. e., the wall thickness profile). Experimental results are very encouraging. Various defects (slot and <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole)</b> are reconstructed using the tomographic inversion. The general shape and width are well recovered. The current sizing accuracy is in the order of 1 mm...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} determine the flaw detection sensitivity of advanced nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques with respect to structural applications. The techniques analyzed exemplify the incorporation of digital technology into NDT and includes the following: meandering winding magnetometer array (MWM-array@) eddy current, phased-array ultrasonic (PA-UT), three dimensional computed tomography (3 DCT), and digital radiography (DR). The three classes of samples inspected with these techniques consisted of alloy block specimens containing <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> (FBH) arrays, probability of detection (POD) wedding cake samples, and actual airplane engine components. Results from the sensitivity analyses were compared to current NDT techniques used industrially. An image analysis program called Cellprofiler was used to optimize the threshold correction factor for selected results. The Cellprofiler output was analyzed in conjunction with POD software, and the integration of digitally advanced NDT techniques with image analysis software resulted in approximately a threefold improvement in the minimum detectable flaw size at the 90 / 95 POD/CL level. An improved inspection methodology was presented which incorporated redundancy in the in-service inspection plan {{with the use of}} Bayesian updating techniques to forecast remnant life. Reliability block diagrams for structural disk and blade aircraft engine components were presented as examples of the methodology. Implementation of the proposed NDT methodology significantly increases the feasibility of a retirement-forcause (RFC) approach to be applied to aging structural components in a cost-effective manner. by Brian P.

Data recorded at metal test specimens with <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>holes</b> (FBHs) were analysed by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the defect signatures in the thermograms {{as well as in}} the phase images as a function of defect parameters. A new multi-parameter probability of detection (POD) model was developed, where an Ã¢ versus a continuous signal analysis was based on the linear relationship between the SNR and a multi-parameter a.

40|$|Phased array {{transducers}} {{are playing}} an increasing role in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation inspection applications, and {{one area of}} their use is in the inspection of critical jet engine components such as titanium alloy turbine disk forgings. Inspection of these forging disks is performed during stages of their manufacturing, particularly at an intermediate stage when the forging disk has a deliberate 2 ̆ 2 sonic shape. 2 ̆ 2 A forging 2 ̆ 7 s sonic shape, from which the final disk shape will be machined, is conducive to ultrasonic testing inspections due to its simple entry surfaces. These entry surfaces are primarily planar or conical surfaces. In prior work, forgings from General Electric Aircraft Engines, Pratt 2 ̆ 6 Whitney, and Honeywell Engines and Systems were ultrasonically inspected through their planar interfaces, accomplished with a 10 MHz, segmented annular, compound spherical, phased array transducer designed to perform inspections through planar interfaces. Proof-of-concept research used this array along with surface compensating ultrasonic mirrors to inspect through the conical entry surfaces in these forgings. While successful, {{it was believed that}} the results of these inspections fell below what would be possible due to non-ideal focusing conditions and other focusing aberrations. To correct for focusing aberrations when inspecting through forging material planar and curved interfaces, three progressively more sophisticated ray-tracing algorithms were developed to generate delay time sets for phasing transducer array elements, including an initial 2 D method from prior work, a refined 2 D method designed to more accurately account for refraction at interfaces, and a 3 D method designed for circumferentially phasing the segmented annular array. Ultrasonic inspections using these methods were performed on two sets of forging material specimens, with either planar or curved interfaces, thicknesses ranging from 0. 2 inches to 2. 7 inches, and each containing a 1 / 128 -inch-diameter <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> (# 1 / 2 FBH) reflector. FBH responses from planar interface specimens allowed comparison of the initial and refined 2 D inspection methods. The refined 2 D inspection method used on the planar and curved interface specimens evaluated the performance of the surface compensating mirror. The refined 2 D and 3 D inspection methods were compared using the curved interface specimens...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce costs of {{production}} and increase economic sustainability {{it is necessary to}} perform non-destructive tests at an early stage in the manufacturing process. Laser metal deposition (LMD) of titanium alloys using wire feed technology is a fairly young technology and is still in a developing stage. Thus the necessity of introducing non-destructive examination adapted to LMD/wire parts is even higher. The main purpose of the project was to evaluate usability of ultrasonic immersion testing for detecting lack of fusion defects in specific LMD test samples. Additionally, eddy current technique was examined as probable complementary inspection. Initially, theoretical study was performed on applying ultrasonic tests to LMD parts {{as well as on the}} characteristics of lack of fusion and its detectability. The experimental part of ultrasonic tests consisted of evaluation of available probes for the application, creating and optimizing amplification curves according to the reference as well as performing planar scans on available samples. Different incidence surfaces and their conditions were evaluated in terms of usability for inspection. As the result, several inspection limitations were identified. Subsequently, complimentary theoretical study was performed focusing on eddy current inspection. Eddy current experiments were performed on reference plate, using both plane surface as well as surface containing notches. Additionally, scans were performed on LMD/w samples with two different surface conditions. Comparison of the results was provided. Applying ultrasonic immersion testing for LMD/w test pieces showed satisfying results in terms of usability of the method. The results of the ultrasonic testing revealed a number of limitations when it came to inspection capabilities. To start with, raw surface conditions reduced the reliability of the inspection. Certain volumes close to the incidence surface as well as close to the edges of component were restricted from inspection. Using optimized settings it was possible to detect flaws producing signals comparable to the target (i. e. 0. 4 mm <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole).</b> Eddy current inspection showed capabilities of being used as a complementary method for inspection of limited volumes of close to the edge area. Yet, the conclusion was based mainly on reference defects. Additionally, depending on the size of reference defects, the detectability of flaws varied regarding to the depth. The milled surface condition of LMD parts provides similar inspection conditions to the ones of reference plate...|$|E

The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using immersion test data from a block with side-drilled holes with an additional scatterer residing in water. In this way, the method’s capability of simultaneously imaging scatterers in different media and at different depths was investigated.
