The Commission appears to be on a completely different track when it comes to non-merger arrangements, such as strategic alliances, distribution agreements, technology licenses, joint selling <b>agreements</b> and <b>joint</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>agreements.</b> While the Commission is seeking to maximize legal certainty for companies planning concentrations, in the other spheres of business activity which fall within the ambit of Articles 81 and 82, including those noted above, the Commission has decided that the legal certainty afforded by the old notification/exemption system should be abandoned in favor of a 2 ̆ 2 self-assessment 2 ̆ 2 system. In short, the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s time-honored notification regime will vanish starting in May 2004. The self-assessment system is actually part of a larger reform of Commission enforcement policy known as the 2 ̆ 2 modernization 2 ̆ 2 program, which is intended to result in a large devolution of enforcement of Articles 81 and 82 to the Member State competition authorities and courts. The post-modernization climate will have long-lasting effects on the way in which competition law is practiced in the European Union.

Further, clear predictions emerge for the price pattern, contrasting with the existing literature: with multiple purchases only, the firm offers strict quantity dis-counts; with <b>joint</b> <b>purchases</b> only, discounts are infeasible. 1...|$|R
