50|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} requires {{cryogenic storage}} technology such as special thermally <b>insulated</b> <b>containers</b> and requires special handling {{common to all}} cryogenic fuels.

50|$|A hay box, straw box, fireless cooker, {{insulation}} cooker, wonder oven or retained-heat cooker is a cooker that utilizes {{the heat}} of the food being cooked to complete the cooking process.

5000|$|A {{reaction}} calorimeter is a calorimeter {{in which a}} chemical reaction is initiated within a closed <b>insulated</b> <b>container.</b> Reaction heats are measured and the total heat is obtained by integrating heatflow versus time.

5000|$|Dry ice {{can also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a fog machine to create a low-lying fog effect. Dry ice is placed inside an <b>insulated</b> <b>container</b> with an [...] at each end. Fog from a fog machine is pumped in one side of the container, and allowed to flow out the other end. Although this technique does allow an individual to create low-lying fog [...] "on the cheap" [...] (when compared to the cost of renting cylinders of liquid CO2 or watertight containers with integral heaters), the volume of low-lying fog produced is typically less, and is more susceptible to atmospheric disturbances.|$|E
50|$|For an {{adiabatic}} free {{expansion of}} an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an <b>insulated</b> <b>container</b> and then allowed to expand in a vacuum. Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero. Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the {{first law of thermodynamics}} then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.|$|E
