5|$|<b>For</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> mining was an {{important}} industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|Its name {{derives from}} potlatch, {{a type of}} {{ceremony}} held by the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest; one such tribe lived along the river <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> {{before the arrival of}} whites. Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century. After that, logging eliminated most of the forests within the watershed and the ecology of the river is {{still in the process of}} recovery. Fishing, hiking and camping are popular recreational activities on the river; 14 percent the watershed lies on public lands. Before logging and agriculture, many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment, and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries.|$|E

5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also {{run into the}} bay. The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide range}} of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'.

The remains of the city were eventually absorbed by nearby Cairo, which had been built to the north of Fustat in 969 when the Fatimids conquered the region and created a new city as a royal enclosure for the Caliph.

Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada or the United States, finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land.|$|E

Domesticated rock pigeons are also bred as carrier pigeons, used {{for thousands of years}} to carry brief written messages, and release doves used in ceremonies. White doves are also commonly used in magic acts.|$|E

Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials, including naphtha, turpentine, dyes, and gum arabic, using straightforward chemical engineering processes. Shoe polish is usually flammable, can be toxic, and, if misused, can stain skin. It should be used in a well-ventilated area with care taken to protect clothes, carpet and furniture.|$|E

5|$|After {{the islands}} were {{transferred}} to Scotland, thousands of Scots families emigrated to Shetland in the 16th and 17th centuries but studies of the genetic makeup of the islands' population indicate that Shetlanders are just under half Scandinavian in origin. A sizeable component of Scandinavian patrilineal ancestry {{has been reported in}} Orkney (55%) and Shetland (68%). This combination is reflected in many aspects of local life. For example, almost every place name in use {{can be traced back to}} the Vikings. The Norn language was a form of Old Norse, which continued to be spoken until the 18th century when it was replaced by an insular dialect of Scots known as Shetlandic, which is in turn being replaced by Scottish English. Although Norn was spoken <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> it is now extinct and few written sources remain. Shetlandic is used both in local radio and dialect writing, and kept alive by the Shetland Folk Society.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor and Stuart periods, horse {{ownership}} {{was more}} widespread in Britain than in continental Europe, but it suffered {{a decline in}} the harsh economic environment of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With economic recovery, the number of horse owners increased again. Travel became more popular, along with the hiring of horses, although a common practice at the time was for a traveller to buy a horse for a journey, and then sell it on arrival at his destination. Horses had been raced in Britain <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> by the time of King James VI of Scotland (1567– 1625), but he brought the sport as it is known today into England from Scotland while he was king of both countries (1603– 1625); he organised public races in a number of places, and continued to import quality animals aimed at the development of a new, lighter, faster type of horse.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
