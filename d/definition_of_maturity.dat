50|$|The {{status of}} {{maturity}} is distinguished by the {{shift away from}} reliance on guardianship and the oversight of an adult in decision-making acts. Maturity has different definitions across legal, social, religious, political, sexual, emotional, and intellectual contexts. The age or qualities assigned {{for each of these}} contexts are tied to culturally-significant indicators of independence that often vary as a result of social sentiments. The concept of psychological maturity has implications across both legal and social contexts, while a combination of political activism and scientific evidence continue to reshape and qualify its definition.

40|$|When Adorno {{refers to}} the concept of {{maturity}} (Mündigkeit), he generally means having the courage and the ability to use one’s own understanding independently of dominant heteronomous patterns of thought. This Kantian-sounding claim is essentially an exhortation: maturity demands self-liberation from heteronomy, i. e. autonomy. The problem, however, is that in spite of Adorno’s general endor-sement of Kant’s <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturity,</b> he ultimately rejects the corresponding Kantian definition of autonomy. Yet Adorno does not simply discard the Kantian concept of autonomy. On the contrary, he will try to correct it by returning to it what it lacks, namely, intimacy or ‘live contact with the warmth of things’. In this gesture, he aims to restore to autonomy its ethical substance or lived ethical context, not as a mere supplement to the purity of duty, but rather as necessary to the very process of becoming mature. This article examines Adorno’s concept of maturity {{in the context of the}} dialectical relationship between autonomy and intimacy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Maturity {{models are}} popular {{instruments}} used, e. g., to rate capabilities of maturing elements and select appropriate actions {{to take the}} elements {{to a higher level}} <b>of</b> <b>maturity.</b> Their application areas are wide spread and range from cognitive science to business applications and engineering. Although there are many maturity models reported in scientific and non-scientific literature, the act of how to develop a maturity model is for the most part unexplored. Many maturity models simply – and vaguely – build on their, often well-known, predecessors without critical discourse about how appropriate the assumptions are that form the basis of these models. This research sheds some light on the construction <b>of</b> <b>maturity</b> models by analysing 16 representative maturity models {{with the help of a}} structured content analysis. The results are transformed into a set of questions which can be used for the (re-) creation <b>of</b> <b>maturity</b> models and are answered with the help of the case example <b>of</b> a knowledge <b>maturity</b> model. Furthermore, a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the term <b>maturity</b> model is developed from the study’s results...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} {{into one of the}} important functions of the banking system: to transform short-term liquid deposits into long-term illiquid financial assets that can fund long gestation activities and, thus, raise the rate of economic growth. To investigate this function empirically, the dissertation uses two new data sets on the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> bank credit to the private sector. First data set contains yearly observations covering 74 countries during the period from about 1990 to 2005, while the second data set contains quarterly observations covering 14 transition countries from about 1995 to 2006. Using the data on a broad set of countries, the dissertation shows that economic growth is enhanced in countries where the financial system extends more long-term credit. This finding is the first empirical confirmation of the theoretical predictions regarding the liquidity transformation function of banks. Furthermore, using the same data set, the dissertation shows that credit maturity depends on a number of institutional and economic factors. The determinants <b>of</b> credit <b>maturity</b> have an impact on economic growth via their influence on the availability of long-term external financing. Credit maturity is longer in countries with strong legal institutions, with low inflation, with deeper financial markets, and with schemes for sharing credit information between financial institutions. From a policy perspective, the institutions for sharing credit information probably present the most interest because their establishment is a policy choice. Findings from the broad set of countries are confirmed in the second data set using several <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturity.</b> Additional results from the second data set suggest that credit maturity is longer in countries at the higher level of economic development, with less liquid stock markets, and with more privately owned domestic banks. Furthermore, the results suggest that credit information sharing mechanisms lengthen the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> credit if credit information sharing institutions are privately owned or have greater quality of information...|$|R

Yet despite this extensive body of knowledge, there is no psychological or legal <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturity</b> {{that can be applied}} to legal decision making. Within a criminal context, investigations of adolescent immaturity have emphasized cognitive factors, influenced by the informed consent model which places a premium on factors such as “knowledge” and “competence”, with an emphasis on cognitive functioning (e. g., thinking, reasoning, and understanding). This approach has been criticized for failing to adequately illustrate differences between adolescent and adult decision making.

40|$|Maturity {{models are}} one of the {{widespread}} areas in the field of improving organizational performance. Maturity models identify organizational strengths and weaknesses in addition to providing benchmarking information. Project management maturity models are important assessment tools for the profession. Companies assess their organizational performance and identify their weaknesses and strengths in terms of their needs and objectives and also characteristics of the models. The important issue here is that construction companies can assess their organizational performance by a comprehensive and useful model. This can help them compare their situation with other companies by using the same model. There are many maturity models like OPM 3, P-CMM, CMMI, OPMMM, TMM, P 3 M 3, SPICE, BPMM, FAAiCMM, (PM) 2, Kerzner’s Project Management Maturity Model, Ibbs and Kwak Maturity Model, RMMM, TMM, etc. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out the best maturity model for using in construction companies.

In the "Golden Belt", potential productive levels are Early Paleozoic in age and the reliable assessment <b>of</b> their thermal <b>maturity</b> is crucial for evaluating hydrocarbon generation/expulsion scenarios. When exploring Lower Paleozoic targets that are devoid of vitrinite macerals, uncertainties in thermal maturity evaluation can occur according to commonly adopted parameters (e. g., vitrinite reflectance). These uncertainties can negatively influence targets assessment. We adopted a multi-method approach to assess thermal <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> the Silurian sections encountered in three wells deep between 2. 9 and 3. 3 km, recently drilled in the Polish Baltic Basin. The methodological strategy consists of: (i) measurement of organoclasts (mainly graptolites) reflectance; (ii) FT-IR spectroscopy on bulk dispersed organic matter; (iii) X-ray diffraction on < 2 μm grain-size fraction of sedimentary core samples. Organoclasts reflectance is between 0. 6 and 1. 4 % indicating a large range <b>of</b> thermal <b>maturity</b> spanning from early to late mature stages of hydrocarbon generation. Mixed layers illite-smectite and FT-IR indexes (e. g.

In the novel, Adam, who encounters some tragic events, moves through a process of development as seen through the beginning {{until the end of the}} novel. He is initially portrayed as a young immature man who is married by his weak qualities. Nevertheless, through certain events in his life, he develops to be more mature. These events are tragic, yet, they apparently give enormous contribution to Adam's developing character. Therefore, the thesis writer is encouraged to expose Adam's character development in order to trace what factors influentially leading him to his maturity. The thesis writer intends to analyze it by finding out Adam's initial character traits before he becomes a mature man, analyzing the process of development, and examining his changing character traits. In analyzing the novel, the thesis writer applies the literary theories of characterization and conflict as well as the psychological <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturity.</b> In the analysis, the thesis writer finds out that resentfulness, intolerance and unforgivingness indicate Adam's character traits before his maturity. Moreover, having analyzed the events in Adam's life, the writer finds out that his character development is much influenced by some external and internal factors. The external factors are the events themselves, which are tragic and forcefully powerful to provoke Adam's personal and emotional response. The internal factor is the suffering-as Adam's emotional response-because of the tragic events. These external and internal factors have strong influence to teach Adam that he actually loves his father and that he needs to have mercy towards other people. Eventually, Adam's character changes.

30|$|Aromatic {{fractions}} of 140 oils and condensates that originated from {{different types of}} source rocks (marine shale, terrestrial shale and marine carbonate) were analyzed using gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) to investigate the relative distributions of methylated dibenzothiophenes with respect to thermal maturity. The positions of methyl groups of trimethyldibenzothiophene isomers (TMDBTs) including those used in the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturity</b> indicator TMDBT index in previous studies were firmly identified by co-elution of internal standards in GC-MS analysis and by comparing with reported retention indices. A new maturity ratio related to dimethyldibenzothiophenes (DMDBTs) is proposed {{on the basis of}} the differences in thermodynamic stability among different DMDBT isomers. Another maturity index (TMDBT-I 2) based on TMDBTs is also suggested on the basis of our empirical observations and presumed thermodynamic stability of TMDBT isomers. These two newly proposed (2, 6 + 3, 6)-/l, 4 -DMDBT ratio and TMDBT-I 2 correlate well with MDR (4 -/l-methyldibenzothiophene) and 2, 4 -/ 1, 4 -DMDBT ratios, suggesting their common chemical reaction mechanisms and similar behavior with increasing maturity. Therefore, they can be effectively applied for maturity assessments. Furthermore, the TMDBTs related maturity parameters are more reliable for over-mature oils and condensates due to the relatively higher concentrations of thermodynamically unstable TMDBT isomers, i.e. 1, 4, 6 -, 1, 4, 8 - and 3, 4, 6 -TMDBT in this study than those of 1 -methyldibenzothiophene (1 -MDBT) or 1, 4 -DMDBT. In contrast with 4, 6 -/ 1, 4 -DMDBT, the newly proposed (2, 6 + 3, 6)-/ 1, 4 -DMDBT ratios for oils that originated from different types of source rocks have approximately same relationship with the oil maturity (Rc %). This suggests that the lithology and organic facies may have relatively less influence on (2, 6 + 3, 6)-/ 1, 4 -DMDBT ratio compared to 4, 6 -/ 1, 4 -DMDBT. The maturity parameters based on methylated dibenzothiophenes are particularly useful in the maturity assessments of post- and over-mature oils and condensates and can complement maturity indicators based on steranes and terpanes.|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. In the {{volatile}} telecommunication industry, innovation {{is the key}} to success. Mobile Telephone Network South Africa (MTN SA) needs to launch new products and services consistently to stay on the competitive edge. Consequently, effective project management becomes the key to gaining the competitive advantage by turning new product or service concepts into reality. According to Nokes and Kelly (2007 : 153 – 156), there is a high correlation between project success and effective project scope management. The effectiveness of project scope management can drastically affect the success of projects, as changes to the project scope may severely affect the project value creation, timeline, quality and cost. Accordingly, high project scope management maturity would contribute tremendously to the effectiveness of project management. The purpose of this present research is to define a roadmap to guide MTN’s Business Optimisation (BO) department to project scope management excellence. To meet this aim, the researcher utilises the concept of a Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM), as a guideline {{for the creation of a}} project scope management maturity model. The created project scope management maturity model is then utilised to provide an effective means to measure MTN SA’s project scope management maturity and identify the gaps prohibiting MTN SA from project scope excellence (Kerzner, 2004 : 193). Based on the literature review on the elements of project scope excellence, this paper suggests that there is a general misunderstanding regarding the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturity.</b> Many believe that process rigorousness indicates maturity, and have forgotten the criticality of the organisational culture that fosters an environment for project scope excellence and the effective use of the project scope process. iii This research offers a comparative study on the most popular and effective maturity models in the market, to identify the models that truly contribute to project scope management success and excellence. Finally, the research tailors the models to a project scope management focused maturity model, to assess MTN SA’s project scope management maturity from all aspects, and proposes a roadmap toward project scope management excellence...|$|E

However, as suggested in the UK Government Strategy, the relevant gains and difficulties related {{to the adoption of}} BIM in the operational stages of the project life cycle are considerably less explored in the available literature. In this respect, a gap of knowledge exists in relation to the value that design and construction information modelling can generate after construction is finished. Moreover, the difficulties involved in shifting from traditional to BIM-Based FM processes are not known. In this article a discussion is proposed that address some of the issues involved in the adoption of BIM from an owners' perspective.

Due to lack of field data, efforts to quantify crop yield potential typically rely on crop models. Using the ORYZA rice crop model, we sought to estimate Yp of irrigated rice for two widely used rice varieties (M- 206 and CXL 745) in three major US rice-producing regions that together represent {{some of the highest}} yielding rice regions of the world. Three major issues with the crop model had to be addressed to achieve acceptable simulation of Yp; first, the model simulated leaf area index (LAI) and biomass agreed poorly for all direct-seeded systems using default settings; second, cold-induced sterility and associated yield losses were poorly simulated for environments with a large diurnal temperature variation; lastly, simulated Yp was sensitive to the specified <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> physiological <b>maturity.</b> Except for the simulation of cold-induced sterility, all issues could be remedied within the existing model structure. In contrast, simulation of cold-induced sterility posed a continuing challenge to accurate simulation—one that will likely require changes to ORYZA's formulation. Estimates of Yp from the modified model were validated against large multi-year data sets of experimental yields covering the majority of US rice production areas. Validation showed the adjusted model simulated Yp well, with most top yields falling within 85 % of Yp for both varieties (77 % and 78 % observed yields within 15 % of Yp for CXL 745 and M- 206 respectively). Maximum estimated Yp was 14. 3 (range of 8. 2 – 14. 5) and 14. 5 (range of 8. 7 – 15. 3) tha‐ 1 for the Southern US and CA, respectively...|$|R

The preschool children start with sport like football, tennis or gymnastic which can constitute an unilateral burden. This kind of burden, which is inadequate for the children, can cause an emergence of functional and structural lesions of motoric system. Rehabilitation of the incorrect posture is important prerequisite for the children were ready to go to school or for the initiation of sports activities. It is necessary to identify the preschool children's postural maturity. If an underdeveloped postural stabilization is dected by children parents of these children will be noticed ftbout the threat which is conected with sports activities. The thesis deals with an application of simple motor skills tests, assessment and evaluation in children aged 5 - 6 years. The aim of the project: This study aims an evaluation <b>of</b> the postural <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> children in pre-school age by means of selected clinical tests. Another aim is an evaluation a reciprocal influence <b>of</b> children's postural <b>maturity</b> and performance in sports activities. Method of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Document {{understanding}} has {{attained a}} level <b>of</b> <b>maturity</b> that requires migration from ad-hoc experimental systems, {{each of which}} employs {{its own set of}} assumptions and terms, into a solid, standard frame of reference, with generic definitions that are agreed upon by the document understanding community. The logical structure of a document conveys semantic information that is beyond the document's character string contents. To capture this additional semantics, document understanding must relate the document's physical layout to its logical structure. This work provides a formal <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the logical structure of text-intensive documents. A generic framework using a hierarchy of textons is described for the interpretation of any text-intensive document logical structure. The recursive <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> textons provides a powerful and flexible tool that is not restricted by the size or complexity of the document. Frames are analogously used as recursive constructs for the physical struct [...] ...|$|R
