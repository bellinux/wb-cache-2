The scenario was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Material</b> Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility where the above hazards could be recreated.

The U.S. Coast Guard arrived by boat with a team on September 7, with a preliminary damage assessment completed four days later; the team repaired a generator to provide power. The United States Navy's combat stores ship, the USNS San Jose (T-AFS-7), and sixteen members United States Air Force's 36th Contingency Response Group at Andersen AFB, Guam arrived on September 8 and analyzed the stability of the airfield along with assisting in clean-up efforts, and after core tests workers cleared the runway to allow flights onto the territory.

5|$|The southernmost {{part of the}} Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, {{from south}} of DE 10 to north of Bay Road, was placed under {{construction}} in 1990 and opened along with the DoverSmyrna portion of DE 1 in 1993. US 113 traffic needed to use a temporary tie-in during construction, and after the new freeway opened, traffic on the U.S. Highway needed to use Exit 95 to transfer between the new freeway and Bay Road. The extension of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later due {{to the need to}} coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to remediate <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new main gate, and reconstruct base housing {{on the west side of}} the highway. The main gate to Dover Air Force base was moved further east, and a diamond interchange was built between the main gate and the base housing area. The upgrade of US 113 and DE 1 through the military base was built in two phases, the first from 1996 to 1998 and the second in 1999 and 2000.|$|E

40|$|The <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> risk {{management}} process involves a set of crucial logistical decisions referring to the planning of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> transportation {{and the organization of}} the emergency response operations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a Decision Support System for <b>hazardous</b> <b>Materials</b> Transportation Risk Management that covers integrated <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> distribution and emergency response decisions. The inherent interrelationships between the emerging <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> logistical problems imply the integration of routing and emergency response logistical decisions in order to improve the effectiveness of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> emergency response process. The proposed system contributes substantially to this objective by providing the following capabilities: (i) provision of alternative efficient <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> distribution routes in terms of minimum cost and risk, (ii) identification of the emergency response units locations that minimise the incident response time and secure a predefined service level for <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> incidents, (iii) routing of the emergency response units, and (iv) identification of optimum evacuation plans i. e. optimum evacuation paths and traffic assignment given the evacuation area. The focus of this paper is on the exposition of the proposed Decision Support System components and capabilities while special emphasis is placed on the contribution of this system to the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> {{risk management}} process.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the lane reservation strategy in the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> transportation. Once an accident of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> transportation happens, its effect is significant. Lane reservation can reduce the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> transportation risk enormously; however, it will also impact on the normal traffic. The proposed problem is to choose lanes to be reserved on the network and select the path for each <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> shipment among the reserved lanes {{in order to make}} a trade-off between the impact on the normal traffic and the total risk of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> transportation. We first develop a multi-objective integer linear programming model for the problem with multiple types of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> and multiple origin-destination pairs. Then we adopt the ε-constraint method to solve the multi-objective model. The performance of the method is evaluated on a large set of randomly generated instances. Computational results show that the ε-constraint method can not only solve the proposed problems within reasonable time but also generate candidate solutions that can shape an efficient Pareto front for the multi-objective optimization problem...|$|R
