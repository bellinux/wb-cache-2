50|$|The {{elements}} {{are given the}} correct lengths and spacings so that the radio waves radiated by the driven element and those reradiated by the parasitic elements all arrive {{at the front of}} the antenna in phase, so they superpose and add, increasing signal strength in the forward direction. In other words, the crest of the <b>forward</b> <b>wave</b> from the reflector element reaches the driven element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element. These waves reach the first director element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element, and so on. The waves in the reverse direction interfere destructively, cancelling out, so the signal strength radiated in the reverse direction is small. Thus the antenna radiates a unidirectional beam of radio waves from the front (director end) of the antenna.|$|E

Note that the simple analogy between light within the MM apparatus and a standing wave on a string cannot be strictly true. Standing waves on a string are oscillations in three-dimensional space of a one-dimensional medium, while light waves in an ether are assumed to be an oscillating displacement of the three-dimensional ether. Also, while the thumb and forefinger clearly hold the displacement of the string to zero, the partially transparent mirror does not require the electric field to be zero. The physical pictures are not completely equivalent.|$|E
50|$|To {{test for}} a match, the {{reference}} impedance {{of the bridge}} is set to the expected load impedance (for example, 50 ohms), and the transmission line connected as the unknown impedance. RF power {{is applied to the}} circuit. The voltage at the line input represents the vector sum of the <b>forward</b> <b>wave,</b> and the wave reflected from the load. If the characteristic impedance of the line is known to be 50 ohms, we know the magnitude and phase of the forward wave; it is the same wave present {{on the other side of}} the detector. Subtracting this known wave from the wave present at the line input yields the reflected wave. Properly designed, a bridge circuit can be used not only to indicate a match, but the degree of mismatch - thus making it possible to calculate the SWR. This usually involves alternately connecting the reference wave and the reflected wave to a power meter, and comparing the magnitudes of the resulting deflections.|$|E
50|$|SWR {{is used as}} {{a measure}} of {{impedance}} matching of a load to the characteristic impedance of a transmission line carrying radio frequency (RF) signals. This especially applies to transmission lines connecting radio transmitters and receivers with their antennas, as well as similar uses of RF cables such as cable television connections to TV receivers and distribution amplifiers. Impedance matching is achieved when the source impedance is the complex conjugate of the load impedance. The easiest way of achieving this, and the way that minimizes losses along the transmission line, is for both the source and load to be real, that is, pure resistances, equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. When there is a mismatch between the load impedance and the transmission line, part of the <b>forward</b> <b>wave</b> sent toward the load is reflected back along the transmission line towards the source. The source then sees a different impedance than it expects which can lead to lesser (or in some cases, more) power being supplied by it, the result being very sensitive to the electrical length of the transmission line.|$|E

50|$|One {{must take}} into account an {{additional}} phase delay due to the finite distance between the elements which further delays the phase of the currents in both the directors and reflector(s). The case of a Yagi - Uda array using just a driven element and a director is illustrated in the accompanying diagram taking all of these effects into account. The wave generated by the driven element (green) propagates in both the forward and reverse directions (as well as other directions, not shown). The director receives that wave slightly delayed in time (amounting to a phase delay of about 35° which will be important for the reverse direction calculations later), and generating a current that would be out of phase with the driven element (thus an additional 180° phase shift), but which is further advanced in phase (by about 70°) due to the director's shorter length. In the forward direction the net effect is a wave emitted by the director (blue) which is about 110° (180° - 70°) retarded with respect to that from the driven element (green), in this particular design. These waves combine to produce the net <b>forward</b> <b>wave</b> (bottom, right) with an amplitude slightly larger than the individual waves.|$|E

This has particularly well been studied in healthy ascending aortas, carotid, brachial and coronary arteries. However, wave propagation in diseased and peripheral arteries remains unknown. We performed wave intensity analysis in such conditions during endovascular and surgical procedures and described the changes after revascularisation. Methods Velocity and pressure measurements were performed simultaneously along the femoral axis using Combowire® (Volcano Corp) in 4 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Data were acquired before the lesion was treated and repeated just after. Procedures concern one femoral stenosis stenting, one femoral occlusion stenting and two femoro-popliteal bypasses. Results <b>Forward</b> <b>wave</b> intensity absorption {{was related to the}} severity of the arterial lesion. Stenting or surgical bypass restored <b>forward</b> <b>wave</b> intensity to the same extent. Persistent absorption of <b>forward</b> <b>wave</b> intensity was observed per-operatively in the bypass that showed abnormal decreased peak velocity at the post-procedural duplex examination.
