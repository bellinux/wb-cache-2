500|$|Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine {{said the}} track [...] "shows Janet the 4/4 we assumed she lost, though the beat whomps so relentlessly here it's hard to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> could've ever {{misplaced}} it."

500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E

2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Joe Henry, Madonna's brother-in-law. The demo of the song, {{entitled}} [...] "Stop", was first created by Henry at his home studio with string samples. Later, Henry played the demo {{for his wife and}} she said, [...] "You know, I can really hear Madonna singing this song. You should send it to her, you know, she's making a record in London right now." [...] However, he claimed, [...] "If I was going to pitch something to her, I could probably dig something up, but it certainly wouldn't be this." [...] Later, his wife sent Madonna a copy of the demo, but it was so musically different from the record she was making that she didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> could make any use out of it. After some time, he was talking to Madonna on the phone and she asked to rearrange the track to fit in better with the album, recording the song months later. Henry claimed {{in an interview that he}} was surprised that, lyrically, it remained completely intact.|$|E
