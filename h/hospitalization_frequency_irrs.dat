Methods: In this prospective study, all COPD patients that completed a comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) between June 2006 and December 2012 were included. Self-reported exacerbation and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>frequency</b> 1 year before PR was retrospectively recorded. During the year following PR, exacerbation and <b>hospitalization</b> <b>frequency</b> was recorded with questionnaires. Results: For 343 patients, complete information on exacerbation and hospitalization rate was obtained. The mean number of exacerbations decreased significantly after participating in a PRP by 1. 37 exacerbations/year (95 % confidence interval 1. 029 to 1. 717) from 4. 56 ± 3. 26 exacerbations in the year preceding PR to 3. 18 ± 2. 53 in the year following PR (P< 0. 0005). The number of hospitalizations due to exacerbations decreased significantly by 0. 68 hospitalizations/year (95 % confidence interval 0. 467 to 0. 903) from 1. 48 ± 1. 84 in the year preceding PR to 0. 80 ± 1. 31 hospitalizations/year in the year following PR (P< 0. 0005). The proportion of patients with a frequent exacerbation type (more than two exacerbations/year) was reduced by 24 %. Multivariate regression analysis to explore determinants that might predict reduction in exacerbation frequency or change in exacerbation pattern did not reveal clinically useful predictors, although patients with more exacerbations before PR had the highest potential for reduction.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} whether the predisposition of a mutation at position 179 of the ICAM- 1 gene to child hospitalization due to malaria was mediated {{by changes in}} adherence properties of IRBCs to ICAM- 1. ICAM- 1 genotypes were determined by nested polymerase chain reaction of isolated DNA from filter blood spots followed by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Plasmodium falciparum adherence assays were done on immobilized purified ICAM- 1. Our data indicate that the homozygosity for the ICAM- 1 (Kilifi) mutation occurs at a frequency of 22. 3 % in Magugu-Babati, Northern Tanzania. Our results show {{that there are no}} differences in IRBC binding profiles across genotypes. We show in this study that homozygosity for the ICAM- 1 (Kilifi) is associated with child hospitalization (X- 2 = 14. 47, p < 0. 001). We have further shown that hospitalization was not associated with cytoadherence (X- 2 = 0. 17, p = 0. 68). We conclude that the ICAM- 1 (Kilifi) allele occurs at a high frequency in Tanzania and that associations of this allele with higher child <b>hospitalization</b> <b>frequencies</b> is independent of cytoadherence patterns of IRBC isolated from ICAM- 1 genotypes, implying that any associations reported to exist between the ICAM- 1 (Kilifi) mutation and severe malaria are unlikely to be mediated through altered IRBC cytoadherence properties...|$|R

However, how neonatal thymectomy affects the subsequent {{development of the}} immune system in humans remains unclear. We monitored patients for 3 years from the time of thymectomy that was performed during cardiac surgery in early infancy. MethodsFor up to 3 years, we monitored the number of circulating lymphocytes and the clinical course of the children who underwent complete (n =  17), partial, and no (n =  15) thymectomy during congenital heart defect surgery performed at less than 3 months of age. The titers of immunoglobulin-G produced in response to vaccinated viruses and phytohemagglutinin responses were also measured. ResultsSix months after surgery, the number of T cells, including CD 4 + and CD 8 + subpopulations, decreased in patients with complete but not partial thymectomy. The reduction in T-cell number persisted for 3 years, whereas the number of B cells did not change. In patients with complete thymectomy, the titers of immunoglobulin-G produced in response to vaccinated measles and rubella viruses were reduced, whereas the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of T cells was not impaired. In addition, <b>hospitalization</b> <b>frequency</b> associated with infectious diseases increased in patients with complete but not partial thymectomy.

Clinical guidelines recommend prophylactic {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} (G-CSF) for patients receiving chemotherapy with a 20 % or greater risk of febrile neutropenia. A discrete choice experiment was conducted to explore breast cancer patients’ preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for prophylactic G-CSF to decrease the risk of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. MethodsAn online discrete choice experiment questionnaire survey of a national US convenience sample of self-reported breast cancer patients with prior chemotherapy treatment was conducted. Sixteen paired G-CSF treatment scenarios, each with four attributes (risk of disruption to chemotherapy schedule due to low white blood cell counts, risk of developing an infection requiring <b>hospitalization,</b> <b>frequency</b> of administration, and total out-of-pocket cost) were presented with a follow-up “no treatment” option. Participant preferences and WTP out of pocket were estimated by logistic regression. ResultsParticipants (n = 296) preferred G-CSF regimens with lower out-of-pocket costs, lower risk of chemotherapy disruption, lower risk of infection, and greater convenience (one G-CSF injection per chemotherapy cycle). Participants’ WTP was $ 1076 out of pocket per cycle {{to reduce the risk}} (high to low) of disrupting their chemotherapy schedule, $ 884 per cycle to reduce the risk (24 % [high] to 7 % [low]) of infection, and $ 851 per cycle to decrease the number of G-CSF injections (11 to 1) per cycle. ConclusionsParticipants highly valued specific features of prophylactic G-CSF treatment including maintaining their chemotherapy schedule, lowering their risk of infection, and reducing the number of injections.

40|$|Abstract Air {{pollution}} is increasingly {{recognized as an}} important and modifiable determinant of cardiovascular diseases in urban communities. The potential detrimental effects are both acute and chronic having a strong impact on morbidity and mortality. The acute exposure to pollutants {{has been linked to}} adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias. The long-terms effects are related to the lifetime risk of death from cardiac causes. The WHO estimates that air {{pollution is}} responsible for 3 million premature deaths each year. The evidence supporting these data is very strong nonetheless, epidemiologic and observational data have the main limitation of imprecise measurements. Moreover, the lack of clinical experimental models makes it difficult to demonstrate the individual risk. The other limitation is related to the lack of a clear mechanism explaining the effects of pollution on cardiovascular mortality. In the present review we will explore the epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence of the effects of ozone on cardiovascular diseases. The pathophysiologic consequences of air pollutant exposures have been extensively investigated in pulmonary systems, and it is clear that some of the major components of air pollution (e. g. ozone and particulate matter) can initiate and exacerbate lung disease in humans 1. It is possible that pulmonary oxidant stress mediated by particulate matter and/or ozone (O 3) exposure can result in downstream perturbations in the cardiovasculature, as the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems are intricately associated, and it is well documented that specific environmental toxins (such as tobacco smoke 2) introduced through the lungs can initiate and/or accelerate cardiovascular disease development. Indeed, several epidemiologic studies have proved that there is an association between PM and O 3 and the increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 3. Most of the evidence comes from studies of ambient particles concentrations. However, in Europe and elsewhere, the air pollution profile has gradually changed toward a more pronounced photochemical component. Ozone {{is one of the most}} toxic components of the photochemical air pollution mixture. Indeed, the biological basis for these observations has not been elucidated. In the present review, the role of ozone as chemical molecule will be firstly considered. Secondly, pathogenetic mechanisms connecting the atmospheric ozone level and cardiovascular pathology will be examined. Thirdly, the literature relating <b>hospitalization</b> <b>frequency,</b> morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular causes and ozone concentration will be studied.

Adequate glycemic control and earlier diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during hospitalization are cost-effective measures. Methods This prospective cohort study was designed to determine the impact of hyperglycemia on morbidity and mortality in a general hospital setting during a 3 -month period by reviewing patients' records. The primary purposes of this trial were to verify that hyperglycemia was diagnosed properly and sufficiently early and that it was managed during the hospital stay; we also aimed to evaluate the relationship between in-hospital hyperglycemia control and outcomes such as complications during the hospital stay, extent of <b>hospitalization,</b> <b>frequency</b> of re-hospitalization, death rates and number of days in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) after admission. Statistical analyses utilized the Kruskall-Wallis complemented by the "a posteriori" d. m. s. test, Spearman correlation and Chi-squared test, with a level of significance of 5 % (p Results We reviewed 779 patient records that fulfilled inclusion criteria. The patients were divided into 5 groups: group (1) diabetic with normal glycemic levels according to American Diabetes Association criteria for in-hospital patients (n = 123); group (2) diabetics with hyperglycemia (n = 76); group (3) non-diabetics with hyperglycemia (n = 225); group (4) diabetics and non-diabetics with persistent hyperglycemia during 3 consecutive days (n = 57) and group (5) those with normal glucose control (n = 298). Compared to patients in groups 1 and 5, patients in groups 2, 3 and 4 had significantly higher mortality rates (17. 7 % vs. 2. 8 %) and Intensive Care Unit admissions with complications (23. 3 % vs. 4. 5 %). Patients in group 4 had the longest hospitalizations (mean 15. 5 days), and group 5 had the lowest re-hospitalization rate (mean of 1. 28 hospitalizations). Only 184 (51. 4 %) hyperglycemic patients had received treatment. An insulin "sliding-scale" alone was the most frequent treatment used, and there was a wide variation in glucose target medical prescriptions. Intra Venous insulin infusion was used in 3. 8 % of patients in the ICU. Glycohemoglobin(A 1 C) was measured in 11 patients(2. 2 %). Conclusions Hospital hyperglycemia was correlated with, among other parameters, morbidity/mortality, length of hospitalization and number of re-hospitalizations. Most patients did not have their glycemic levels measured at the hospital; despite the high number of hyperglycemic patients not diagnosed as diabetics, A 1 C was not frequently measured. Even when patients are assessed for hyperglycemia, they were not treated properly. </p...|$|R

Here, we describe the use and timing of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The nonconcurrent prospective study population consisted of 4182 patients hospitalized with AMI in central Massachusetts in four annual periods between 2001 and 2007. RESULTS: One-quarter (25 %) of patients had a DNR order written either prior to or during <b>hospitalization.</b> The <b>frequency</b> of DNR orders remained constant (24 % in 2001; 26 % in 2007). Among patients with DNR orders, there was a significant increase in orders written prior to hospitalization (2001 : 9 %; 2007 : 55 %). Older patients and those with a medical history of heart failure or myocardial infarction {{were more likely to have}} prior DNR orders than respective comparison groups. Patients with prior DNR orders were less likely to die 1 month after hospitalization than patients whose DNRs were written during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Although the use of DNR orders in patients hospitalized with AMI was stable during the period under study, in more recent years, patients are increasingly being hospitalized with DNR orders already in place...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{potential}} drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) at hospital admission, during hospitalization and at discharge and to evaluate the number of pDDIs created during hospitalization. METHODS: The medication of 851 patients was screened for pDDIs (major and moderate severity) using the screening program Pharmavista. The frequency of pDDIs per patient, per number of drugs and drug pairs was estimated. RESULTS: During <b>hospitalization,</b> the <b>frequency</b> of major and moderate pDDIs per patient was 1. 11, which was higher compared to hospital admission (0. 59) or to hospital discharge (0. 60). The frequency of major and moderate pDDIs per drug prescribed (13. 7 % vs. 9. 1 %) or per drug pairs analyzed (4. 5 % vs. 2. 3 %) was higher at hospital admission compared to hospital discharge. 47 % of all major and moderate pDDIs at discharge were due to a medication change during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of major and moderate pDDIs per patient did not increase from hospital admission to discharge, it is important to realize that 47 % of all major and moderate DDIs at hospital discharge were created during hospitalization. Prescribing drugs with a low risk for pDDIs as well as careful monitoring for adverse drug reactions are important measures to minimize harm associated with DDIs...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To compare {{early use}} of transjugular {{intrahepatic}} portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with endoscopic treatment (ET) for the prophylaxis of recurrent variceal bleeding. METHODS: In-patient {{data were collected}} from 190 patients between January 2007 and June 2010 who suffured from variceal bleeding. Patients who were older than 75 years; previously received surgical treatment or endoscopic therapy for variceal bleeding; and complicated with hepatic encephalopathy or hepatic cancer, were excluded from this research. Thirty-five cases lost to follow-up were also excluded. Retrospective analysis was done in 126 eligible cases. Among them, 64 patients received TIPS (TIPS group) while 62 patients received endoscopic therapy (ET group). The relevant data were collected by patient review or telephone calls. The occurrence of rebleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or other complications, survival rate and cost of treatment were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: During the follow-up period (median, 20. 7 and 18. 7 mo in TIPS and ET groups, respectively), rebleeding from any source occurred in 11 patients in the TIPS group as compared with 31 patients in the ET group (Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test, P = 0. 000). Rebleeding rates at any time point (6 wk, 1 year and 2 year) in the TIPS group were lower than in the ET group (Bonferroni correction &#x 3 B 1;&#x 2019; = &#x 3 B 1;/ 3). Eight patients in the TIPS group and 16 in the ET group died with the cumulative survival rates of 80. 6 % and 64. 9 % (Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test &#x 3 C 7; 2 = 4. 864, P = 0. 02), respectively. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups with respect to 6 -wk survival rates (Bonferroni correction &#x 3 B 1;&#x 2019; = &#x 3 B 1;/ 3). However, significant differences were observed between the two groups in the 1 -year survival rates (92 % and 79 %) and the 2 -year survival rates (89 % and 64. 9 %) (Bonferroni correction &#x 3 B 1;&#x 2019; = &#x 3 B 1;/ 3). No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy (12 patients in TIPS group and 5 in ET group, Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test, &#x 3 C 7; 2 = 3. 103, P = 0. 08). The average total cost for the TIPS group was higher than for ET group (Wilcxon-Mann Whitney test, 52 678 RMB vs 38 &#x 2005; 844 RMB, P < 0. 05), but <b>hospitalization</b> <b>frequency</b> and hospital stay during follow-up period were lower (Wilcxon-Mann Whitney test, 0. 4 d vs 1. 3 d, P = 0. 01; 5 d vs 19 d, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Early use of TIPS is more effective than endoscopic treatment in preventing variceal rebleeding and improving survival rate, and does not increase occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy...|$|R

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is more {{prevalent}} and longer survival compared to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aims: To describe episodes of febrile neutropenia (FN) in children with AML, determining frequency of infections as agent, focus and evolution, comparing children with ALL episodes. Method: A prospective multicenter study. Children presenting with FN at six hospitals in Santiago, Chile, were invited to participate in two consecutive FONDECYT projects, from April 2004 to June 2011. All patients were uniformly evaluated, recording epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables. Information regarding FN episodes of children with LMA and LLA was used to this study. Results: We evaluated 506 episodes of FN in children with leukemia: 173 children with AML and 333 in children with ALL. NF episodes in children with AML showed significantly greater depth and duration of neutropenia, febrile remained a > period of time and had a worse clinical outcome, as evidenced by > hemodynamic instability, > sepsis, CRP > 90 mg/L for a longer time, more days of <b>hospitalization,</b> > <b>frequency</b> of <b>hospitalization</b> in ICU, > bacteremia, mainly by Streptococcus viridans group, > change of antimicrobial treatment, > use of antifungal therapy. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that FN episodes in children with AML further evolve unfavorably, compared with episodes of FN in children with ALL. FN episodes in children with AML require a more aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach, related to its severity. Financiado por FONDECYT 1040907, 109019...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{conduct a}} {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate {{in patients with}} non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) from the Italian NHS perspective using patient-level data from the INDEPENDENT-CKD study. Methods: Patient-level data on all-cause mortality, dialysis inception and phosphate binder dose were obtained for all 107 sevelamer and 105 calcium carbonate patients from the INDEPENDENT-CKD study. <b>Hospitalization</b> and <b>frequency</b> of dialysis data were collected post hoc for all patients via a retrospective chart review. Phosphate binder, hospitalization, and dialysis costs were expressed in 2012 euros using hospital pharmacy, Italian diagnosis-related group and ambulatory tariffs, respectively. Total life years (LYs) and costs per treatment group were calculated for the 3 -year period of the study. Bootstrapping was used to estimate confidence intervals around outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness and to calculate the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. A subgroup analysis of patients who did not initiate dialysis during the INDEPENDENT-CKD study was also conducted. Results: Sevelamer was associated with 0. 06 additional LYs (95 % CI - 0. 04 to 0. 16) and cost savings of EUR - 5, 615 (95 % CI - 10, 066 to - 1, 164) per patient compared with calcium carbonate. On {{the basis of the}} bootstrap analysis, sevelamer was dominant compared to calcium carbonate in 87. 1 % of 10, 000 bootstrap replicates. Similar results were observed in the subgroup analysis. Results were driven by a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and significantly fewer hospitalizations in the sevelamer group, which offset the higher acquisition cost for sevelamer. Conclusions: Sevelamer provides more LYs and is less costly than calcium carbonate in patients with NDD-CKD in Ital...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A block downconversion {{receiver}} incorpo rates {{a digital}} image rejection technique to support mul tiple aggregated carriers by one receive path and one fre quency synthesizer. A prototype {{consisting of a}} CMOS RF front end and an FPGA back end exhibits an image rejec tion ratio (IRR) of at least 70 dB across 2 GHz ± 25 MHz and reconstructs a- 76 -dBm 64 -QAM signal with an EVM of- 30 dB {{in the presence of}} another channel 40 dB higher. Carrier aggregation is an attractive approach to increasing the bandwidth and hence the data rate in wireless communica tions. It is possible to place a single LO frequency mid-way between two carriers in a Weaver receiver so as to reconstruct simultaneously both signals [I]. However, this approach faces several issues: lack of frequency-dependent IRR calibration, the need for harmonic-rejection IF mixers, and the direct in crease in analog complexity and power dissipation as the num ber of channels increases. The first issue is particularly im portant as even a 2 % mismatch between the poles of two first order I and Q analog filters limits the usable bandwidth to 10 % of the pole <b>frequency</b> if <b>IRR</b> must exceed 60 dB. This paper describes a "scalable " block downconversion re ceiver architecture that, by virtue of a background digital im age calibration technique, can support multiple carriers while providing an IRR greater than 70 dB. A new broadband low noise amplifier (LNA) is also introduced. Receiver Architecture The receiver architecture is shown in Fig. I along with spectra for a four-carrier example. The LO frequency is placed mid-way between the outermost carriers, thereby downconverting the block to an IF of no more than 35 MHz [1]. The quadrature IF signals are low-pass filtered, dig itized, and applied to an image rejection module before com plex downconversion to baseband. Of course, the two ADCs must digitize the IF components along with downconverted in-band blockers. Among the in-band blocker profiles in [2], that containing a 5 -MHz wide desired signal and a 40. 5 -dBc blocker demands the widest ADC dynamic range (DR). Since a 64 -QAM constellation dictates an SNR of about 24 dB for an acceptable BER, we conclude that the ADC must achieve...|$|R

Study Design: Prevalence based cohort Place and Duration of Study: Penang General Hospital, Hospital USM, and– Univesiti Malaya Medical Center; 2005 – 2008. Methods: Study patients were placed in the TB only, DM only, or DM-TB groups,with each group including 200 patients. Information related to demographics, chronic disease comorbidity, duration of hypertension (HTN) and DM, and economic variables were obtained from the patients’ medical files both {{at the beginning and end}} of the study period. The economic burden of DM-TB patients was assessed from <b>hospitalization</b> periods, <b>frequency</b> of clinic visits, and diagnostic requests. Results: Durations of DM and HTN were 9. 2 and 5. 6 years, respectively, for the DMonly group compared to 5. 3 and 1. 1 years, respectively, for DM-TB subjects. For both diabetic groups, diabetes preceded HTN, with onset of HTN occurring approximately 4 years after patients were diagnosed diabetic. Approximately 86 % of DM only subjects suffered additional comorbidity, and 44. 5 % had three or more coexisting chronic diseases compared to 56 % and 11. 4 %, respectively, in the DM-TB group. The hospitalization period was 10. 2 days for the DM-TB group compared to 7 and 4 days for the TB only and DM only groups, respectively; however, 43 % of TB only subjects needed surgical intervention compared to 17 % in the DM-TB group.
