2500|$|Most color CRT displays, i.e. {{television}} sets and computer monitors, {{each have a}} built-in degaussing (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component {{of which is a}} degaussing coil which is mounted {{around the perimeter of the}} CRT face inside the [...] Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases. In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable <b>degausser</b> or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically deform (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.|$|E
5000|$|In some high-security environments, {{one may be}} {{required}} to use a <b>degausser</b> that has been approved for the task. For example, in US government and military jurisdictions, one may {{be required}} to use a <b>degausser</b> from the NSA's [...] "Evaluated Products List".|$|E
50|$|Degaussing is {{the removal}} or {{reduction}} of {{a magnetic field}} of a disk or drive, using a device called a <b>degausser</b> that has been designed for the media being erased. Applied to magnetic media, degaussing may purge an entire media element quickly and effectively.|$|E
30|$|Physical medium layer. Due {{to lack of}} {{semantics}} of file system, single-file sanitization is {{not feasible}} at the physical medium layer. To delete the data, a naivest way is to overwrite/destroy all the data on the physical medium. Tools such as <b>degaussers</b> {{can be used to}} sanitize data on HDDs (Kissel et al. 2006).|$|R
50|$|A {{cassette}} demagnetizer is {{a device}} that removes the magnetic field that is built up {{from the use of}} audio cassettes in a cassette deck. Over time, the passage of magnetically charged cassette tape over the metallic parts of the tape deck will impart a magnetic polarity that can impair the ability of subsequent tapes to record accurately. Cassette demagnetizers (sometimes known as <b>degaussers)</b> were developed to remove this polarity.|$|R
50|$|Degaussing often renders hard disks inoperable, as it erases {{low-level}} formatting {{that is only}} done at the factory during manufacturing. In some cases, {{it is possible to}} return the drive to a functional state by having it serviced at the manufacturer. However, some modern <b>degaussers</b> use such a strong magnetic pulse that the motor that spins the platters may be destroyed in the degaussing process, and servicing may not be cost-effective. Degaussed computer tape such as DLT can generally be reformatted and reused with standard consumer hardware.|$|R
50|$|Erasure via {{degaussing}} may {{be accomplished}} in two ways: in AC erasure, the medium is degaussed by applying an alternating field that is reduced in amplitude over time from an initial high value (i.e., AC powered); in DC erasure, the medium is saturated by applying a unidirectional field (i.e., DC powered or by employing a permanent magnet). A <b>degausser</b> is a device that can generate a magnetic field for degaussing magnetic storage media.|$|E
5000|$|Although the NISPOM text itself never {{described}} {{any specific}} methods for sanitization, past editions (1995 and 1997) did contain explicit sanitization methods within the Defense Security Service (DSS) Clearing and Sanitization Matrix inserted after Section 8-306. The DSS still provides this matrix {{and it continues}} to specify methods. As of the Nov 2007 edition of the matrix, overwriting is no longer acceptable for sanitization of magnetic media. Only degaussing (with an NSA approved <b>degausser)</b> or physical destruction is acceptable.|$|E

40|$|Australian {{guidelines}} for exposure to magnetic fields and electrical {{fields in the}} extremely low frequency (ELF) band are currently under revision by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). Although ELF magnetic fields have been classified as a possible cause of cancer in humans (Group 2 B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the draft guidelines have allowed conditional increases in the allowable levels of exposure. Everything electrical {{is a source of}} ELF fields, but elevated levels of occupational exposure can be expected in power stations, near transmission cables and near some electrical equipment (arc furnaces, large electrical motors, non-destructive testing equipment, welders and tape <b>degaussers).</b> In some cases, exposure standards for the general public are applicable to employees at work. Occupational hygiene case studies are presented from commercial buildings, the electrical-manufacturing industry, the entertainment industry and the metal-manufacturing industry...|$|R
5000|$|Korean {{animator}} Nelson Shin, who {{was working}} for an American company at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look [...] "a little shaky" [...] like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a <b>degausser</b> sound {{on top of the}} other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandMagnetic {{recorders}} {{are susceptible}} to external magnetic fields and hence prone to data degradation. This is primarily observed in instrumentation (space and ground) and computer recorders, where little or no shielding of the heads is provided. The magnetic core material in the heads attracts flux lines and will with certain orientations concentrate these in the record, play back or erase gaps. During recordings a foreign field may therefore be superimposed on the intended recording field and may cause errors {{in the form of}} phase shift and dc offset; these affects are agravated when AC bias is used in the recording process. If an external field is present during playback only, partial or complete erasure may take place. One external field is always present: The earth s magnetic field which has a magnitude of roughly one Gauss (or Oersted). The writer is not aware of any errors per se caused by this field, but it has numerous times caused difficulties in achieving a perfect demagnetization of heads (An oscillating and simultaneously decreasing field from a <b>degausser</b> does then in essence record a permanent magnetization into the heads, which in turn will result in noisy and distorted recordings). Other fields are man made, such as originating from heavy currents in cable harnesses. The analysis presented in this paper was undertaken to establish susceptibility limits for a field generated by a magnetic attitude control system for spacecrafts. This is illustrated in Figure 1, where three orthogonal electromagnets on board a spacecraft generate a magnetic moment (M), variable in magnitude and orientation. The attitude correcting torque (T) on the spacecraft is expressed as the cross product between this moment and the earth's field. Recording equipment may be located within a few feet of the center of the attitude control field, which must be limited in magnitude or the recorder shielded to avoid data errors and/or erasure...|$|E
