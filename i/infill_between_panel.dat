The verandah awning is supported on paired stop chamfered timber posts with mouldings, and fretwork brackets and <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> <b>between</b> the paired posts. A cast iron balustrade, signed with John Grase Registered December 14, 1883 NO14.1, is surmounted by a bread loaf handrail. These same details are found on the gable balconies.|$|R

40|$|Several {{buildings}} at Y- 12 Plant rely on unreinforced hollow clay tile walls (HCTW) <b>infilled</b> <b>between</b> unbraced, non-moment resisting steel frames to resist natural phenomena forces, seismic and wind. One critical building relies on moment resisting steel frames {{in one direction}} while relying on unreinforced HCTWs <b>infilled</b> <b>between</b> the columns in the orthogonal direction to resist these forces. The HCTWs must act as shear walls while maintaining out-of-plane lateral stability. In assessing the safety of these buildings to seismic forces, several models to study the in- and out-of-plane effects were made and analyzed. The study of the moment resisting steel framed building indicated that bending stresses in the walls were induced by building drift and not by inertial forces per se. The discovery of this phenomenon was some what of a surprise in that the analysis performed is not typically used in design of these structures. The study indicated that the walls began to crack at their interface with the foundation at a low ``g`` level and that horizontal cracking at different elevations continued until the walls exhibited little bending resistance. This paper presents {{results of the study}} for out-of-plane behavior of unreinforced HCTWs <b>infilled</b> <b>between</b> adjacent moment resisting steel frames and discusses the problems of assessing the in-plane behavior given the horizontal cracks induced by building drift in the out-of-plane direction...|$|R

50|$|Expansion of the {{building}} to create the current Palladian mansion was commenced in 1730 by Henry Peirse, primarily by <b>infilling</b> <b>between</b> {{the wings of the}} existing house. The hall then remained unchanged until about 1760, when a new wing was added to house a racing stud, together with gallops on nearby land. In 1777 the hall was again expanded by incorporating a nearby house into the structure.|$|R
50|$|Timber framed hall houses {{often had}} the <b>infilling</b> <b>between</b> their {{structural}} timbers replaced several times. While the timbers themselves were the strongest {{part of the}} building, it is unusual for all to have survived without replacement. In many cases whole outer walls have been replaced with solid brick or with solid stone. Usually a thatched roof was turned into one of slates or tiles.|$|R

Two storey timber verandahs provided the <b>infill</b> <b>between</b> the projecting wings of the front elevation.|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the brick nogging (<b>infill</b> <b>between</b> the timbers) is plastered with stucco while the timbers are not; this is unusual as the only house in Kentucky known to have this feature. The 32 ft by 28 ft house also has a steep roof and just one window each for the two front rooms. The appearance {{of the house is}} much like historic Colonial dwellings in the eastern colonies. The construction is thus dated to pioneer era and perhaps the 18th century.|$|R

They could {{have been found in}} sufficient numbers from four possible bays: Walpole Bay in Cliftonville; Pegwell Bay especially at Shellness Point, Cliffsend, near Richborough; Sandwich Bay, Sandwich; and Shellness on the Isle of Sheppey. The majority of the mosaic is formed from the flat winkle, which is used to create the background <b>infill</b> <b>between</b> the designs. However, this shell is found only rarely locally, so would have been collected from shores west of Southampton, where it is abundant.|$|R
40|$|Exterior masonry walls and/or {{interior}} partitions {{built as}} an <b>infill</b> <b>between</b> a reinforced concrete frame’s beams and columns are usually {{considered to be}} non-structural elements in design. The interaction between the frame and infill is often ignored. However, the actual behaviour of such structures observed during past earthquakes shows that their response is often wrongly predicted during the design stage. Real interaction <b>between</b> the <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> and frame results in premature failure of the frame in some cases, and in improved performance in others. With the aim of better understanding {{the interaction between the}} primary structure and infill panels, this paper reviews research performed on the structural behaviour of such buildings under earthquakes. In addition, the predictions of FE models developed here will be compared with the results of some laboratory tests that were previously conducted at the University of Melbourne on masonry specimens. The modelling techniques developed in this work will be useful in constructing future larger FE models to evaluate the real performance at the key displacement limit states of infill-frames when subjected simultaneously to seismic in-plane and out-of-plane loads...|$|R

50|$|The {{characteristics}} of a turned chair are that the frame members are turned cylindrical on a lathe. The main uprights are usually heavier and plainly turned, the lighter spindles <b>infilling</b> <b>between</b> them are more decoratively turned, often with repeated bobbin turning, so as to appear {{as a series of}} balls, beads or bails. The complexity of this turning varies widely, and is used as a guide to identifying the region of origin. Some chairs have so many spindles that their backs and sides form an almost solid latticework, akin to the Arabic lattice windows or Mashrabiya. Eighteenth century turned chairs became far simpler. Eventually their techniques influenced the celebratedly simple and elegant style of the Shaker chair, still largely made by turning.|$|R
