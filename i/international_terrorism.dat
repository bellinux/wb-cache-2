It argues that the international law of piracy is not applicable in the enforcement and prosecution of maritime terrorists on the high seas. <b>International</b> treaties on <b>terrorism</b> and the post-September 11 developments relating to <b>international</b> laws on <b>terrorism</b> have created a workable international legal framework for combating maritime terrorism, despite some bottlenecks...|$|R
