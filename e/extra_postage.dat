She began to write without hesitation, and her pen gabbled rapidly until she had covered two sheets of paper, when, instead of taking a fresh sheet, she wrote across the lines already written.

Then she remembered something she had forgotten to say; but there was no more room on her two sheets, and she was reluctant to use a third, which might, in a letter to France, involve <b>extra</b> <b>postage.</b> Whilst she was hesitating her brother entered.|$|E

The clerk gave me the letter and paid the shortage himself. The letter was from my sister, telling me how peaceful and plentiful life was at home, {{and it made me}} crazy. She asked me how many nuggets I had found. You can judge how that hurt me. I reeled down the street, for I must eat or die, I knew that." ...|$|E

White completed farewell entertaining at the Berlin apartment {{he was forced}} to vacate, supervised the packing and disposal of furnishings, and moved out on July fifth. The serious illness of his daughter, the suicide of his son, and the arrangement for the care of his financial affairs by his nephew were the subjects of many letters in the late summer. Andrew Carnegie had recently announced his intention to devote much of his fortune to public benefactions during his lifetime, and Holls and White visited Carnegie's Scottish castle to lay various plans before him. Holls' letter of August 26 and White's of September 20 describe Carnegie and his estate.
