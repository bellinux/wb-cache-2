The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.|$|E

5|$|Adrift <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> City is a 1914 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Film Corporation that stars Florence LaBadie. The film begins with Pat Moran who pays for the passage {{of his wife and}} daughter to join him in America, but he is seriously injured on the way to greeting them. Left by themselves, the daughter works in a sweatshop and goes blind, forcing her and her mother to become beggars. By pure happenstance, the blind girl wanders to the hospital where her father is recovering and tells her story to a doctor. The father recognizes the girl as his daughter and the family is reunited, and the doctor confirms her blindness can be cured. The film was reviewed negatively by critics for its poor scenario, settings and technical execution. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E

5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|During that time, Shapiro {{instructed}} ex-captive orangutans in {{the acquisition}} {{and use of}} signs following the techniques of psychologists R.

In the only signing study ever conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a two-year period. For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E

5|$|His final {{international}} commission {{took place}} late in 1343, when he accompanied Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Derby, on a diplomatic mission to Castile. Early in 1344 {{he was back}} in England, where he took part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> tournament at Windsor. It was during this tournament, according to the chronicler Adam Murimuth, that he received wounds that would prove fatal. Salisbury died on 30 January 1344. He was buried at Bisham Priory in Berkshire, adjoining his home, Bisham Manor. He had founded the priory himself in 1337, on his elevation to the earldom. King Edward's financial obligations were never paid in full during the earl's lifetime, and at Salisbury' death the king owed him £11,720. Of this, some £6374 were written off by his executors in 1346.|$|E
5|$|In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing Major General Charles P. Hall's XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and Major General Joseph M.

5|$|Napoleon had {{calculated}} that Kutuzov, expecting reinforcements from Russia {{to defend its}} political allies, would withdraw toward Vienna; he envisioned that his and Kutuzov's armies would engage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> battle at Vienna, and that this battle would decide the war. Consequently, Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande Armée {{to create a new}} VIII Corps. This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and, more importantly, prevent Kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia.|$|E

5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> variety of sounds. A combination action {{can be used to}} switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{over his}} vanquished opponent, Carrouges {{remained}} on the field as the crowd cheered him and pages rushed to bind his wound. He then kneeled before the King, who presented him with a prize of a thousand francs {{in addition to a}} royal income of 200 francs a year. Only then did he greet his wife, in an emotional scene before the thousands of spectators. Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges then, with the crowd following <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> procession, rode from the abbey to the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, to give thanks for the victory.|$|E
5|$|The Great Revolt and the {{subsequent}} sacking of Jerusalem in 70 CE brought about the destruction of Herod's Temple, including the Royal Stoa, {{by members of the}} Roman X Fretensis, XII Fulminata, XV Apollinaris and V Macedonica legions under the command of emperor Vespasian's son Titus. It is likely that the stoa was modified during the initial phases of the revolt when the Temple Mount was fortified, first by Simon Bar Giora and then by John of Gischala. The main entry at Robinson's Arch was destroyed and towers built. Excavated remains of the Stoa provide evidence of its demise <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> fire. Chemical analysis of the remains has shown that some of the materials underwent transformations requiring a minimum temperature of —a result of sustained, high-temperature burning consistent with Josephus's account of destruction in a large conflagration.

5|$|The Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli {{captured}} Kars {{on behalf}} of the Georgian crown in 1206, but were repelled from the walls of Akhlat in 1209. This brought the struggle for the Armenian lands to a stall, leaving the Lake Van region in a relatively secure possession of its new masters – the Ayyubids of Damascus. In 1209, the brothers Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli laid waste to Ardabil – according to the Georgian and Armenian annals – as a revenge for the local Muslim ruler's attack on Ani and his massacre of the city's Christian population. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> final burst, the brothers led an army marshaled throughout Tamar's possessions and vassal territories in a march, through Nakhchivan and Julfa, to Marand, Tabriz, and Qazvin in northwest Iran, pillaging several settlements on their way.|$|E
5|$|While {{head of the}} Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended {{construction}} of the Moscow Metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and {{spent much of his}} time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the Order of Lenin for his role in its construction. Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee which was responsible for Moscow oblast, a province with a population of 11million.|$|E
5|$|After rejoining the Emperor at Champaubert, Nansouty {{took part}} to the Battle of Montmirail, where he was at first {{instructed}} to protect the artillery. He then joined in the attack of the Guard infantry on the farm of Ėpine-au-Bois, where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home, routing these troops and subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined attack of the Guard resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> number of prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took {{part to the}} Battle of Château-Thierry, where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel Curély brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the Battle of Vauchamps, where he supported Grouchy in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging Blücher's men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached a staggering 9,000-10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed {{when he found out}} of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General Guyot (one of Nansouty's subordinates) failing to provide an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned Guyot and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannon during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed Guyot and announced to Nansouty that General Exelmans would replace Guyot at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.|$|E
