40|$|Sassafrasoxylon gottwaldii sp. nov. {{is a new}} taxon for fossil {{wood with}} a suite of {{features}} diagnostic of Sassafras Nees & Eberm. of the Lauraceae. The fossil wood described is from Late Cretaceous (Santonian- Maastrichtian) sediments of the northern Antarctica Peninsula region. This new species of Sassafrasoxylon Brezinová et Süss resembles the species of extant Sassafras in being distinctly ring-porous, having vessel elements with simple perforation plates and very occasional scalariform plates with relatively few bars in the narrowest latewood vessels, alternate intervascular pitting, marginal (<b>initial)</b> <b>parenchyma</b> bands and paratracheal vasicentric parenchyma in the latewood, multiseriate rays and oil and /or mucilage cells. The fossils were found as isolated pieces of wood and therefore it is not certain whether the parent plant was Sassafras- like in all characters. Consequently the fossils {{have been placed in}} an organ genus rather than in extant Sassafras. This is the oldest record of an organ with features closest to extant Sassafras and may suggest that Sassafras first appeared in Gondwana and later radiated into the Northern Hemisphere. The distribution of extant Sassafras in North America and East Asia may represent a relict of a geographically more widespread taxon in the past...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Accurate {{delineation}} of pathological lungs from {{computed tomography}} (CT) images remains mostly unsolved because available methods fail {{to provide a}} reliable generic solution due to high variability of abnormality appearance. Local descriptor-based classification methods have shown to work well in annotating pathologies; however, these methods are usually computationally intensive which restricts their wide-spread use in real-time or near-real-time clinical applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for fast, accurate, reliable segmentation of pathological lungs from CT scans by combining region-based segmentation method with local-descriptor classification that is performed on an optimized sam-pling grid. Our method works in two stages; during stage one, we adapted the fuzzy connectedness (FC) image segmentation algorithm to perform <b>initial</b> lung <b>parenchyma</b> extraction. In the second stage, texture-based local descriptors are utilized to segment abnormal imaging patterns using a near optimal keypoint analysis by employing centroid of supervoxel as grid points. The quantitative results show that our pathological lung segmentation method is fast, robust, and improves on current standards and has potential to enhance the performance of routine clinical tasks.

40|$|The {{length and}} breadth of the cambial {{initials}} and their derivatives have been examined in Polyalthia longifolia, a tropical tree possessing non-storied cambium. Taking the average size of the initials and the elements originating from them, most of the sieve-tube elements {{have been found to}} be slightly shorter in length than the fusiform initials. On the other hand, a few of these are still shorter - almost half of the fusiform initials, due to transverse or somewhat oblique divisions in the sieve element mother cells. The vessel elements are slightly shorter but 5 - 6 times wider than the fusiform <b>initials.</b> The <b>parenchyma</b> strands, in phloem comprising cells storing starch or tannin (pps), in xylem accumulating starch only (ssps), are more or less equal to fusiform initials indicating that the xylem and phloem mother cells forming parenchyma cells have not undergone any major change except for transverse divisions. The individual vessel-associated parenchyma cells (v. a. p. cells) are wider but much shorter in length as compared to the starch-storing parenchyma cells (s. s. p. cells) indicating that more transverse divisions have occured in the strands of the former than those of the latter. Among all the cambial derivatives, the fibers exhibit maximum increase in length, due to intrusive growth. The ray parenchyma cells are slightly longer than the ray initials possibly due to the elongation of these initials during their transformation into vascular ray cells...|$|R
40|$|Before an {{intended}} implantation stem/progenitor {{cells are}} usually {{kept in the}} beneficial atmosphere of a selected culture medium. However, after implantation the situation is drastically changing for them. Yet stem/progenitor cells must stand the harmful fluid environment within a diseased organ. In this coherence it is unknown, to which degree alterations in molecular composition of interstitial fluid can influence the <b>initial</b> regeneration of <b>parenchyma.</b> To obtain first insights in the sensitivity against changes in fluid composition, renal stem/progenitor cells were mounted within a polyester interstitium for perfusion culture. To model interstitial fluids different chemically defined culture media all including aldosterone were administered continuously for 13 days. Then morphological quality of generated tubules was registered by light and transmission electron microscopy. Culture of stem/progenitor cells in earlier approved Iscove´s Modified Dulbecco´s Medium served as internal standard. These experiments revealed generation of numerous tubules. In comparison, application of Williams’ E Medium, Basal Medium Eagle, McCoy’s 5 A Modified Medium and Medium 199 produced only a lean quality of generated tubules, since contained cells exhibited numerous vacuoles. In contrast, administration of Leibovitz’s L- 15 Medium and CO 2 Independent Medium showed unexpected promoting effects on development of tubules. In this series numerous and intact tubules without formation of an excess of vacuoles were detected. In consequence, Leibovitz’s L- 15 Medium and CO 2 Independent Medium appear as challenging candidates to be tested in future for implantation in combination with stem/progenitor cells...|$|R
