5|$|Scouting in South Africa grew rapidly, and in 1912 Robert Baden-Powell visited South African Scouts. Due to {{the rapid}} spread of Scouting it became {{necessary}} to provide some form of local co-ordination. Provincial Councils were formed in South Africa between 1912 and 1916. These councils had no <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> each other and reported directly to Imperial Scout Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} located in the valley of the , a {{tributary}} of the Hogneau, and is part of the greater drainage basin of the Scheldt. The reserve is not in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the river. It is supplied with water only by precipitation, which is retained by the natural properties of marl.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> civilizations {{significantly}} {{more advanced than}} humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E

5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, and <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> skin {{can cause}} damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the fetal chorion like {{it does in the}} hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
5|$|Invisible Circles is {{a concept}} album about the {{dynamics}} of quarrelsome families and psychological child abuse. The theme was inspired by guitarist Sander Gommans' work as an art teacher, in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> dysfunctional families and teen-age problems. It is also a metal opera, with a storyline that follows the lives of an abused child and her parents since her conception to adulthood. The album was received with mixed reviews, but entered the charts in the Netherlands and Belgium.|$|E
50|$|The International Crisis Group, {{which had}} <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> the warlords, said in June 2006 that the CIA was {{funnelling}} $100,000 to $150,000 {{a month to}} the ARPCT.|$|R
50|$|SKP(ml)/SKA {{never had}} <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> the Communist Party of China nor the Party of Labour of Albania. It had {{bilateral}} <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> other maoist {{groups such as}} MLPD (Germany), AKP(m-l) (Norway) and KFML (Denmark). It participated in international conferences organized by MLPD.|$|R
50|$|Amir Kabir, Prime Minister under Nasereddin Shah, also {{initiated}} <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> the American {{government in}} Washington.

5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, an aisle gate and driver's shield were installed on most Greyhound buses which prevent passengers from having <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the driver {{when the bus}} is in motion, even if the aisle gate is forced open.|$|E
5|$|The insect {{circulatory system}} {{utilizes}} hemolymph, a tissue analogous to blood that circulates {{in the interior}} of the insect body, while remaining in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type of the open circulatory system of arthropods, characteristic of spiders, crustaceans and insects.|$|E
5|$|Zelda now {{claims to}} be in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Christ, William the Conqueror, Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock {{paraphernalia}} of insane-asylum jokes... For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
50|$|IMBs were {{particularly}} important IMs. They enjoyed {{the confidence of}} the Stasi, and they also had <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> people classified by the Stasi as hostile (Feindlich-negative Personen). They had direct involvement with long-running work on developing the relevant Operativer Vorgang (Procedures Manual).|$|R
50|$|Seroprevalence is {{approximately}} 5% (0.7-4.7%) of the US population. It {{tends to be}} more common among lower socio-economic groupings, probably reflecting more frequent and <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> mice. However, obtaining an accurate sense of prevalence by geographic region is difficult due to underreporting.|$|R
30|$|Men {{and women}} use {{slightly}} different search methods to find jobs. Considering {{the entire sample}} {{of young men and}} women, the vast majority of young people (53.5 %) rely on their network of family and friends. <b>Direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> prospective employers (19.8 %) and answering advertisements (15.0 %) are the second largest methods of job search. This is a sign of the lack of (public) intermediaries in the labor market able to bring vacancy news to unemployed young people. Men tend to use more frequently than women their network of friends and relatives. Similarly, they also tend to find a job through <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> employers. Women found their job more frequently through advertisements and via information gathered at educational institutions.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, {{competing with the}} Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led {{to the introduction of}} papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|During osmoregulation, fluid {{is added}} to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, the Kurds of Iraq {{established}} a mission in Berlin, establishing <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> the German government. Furthermore, the mission had to coordinate humanitarian and development aid from Germany to the Kurdish region, and informed the German public and media {{about the general}} situation in Kurdistan.|$|R
5|$|In the evening, {{after the}} ceremony, {{the royal family}} decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city {{residents}} opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. It {{was the last time}} that Alexander would be in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E

50|$|In {{front of}} {{mounting}} Communist influence, Haţieganu approached Iuliu Maniu {{with a proposal}} to establish <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> the Western Allies by having Ion Mihalache evade the country (July 1947); the attempt, known as the Tămădău Affair, {{eventually led to the}} prosecution of the PNŢ leadership during a show trial and to an official ban on all party activities.|$|R
5|$|Stephen I granted {{privileges}} to the Roman Catholic Church, {{for example}} by ordering the general {{imposition of the}} tithe upon the population. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen I also divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is administrative units around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count. In time the voivode, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became the principal of all the counts in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, the counts in modern Banat and Crişana remained in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the king who appointed and replaced them at will.|$|E
5|$|The South African Museum in Cape Town {{features}} a hall devoted to whales and natural history {{known as the}} Whale Well. The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted blue whale skeleton, from the carcass of a partially mature specimen that washed ashore in the mid 1980s. The skeleton's jaw bones are mounted {{on the floor of}} Whale Well to permit visitors <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> them, and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal. Other mounted skeletons include that of a humpback whale and a right whale, together with in-scale composite models of other whales, dolphins and porpoises.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E

50|$|Another {{means of}} {{monitoring}} the Empire was through <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> his subjects. One opportunity {{for this was}} during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class (including slaves) could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks, and other public appearances presented another opportunity to gather first-hand information.|$|R
