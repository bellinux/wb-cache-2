40|$|Background: Reducing the phytate {{content in}} grains by genetic {{manipulation}} {{is a novel}} approach to increasing nonheme-iron absorption from mixed diets. Fractional iron absorption from a genetically modified strain of low-phytate maize (LPM) increased significantly, by 50 %. Objective: We assessed iron absorption from porridges prepared from the same LPM (lpa- 1 - 1 mutant) and unmodified wild-type maize (WTM), {{both of which were}} fortified with either ferrous sulfate or <b>sodium</b> iron <b>EDTA.</b> Design: Porridges providing 3. 4 mg Fe were fortified with either ferrous sulfate or <b>sodium</b> iron <b>EDTA</b> to provide an additional 1 mg Fe/serving. In 14 nonanemic women, iron absorption was meas-ured as the amount of radioiron incorporated into red blood cells (extrinsic tag method) 12 d after consumption of the study diets. Results: No significant effect of phytate content on iron absorp-tion was found when porridge was fortified with either <b>sodium</b> iron <b>EDTA</b> or ferrous sulfate. Fractional absorption of iron from WTM porridge fortified with <b>sodium</b> iron <b>EDTA</b> (5. 73 %) was 3. 39 times greater than that from the same porridge fortified with ferrous sulfate (1. 69 %). Fractional absorption of iron from the sodium iron EDTA–fortified LPM porridge (5. 40 %) was 2. 82 times greater than that from LPM porridge fortified with ferrous sulfate (1. 91 %) (P < 0. 0001 for both comparisons, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Thus, the previously identified benefit of LPM was no longer detectable when maize porridge was fortified with additional iron.

40|$|AbstractThe current {{low-cost}} {{process for}} mineral carbonation involves the direct carbonation of a slurry of magnesium or calcium silicate mineral with supercritical CO 2.

Enhancing the dissolution rate in weakly acidic conditions has been identified as one of the main opportunities for lowering the costs of a direct mineral carbonation process.
