India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E

A convolutional code, the unit-memory code, was discovered and is ideal for inner system usage because of its byte-oriented structure.

The burial ground had been connected with the former St Peter's Church, a large one which seated some 1,500 people, which was demolished in 1976. Archaeologists <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> half of the bodies were those of young children, who appeared to have died quickly during the mid-19th century from illnesses affected the lungs and gastrointestinal system.

The study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation.

One survey that was conducted with psychology students reports that 10% had sexual interactions with their educators; in turn, 13% of educators reported sexual interaction with their students. In a national survey conducted for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 found that roughly 290,000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a public school employee between 1991 and 2000. And a major 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> 10 percent of U.S. public school students reported having been targeted with sexual attention by school employees.
