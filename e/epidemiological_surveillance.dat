40|$|Aims: This {{cross-sectional}} and multicenter survey aims {{to estimate}} the prevalence rate of ULMSDs and exposure to risk factors in industrial companies. Occupational physicians, organized in an <b>epidemiological</b> sentinel <b>surveillance</b> of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders network have participated in this survey. Methods: In 2008, clinical data was collected using a questionnaire such as "Nordic" for morbidity symptoms and clinical examination, according to the standardized diagnostic approach of the European SALTSA consensus. The ULMSDs were classified into three degrees of severity after validation of a diagnostic by a "decision tree". Risk factors of ULMSDs were collected by a questionnaire including the biomechanical, psychosocial and organizational factors. The exposure scores were calculated for each anatomical area of upper limb by summation of risk factors revealed by the consensus. Results: 933 employees in eight industrial companies were included at random. Almost one in two workers has suffered in the past 12 months and one in four workers in the past 7 days, from non-specific upper limb musculoskeletal symptoms. The prevalence rate of diagnosed ULMSDs was high: 12 % of workers sustained at least one form proven form of unilateral or bilateral ULMSDs, 6. 3 % a rotator cuff syndrome, 1. 8 % had lateral tennis elbow, 2. 8 % a carpal tunnel syndrome. The prevalence rate of ULMSDs increased with age and varied widely across companies and occupations. One in two workers was exposed to, at least, two risk factors from the upper limb, which is the warning threshold of SALTSA consensus. Conclusion: The use of the SALTSA protocol {{for the first time}} in Algerian companies revealed the importance of the prevalence rate of ULMSDs and exposure to risk factors. These results show the need to structure the occupational physicians in an <b>epidemiological</b> sentinel <b>surveillance</b> network so as to develop a prevention program in most sectors and reduce the prevalence of ULMSDs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} a multilingual <b>epidemiological</b> news <b>surveillance</b> system. Its main contribution {{is its ability}} to extract epidemic events in any language, hence succeeding where state-of-the-art in surveillance systems usually fails: the objective of reactivity. Most systems indeed focus on a selected list of languages, deemed important. However, evidence shows that events are first described in the local language, and translated to other languages later, if and only if they contained important information. Hence, while systems handling only a sample of human languages may indeed succeed at extracting epidemic events, they will only do so after someone else detected the importance of the news, and made the decision to translate it. Thus, with events first described in other languages, such automated systems, that may only detect events that were already detected by humans, are essentially irrelevant for early detection...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDiagnosis and {{detection}} of Echinococcus granulosus (sensu lato) infection in animals {{is a prerequisite}} for <b>epidemiological</b> studies and <b>surveillance</b> of echinococcosis in endemic, re-emergent or emergent transmission zones. Advances in diagnostic approaches for definitive hosts and livestock, however, have not progressed equally over the last 20 years. Development of laboratory based diagnostics for canids using coproantigen ELISA and also coproPCR, have had a huge impact on epidemiological studies and more recently on surveillance during hydatid control programmes. In contrast, diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in livestock still relies largely on conventional post-mortem inspection, despite a relatively low diagnostic sensitivity especially in early infections, as current serodiagnostics do not provide a sufficiently specific and sensitive practical pre-mortem alternative. As a result, testing of dog faecal samples by coproantigen ELISA, often combined with mass ultrasound screening programmes for human CE, has been the preferred approach for monitoring and surveillance in resource-poor endemic areas and during control schemes. In this article we review the current options and approaches for diagnosis of E. granulosus infection in definitive and animal intermediate hosts (including applications in non-domesticated species) and make conclusions and recommendations for further improvements in diagnosis for use in <b>epidemiological</b> studies and <b>surveillance</b> schemes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate, within the Italian National Influenza <b>Epidemiological</b> and Virological <b>Surveillance,</b> the rate of vaccination coverage, the incidence of Influenza Like-Illness (ILI), the incidence of Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI), and to identify the virus strains circulating in Apulia from 1999 to 2003. METHODS: Vaccination coverage rates were calculated based on the number of doses administered to individuals > 65 years of age. Every week, sentinel physicians reported ILI and ARI cases having occurred among their patients. Voluntary general practitioners (GPs) and paediatricians (Ps) collected oropharyngeal swab samples from patients suspected with ILI. Influenza viruses were isolated and identified by cell culture (MDCK cells) and RT-PCR. Virological surveillance was carried out by the ISS, in collaboration with a network of peripheral laboratories. RESULTS: In Apulia, vaccination coverage progressively increased to 68. 6 % during the 2002 - 2003 season. The analysis of ILI cases showed higher incidence rates during the 1999 - 2000 and 2002 - 2003 seasons. ARI rates appeared to have a more constant trend. ILI and ARI incidence rates were higher in the 0 - 14 year age group. CONCLUSION: The increase in vaccination coverage rates and implementation of the network of clinical, and <b>epidemiological</b> and virological <b>surveillance</b> are fundamental for the control and prevention of influenza...|$|R
