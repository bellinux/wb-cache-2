She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would have loved to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, the {{executive}} {{producers of the}} Academy Award-winning film adaptation of the Broadway musical Chicago, were hired as the producers for Hairspray, and began discussing possibly casting John Travolta and Billy Crystal (or Jim Broadbent) as Edna and Wilbur Turnblad, respectively. Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell, authors of the book for the stage musical, wrote {{the first draft of}} the film's screenplay, but were replaced by Leslie Dixon, screenwriter for family comedies such as Mrs. Doubtfire and Freaky Friday. After a year's deliberation on who should direct the film, Zadan and Meron finally decided to hire Adam Shankman to both direct and choreograph Hairspray. Upon learning he had been hired, Shankman arranged a meeting with John Waters, who advised him [...] "don't <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> don't do what the play did. You've gotta do your own thing." [...] Despite this, Shankman still noted [...] "all roads of Hairspray lead back to John Waters." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Stork {{became the}} last {{perpetrator}} sentenced {{in the political}} assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, {{and for a long time}} I slept with a loaded gun beside my bed." [...] Though Stork could have faced life in prison, U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had [...] "seen the error of her ways." [...] A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the [...] "MVP" [...] of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I'm truly sorry." [...] Stork returned to Germany after her sentencing.|$|E
