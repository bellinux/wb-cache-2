For studying the <b>fusing</b> behavior, <b>bond</b> wires were wedge-bonded over a 2 mm wide slit, to emulate the final application, and fused at different currents and voltages. For electrical isolation, a set of wires were coated with a 4 µm thick layer of Parylene before they were fused.

The yield of the process was also investigated, and the fusing event was studied using a high-speed camera for analyzing the dynamics of fusing. Four characteristic tip shapes were observed: spherical, semi-spherical, serpentine shaped and folded. The stub length leveled out at ~ 420 µm. The fusing of the coated wires required a higher power for attaining a spherical shape. Finally, a Parylene coated bond wire was integrated into a stripline split-ring resonator (SSRR) microplasma source, and fused to form two Langmuir probes with spherical endpoints.

40|$|When a {{bonding wire}} becomes too hot, it fuses and fails. The ohmic heat that is {{generated}} in the wire can be partially dissipated to a mold package. For this cooling effect the thermal contact between wire and package is an important parameter. Because this parameter can degrade over lifetime, the <b>fusing</b> of a <b>bonding</b> wire can also occur as a long-term effect. Another important factor is the thermal power {{generated in the}} vicinity of the bond pads. Nowadays, the reliability of bond wires relies on robust dimensioning based on estimations. Smaller package sizes increase the need for better predictive methods. The Bond Calculator, a new thermo-electrical simulation tool, is able to predict the temperature profiles along bond wires of arbitrary dimensions in dependence on the applied arbitrary transient current profile, the mold surrounding the wire, and the thermal contact between wire and mold. In this paper we closely investigated the spatial temperature profiles along different bond wires in air in order to make a first step towards the experimental verification of the simulation model.

40|$|Purpose - This work aims to {{evaluate}} the influence of rheological properties of building materials on the bonding quality and ultimate tensile strength in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, through the investigation of parts printed by semi-crystalline and amorphous resins. Little information is currently available {{about the influence of}} the crystalline nature on FDM-printed part quality. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-crystalline polyamide 12 and amorphous acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were used to assess the influence of rheological properties on bonding quality and the tensile strength, by varying three important process parameters: materials, liquefier temperature and raster orientation. A fractography of both tensile and freeze-fractured samples was also investigated. Findings - The rheological properties, mainly the melt viscosity, were found to have a significant influence on the <b>bonding</b> quality of <b>fused</b> filaments. Better <b>bonding</b> quality and higher tensile strength of FDM parts printed with semi-crystalline PA 12, as compared with amorphous ABS, are suggested to be a result of higher initial sintering rates owing to the lower melt viscosity of PA 12 at low shear rates. Near-full dense PA 12 parts were obtained by FDM. Originality/value - This project provides a variety of data and insight regarding the effect of materials properties on the mechanical performance of FDM-printed parts.

One-microliter aliquots of these solutions were injected in splitless mode into a GC/MS system consisting of an autosampler, a Scion 456 gas chromatograph, and a Scion TQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (all Bruker Daltonics, Freemont, USA). The chromatographic separation was performed on a chemically <b>bonded</b> <b>fused</b> silica capillary column Br 5 -MS column (Bruker Daltonics), 0.25  mm internal diameter, 0.25  µm film thickness, 30  m length, connected to a 2  m long deactivated fused silica capillary pre-column. Injection temperature was 280  °C, the interface was set to 300  °C, and the ion source was adjusted to 230  °C. Oven conditions: initial temperature 70  °C, 2  min isothermal, 6  °C/min up to 310  °C, 10  min isothermal. Carrier gas: He, constant flow 1.0  mL/min. Electron impact spectra were recorded at 70  keV in selected ion monitoring mode to detect trimethylsilylated methoximate samples. The sugar standards used for identification were glucose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, fucose, ribose, arabinose, and xylose (Sigma-Aldrich). β-Hydroxy acids were determined as trimethylsilylated derivatives using the same derivatization protocol: data were analyzed with MS Workstation (Bruker Daltonics) and AMDIS software. Identification of β-hydroxy acids was performed with the Wiley MS library search and comparison with spectral data.|$|R
40|$|Outer fabric samples {{contained}} in hard copy {{held at the}} LibraryThis design-led research project was developed {{in collaboration with the}} Christchurch-based bedding manufacturing firm FibreTech New Zealand Limited. It explored the potential of an innovative wool-fill product developed by FibreTech. This new wool-fill maximises loft and bulk, both key factors for warmth and comfort in bedding. Loft is an active, three-dimensional feature of bedding, controlled through processes of compression and release. Retaining and managing loft was vital. The designer provided a holistic approach, using a textile design perspective to explore functionality and aesthetics in relation to the structure of the fill and outer membrane layers of bedding products. Through material sampling the project assessed how FibreTech’s new wool product could be layered and bonded with other textiles. The technical processes of needle punching, <b>fusing</b> and stitch <b>bonding</b> were used to explore the loft and compression relationship within the textiles. It was found that ratios of loft and compression could be altered to improve the efficiency of manufacturing; {{while at the same time}} optimising functionality and aesthetics. Textile design, wool knops, knoppy web, New Zealand wool, loft, overbody bedding, underbody bedding, sampling, research and development, digital quilting, computer-aided design Key words: Using the existing manufacturing process of digital quilting, stitch paths were redesigned to create an innovative range of bedding products for use over and under the body. The resulting textiles revealed a departure from classic bedding construction, with a new focus on controlling the stitch line through computer-aided design (CAD) technology. This hard-edged stitch line was a digital imposition that contrasted with the organic nature of soft, lofted materials. This visual and haptic tension was identified as key design interplay for both overbody and underbody approaches. Strategies were created towards lightweight overbody bedding and engineered shaping of underbody bedding. These new digital quilting strategies captured loft in distinctly different, yet functional ways. This project provides evidence that a textile designer can be a key contributor in the manufacturing industry, along with other disciplines such as science and engineering to add value to research and development in the New Zealand wool textile manufacturing industry. The design research progressed as a Callaghan Innovation Postgraduate Fellowship project and represents the development of a new aesthetic for wool bedding products...|$|R
40|$|This work {{gives an}} insight on the {{fabrication}} and characterization of two distinctly different hydrogenated carbon nitride CNx:H structured films showing either polymeric, p-CNx:H or nanostructured, ns-CNx:H film growth. These structures were obtained using radio frequency (rf) plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} employing a parallel-plate electrode configuration, under the same deposition parameters except for {{the change in the}} electrode distance. It was this simple change in the distance which induced the structural transformation from p-CNx:H films obtained at distance of six to three cm, to the ns-CNx:H films produced at two to one cm. Each type of film showed its own unique characteristics. For the p-CNx:H films deposited at an electrode distance of 5 cm, their PL spectra showed two main peaks assumed to be attributed to the presence of sp 2 clusters and nitrogen bonding in the films. Further studies showed that the optimized rf power and nitrogen-to-methane N 2 :CH 4 gas-flowrate ratio to obtain p-CNx:H films with the highest PL intensities were 80 W and 0. 70, respectively. There appeared to be no direct correlation between the PL properties and optical energy gap. However, the PL characteristics were dependent on the N content in the films. From extensive bonding studies carried out on these films, it was found that N is incorporated most significantly through nitrile, isonitrile and sp 2 -CN bonding configurations. Also, these films were thermally stable when annealed in nitrogen up to temperatures of 500 °C, though the PL intensities start to decline even from 200 °C. The recombination centers which produced these high PL intensities were attributed to the CHn, CN and the isolated and/or <b>fused</b> aromatic rings <b>bonded</b> to nitrile (−C≡N) which may contribute significantly as recombination centers. While the studies of p-CNx:H films were focused on their PL characteristics, a more fundamental approach was taken in the study of ns-CNx:H. These novel ns-CNx:H films were obtained at low deposition temperatures without the use of metal-catalyst or template, and could be grown directly on the bare silicon and quartz substrates. The focus of the study of these ns-CNx:H films was on the formation of vertically aligned CNx:H nanorods and their growth mechanism. The optimized parameters for the formation these nanorods were determined to be at Prf of 80 W and N 2 :CH 4 ratio of 0. 70. This coincided with the maximum N content and preferential bonding of isonitrile <b>bonded</b> to <b>fused</b> or isolated aromatic rings in the films. These nanorods were made up of C nanographitic sp 2 clusters embedded in a carbon-nitrogen amorphous matrix which surrounded, encapsulated and held them together. The growth mechanism of these vertically aligned nanorods was proposed. In the optimization studies of both materials, one fascinating conclusion was uncovered. The optimized deposition parameters for both exceptional characteristics of these structured films were the same. It is the simply the difference in electrode distance at these optimal Prf and N 2 :CH 4 ratio, which induces the formation of these two significantly different structured films...|$|R
