6000|$|A {{few minutes}} afterwards, {{they crossed the}} shelf. Deering led, and Jimmy, going first on the second rope, rather doubted if they would reach the trees. In summer the long {{straight}} crack was obviously the mountain's rubbish shoot and its sides were <b>ground</b> <b>smooth</b> by rolling stones; now it was packed by hard, firm snow.

The gully was nearly precipitous; a narrow trough {{that serves as a}} rubbish shoot for the {{mountain}} when the thaw splits the rocks. I expect it's <b>ground</b> <b>smooth</b> in summer, but it was filled with hard, slippery snow. We stopped again and studied it, and I felt doubtful I about taking Lucy up, but she didn't want to go back.

Then they reached a scarp of rock <b>ground</b> <b>smooth</b> by the slipping down of melting snow, and when they had crossed that their difficulties began. The scarp broke off on the verge of an almost precipitous rift, and a torrent that seemed drawn out into silk-like threads roared in the depths of it. A few pines were sprinkled about the slopes of the gully, and one or two of them which had fallen lay athwart the creek.|$|E

60|$|When they nooned upon {{a gravel}} bank {{near the end}} of a wide lake it was {{fiercely}} hot. The calm water, flashed like polished steel, and Agatha could hardly see the flames of the snapping fire; the smoke went up in thin gray wreaths that were almost invisible. A clump of juniper grew among the stones and she sat down in the shade and looked about with dazzled eyes. A line of driftwood, hammered by the ice and bleached white by the sun, marked the subsidence of the water from its high, spring level. Small islands broke the shining surface, some covered with stunted trees and some quite bare. The rocks about the beach were curiously worn, but Agatha knew they had been <b>ground</b> <b>smooth</b> by drifting floes. Behind the beach, the forest rolled back in waves of somber green to a bold ridge that faded into leaden thunder-clouds.|$|E

We lay down, with our toes in the nicks, to rest, and I slid my flask down to Walters when I'd had a drink. It was a big flask, and I'd got it filled with brandy. I thought the guide took a remarkably long drink, but he looked steady when he crawled up to take my place.|$|E

50|$|Several dozen Olmec {{iron ore}} mirrors are known {{but only a}} few of these have been {{recovered}} in secure archaeological excavations. At the Olmec site of Las Bocas in Puebla, a particularly fine mosaic mirror was recovered that was dated to around 1000 BC. By the Middle Preclassic period the production of high status stone artefacts, including mirrors, was probably already being carried out by specialist artisans. An Olmec mining colony has been identified in the Cintalapa valley. Among items excavated were partially worked blocks of ilmenite and mangnetite and a fragment of mirror, together with tools and San Lorenzo style ceramics. These remains date to around 950 BC. Concave Olmec mirrors were fashioned from a single pied of iron ore. The front, with the mirror face, was concave with a highly polished lens. The bevelled edge of the mirror was convex and the rear and sides of the mirror were roughly sawn or ground down, although there are occasional exceptions. One Olmec mirror had a back that was <b>ground</b> <b>smooth</b> and highly polished. Concave mirrors are depicted in Olmec art, where they are frequently represented as pectorals worn on the chest. They can be divided into two groups; those that have a singe drilled hole near the top and those that have at least two drilled holes at the sides. The latter tend to be larger than the former. Most of the mirror stones have been sawn from a larger piece of rock and fashioned into an oval shape; occasionally it is possible to distinguish the original form of the parent stone. The curve of each mirror is unique and tailored to the stone from which it is worked, and none possesses perfect symmetry; this appears to be deliberate. Although the elliptical mirrors are parabolic, the circular mirrors have a spherical concavity. The circular mirrors are effective at lighting fires while the parabolic mirrors are not, although they may have been used to produce smoke. Of four large mirrors found at Arrroyo Pesquero in Veracruz, two were circular and were excellent sources of ignition.|$|E

40|$|Air-polishing-devices {{are used}} by adults to remove biofilm and {{discoloration}} as an efficient alternative to conventional tooth polishing. There is hardly any data for the effect of air-polishing-devices on the enamel of the 1 st dentition. Therefore {{the purpose of this}} in vitro study was to examine, whether air-polishing-devices are suitable for regular teeth cleaning in children and adolescents with teeth of the 1 st and 2 nd dentition. Crowns from lower incisors of freshly slaughtered animals (calves, cattle) were partially embedded in polyurethane casting resin and polished flat. As a comparison, human primary incisors and second primary molars were also embedded and polished flat. Before and after embedding, the teeth were kept in 0. 1 % thymol solution. The teeth were then separated according to type and randomly assigned to 22 groups (n= 10). With the distribution of the teeth into 22 groups, each tooth type (cattle, calf and human primary) in its corresponding group was treated with a combination of air-polishing-devices (PROPHYflex 3 ®, Air-Flow® Handy 2 +) and Abrasives (Air-Flow® Pulver Classic, ClinProTM Prophy Powder, PROPHYpearls®) or was polished with CCS® 40 or Cleanic® using a brush at low speed; exposure time: 60 seconds, air-polisher nozzle distance 5 ± 0. 5 mm, maximum setting. Subsequently, various surface texture parameters (Ra, Rz, Rmax) and the maximum loss of enamel were determined by profilometry (Perthometer PCV). Statistical analysis was performed with Stata/IC 11. 2 for Windows. An ANOVA F-test was used to test globally which of the variables {{had a significant impact on}} the differences in surface roughness compared to the baseline after air-polishing. Findings were considered statistically significant at p < 0. 05. •	Enamel, <b>ground</b> <b>smooth</b> and highly polished, was raised by application of polishing pastes (CCS® 40, Cleanic®) as well as air-polishing-devices (Air-Flow® Handy 2 +, PROPHYflex® 3). •	PROPHYflex 3 ® produced significantly rougher surfaces than Air-Flow® Handy 2 +. •	Roughness on permanent bovine teeth after application of air-polishing-devices or polishing pastes was significantly smaller than on calves and primary teeth. There was no significant difference in the roughness between calves and primary teeth. •	The roughness produced after the application of Air-Flow® Handy 2 + and PROPHYflex® 3 was significantly greater than with CCS® 40 -paste, but comparable with Cleanic®-paste. •	Enamel abrasion produced by air-polishing-devices was equivalent or smaller than the effect of Cleanic®-paste. •	PROPHYpearls® produced significantly greater roughness and more enamel abrasion than Air-Flow® Pulver Classic and ClinProTM Prophy Powder. Air-Flow® Handy 2 + and PROPHYflex® 3 produced roughness which is not different from the roughness produced by polishing using Cleanic®-paste. Air polishing-devices are suitable every four weeks for routine removal of plaque and discoloration among children with mixed dentition and fixed orthodontic appliances. PROPHYpearls® is too aggressive and should not be used...|$|E
