5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E

5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein–protein interactions. Natural <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} kinds of {{reversible}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> They are classified {{according to the}} effect of varying the concentration of the enzyme's substrate on the inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes. These interactions can be either reversible (i.e., removal of the inhibitor restores enzyme activity) or irreversible (i.e., the inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme).|$|E
50|$|Zofenoprilat is an angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> and is {{the active}} free {{sulfhydryl}} form of zofenopril.|$|R

5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{can also}} irreversibly {{inactivate}} enzymes, usually by covalently modifying active site residues. These reactions, {{which may be}} called suicide substrates, follow exponential decay functions and are usually saturable. Below saturation, they follow first order kinetics with respect to inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|The human {{innovation}} {{of cooking}} {{may have been}} particularly helpful in overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants. Many <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in cereal grains and pulses, such as trypsin inhibitors prevalent in pulse crops, are denatured by cooking, making them digestible.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} uses for <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} {{pathological}} condition. However, not all drugs are <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated {{to the type of}} enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E

40|$|Renal vein {{thrombosis}} and the congenital nephrotic syndrome {{have been associated}} with nephrotic-range proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome and hypertension in the newborn period. We describe a newborn with severe hypertension and proteinuria secondary to unilateral renal artery stenosis. Proteinuria completely disappeared with blood pressure control (with sodium nitroprusside and an angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor).</b> Although renin was not measured, we speculate that proteinuria might have been induced by a high renin state, and was controlled by the angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor...</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the patient}} suffers from {{elevated}} pulse pressure, treatment may include medications that address this factor, {{such as an}} angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (ACE inhibitor).|$|R
5|$|Although most serpins control {{proteolytic}} cascades, some proteins with a serpin structure are not <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> {{but instead}} perform diverse {{functions such as}} storage (as in egg white—ovalbumin), transport as in hormone carriage proteins (thyroxine-binding globulin, cortisol-binding globulin) and molecular chaperoning (HSP47). The term serpin is used to describe these members as well, despite their non-inhibitory function, since they are evolutionarily related.|$|E
5|$|Biochemistry {{laboratories}} {{often use}} {{in vitro studies}} to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. <b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.|$|E
5|$|In appearance, {{all forms}} of this {{coenzyme}} are white amorphous powders that are hygroscopic and highly water-soluble. The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD are colorless and stable {{for about a week}} at 4°C and neutral pH, but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis. Upon decomposition, they form products that are <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b>|$|E

50|$|Laboratory {{testing is}} usually used to {{diagnose}} specific underlying diseases, including rheumatologic tests (e.g. antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, angiotensin converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <-- error) and serology for infectious diseases (Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis, Tuberculosis).|$|R
25|$|The {{activity}} of trypsin is {{not affected by}} the <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, TPCK, which deactivates chymotrypsin. This is important because, in some applications, like mass spectrometry, the specificity of cleavage is important.|$|R
5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E

50|$|The Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-4) was a 2×2×2 {{factorial}} placebo-controlled {{trial of}} the angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (ACE inhibitor) captopril, isosorbide mononitrate and magnesium sulphate. It recruited 58,050 patients and was completed in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|Vemurafenib (INN, {{marketed as}} Zelboraf) is a B-Raf <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> {{developed}} by Plexxikon (now part of Daiichi-Sankyo) and Genentech {{for the treatment}} of late-stage melanoma. The name [...] "vemurafenib" [...] comes from V600E mutated BRAF inhibition.|$|R
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to other}} 2OG oxygenases, gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase can be {{inhibited}} by 2OG mimics and aromatic inhibitors such as pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate. Other reported gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase inhibitors include cyclopropyl-substituted gamma-butyrobetaines and 3-(2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl)propanoic acid, {{which is a}} mechanism-based <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{protein kinase}} {{inhibitor}} {{is a type}} of <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitor</b> that blocks the action of one or more protein kinases. Protein kinases are enzymes that add a phosphate (PO4) group to a protein, and can modulate its function.|$|R
