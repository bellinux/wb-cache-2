40|$|Two discoveries {{demonstrate}} that <b>hexagon</b> <b>type</b> spatial rigid bar structures built of tetrapod shaped superelements {{are the best}} for solving of optimal lattice and optimal two dimensional multiscale tessellation problems. Unexplored, however, remain the topological transformations and multiscale tessellation possibilities of regular spatial lattices space in analogy to the 2 dimensional transformations considered so far. Therefore this article concentrates specifically on derivation of <b>hexagon</b> <b>type</b> spatial lattices and the multiscale tessellation compatibility possibilities of the spatial lattice cells obtained. In {{order to determine the}} shapes of the regular spatial hexagonal lattices, two choices are available. The first one is to apply topological transformations to spheres, placed at regular points in space. The second one is to search for all unique combinations of the superelements. However, both of the approaches ask for proof that all possible lattice configurations have been found. A combined approach is to use the 2 dimensional hexagonal lattice {{as a starting point for}} expanding to three dimensions. This yields two unique spatial <b>hexagon</b> <b>type</b> cell analogues and, consequently, two lattice variants. Considering multiscale tessellation possibility of the lattices, an examination of multiscaled lattice cell vertex coincidence reveals that repeating patterns do exist for the second lattice variant...|$|E
40|$|In {{the drug}} design process, {{one wants to}} {{construct}} chemical compounds with cer-tain properties.

In order to establish the mathematical basis for connections between molecular structures and physicochemical properties of chemical compounds, some so-called structure-descriptors or “topological indices” have been put forward.

40|$|Objective: Evaluate the {{behavior}} of implant-supported dentures and their components, made by cemented cylinder technique, using threetypes of resin cements. Methods: Fifty three patients, of whom 26 were women and 27 men, aged between 25 and 82 years. Results: With partial (54. 43 %) and total (45. 57 %) implant-supported dentures, of the Cone Morse, external and internal <b>hexagon</b> <b>types</b> (Neodent®, Curitiba, Brazil), totaling 237 fixations, were analyzed. The resin cements used were Panavia® (21. 94 %), EnForce® (58. 23 %) and Rely X® (19. 83 %) and the components were used {{in accordance with the}} Laboratory Immediate Loading - Neodent® sequence. The period of time of denture use ranged between 1 and 5 years. The results reported that 5 (2. 1 %) cylinders were loosened from metal structure (both belonging to Rely X group), 2 (0. 48 %) implants were lost after the first year of use, 16 (6. 75 %) denture retention screws wereloosened and 31 (13. 08 %) abutment screws were unloosened. Conclusion: The reasons for these failures probably are: metal structure internal retention failure, occlusal pattern, cementation technique and loading conditions. The cemented cylinder technique was effective when used in partial and total implant-supported rehabilitations, keeping prosthetic components stable, despite the resin cement utilized. However, further clinical studies must be conducted...|$|R

Furthermore, the enhanced model allows us to careful modelling the distance-dependent systematic biases to realize the precise RTK applications over long baselines. For the single-baseline RTK, the initial {{studies have shown that}} with triple-frequency GNSS, the service distance can be extended to about 100  km with comparable performance to current short distance RTK with dual frequency. It means that in the medium city of China, like Shanghai, we can provide the RTK service with only one reference station (Feng and Li 2010). Analogously, for the network RTK, the distance of reference stations is advised to be roughly doubled with <b>hexagon</b> <b>type</b> of reference deployment. Such network deployment can save huge money in equipment installation and on-going maintenance (Feng and Li 2008).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The strong {{continuous}} fiber reinforced {{metal matrix}} composites (MMCs) are recently used in aerospace and transportation applications as an advanced material {{due to its}} high strength and light weight. However, MMC is significantly affected by the interface under the transverse loading. Furthermore, the crack at the interface induces weakness {{of the characteristics of}} the overall mechanical response and strength of the MMCs. In {{order to be able to}} utilize these MMCs effectively and with safety, it must be determined their elastic plastic fracture behaviors at the interface. The influence of different regular fiber arrangement as like square and hexagonal arrangement on the strength of transversely loaded fiber reinforced matrix is analyzed. And the interface of fiber and matrix is modeled as thin multi layers with properties linearly gradient to distinguish the interface from the fiber and matrix. Different fiber arrangement of square and <b>hexagon</b> <b>type</b> is studied. And fiber volume fraction is changed for several kinds (5 %- 60 %) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} inner rings in barred spiral galaxies are {{associated}} with specific 2 D and 3 D families of periodic orbits located just beyond {{the end of the}} bar. These are families located between the inner radial ultraharmonic 4 : 1 resonance and corotation. They are found in the upper part of a type- 2 gap of the x 1 characteristic, and can account for the observed ring morphologies without any help from families of the x 1 -tree. Due to the evolution of the stability of all these families, the ring shapes that are favored are mainly ovals, as well as polygons with `corners' on the minor axis, {{on the sides of the}} bar. On the other hand pentagonal rings, or rings of the NGC 7020 <b>type</b> <b>hexagon,</b> should be less probable. The orbits that make the rings belong in their vast majority to 3 D families of periodic orbits and orbits trapped around them. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figures, to appear in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|John Holland (1985) {{proposed}} a vocational theory that organizes people into six vocational personalities (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional) and organizes work environments into six corresponding categories. Holland claims that people search for occupations that {{are compatible with}} their vocational personality and avoid occupations that are incompatible. Behavior {{is assumed to be}} the result of the interaction between the vocational personality and the work environment. Previously, Holland, Whitney, Cole, and Richards (1969) had {{proposed a}} hexagonal model that describes the relationships among the six personality types. Degrees of similarity are indicated by the relative distances between the vertices of a <b>hexagon.</b> Theoretically, personality <b>types</b> and work environments that are adjacent on the hexagon share the greatest number of similarities, while opposing categories share few similarities. Categories that are neither adjacent nor opposite represent an intermediate degree of similarity. Holland’s theory also incorporates four constructs (congruence, consistency, differentiation, and identity) that attempt to explain sources of variability in occupational behavior. Congruence refers to the degree of compatibility between a person’s vocational personalit...|$|R
