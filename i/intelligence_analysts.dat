5|$|Phát {{and other}} pro-Diệm {{officers}} opposed the Buddhist influence being exerted on Khánh. Thảo consulted Kỳ—who wanted to seize power for himself—before the plot, and exhorted {{him to join}} the coup, but the air force chief claimed that he was remaining neutral. Thảo thus believed Kỳ would not intervene against him, but Kỳ was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. American <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> had believed that General Don {{was involved in the}} coup with Phát and Thảo, but this was proven false when the action started. Eight months after the coup was over, Don told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but that the Đại Việt and Thảo's Catholic civilian allies had insisted on installing Khiêm, a Catholic. A month before the coup, American <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> had believed that Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don.|$|E

5|$|The {{deception}} plan mounted by the Egyptians, {{which included}} their intelligence services, relied on producing {{a series of}} events and incidents, militarily and politically, internationally and nationally, aimed at convincing Israeli <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> that the Arab world was not preparing for war. Among the plan's requirements was that senior echelon commanders preserve superficial normality while working secretly on the final preparations for the offensive.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E
5|$|American <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> {{were quite}} baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them there {{appeared}} to be no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 U.S. <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> {{estimated}} that 5,843 enemy infiltrators (actually 4,000) had moved {{south on the}} trail; in 1962, 12,675 (actually 5,300); in 1963, 7,693 (actually 4,700); and in 1964, 12,424. The supply capacity of the trail reached 20 to 30 tonnes per day in 1964 and it was estimated by the U.S. that 12,000 (actually 9,000) North Vietnamese regulars had reached South Vietnam that year. By 1965 the U.S. command in Saigon {{estimated that}} communist supply requirements for their southern forces amounted to 234 tons of all supplies per day and that 195 tons were moving through Laos.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guideline)s and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E

25|$|The Agency also {{prepares a}} {{national}} port risk assessment every two years. The Agency assessed {{the relative risk}} to 168 ports of entry in 2006 and 220 in 2004. Regional <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts,</b> in consultation with other sources and port operational staff, complete a questionnaire detailing port demographics, traffic volume, enforcement, and intelligence information.

25|$|The {{report was}} {{produced}} annually by <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> and subject matter experts at DIA, incorporating all sources of intelligence {{from across the}} U.S. Intelligence Community. By direction, draft inputs were written at a classified level prior to being edited or downgraded by senior intelligence officers with the proper authorities. To illustrate the publication without revealing classified U.S. satellite imagery and sensor capabilities, DIA artists prepared approximately 150 detailed paintings of Soviet military hardware and installations specifically for the publication. Some of this original artwork is {{on display in the}} 4th floor museum area of the Defense Intelligence Agency Headquarters on Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the regular}} Army, WACs could not be {{permanently}} assigned as cooks, waitresses, janitors, or to any other civilian jobs. While most became clerks, secretaries, and drivers, they also became mechanics, weather observers, radio operators, medical technicians, <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts,</b> chaplains, postal workers, and heavy equipment operators. The restriction against combat training and carrying weapons was waived in several cases, allowing women to serve as pay officers, military police, in code rooms, or as drivers in some overseas areas. On January 10, 1943 a 200-WAC unit was even trained as an antiaircraft gun crew, though they {{were not allowed to}} fire the 90mm weapon. Several were also assigned to the Manhattan Project.|$|E

25|$|During 1966 and 1967 {{it became}} obvious to MACV that the North Vietnamese were using neutral Cambodia {{as a part of}} their {{logistical}} system, funneling men and supplies to the southernmost seat of battle. The unknown factor was the how much use the enemy was making of Cambodia. The answer shocked even the most hardened <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts.</b> Prince Norodom Sihanouk, desperately trying to balance the threats facing his nation, had allowed Hanoi to set up a presence in Cambodia. Although the extension of Laotian Highway 110 into Cambodia in the tri-border region was an improvement to its logistical system, North Vietnam was now unloading communist-flagged transports in the port of Sihanoukville and simply trucking its supplies to its Base Areas on the eastern border.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2007, The Washington Post {{published}} {{excerpts from}} UCLA Professor Amy Zegart's book Spying Blind: The CIA, the FBI, and the Origins of 9/11. The Post reported, from Zegart's book, that government documents showed {{that both the}} CIA and the FBI had missed 23 potential chances to disrupt {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001. The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA {{and the rest of the}} United States Intelligence Community. The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI had not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change. For example, FBI personnel practices continued to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Epic Games {{partnered with}} Virtual Heroes of Applied Research Associates to launch Unreal Government Network, {{a program that}} handles Unreal Engine 3 {{licenses}} for government agencies. With this support agreement, Virtual Heroes was able to license the technology to the departments, agencies and units of the United States and its allies across multiple platforms. Epic also revealed that several UGN projects were already underway, including an Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) contract for Virtual Heroes to design serious games with the aim to help <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysts</b> tackle instinctual biases that might colour their findings, an anaesthesiology training application for U.S Army physicians, and a multiplayer crime scene training simulation developed by the FBI Academy. Additionally, Epic's tech was also being used by a top five defense contractor and a national laboratory for custom-made model integrations and visualization. Later in December, defense IT and software firm IPKeys Technologies licensed the third version of the engine for development of I-GAME, a tool intended to train tactics and techniques in regards to Counter-IEDs.|$|E
