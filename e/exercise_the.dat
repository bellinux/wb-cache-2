5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing <b>exercise.</b> <b>The</b> Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{principle}} that is applied {{by the courts}} is that where statute grants a power to a decision-maker for purpose A, it is unlawful for the decision-maker to <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> power for purpose B, because the decision-maker would be using the power for an unauthorized purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E
5|$|A new student, Hilary van Doren, {{joins the}} school's Dance {{department}} and seduces Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate {{the merits of}} traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments. Bruno's father plays his music (the title song) outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets. As an acting <b>exercise,</b> <b>the</b> {{students are asked to}} divulge a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming out in front of his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a New York City Subway station, Lisa drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.|$|E

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to <b>exercise.</b> <b>The</b> gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During {{the same}} year, he met widow Benita Martínez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo Fidel, or Dominguito, {{who would be}} killed in action during the War of the Triple Alliance at Curupaytí in 1866. Sarmiento {{continued}} to <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> idea of {{freedom of the press}} and began two new periodicals entitled La Tribuna and La Crónica respectively, which strongly attacked Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento's essays became more strongly opposed to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentine government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to hand him over.|$|E
5|$|Magistrates {{were elected}} officials, serving {{as representatives of}} the people {{for the conduct of}} public business. There are two broad {{categories}} of magistrates, the ordinary magistrates such as the consuls, products of the republican constitution, and the extraordinary magistrates such as the dictators, remnants of the monarchial constitution and reserved primarily for emergencies. Each magistrate held potestas, the authority to <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> office's powers conferred by custom or statute. The most powerful magistrates, such as the extraordinary magistrates, consuls, and praetors, held a kind of authority known as imperium, the authority to command in a military or judicial sense.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E
5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this <b>exercise,</b> <b>the</b> new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can last {{from one day to}} five weeks.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2006, Mertens officially {{signed for}} AGOVV Apeldoorn, who later {{dissolved}} in 2013, on a season-long loan with {{the option of}} purchase. He managed a return of 2 goals in 35 appearances during a season which saw him become a fan favourite amongst De Blauwen supporters. Mertens' form prompted AGOVV, led by new manager John van den Brom, to <b>exercise</b> <b>the</b> option to sign the Belgian permanently the following season. It was a move that paid off for the Dutch club as Mertens ended the season having 15 goals in 38 appearances for the club.|$|E

5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative.

In fact, Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4. This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army, but at that late stage in the operations, no plans were changed.|$|E

The exercise began with the insertion of troops from the 29th Infantry Division's 1st and 3rd Brigades by UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters into strategic landing zones. NATO-member forces trained with the 29th Infantry Division throughout the exercise. In December 2008, the division also dispatched {{a task force to}} Camp Asaka near Tokyo, Japan for exercises with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force called Yama Sakura 55, an bilateral exercise simulating an invasion of Japan.|$|E
5|$|U-28 sank by {{accident}} on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt. During a training <b>exercise,</b> <b>the</b> boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice.

Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.|$|E
