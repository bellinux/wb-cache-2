40|$|The {{durability}} of coated Nicalon silicon carbide fiber-reinforced carbon (SiC/C) as the <b>flap</b> and <b>seal</b> <b>exhaust</b> nozzle components {{in a military}} aerospace turbine engine was studied. Test specimens machined from both a flap and a seal component were tested for residual strength following extended ground engine testing on a General Electric F 414 afterburning turbofan engine. Although small amounts of damage to the protective exterior coating were identified on each component following engine testing, the tensile strengths were equal to the as-fabricated tensile strength of the material. Differences in strength between the two components and variability within the data sets could {{be traced back to}} the fabrication process using witness coupon test data from the manufacturer. It was also observed that test specimens machined transversely across the flap and seal components were stronger than those machined along the length. The excellent retained strength of the coated SiC/C material after extended exposure to the severe environment in the afterburner exhaust section of an aerospace turbofan engine has resulted in this material being selected as the baseline material for the F 414 exhaust nozzle system...|$|R

40|$|Methods were {{developed}} for predicting externally blown flap (EBF) noise and turbomachinery strut noise. Noise radiated by under-the-wing and upper-surface-blowing EBF configurations is calculated as a sum of lift dipole noise, trailing edge noise, and jet quadrupole noise. Resulting predictions of amplitudes and spectra generally were in good agreement {{with data from}} small-scale models. These data cover a range of <b>exhaust</b> velocity, <b>flap</b> deflection, <b>exhaust</b> nozzle position, exhaust nozzle shape, and ratio of exhaust nozzle diameter to wing chord. A semi-empirical method for predicting dipole noise radiation from a strut with incident turbulence was in good agreement with data. Leading-edge regions made of perforated plate backed by a bulk acoustic absorber achieved up to 7 db reduction of strut noise caused by incident turbulence at high frequencies. Radial turbulence in a turbofan exit duct {{was found to have}} a relatively high level associated with the mean velocity defect in the rotor blade wakes.

40|$|This {{work which}} is {{intended}} to shed more light on the acoustic and fluid dynamic characteristics of jet <b>flap</b> type <b>exhaust</b> flows, reports and discusses some typical experimental results obtained with cold model air jets in a reverberation chamber. Acoustic data on the total sound power output and the overall noise spectrum of various jet flap configurations are given and compared with data from conventional circular jets. In addition various flow data for the same jets resulting from hot wire measurements are reported and general conclusions are obtained regarding the expected noise source distribution. The results indicate the dependence of the acoustic and flow characteristics on the major nozzle parameters. For the jet flaps the total radiated sound power is found to follow a 3 to 6 power of the exhaust velocity while for the circular jets the 8 power law is confirmed.

40|$|The High Performance Aircraft (HPA) Grand Challenge of the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) program {{involves}} the computation {{of the flow}} over a high performance aircraft. A variety of free shear layers, including mixing layers over cavities, impinging jets, blown <b>flaps,</b> and <b>exhaust</b> plumes, may be encountered in such flowfields. Since these free shear layers are usually turbulent, appropriate turbulence models must be utilized in computations in order to accurately simulate these flow features. The HPCC program is relying heavily on parallel computers. A Navier-Stokes solver (POVERFLOW) utilizing the Baldwin-Lomax algebraic turbulence model was developed and tested on a 128 -node Intel iPSC/ 860. Algebraic turbulence models run very fast, and give good results for many flowfields. For complex flowfields such as those mentioned above, however, they are often inadequate. It was therefore deemed that a two-equation turbulence model will be required for the HPA computations. The k-epsilon two-equation turbulence model was implemented on the Intel iPSC/ 860.

By analysis of the deformation of the exhaust valve housing under different preload force, the deformation of exhaust valve housing increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet.

The main engine was served by four side-mounted ducts as well as a row of large louvers along the upper surface to allow air to enter the engine during full power hovering. This engine was the R-79V-300, a two-shaft augmented turbofan with a bypass ratio of 1. Maximum thrust was 14,000 kg (30,864 lb). The rear nozzle could rotate from 0 degrees to 95 degrees for VTOL landing and hovering. The two lift engines were the RD-41 design, a simple single-shaft engine made mostly of titanium. Each had a thrust of 4,100 kg (9,040 lb). The engines were installed behind the cockpit at an angle of 85 degrees.
