40|$|Die externe (gegenueber dem Ausland) Verschuldung der ost- und suedosteuropaeischen Reformlaender stellt einen besonderen Faktor ihrer Transformation zu Demokratie und Marktwirtschaft dar. Zum einen hat die Buerde des aeusseren Schuldendienstes etliche fruehere kommunistische Regime in die Zahlungsbilanzfalle 'gedrueckt' und den Weg fuer Reformen erst frei gemacht. Das gilt klar fuer Polen, aber auch fuer die ehemalige DDR und Bulgarien. Zum anderen trug die Verschuldung wesentlich zur Offenbarung der oekonomischen Lage in den auch wirtschaftsstatistisch gut abgeschotteten RGW-Laendern bei. Insbesondere das RGW-Kernland - die Sowjetunion - demonstrierte durch seine faktische Zahlungsunfaehigkeit die Grenzen des gewaehlten zentralistischen Wirtschaftsordnungsmodells. Nach der politischen Wende erlangte das Problem eine neue Qualitaet, denn seine Handhabung musste nun mit marktwirtschaftlichen Steuerungsinstrumenten erfolgen. Dabei erweist sich die Erzielung eines aeusseren Gleichgewichts als schwierig, was im Fall vieler Laender zum weiteren Anstieg der Verschuldung fuehrt. Ein schwer lastender Schuldendienst bzw. Nachfrage- und Einkommensrueckgang, Investitionsschwaeche sowie Wachstumsverluste sind die Folge. Oft bleibt nur der Weg der Umschuldung oder - wie im Fall Polen und Bulgarien - der umfassenden Schuldenregelung durch Streichung von Forderungen. ' (Autorenreferat) 'The {{external}} (foreign) debt of the reforming {{countries of}} Eastern and South-East Europe represents a special {{factor in their}} transformation to democracy and market economy. For one thing, the burden of servicing their foreign debt 'squeezed' many former communist regimes into a balance of payments trap and was thus instrumental in opening up the way for reforms. This is clearly true of Poland {{but also of the}} former GDR and Bulgaria. Secondly, it was largely via their foreign debt that the true economic situation in the CMEA countries was revealed, despite their attempts to sequester themselves in terms of economic statistics, too. The <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>insolvency</b> especially of the country that formed the core of CMEA -the Soviet Union - demonstrated the limits of the model of a centralist economic order that these countries had chosen for themselves. After the political turn-around the foreign-debt problem took on a new quality, because it now had to be tackled with market-economy steering instruments. Since it is difficult to achieve a balance with the outside world, many countries' foreign debt has grown still further. The results are a heavy debt-servicing burden, declining demand and incomes, weak investment and loss of growth. Often, the only way out is for a country to re-schedule its debts or -as in the case of Poland and Bulgaria - to arrive at a comprehensive settlement with its creditors in which these agree to waive at least part of their claims.

40|$|<b>De</b> <b>facto</b> states, {{defined as}} {{entities}} that possess {{control over a}} defined territory, population, and government, but without recognition from other states, have become increasingly important {{over the past three}} decades. Although the universe of cases is small (there have been 24 <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states since the 1960 s), <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states {{play an important role in}} regional security and stability. Despite this relevance, we still know little about why <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states emerge, how their preferences are formed, and what shapes their behaviour and decision-making. Shedding light on these overlooked issues will allow us to better understand the role of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states in regional and international politics. The existing literature, although insightful, does not fully explain the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. In particular, the literature has fallen short in explaining the behaviour of Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to better understand the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states, this thesis asks the following questions: what are the factors that shape and influence <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state preferences and behaviour? What are the factors that determine if a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state will declare independence or preserve the status quo? More specifically, in terms of the cases under examination, why did Kosovo and South Sudan declare independence, while Iraqi Kurdistan has not? The goal of this dissertation is to identify the conditions under which a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state may declare independence and when it may preserve the status quo. To address these questions, this thesis employs international relations theories and adopts a comparative analysis method to the behaviour of Kosovo, South Sudan, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Following extensive fieldwork in Iraqi Kurdistan, the thesis argues that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states will forgo independence when the parent state furnishes the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state with autonomy and offers sufficient economic incentives. Other mitigating factors include the domestic environment of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state and the parent state, the role of regional and international governments, and the presence or absence of the old regime of the parent state. The main point is that the preference for independence is neither fixed nor inevitable...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the concept of}} <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> (by fact) statelessness, often conceptualised as ineffective citizenship, from being included within the statelessness discourse. This is done by considering the nexus between de jure (by law) statelessness and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> citizenship. The argument that if someone can have citizenship that is so ineffective they are <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> stateless is extended to consider if a person can receive such effective 'citizenship', despite de jure statelessness, {{that they should be}} considered a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> citizen, thus not stateless. By drawing upon the example of the stateless Estonians of Russian origin, the dangers of not recognising the centrality of the legal bond of citizenship, seen in attempts to incorporate <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statelessness into the statelessness debate, are reflected upon. <b>De</b> <b>facto</b> 'statelessness' is shown not only to underutilise the plethora of human rights conventions available, but also to threaten the statelessness conventions themselves...|$|R

Prior to this reform, the non-financial contributions of a same-sex partner to a relationship could not be recognised in the same way as marriage or heterosexual <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> relationships. This could lead in some cases to a non-working partner not being able to obtain an appropriate property settlement.

The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has given}} rise to the number of non-state political actors such as <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. While scholarly attention has been given to the concept of sovereignty and to empirical analyses of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood, <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states as influential non-state political actors remained theoretically under-studied. This dissertation tackles the research question of how an issue that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states causes affects the likelihood of conflict between a parent and an external state. I examine the “opportunity and willingness” pre-theoretical framework of Most and Starr (1989) in order to comprehend how <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states cause inter-state military conflict. I argue that the process of fighting for <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood and the outcome of becoming a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state both create opportunity for the parent and external states. Moreover, internal dynamics in a state are important to understand whether the states are willing to exploit the interaction opportunity <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states generate. I especially examine regime type and levels of democracy in parent, external and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states and argue that when these are all democracies, v likelihood of militarized disputes decrease. Using the comparative method and most similar systems design, I analyze two cases: Kurdistan Regional Government, Iraq, Turkey and South Ossetia, Georgia, Russia. Both cases support the arguments of the dissertation. I conclude with a brief summary and implications of the findings for future scholarship. Özpek, Burak BilgehanPh. D...|$|R
