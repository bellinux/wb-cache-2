The relatively crude, labour-intensive nature of surviving mining techniques contributed to the false impression that India was poorly endowed with mineral resources or that they were inaccessible or otherwise difficult and unremunerative to work. But the fate of mining and metallurgy was affected by political as well as by economic and technological considerations.The British were aware of the part metal-working had played in supporting indigenous powers in the past through the production of arms and ammunition, and, just as they introduced an Arms Act in 1878 to restrict Indian access to firearms, so they sought to limit India’s ability to mine and work metals that might sustain it in future wars and rebellions. This was especially the case with Rajasthan, a region rich in metals. In the 1820s James Tod identified the ‘mines of Mewar’ as one of the means that had enabled its masters ‘so long to struggle against superior power, and to raise those magnificent structures which would do honour to the most potent kingdoms of the west’. Indian skill in the difficult art of casting brass cannon had made Indian artillery a formidable adversary from the reign of Akbar to the Maratha and Sikh wars 300 years later. But by the early 19th century most of the mines in Rajasthan had been abandoned: the caste of miners was ‘extinct’.During the Company period, as military opponents were eliminated and princely states extinguished, so was the local capacity to mine and work metals steadily eroded. As late as the Rebellion of 1857, the mining of lead for ammunition at Ajmer was perceived as a threat the British would no longer countenance and the mines were closed down.|$|R

In 1958 the Arigna Power Station was opened to produce electricity. It was the first major power generating station in Connaught. The station was built specifically to burn the semi bituminous coal with its high ash content. At its height, the power station burned 55,000 tonnes of coal per year and employed 60 people.

Many lives were lost in accidents at the works, and there is a slate plaque to remember them and everyone who worked there. The prolonged miners' strike of 1984 and the competition from <b>foreign</b> <b>coal</b> imports resulted in wholesale pit closures which, in turn, reduced the demand for mining explosives to the point where production was no longer economic and the site was finally cleared in 1997.

The coal cleaning innovations at State Mines show how absorptive capacity was of prime importance for the firm's innovative capacity. External knowledge acquisition as well as internal knowledge building proved to be relevant, although the balance changed over time. While initially acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge (potential absorptive capacity) were essential to improve the existing coal cleaning processes, internal knowledge building was needed to come to real improvements in coal cleaning. The establishment of a licensing company was essential to exploit this knowledge. An important feature was that State Mines was always well aware of its lack of capabilities and knowledge and open to search for and learn from knowledge outside its firm boundaries.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the price impacts of the major regulatory interventions in the England & Wales wholesale electricity market from 1 April 1990 to 31 March 2002. More particularly, to establish whether falling prices during 1999 – 2002 were caused by the regulator (‘Ofgem’) forcing the dominant duopoly of fossil fuel generators to divest coal-fired plant, or because the Pool market mechanism was replaced with New Electricity Trading Arrangements (‘NETA’). Backward regression analysis of functionally equivalent elements of day-ahead prices under the Pool and NETA shows that changing the trading arrangements produced no statistically significant response except for the removal of Capacity Payments. In contrast, coal plant divestment, increased imports of <b>foreign</b> <b>coal,</b> and overcapacity caused by the ‘dash for gas’, caused the majority of the price fall. The direct system development costs, associated management costs, and increased operational risk of implementing NETA were therefore unnecessary because industry restructuring had already brought about a significant price reduction by March 2001. A number of fossil fuel plants, as well as the nuclear plant operators are in financial distress as a result of falling prices but as NETA had no impact on prices there is no need for further fundamental NETA reform. As in any other bulk commodity industry, prices can only rise after some firms have gone bankrupt and their capacity either sold off or closed down for good. In this case, that means the nuclear industry should not be rescued by the UK Government but allowed to fail and their assets sold to the highest bidder. Extending NETA to Scotland, as the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA) will not benefit consumers without also breaking the Scottish generation duopoly. To achieve this, generators in England & Wales must be allowed to enter the Scottish market via an open access agreement covering the entire capacity of the upgraded Scotland–England interconnector. •electricity market design, NETA, industry concentration...|$|E
40|$|Conducting {{business}} {{in another country}} can be difficult {{and even more so}} when there are differences of culture, law, politics and ethics. Knowledge of these issues is essential for effective management. The focus of this study is on effective leadership practice in the environment of the Colombian coal mining industry. This research project seeks to develop an explanatory model of effective leadership practice by executives in coal mining companies in Colombia and, thus, sets out to identify the key issues of the Colombian business environment and explore the strategies adopted by executives in effectively managing this business environment. The model developed for this research project attempts to highlight the issues of executive leadership practice, influencing factors, indicators of effectiveness, contextual dynamics and strategic leadership in the context of current modern leadership practices. Accordingly, the research problem addressed in this study is: How do executives in the Colombian coal mining industry relate to effective leadership practice? Six research issues were developed in the respective sections of the relevant literature. This research is important because it will add to the body of literature and provide a briefing to those companies and their executives who are either already in Colombia or considering entering the country. The study can also be justified on the basis that the mining industry is now a major industry and the number of foreign companies entering this market is increasing. Additionally, there also appears to be a limited amount of literature regarding specifically how key indicators are perceived to determine effective leadership practice in this Colombian business environment. It is not possible to assume that effective leadership practice in one culture can be readily transferred to another culture (Pillai, Scandura & Willliams. 1999). A research paradigm based on critical scientific realism was selected as appropriate for this study because the research involves action-related case analysis of real and complex situations. The basis for this decision is covered in chapter 3. While this study focuses on <b>foreign</b> <b>coal</b> mining companies, there are other foreign companies such as metalliferous mining and oil companies operating in Colombia and the issues affecting the coal mining companies are also representative of those affecting other foreign companies. Overall, the findings found that effective leadership practice as a concept was understood and described by the executives interviewed and they identified eight main attributes which they believed described effective leadership practice and these responses were in line with the definition presented in chapter 2 of this study. Additionally, the responses to the survey indicate that in Colombia leader legitimacy and acceptance is often contingent on non-utilitarian qualities of the leader. Given the importance of the involvement/engagement of executives in the process of effective leadership practice in order to ensure successful outcomes, additional research—specifically {{in the area of the}} influence of strategic agendas on effective leadership practice—needs to be conducted looking at the requirements for success and the vision for the future in the context of the environment in which these coal companies and their executives operate in Colombia...|$|E
