50|$|Pagani {{moved to}} Venice in 1667, {{where he made}} a series of ten aquatints from works by Giuseppe <b>Diamantini</b> (1621-1705). In 1675 he painted the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus. The {{painting}} was exhibited at Palazzo Molin and is currently located in the National Gallery of Spinola in Genoa. In 1690 he was invited to Vienna by the Emperor Leopold I.|$|E
50|$|Carriera's {{mother taught}} her {{the art of}} lace making, but the artworks she became famous for were {{a result of her}} own self learning. Despite this, there are many speculations {{surrounding}} her education in art. It is said that the French painter Jean Steve encouraged her to make miniatures on ivory to decorate the lids of snuffboxes. Some also claim that she received initial instruction in oil technique from the Venetian painter Giuseppe <b>Diamantini.</b>|$|E
50|$|He {{is known}} to have {{designed}} the title page of a libretto for the opera L’inganno riconosciuto by Camillo Contarini from 1666. He reputedly was an early mentor of Rosalba Carriera, and a painter by the name of Santo Piati. He painted a God the Father on the ceiling of the choir of the church of San Giovanni Crisostomo in Venice. He painted an altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi for the church of San Moisè. He painted classical scenes of the gods Mercury and Argus, Juno, Jupiter and Io and Venus for the hall of the Palazzo Badoer (not {{to be confused with the}} villa) in Venice. He also produced a series of about 60 prints, mainly on classical mythological subjects. In 1698, <b>Diamantini</b> returned to Fossombrone, where he died.|$|E
30|$|This {{configuration}} determines absolutely favourable {{conditions to}} establish virtuous relations between urban and natural processes, with special {{reference to the}} ecosystems still present in the peri-urban areas, including, in particular, agricultural land (Hough 1995; Tjallingii 2000; <b>Diamantini</b> 2006; Alberti 2008; Palazzo and Steiner 2012). These favorable conditions are, however, hampered by the tensions that are created, as mentioned, by the contrast between urban development and scarcity of space.|$|E
40|$|Data {{mining and}} {{knowledge}} discovery are advanced research fields with numerous algorithms and studies to extract patterns and models from complex data sources like blogs, event or log data, biological data, spatio-temporal data, social networks, mobility data, and sensor data and streams. The works {{presented in this}} special issue of the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems should keep the attention of both researchers and practitioners of data mining {{who are interested in}} the advances and latest developments in the area of extracting patterns. Behavioral Process Mining for Unstructured Processes by Claudia <b>Diamantini,</b> Laura Genga and Domenico Potena addresses the challenging problem of extracting useful information from the huge volume of events recorded by several of today's enterprise systems...|$|E
30|$|The article, {{that extends}} {{previous}} studies of the author (<b>Diamantini</b> 2014), assumes {{the perspective of a}} city development in the Alps able to safeguard the distinctive features of the Alpine city by strengthening the quality of relations between city and peri-urban agriculture. The characteristics of the urbanization process that is taking place in the Alps and the problems it engenders are considered, focusing on both the opportunities, which call for solutions alternative to the current urban growth pattern, and the conditions for the realization of these solutions. Particularly important among these conditions is above all the reversal {{of the relationship between the}} city and the peri-urban territory, now completely unbalanced in favour of the city. Finally, reference is made to a specific case study: the territory to the north of Trento where a planning project was drawn up, with the involvement of the author (Additional file 1), aimed at emphasizing the agro-food vocation of this territory through different measures, including the creation of an agricultural park.|$|E
30|$|Finally, peri-urban agriculture, in the Alps, {{is often}} based on {{important}} networks of actors who, {{during the last few}} decades, have organised strong opposition to the transformation of agricultural land, reinforced during recent years precisely {{as a result of the}} growing solidity and importance of agricultural practices. The presence of these networks and the effectiveness of their actions acquire ever more decisive weight as they are gradually transformed into forms of organisation able to play a decisive role in fundamental policy decision-making (Peyrache-Gadeau and Fleury 2005; Janin and Perron 2005; Souchard 2003; Corrado 2010). For example, it is well known that land-use policies in the South Tyrol and the substantial defence of agricultural land around the city of Bolzano in particular, can be attributed to the strong influence played by the Südtiroler Bauernbund (the South Tyrolean farmers association) on the Südtiroler Volkspartei (the party representing the German-speaking population) which has governed the Autonomous Province of Bolzano for the last decades (<b>Diamantini</b> 1999).|$|E
