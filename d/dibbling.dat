It was locally-fabricated using commonly-used shop tools, equipments and materials available over-the-counter. Parts of the prototype tool are grip handle, shank, tool bar, dibbler teeth, wing nut and hexagonal double nut. Theoretical and effective <b>dibbling</b> time per tray of the prototype tool is significantly different (28. 2 sec.) from the farmers practice (34. 1 sec.). <b>Dibbling</b> Capacity significantly increased to 109 trays/hour from 15. 7 trays/hr (farmers ’ practice) with device efficiency of 82. 7 %.

40|$|Rice is an {{important}} cereal to Ghana’s economy and agriculture. While there is huge potential for lowland rice cultivation in northern Ghana, erratic rainfall and low and degrading soil fertility remain the key constraints of production. The present study analyzes the adoption decision {{and the impact of}} bund technology and <b>dibbling</b> method on fertilizer demand, output supply, and net returns. The present analysis explicitly takes account of selection bias by employing endogenous switching regression and propensity score matching. The cross-sectional data set refers to the cropping season 2005 and consists of 342 smallholder rice farmers. Results of the seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model suggest that the adoption decisions of <b>dibbling</b> and bund technology should be estimated jointly. Estimates indicate that bunds are more likely constructed on marginal land as a preventive technology, while <b>dibbling</b> method seems to be used complementary to good soil productivity. Adoption decisions are found to be related to economic constraints, particularly of labour and capital, while off-farm income appears to decrease the adoption of labour-intensive technologies. Furthermore, adoption seems to be strongly related to the use of interrelated technologies, the perception of technologies, participation in technology-related projects and farmer groups, plot-level characteristics, and geographic location. To examine the impact of technology adoption, this study applies Mahalanobis metric matching with calipers and the propensity score as additional variable. This approach is particularly useful in the present analysis with multiple treatments. To check for the robustness of results, kernel based matching and nearest neighbour matching are applied. Balancing tests were conducted by checking the reduction of the mean standardized absolute bias. To control for hidden bias due to selection on unobservables, sensitivity analysis was done by employing the Rosenbaum (2002) bounding approach. Results indicate the significance of matching in reducing bias in the distribution of relevant variables between the treatment and control group and that the estimates are quite insensitive to hidden bias. Results of the Mahalanobis metric matching indicate that the adoption of bund technology has a positive and significant effect on fertilizer demand, as well as a positive, but insignificant impact on output supply and net returns. Adopters of <b>dibbling</b> appear to have higher rice yields, while no significant difference in net returns and fertilizer demand was found. However, data reveal a positive and significant effect on output supply and net returns when <b>dibbling</b> method is combined with intensified weeding. Furthermore, when <b>dibbling</b> is not only used as seed sowing but also as fertilizer application method, nitrogen demand is significantly higher. The estimates of the endogenous switching regression model suggest that self-selection occurs. Labour and capital constraints, the use of interrelated technologies, social networks such as farmer groups, education, learning effects through the dissemination and the use of interrelated technologies, and the timely availability of land preparation equipment appear to be important factors in determining farm outcomes. However, the effects vary in the level and significance according to the type of technology and outcome. This supports the need to examine the impact of determinants separately for adopters and non-adopters...|$|E

40|$|Poor crop {{establishment}} {{is one of}} the major limitations to the production of grain legumes after rice (Oryza sativa L.) in rainfed lowland lice-based cropping systems. The success of germination and emergence of mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilzek), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) planted in zero tilled (ZT), zero tilled combined with mulch application (ZTM) and tilled soils (T) were investigated in a {{crop establishment}} trial as a function of sowing delay. Sowing delay was used as a surrogate for soil-water content. This experiment was conducted under a rain-shelter to ensure continuous and progressive drying conditions. A <b>dibbling</b> trial using the same legumes was conducted concurrently and subjected to the: prevailing climatic conditions. Germination and emergence success rate of the traditional <b>dibbling</b> method was compared to <b>dibbling</b> incorporating depth control and seed cover. Both experiments were conducted towards the end of the 1994 rainy season in a Vertisol soil at Ngale and an Andosol soil at Jambegede, in East Java, Indonesia where the season gradually changes from wet to dry season. Mungbean emergence was 93 - 94 % at Ngale and soybean emergence was 83 - 95 % at Jambegede, both in the presence and absence of rain. Peanut emergence was low (50 - 69 %) at both sites. In all three species at both sites, the percentage of seeds that failed to germinate was greater than seeds that failed to emerge, indicating that germination rather than emergence was limiting. Seed rot caused by fungal attack and poor imbibition associated with poor seed-soil contact (observed as intact seeds) were the main constraints for the success of germination of mungbean, soybean and peanut. Thr failure to emerge was mainly caused by seedling rot and the failure of hypocotyl and radicle to penetrate the hard soil, observed as a culling of the hypocotyl, Cultivation at Ngale on a Vertisol resulted in excessively cloddy soil, which in turn resulted in a significant decrease in germination and emergence. The application of straw mulch had little effect on the emergence of legumes on this soil, The use of depth control and application of seed-soil cover did not have a significant effect. Hence the traditional <b>dibbling</b> method where depth of planting ranged from 4 to 7 cm without seed cover was found to be appropriate for planting mungbean and soybean. Germination and emergence of peanut was improved with the application of soil cover and the <b>dibbling</b> stick had a spike added to the tip to assist the root to penetrate the hard compacted soil.
