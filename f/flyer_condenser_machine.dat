40|$|The {{concept of}} {{multichannel}} array projection is generalized {{in order to}} realize an ultraslim, highly efficient optical system for structured illumination with high lumen output, where additionally the Kohler illumination principle is utilized and source light homogenization occurs. The optical system consists of a multitude of neighboring optical channels. In each channel two optical freeforms generate a real or a virtual spatial light pattern and furthermore, the ray directions are modified to enable Kohler illumination of a subsequent projection lens. The internal light pattern may be additionally influenced by absorbing apertures or slides. The projection lens transfers the resulting light pattern to a target, where the total target distribution is produced by superposition of all individual channel output pattern. The optical system without absorbing apertures {{can be regarded as}} a generalization of a <b>fly's</b> eye <b>condenser</b> for structured illumination. In this case light pattern is exclusively generated by freeform light redistribution. The commonly occurring blurring effect for freeform beamshaping is reduced due {{to the creation of a}} virtual object light structure by means of the two freeform surfaces and its imaging towards the target. But, the remaining blurring inhibits very high spatial frequencies at the target. In order to create target features with very high spatial resolution the absorbing apertures can be utilized. In this case the freeform beamshaping can be used for an enhanced light transmission through the absorbing apertures. The freeform surfaces are designed by a generalized approach of Cartesian oval representation...|$|R
40|$|The micro-optical array {{projector}} {{is a new}} {{and innovative}} possibility to project patterns onto arbitrary shaped surfaces 1. In contrast to single-aperture systems the illuminance of the projected image is raised by only increasing the lateral extent of the projector while keeping the length constant. Thanks to the setup - analogous to a <b>fly’s</b> eye <b>condenser</b> – we obtain a very compact design with homogenization of illumination. The images to be projected are presented as arbitrarily curved CAD-objects. Because of its complexity, the first attempt was a chief-ray backtrace implemented into a CAD-program, with the individual projectorlets modelled as pinhole cameras. With this principle one can trace the slides for several applications like the projection on perpendicular, as well as tilted and curved surfaces. Since aberrations cannot be considered with the simple CAD backtrace described above, we used the commercially available raytracer Zemax®, controlled by a macro, working {{in conjunction with a}} CADprogram for improved slide mask generation. Despite both methods, depending on the complexity of the optical system, are generating the fundamental mask data, the paper will show that there is a tradeoff between calculation time and accuracy. Based on this evaluation we will discuss further development as well as the possibility of improvement concerning the calculation methods. The different methods were investigated to determine their advantages and disadvantages. This provides the basis for the scope of application. Further we will demonstrate simulations as well as results obtained with built demonstrators...|$|R
40|$|Fly's eye {{condensers}} {{are commonly}} used for the beam shaping of an arbitrary input intensity distribution into a top hat. The setup usually consists of a Fourier lens and two identical regular microlens arrays - {{often referred to as}} tandem lens array - where the second one is placed in the focal plane of the first microlenses. Due to the periodic structure of the regular arrays the output intensity distribution is modulated by equidistantly located sharp intensity peaks. In a chirped array, the inflexibility of a regular structure has been overcome. Hence, an array can be formed which is non-periodic and consequently the equidistantly located intensity peaks can be suppressed. A far field speckle pattern results with more densely and irregularly located intensity peaks leading to an improved homogeneity of the intensity distribution. In contrast to stochastic arrays, chirped arrays consist of individually shaped lenses defined by a parametric description of the cells optical function which can be derived completely from analytical functions. This gives the opportunity to build up tandem array setups enabling to achieve far field intensity distribution with an envelope of a top hat. We propose a new concept of a <b>fly's</b> eye <b>condenser</b> incorporating a chirped tandem microlens array for the generation of a top hat far field intensity distribution with improved homogenization under coherent illumination. Considerations for the design of the irregular micro lens arrays and measurements of far field intensity distributions obtained from first prototypes generated by reflow of photoresist are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a method and a device for recovering heat from an internal combustion engine, in particular of a motor vehicle, and for converting the recovered heat into mechanical energy {{by means of}} a rankine cycle-type expansion machine.

40|$|FOLLOWING {{tissue damage}} several tissueenzymes are {{released}} into the serum. On this basis, changes in serum glutamate-oxal-acetate transaminase and lactate dehydro-genase 1 {{have been used as}} indicators of the occurrence and severity of myocardial infarc-tion. These tests lack specificity because dam-age to liver and other organs also causes an increase in the serum levels of these enzymes. Recently we observed 2 that heart tissue con-tains singularly high levels of condensing enzyme (see reaction 2 below). We wondered whether a rise in serum condensing enzyme would prove to be an indicator of myocardial damage more specific than either glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase or lactate dehydro-genase. The present study demonstrates the release of condensing enzyme into serum fol-lowing experimental myocardial infarction in clogs. Methods One acute iind 5 chronic myocardial infarction preparations wore studied. Dogs were anesthetized by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital, 30 mg. per Kg. Myocardial infarots were then in-duced by tying 1 the anterior descending coronary artery according to the procedure of Harris. 3 The animals with chronic infarctions were studied for one week. Periodic venous blood samples were taken, allowed to clot, and centrifuged. The serum was analyzed for condensing enzyme, and gluta-mnte-oxalacetate transaminase.

40|$|The use of polymer {{composite}} materials for large body panels in automobiles {{has created an}} environmental problem; these materials are not degradable nor are they recyclable. The objective of this project is to change this kind of material into an admixture to concrete that would enhance {{the properties of the}} concrete, {{and at the same time}} solve an environmental problem. Experimental results show that adding pyrolysed sheet molding compound (PSMC) residue to cement mortar can lead to an increase in the compressive strength of mortar. The improvement in strength is more significant in later ages than in early ages. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies reveal that PSMC has changed the microstructure of mortar and interfered with the cement hydration processes. The improvement of strength is believed to be due to both the physical nature and the pozzolanic properties of PSMC. Compared with other pozzolans used in concrete such as <b>fly</b> ash and <b>condensed</b> silica fume, it is concluded that PSMC has similar physical and chemical characteristics, and so there is a strong potential to develop a new pozzolanic admixture for concrete by pyrolysis of sheet molding compound.

40|$|In North Europe the {{domestic}} heating systems an the hot-water supply are mainly {{supplied by the}} process of combustion of fossil sources as natural gas or fuel oil. As a result to individual consumption and seasonal heating periods during a year the high difference in the required heat varies significantly. The boiling system adjusts itself towards the changing heat consumption by operating in a stop and go modus with different operation time. A harmful amount of CO- an CxHy- emissions results from the start and stop operation during a year. By regulating automatically the power of the burner in a boiler system these emissions can be reduced. This operation mode is not practicable with standard boilers. While changing the power, contents of the <b>flew</b> gas can <b>condense</b> inside the boiler and corrode its wall. Especially in boilers for fuel oil combustion sulfuric acid can result from condensation because of sulfur contents in fuel oil. Investigations on 2 new boiler principles for fuel oil combustion and for a high power range were made. The first principle is a gas condensing boiler which is designed for permanent condensation and desulfurization of the flew gas. In this boiler a bubble column is used for heat and mass transfer. With the second principle a boiler can operate in a high power range without any condensation. Condensation is avoided to construct very simple designed boilers. The heat is transferred in special wickless Heat Pipes. With these two Heat Transfer Principles heat can be transferred in a power range of up to 1 : 10 nearly without a loss of the systems thermal effectivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of synthesis {{gas from the}} gasification of palm oil waste; Kernel Shell, (KS) and Mesocarp Fibre, (MF) has been studied using a small lab scale gasification unit. The effect of operating temperature on the sample for the products yield and composition were investigated. The sample was collected, cleaned, dried, resized and gone through CHNS analysis prior {{to be used as}} the feedstock. Initially, approximately three grams of sample was used. Reactor and condenser were weighted before and after the gasification process in order to know the weight percent of solid, liquid and gas for each sample. Nitrogen gas; N 2 was first purged at 50 ml/min into the reactor as the carrier gas to remove gases in the system for about 20 minutes. It was done to achieve oxygen free atmosphere in order to avoid any explosion. After that, the flowrate was increased to 100 ml/min and the furnace was turned on to the desired temperature. The products which were syngas and bio-liquid from the gasification were firstly <b>flown</b> into the <b>condenser.</b> Then, the uncondensed gases were flew into a 12 L gas sampling bag and analyzed via Gas Chromatography, GC. The liquid product was trapped in the condenser. The gasification process was done in one hour. The effect of operating temperature has influenced the yield of bio oil, syngas and char for the samples (KS and MF). The highest syngas produced from MF and KS was obtained at 900 oC. As the temperature increased, the product yield of bio-oil and char were decreased. The highest amount of Hydrogen gas produced for both samples was obtained at 900 oC and it can be deduced that 900 oC is the optimum temperature for the gasification process. The composition of the syngas produced was identified using Gas Chromatography (GC). The result showed that the Hydrogen composition in MF is higher than KS. The studies on the {{production of}} Hydrogen gas from the gasification of KS and MF showed that the Hydrogen obtained from the KS and MF might be a potential valuable source for renewable fuel and for the usage of chemical feed stock...|$|R

40|$|A lot of {{industrial}} use water in their process {{to support their}} operational. One of the systems that {{use a lot of}} water in a textile industry is the cooling water system. In this system, water is taken from water source (etc: deep well). The water is then <b>flown</b> into a <b>condenser</b> that is connected with a chiller and is used as a media to decrease the temperature of the production machine, room, and all the equipment that is used in the industry. There is two kind of Cooling water system: 1.) Once through system, which a cooling system that runs water through the system once, then the water discarded. 2.) Recirculation system, which is a cooling system that circulates water so it will be reused. The advantage of once through system is that the system can run well cause the quality of the water can be maintained. But the disadvantage is the use of water will be very big or will be squandered. On the contrary using the recirculation system can save more water. This study will evaluate the efficiency of water using in the open recirculation cooling water system. The statistic test result taken from three units of the textile industry, shows that the changes of the debit are comparable to the changes of concentration and the changes of the temperature (∆T) from the water bait hardness and the blow down water. To reach an optimal level of the temperature in the cooling system can be done by adjusting the water bait debit and the blow down. To establish the optimization in the blow down can be done by analyzing the regression and the correlation between debit cycles and the temperature changing (∆T). The graph shows that debit cycles will be optimal when the temperature changing (∆T) is optimal too, that is when the ∆T= 5 °C. The evaluation of the efficiency is done by comparing the amount of water that is been use between the once through system and the open recirculation system in the optimum level. Without counting the debit, we can also count the efficient by using the optimality of the system. In the once through system the cycles is considered as 1 (one), cause there is no cycles in this system. The optimal cycles in cooling system in Weaving unit, the Spinning unit and the Diesel unit is 2, 6; 2, 5; and 2, 5.
