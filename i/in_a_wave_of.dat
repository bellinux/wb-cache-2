In the weeks after his death, he was celebrated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> tributes. He was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, and as a Disney Legend in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing {{for a period of}} time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E
5|$|Su {{continued}} {{his career as}} military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized {{like many of the}} other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was on the decline. Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central Asian art incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor.|$|E
5|$|East Timor's {{ballot in}} favour of {{independence}} after 24 years of Indonesian occupation on 30 August 1999 resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> violence by militia groups and pro-integration factions within the Indonesian military. 2, 3 and 5/7 RAR were subsequently deployed from 20 September 1999 {{as part of the}} UN-sanctioned International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), charged with restoring peace and overseeing the Indonesian departure. Despite minor clashes, including a contact at Motaain on the Indonesian border on 10 October 1999, control was quickly established and INTERFET handed over to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in February 2000. At this time, 5/7 RAR become the first battalion of the regiment to serve under UN command since the Korean War. From 1999 to 2004, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5/7, and 6 RAR would all serve in East Timor twice, giving the regiment a wealth of operational experience. One soldier was accidentally killed during these operations, while several more were wounded. Two years after being withdrawn, the deteriorating situation in the country—by then known as Timor Leste—again saw units of the regiment deployed to conduct stabilisation and security operations, this time under Operation Astute. In response to the initial crisis, 3 RAR was deployed along with special forces from 4 RAR (Commando) and the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) in May 2006. It was replaced in early September by a combined Australian and New Zealand battle group based on 6 RAR, designated the ANZAC Battle Group. Subsequent rotations included elements of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8/9 RAR in the years that followed. After a phased drawdown, the last elements were withdrawn in 2013. Events in East Timor largely overshadowed developments in Solomon Islands, where elements of the regiment also served periodically from 2003 onwards. One member of the regiment died during operations in the Solomon Islands.|$|E

25|$|The {{fall of the}} Ottoman Empire {{at the end of}} World War I, {{followed}} by the arrival of the British, brought with it benefits for the Jewish community of Palestine and its kibbutzim. The Ottoman authorities had made immigration to Palestine difficult and restricted land purchases. Rising antisemitism forced many Jews to flee Eastern Europe. To escape the pogroms, tens of thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to Palestine in the early 1920s, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> immigration that was called the Third Aliyah.|$|E

25|$|Hitler had {{expected}} a million Germans {{to die in}} conquering France; instead, his goal was accomplished in just six weeks with only 27,000 Germans killed, 18,400 missing and 111,000 wounded, {{little more than a}} third of the German casualties in the Battle of Verdun during World War I. The unexpectedly swift victory resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> euphoria among the German population and a strong upsurge in war-fever.

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Manuel I in 1180, his widow, the Latin princess Maria of Antioch, acted as regent to her infant son Alexios II Komnenos. Her regency was notorious for the favoritism shown to Latin merchants and the big aristocratic land-owners, and was overthrown in April 1182 by Andronikos I Komnenos, who entered the city <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> popular support. Almost immediately, the {{celebrations}} spilled over into violence towards the hated Latins, and after entering the city's Latin quarter a mob began attacking the inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the city was}} {{designated}} a fortress of the German Confederation with huge military construction works directed primarily against {{the threat of a}} French invasion. The city became an important centre of industrialisation in southern Germany {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844–91) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> German national enthusiasm for the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Given its {{southern}} Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters {{broke out in}} repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829. Anti-abolitionists attacked blacks in the city <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> destruction that resulted in 1,200 blacks leaving {{the city and the}} country; they resettled in Canada. The riot and its refugees were topics of discussion throughout the country, and blacks organized the first Negro Convention in 1830 in Philadelphia to discuss these events.|$|E

The Bronx, particularly the South Bronx, saw a sharp decline in population, livable housing, and {{the quality of life in}} the late 1960s and the 1970s, culminating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> arson.

Many businesses collaborated with the Germans, and some women cohabitated with them. They were treated roughly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> popular violence in November and December 1918. The government set up judicial proceedings to punish the collaborators. In 1919 the king organized a new ministry and introduced universal male suffrage.

The Hungarian rebellion also sparked student protests in such places as Bucharest, Timișoara, Oradea, Cluj and Iași, which contributed to unease inside the PMR and resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> arrests.
