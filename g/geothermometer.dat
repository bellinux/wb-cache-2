The interpretation of these <b>geothermometers</b> led us to think in an initial assessment of the presence of a deep high temperature resource in a geothermal system, but it is necessary to consider the water–rock interaction condition. Thus, the Cl–SO 4 –HCO 3 ternary diagram was used for the classification of the thermal fluids as a first step to describe a geothermal system.

50|$|The major {{constraint}} of {{this technique}} {{is that it is}} only usable in systems that contain titanium, or the mineral rutile (TiO2). In systems that have no or very little titanium, this method is pointless, as zircons will not incorporate titanium if it is not present in the magmatic melt. However, recent models have taken into account zircon's ability to replace either silicon or zirconium in the crystal with titanium by using independent activities of silicon and zircon. This has expanded the potential uses for zircons with unknown origins, due to the abundance of silicon in Earth's crust. In some zircon crystals, inclusions of the mineral quartz (SiO2) can be used as proof that silicon was present during crystallization, thus validating the use of this <b>geothermometer.</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY, The plagioclase-alkali-feldspar <b>geothermometer</b> {{formulated}} by Stormer 0975) {{does not take}} into account the effect of small amounts of calcium in the alkali feldspar. This <b>geothermometer</b> has been reformulated using ternary regular solution model equations, and it is shown that as the Ca content of the alkali feldspar increases the temperature calculated using the Stormer <b>geothermometer</b> willbe increasingly too high. VARIOUS attempts have been made to formulate the distribution of sodium between high-temperature alkali feldspar and plagioclase as a <b>geothermometer</b> (Barth, 1951; Stormer, I 975). Stormer presents a thermodynamic treatment of the equilibrium relation for the reaction NaA 1 Si 3 Oa in alkali feldspar (AF) ~ NaA 1 Si 3 Os in plagioclase (PL) (I) as a <b>geothermometer.</b> He assumes that small amounts of Ca in the alkali feldspar and small amounts of K in the plagioclase have no effect on the equilibrium and models the activity-composition relations of the coexisting phases with the subregular solution model parameters for the binary systems, albite-anorthite for plagioclase and albite-orthoclase foralkali feldspar.

40|$|Orthopyroxene-bearing pelitic {{hornfels}} (opx hornfels) {{is observed}} in the highest-grade contact metamorphic aureole of the Bushveld Complex in the northeastern Transvaal, South Africa. The environment and process of the metamorphism and its melting were examined {{on the basis of}} the newly calibrated orthopyroxene-biotite <b>geothermometer</b> and mineralogical and petrological evidences. Opx hornfels consists mainly of orthopyroxene, biotite, cordierite, K-feldspar, and quartz. The hornfels is accompanied in places by leucocratic products which show melt textures consisting mainly of biotite, K-feldspar, plagioclase, and quartz. K-feldspar and quartz occationally contain tiny inclusions of orthopyroxene, biotite, and cordierite, which may have been refractory residues. According to the geological setting, the opx hornfelses and leucocratic products are considered to have formed at a similar pressure and temperature. The orthopyroxene-biotite <b>geothermometer</b> was empirically calibrated from the garnet-orthopyroxene <b>geothermometer</b> and compositional data of coexisting garnet,orthopyroxene, and biotite in the natural rock system. At 1. 8 ± 0. 4 kbar, the highest temperatures calculated for the hornfelses and leucosomes reach about 800 ℃. Using the two-pyroxene <b>geothermometer</b> of kretz (1982), two meta-diabases associated with the pelitic hornfels show temperatures of 761 - 791 ℃ and 699 - 783 ℃, which are comparable with those calculated from the orthopyroxene-biotite <b>geothermometer.</b> The estimated temperatures are also supported by the occurrences of aluminosilicates (andalusite, sillimanite, and fibrolite) and by muscovite decomposition, which are observer to the outside of the opx hornfles zone. Melting in the opx hornfelses is most likely to have occurred in response to increasing water activity. The water activity can be estimated from the equilibrium reaction;biotite + quartz = orthopyroxene + K-feldspar + water. The calculation result suggests that the rocks could melt only with nearly pure water (activity≒ 1. 0) at the peak temperature and pressure.

A corresponding decrease in measured emergence temperature is also observed (94 - 31 °C). Chalcedony geotemperature estimates ranging from 110 °C to 41 °C between Birdsville and Marree are considered the most accurate of the various <b>geothermometers</b> tested. Log(Q/K) versus T diagrams have also been evaluated to determine likely aquifer mineral assemblages and reservoir temperatures (111 - 39 °C). The Birdsville Track Ridge acts as a conduit for low salinity groundwater (total dissolved solids range from 640 mg/l at Birdsville to 1900 mg/l at Marree) in the Great Artesian Basin. Old, slowly migrating groundwater from the deeper basins {{on either side of the}} ridge is characterised by higher emergence temperature and higher total dissolved solids. This old groundwater is inferred to have mixed with the younger, lower temperature, lower salinity groundwater that is migrating relatively rapidly along the Birdsville Track Ridge axis. Since the various <b>geothermometers</b> provide distinct types of information, evidence for the mixing is provided by the interpretation of the different temperature estimates. Silica equilibration temperatures reflect aquifer temperatures along the ridge axis, whereas cation geotemperatures partly preserve higher temperatures from the deeper, flanking basins.
