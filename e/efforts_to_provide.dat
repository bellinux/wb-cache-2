The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters. The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.|$|E
5|$|Researchers found {{evidence}} that significant deviations from CIRP during {{the onset of the}} global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 were driven by concerns over risk posed by counter parties to banks and financial institutions in Europe and the US in the foreign exchange swap market. The European Central Bank's <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> US dollar liquidity in the foreign exchange swap market, along with similar efforts by the Federal Reserve, had a moderating impact on CIRP deviations between the dollar and the euro. Such a scenario was found to be reminiscent of deviations from CIRP during the 1990s driven by struggling Japanese banks which looked toward foreign exchange swap markets to try and acquire dollars to bolster their creditworthiness.|$|E
5|$|Theaters {{projected}} silent {{films with}} a variety of musical accompaniment. Depending on the film and the venue, accompanying music might have been the performance of a live pianist or orchestra, recorded music, or absent entirely. Some films were distributed with cue sheets indicating when music was to be played, or anthologies of specific songs to use as accompaniment. Especially between 1910 and 1912, these selections were often popular music, chosen because the song's title or lyrics related to the film in some way, in contrast to later <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> music with appropriate texture. Beginning in 1910, Vitagraph provided lists of this nature for all of their films.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 89.5 {{percent of}} {{residents}} {{over the age}} of five spoke English at home, according to the 2007–2011 American Community Survey. It was then estimated that 889 people, comprising 18.5 percent of local inhabitants have German ancestrythe largest ethnicity in Omakand 15.3 percent have Irish ancestry. The Omak area has a relatively high percentage of people of American Indian and Mexican ancestries; there were over 80 American Indians and over 535 Mexican immigrants, with a combined percentage of 28 percent of residents. Conversely, the city has a small Asian population, making up {{less than one percent of}} Omakians. The 2010 census showed that approximately 35 percent of residents lived alone, most of whom were female. Those {{over the age of}} 65 comprised about 16 percent of the population. There have been several <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> service to the homeless people of Omak, although official population figures have not been released.|$|E
5|$|At age 16, Honório Hermeto was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant and standard-bearer of the 2nd Militia Cavalry Regiment, 1st Company, in Vila Rica. Antônio Neto made great <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> Honório Hermeto with an education of much higher quality than would normally {{have been expected}} {{in a family of}} their limited financial means. The promotion to captain in 1819 increased Antônio Neto's income, allowing his eldest son to go to Portugal and enroll in the University of Coimbra's law school in 1820, thus ending Honório Hermeto's brief military career. He was an excellent student and struck up acquaintances among his fellow Brazilians in Coimbra, including Paulino Soares de Sousa (who would become one of his greatest allies and later the 1st Viscount of Uruguai) and Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba).|$|E
5|$|Tropical illness took {{a toll on}} the Europeans at Fernando Po, where {{hundreds}} died during Nicolls's time there. Nineteen of the 34 men in Nicolls's first contingent died soon after their arrival, and only five of the original 47 Royal Marines who accompanied him to Fernando Po in 1829 survived two years of duty on the station. Nicolls, somewhat restored to health, served a second term as Superintendent of Fernando Po during 1832–1833. Despite his differences with Owen, Nicolls was just as determined to disrupt the slave trade, and equally energetic in his attempts to convince the British government to adopt a more aggressive stance. Frustrated in territorial annexation schemes, he invited the West African rulers of Bimbia, Old Calabar, Camaroon, Malimba, and the Bonny to Fernando Po to form an anti-slavery alliance. To Nicolls' disappointment, the British government ordered him to evacuate Fernando Po on 29 August 1832, {{and put an end}} to operations there. Unfinished work and <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for the welfare of liberated and displaced slave populations delayed the end of Nicolls's mandate for several months, and he did not return to England until April 1835.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that water}} {{contamination}} {{is a major}} means of transmitting diarrheal disease, <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> clean water supply and improved sanitation {{have the potential to}} dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22–27% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21–30% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.|$|E

He said he opposed <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> non-emergency health coverage to undocumented immigrants and he supported the Hyde Amendment prohibiting government funding for elective abortion.
