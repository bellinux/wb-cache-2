"From {{behind the}} door," [...] said he {{who owned the}} mill, for he did not choose to satisfy his brother on that point; but later in the evening, when {{he had taken a}} drop too much, he could not refrain from telling how he had come by the hand-mill. [...] "There you see what has brought me all my wealth!" [...] said he, and brought out the mill, and made it grind first one thing and then another. When the brother saw that, he insisted on having the mill, and after a great deal of persuasion got it; but he had to give three hundred dollars for it, and the poor brother was to keep it till the {{haymaking}} was over, for he thought: [...] "If I keep it as long as that, I can make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long year." [...] During that time you may imagine that the mill did not grow rusty, and when hay-harvest came the rich brother got it, but the other had taken good care not to teach him how to stop it. It was evening when the rich man got the mill home, and in the morning he bade the old woman go out and spread the <b>hay</b> after the <b>mowers,</b> <b>and</b> he would attend to the house himself that day, he said.|$|R

50|$|Hay is {{harvested}} somewhat {{differently from}} grain; in modern haymaking, {{the machine that}} cuts the grass is called a <b>hay</b> <b>mower</b> or, if integrated with a conditioner, a mower-conditioner. As a manual task, cutting of both grain and hay may be called reaping, involving scythes, sickles, and cradles, followed by differing downstream steps. Traditionally all such cutting could be called reaping, although a distinction between reaping of grain grasses and mowing of hay grasses has long existed; {{it was only after}} a decade of attempts at combined grain reaper/hay mower machines (1830s to 1840s) that designers of mechanical implements began resigning them to separate classes.|$|R
