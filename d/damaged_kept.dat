50|$|Edwards {{made the}} short journey across the Midlands and joined Wolverhampton Wanderers in July 2004 in a three-year deal for £150,000. His Molineux career made a slow start, after {{playing in the}} club's opening four league games {{following}} relegation from the Premier League, he suffered ankle ligament <b>damage</b> that <b>kept</b> him sidelined for almost six months.|$|R
40|$|When {{applied to}} {{yearling}} steers on November 30, pour-on applications of famphur at 40 or 50 mg/kg were unsatisfactory for systemic grub control as they only {{reduced the number}} of warble grubs by 52. 2 and 68. 4 %, respectively. The treatments, which had no adverse effects on the health of steers or cellular constituents of their blood, reduced the whole-blood cholinesterase, with the maximum reduction occurring 15 days after treatment. Low ambient temperatures prevailing at the time of treatment and during the two following weeks might have impeded the absorption of famphur through the skin and reduced its effectiveness for grub control. With the grub <b>damage</b> <b>kept</b> to the minimum by weekly manual removal of warble grubs, the groups treated with famphur at 40 or 50 mg/kg outgained (P less than 0. 05) the untreated group by 29. 9 and 13. 4 kg/steer, respectively, during the posttreatment period of 181 days. These results indicate the economic benefits of grub control...|$|R

50|$|Ligorio was a {{scientist}} and a devout catholic: {{he needed to}} carefully weigh his words to avoid a clash with the Curia {{while at the same}} time proving that the Pope's claims were unfounded. He collected a long list of earthquakes of the past, compiling a time-line and showing how they were a common and natural occurrence in many parts of the known world. He kept a diary of the aftershock, writing in abundance of detail about their intensity and the <b>damage</b> they <b>kept</b> doing to the city, dramatically improving knowledge of shocks dynamics and consequences of an earthquake.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the second}} half of July, {{aircraft}} from Victorious took part in a series of attacks on Japanese shipping, transport and airbases on Honshu and around the Inland Sea. In one notable attack in July, aircraft of 849 Squadron from Victorious located the Japanese escort carrier Kaiyo at Beppu Bay in Kyūshū and attacked her, inflicting serious <b>damage</b> that <b>kept</b> the ship out of the remainder of the war. [...] In the main, however, British aircraft were excluded from the actions against the major Japanese naval bases; the Americans, for political reasons, preferred to reserve these targets for themselves.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 a fire {{broke out}} in the {{building}} which damaged the roof and the top floor. The cause was deemed to be electrical. A temporary roof was erected to ensure further <b>damage</b> was <b>kept</b> to a minimum, though a permanent roof was not rebuilt as the house was no longer in use. A second fire in 1994 made the building in its current state unusable and unsafe. Though the council wanted to demolish the building, heritage groups persuaded the council to obtain a report looking into the possibility of restoration. This concluded that restoration should be undertaken, and the building was made safe.|$|R
5000|$|Effort {{has been}} made {{to reduce the amount of}} time engines spend idling, chiefly due to fuel economy and {{emissions}} concerns, although some engines can also be <b>damaged</b> if <b>kept</b> idling for extended periods. In the United States, about a billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of fuel is consumed by idling heavy-duty truck and locomotive engines each year. [...] Many newer semi-trucks have small auxiliary power units (APUs) to run accessories more efficiently while the truck is parked. Hybrid vehicles typically shut down their internal combustion engines while stopped, although some conventional vehicles are also including start-stop systems to shut off the engine when it would otherwise idle.|$|R
50|$|A more {{powerful}} earthquake stuck {{the same city}} in 1977; however new construction codes put in effect following the 1944 incident <b>kept</b> <b>damage</b> to a relative minimum.

40|$|Five lorries shipped {{on board}} the ferry Herald of Free Enterprise that sank off the Belgian coast in 1987 {{contained}} together over 100 different chemicals. During the intricate salvage operation that followed the tragedy, the environmental protection activities met with technical, scientific, legal and organizational difficulties. An assessment of the exact nature, harmfulness, and situation of the cargo {{had to be done}} while access to the casualty was limited, and information insufficient. The risks for the personnel and for the marine environment were evaluated using both simplified scenarios and sophisticated computer simulations. Environmental contamination was monitored and protective counterpollution measures were implemented under supervision of the authorities. Although more than half the dangerous cargo was lost, environmental <b>damage</b> was <b>kept</b> to a minimum...|$|R
2500|$|On {{commissioning}} on 26 March 1916, Abdiel {{joined the}} Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow in the Orkneys. Abdiel, {{under the command}} of Commander Berwick Curtis was employed carrying out night-time minelaying missions in the Heliogoland Bight and off Horns Reef. Abdiel accompanied the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May/1 June 1916. [...] During the main fleet engagement, Abdiel was on the disengaged side of Jellicoe's battleships, After nightfall, Jellicoe ordered Abdiel to lay a minefield in the expected path of the retreating German fleet, to the northwest of Sylt. Abdiel successfully laid her mines between 01:24 and 02:04. Later that morning, the German battleship [...] struck a mine laid by Abdiel on 4 May, blowing a hole , and causing <b>damage</b> that <b>kept</b> Ostfriesland in dock until 26 July.|$|R
50|$|Gilligan {{came under}} kamikaze attack 12 January. A sailor {{under fire from}} the attacking plane leaped from his post onto the main battery {{director}} and threw it off target, a mistake which prevented the 5-inch guns from getting off more than 1 round although {{it was able to}} fire an additional 13 rounds thirty minutes later at a second plane that dived into the USS Suesens (DE-342). The kamikaze crashed directly into the muzzles of Gilligan's No. 2 40 mm gun, killing 12 men (10 missing in action, 1 killed in action, and 1 who died of his injuries shortly after the attack) and wounding 13, and started raging fires.
