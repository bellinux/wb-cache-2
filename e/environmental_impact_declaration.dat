40|$|In recent years, Portugal has {{witnessed}} the siting of 250 wind farms, particularly in mountainous and rural areas. Even though, unlike other European countries, general public consensus seemed {{at first to}} prevail, protests by local population and ENGOs have been increasing of late (many broadcast by the media) the outcomes of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> Assessments (EIAs) provide a good example. This chapter has two main objectives. On one hand, it examines how rural landscapes are discursively framed in the press when the Portuguese media picks up wind energy issues. On the other hand, by analysing EIA reports, it aims at identifying the social actors involved in the decision process of the siting of wind farms in rural or periurban areas, the arguments for and against the location of these facilities and how the (rural) landscape is framed and represented. The empirical material is drawn on three different sources: media analysis of the public discourse on landscape issues related to wind farms; an analysis of EIA reports regarding wind farms in Portugal and an analysis of official positions on this issue assessed through the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Declarations</b> (EID) of EIA processes. It is concluded that {{despite the lack of}} media attention to landscape impacts’ of wind farms, the existing discursive frames are often attached to dichotomized cultural meanings: it either deems wind farms as technological tools for landscape progressive transformation or as a risk to its pristine image. As to the EIA reports, landscape matters are more visible and important and at times sufficient to reject approval or change of the siting of a wind farm. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{performs}} the environmental product declarations for three Belgian mineral products, two granite and one sandstone paving. Both main goals {{of this work}} were to obtain Belgian environmental product declarations to strengthen existing databases and to get similar information for their Asian counterparts. Indeed, competition with China for bluestone products and with India for sandstone pavement is very important due to very competitive prices despite their foreign origin and possibly higher induced <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> <b>Environmental</b> product <b>declarations</b> of Belgian bluestone and sandstone products were conducted {{in accordance with the}} ISO standards and following the stand-ard NF P 01 - 010. CML 2001 method was used to obtain <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> for ten categories as climate change, acidification, abiotic resources depletion, etc. Boundaries of the Belgian systems are the same and the life cycle assessment comprises all steps from the extraction of minerals to the implementation on site. Use and end of life steps were neglected due to the low required maintenance and the inert nature of the paving. For Asian products, the analysis is reduced to the transportation of the functional unit, mainly {{due to the lack of}} reliable data. This work highlights the negative effect of long distance transportation of heavy and non-energetic products. Indeed, the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of the sole transport of Asian products are at least as important as those obtained for the whole life cycle of Belgian products, whatever the category taken into account (climate change, acidification, air pollution, etc.). CML 2001 methodology was successfully applied to these five studies about three Belgian products and two abroad transportation steps. Comparison of the 5 corresponding environmental product declarations permits to highlight the importance of the transport on environment and to promote, supposing equal performance, local prod-ucts in a more environmental-friendly point of view.

40|$|In the {{building}} sector, {{there is a}} growing interest in the architectural membrane structures. Thinking about the actual on-going application of the membrane as building technology: a. the typical materials for textiles and foils are polymer-based, have origin from fossil fuel but become very light building components, compared with other typical ones; b. they are stiffened by steel, aluminium, wood and bamboo structural elements (bio-based or not) and, due to the lightness, they involve less quantities of structural materials than similar common building components. Stating with research results {{about the state of the}} art about the sustainability principles in the field of membranes, the paper aims to summarize the collected information and the elaborated concepts, and to relate together the actual obtained results and demonstration by the application of the Life Cycle Assessment methodology on built case studies. A comparison matrix about existing environmental data on fabrics, films and membranes as ultra-lightweight materials (<b>Environmental</b> <b>Impacts,</b> <b>Environmental</b> Product <b>Declarations,</b> Recycling and up-cycling processes) and the LCA studies on the use of textiles in architecture are outputs shown in the paper. Concluding, on the need of harmonization of the research about the availability of data for the LCA of membranes and on the basis of the collected information and the conducted procedures about the LCA of membrane structures, first design pillars for the life cycle design of membranes structures are descripted. Considerations on the gap between the results of the research studies, comprehensive and theoretical, and the real conditions of the architecture design referred to a specific context suggest views for future developments...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the spatial}} {{variation}} of potential <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of bioenergy crops is quantitatively assessed. The cultivation of sugar beet and Miscanthus for bioethanol {{production in the}} North of the Netherlands {{is used as a}} case study. The <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> included are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (during lifecycle and related to direct land use change), soil quality, water quantity and quality, and biodiversity. Suitable methods are selected and adapted based on an extensive literature review. The spatial variation in <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> related to the spatial heterogeneity of the physical context is assessed using Geographical Information System (GIS). The case study shows that there are large spatial variations in <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of the introduction of bioenergy crops. Land use change (LUC) to sugar beet generally causes more negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> than LUC to Miscanthus. LUC to Miscanthus could have positive <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> in some areas. The most negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of a shift towards sugar beet and Miscanthus occur in the western wet pasture areas. The spatially combined results of the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> illustrate that there are several trade offs between environmental impacts: there are no areas were no negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> occur. The assessment demonstrates a framework to identify areas with potential negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of bioenergy crop production and areas where bioenergy crop production have little negative or even positive <b>environmental</b> <b>impact...</b>|$|R

In order to decrease environmental hazards of pesticide, risk of pesticide application should be measured briefly and precisely. In this study <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of registered insecticides in Iran which applied in 2001 - 2002, 2003 - 2004, 2004 - 2005, are considered using <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> quotient (EIQ) index. Results showed that among considered insecticides, Imidacloprid, Fipronil and Tiodicarb, potentially (EIQ) were the most hazardous insecticides, respectively. Taking rate of application and active ingredient of insecticide in to account, <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> (practical toxicity) per cultivated hectare (EIQ Field) of each provinces were investigated. In this regard, among different province of Iran, Kerman, Mazandaran and Golestan were in danger more than the others, respectively. Besides, considering the amount of agricultural production in provinces, <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> per ton of production were calculated for each provinces which three northern provinces of Mazandaran, Golestan and Guilan, respectively endure the most <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> per ton of production.
