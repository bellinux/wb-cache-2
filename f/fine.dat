40|$|Abstract. This {{study has}} been carried out to {{determine}} how the <b>fines</b> content affects the post liquefaction strength and deformation characteristics of sand. With the GDS dynamic triaxial system, a series of monotonic undrained compression tests of the sand after liquefaction with variation in <b>fines</b> content from 0 to 40 % were conducted, and effects of <b>fines</b> content on the post liquefaction strength and deformation characteristics of sand were analyzed. Results show that with the addition of <b>fines</b> up to a <b>fines</b> content of 30 %, the stress-strain curve moves downward and axial strain at low intensive stage is increased, beyond this critical value of <b>fines</b> content the trend is reversed. However, shear strength of post-liquefied sand first decreases with increasing <b>fines</b> content, and beyond the critical value of <b>fines</b> content it increases with increasing <b>fines</b> content at the strength recovery stage when are subjected to monotonic loading.

Analyses of the probability of being <b>fined</b> after an infraction between 2010 and 2014 show that African American athletes {{are more likely to}} be <b>fined</b> than White athletes. The analyses make racial comparisons over infractions categorized as aggressive and unsportsmanlike.

Finally, Black athletes are subject to 15 percent higher <b>fines</b> for aggressive penalties than White athletes while controlling for pre-market and market characteristics.

40|$|Abstract: The {{quantity}} {{and type of}} <b>fines</b> have {{a major influence on}} the performance of an unbound aggregate road-base.
