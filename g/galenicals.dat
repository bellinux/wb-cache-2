Furthermore, the active ingredient can be used also in cosmetic formulations to care or aid the healing process. When applied topically via creams or lotions, they are referred as cosmeceuticals. In general, one aims to improve the bioavailability through tailored formulations and careful selection of components. An example is the use of latanoprost in ophthalmology for lowering the intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients with side effects including stimulated growth of eyelashes. Does this open up the possibility of using latanoprost for the local treatment for hair loss? Latanoprost, when applied topically, shows a stimulating effect on the growth of eyelashes [1] and could serve as an agent against extensive hair loss. Hyaluronic acid is an active component which is selectively used against early skin aging [2].

The active principle of Senna was first isolated and characterized by Stoll in 1941. The first two glycosides were identified and attributed to the anthraquinone family. These were found to be dimeric products of aloe emodin and/or rhein which were named sennoside A and sennoside B. They both hydrolyze to give the aglycones sennidin A and B and two molecules of glucose. Later work confirmed these findings and further demonstrated the presence of sennosides C and D.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry includes the manufacture, extraction, processing, purification, and packaging of chemical materials {{to be used}} as medications for humans or animals. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is divided into two major stages: the production of the active ingredient or drug (primary processing, or manufacture) and secondary processing, the conversion of the active drugs into products suitable for administration. This document deals with the synthesis of the active ingredients and their usage in drug formulations to deliver the prescribed dosage. Formulation is also referred to as <b>galenical</b> production. The main pharmaceutical groups manufactured include: • Proprietary ethical products or prescriptiononly medicines (POM), which are usually patented products • General ethical products, which are basically standard prescription-only medicines made to a recognized formula that may be specified in standard industry reference books • Over-the counter (OTC), or nonprescription, products. The products are available as tablets, capsules, liquids (in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, gels, or injectables), creams (usually oil-in-water emulsions), ointments (usually waterin-oil emulsions), and aerosols, which contain inhalable products or products suitable for external use. Propellants used in aerosols include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are being phased out. Recently, butane {{has been used as a}} propellant in externally applied products. The major manufactured groups include: • Antibiotics such as penicillin, streptomycin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and antifungals • Other synthetic drugs, including sulfa drugs, antituberculosis drugs, antileprotic drugs, analgesics, anesthetics, and antimalarial...|$|R

40|$|A quasicontinuous {{granulation}} {{and drying}} process to avoid scale-up problems is introduced in this work. Consistent and reproducible granule quality {{is a key}} factor in robust dosage form design and fits ideally the prerequisites of a drug quality system for the twenty-first century and the Food and Drug Administration`s Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative. In scale-up, factors that simulate or reproduce the laboratory scale must be considered. This system provides a new possibility for industrial manufacturing and <b>galenical</b> development of pharmaceutical solids. The quasicontinuous method described in the present work, and the laboratory and production batches and the granulating equipment used to produce them, are the same. Once a robust process has been defined in the laboratory, it is merely repeated as many times as necessary to achieve the desired final batch size. The quasicontinuous process gives new possibilities to simplify manufacturing procedures and to validate them faster. The quality of the resulting granules and tablets compared with classical methods is equal until better. In many cases, existing products have been transferred to the multicell process without formulation changes. The quasicontinuous production concept for high-shear granulation and fluid-bed drying offers many advantages over the classical methods used to produce pharmaceutical granules. The wet massing process may be monitored by the power consumption of the mixer motor for each subunit, as in classical high-shear granulation processes. The air volume, temperature, and humidity of each of the drying cells may be controlled individually to avoid overheating of temperature-sensitive materials. All processing variables must be precisely controlled by a computer, and the data must be collected for documentation. As such, product quality and reproducibility for each subunit is assured...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In Eastern Europe, cytisine {{has been}} used a lot in smoking {{cessation}} while in Italy, it has only recently been introduced, however using a longer treatment schedule consisting of 40 days instead of 25 and a different posology. This work gathered the retrospective observational data collected by some Italian smoking cessation centers that used the 40 day cytisine treatment (40 -DCT) and focused on short-term results and possible adverse events. Material and Methods In Italy, cytisine (1. 5 mg per tablet) was prescribed as <b>galenical</b> formulation because is not licensed with a specific brand. The dosing regimen was: induction (2 to 6 tablets/day for the first 7 days), maintenance (6 tablets/day for 7 days), and gradual reduction for 26 days. The 40 -DCT was integrated with a behavioral support (5 - 7 meetings/patient). Demographic and clinical variables of patients were collected {{at the beginning and}} at the end of treatment. Results A total of 162 patients (43. 2 % male) were treated with the 40 -DCT, their mean-age was 51. 1 years. They smoked 22. 6 cigarettes/day and had a mean respiratory CO of 22 ppm at start. The quitting rate at end of treatment was 61 %, while 26. 0 % dropped-out. Among those who continued to smoke (13 %), about half of them (6 %) halved the number of cigarettes. Nobody interrupted the treatment and only few patients had minor side effects. Conclusions The 40 -DCT was effective in tobacco addiction treatment and well tolerated. The vegetal origin and the low cost of cytisine may increase its acceptability and help smokers to quit...|$|R
30|$|Wintersweet (Calycanthaceae) {{contains}} ten species {{belonging to}} three genera: Calycanthus L. contains three species distributed in America and Eastern Asia, Chimonanthus contains six species originated in China, and Idiospermum Blake contains {{a single species}} distributed in Australia (Christenhusz and Byng 2016). The six species of Chimonanthus are further classified into aromatic type and nonaromatic type according to whether their leaves release aroma or not. (Zhang and Shen 1999). Three species of Chimonanthus salicifolius S. Y. Hu, Chimonanthus Zhejiangensis M. C. Liu and Chimonanthus grammalus M. C. Liu are aromatic type (Zhang and Shen 1999). C. salicifolius S. Y. Hu, an endemic species of China, {{has been used as}} Chinese traditional medicine to therapy cough, vomiting, heatstroke, rheumatic arthritis and measles for thousands of years (Ma et al. 2017). C. zhejiangensis M. C. Liu, only found in Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, is also a Chinese herb and a courtyard ornamental plant, which is widely planted in the scenic area of Zhejiang province (Ouyang and Mai 2010). C. grammalus M. C. Liu is an ancient angiosperm and a transitional species between Chimonanthus and Neochimonanthus, and is an endangered and national-protected medicinal plant in China and mainly distributed in Anyuan and Huichang counties of Jiangxi Province (Jiang et al. 2015 a, b). The three Chimonanthus plants mostly distributed in the area where ‘She’ ethnic minority lived in, so the tender stems were firstly applied by them as a traditional herb to treat cough and rheumatism for a long time, and the Chinese name of the <b>galenical</b> is Shiliangcha (herb tea) (Ma et al. 2017). To date, the three species of Chimonanthus have been made into herbal beverage named as ‘Gold tea’, a type of healthy decoction in the counties around Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces.|$|R
40|$|Absrracf. Hair {{particles}} as arterial lung emboli were {{an unexpected}} side effect {{in a long-term}} intravenous toxicity study in Beagle dogs. These emboli led to arterial throm-bosis and perivascular granulomas or focal interstitial pneumonitis. The embolic lesions were not severe enough to cause infarction of the lung. This high incidence of hair embolism was related to a moderate solvent-specific chronic dermatitis at injection sites. Skin and hair particles may become punched out and enter the animal’s blood system when injected intravenously. This risk is minor if the injection is carried out with care. Proof of such undesirable side effects is impossible in the living animal and difficult even in histological lung sections unless they are scrutinized. There have been only isolated reports of mature hairs as lung emboli [2, 3, 5]. Lanugo hairs, however, {{have been found in}} the lungs of people with amniotic fluid embolism [l]. We report mature hairs frequently seen as arterial emboli in lungs of Beagle dogs used in a 4 -week intravenous toxicity study. Materials and Methods Thirty 8 - to 12 -month-old Beagle dogs from our own stock were used in a 4 -week toxicity test. The toxicity of a <b>galenical</b> preparation of an antitussive agent was tested by injecting the substance daily for 4 weeks into the vena cephalica nnrebrachii after removing hairs with electric clippers. The chemical nature of the compound is irrelevant because there were lesions in treated and control animals. Controls were given a solvent widely used for intravenous preparations. It was a citrate-phosphate buffer of 1. 0 mg citric acid, 5. 0 mg Na,HP 0,, 12 H,O, 5. 5 mg NaCl in distilled water to 1 ml. The animals were assigned to four groups (table 1) ...|$|R
