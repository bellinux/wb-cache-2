50|$|<b>Etiracetam</b> is a {{chemical}} compound {{belonging to the}} racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>etiracetam,</b> a {{structural}} analogue or piracetam, were investigated in rats on Y-maze discrimination acquisition, on open field behavior, on one-trial passive avoidance learning and on shuttlebox acquisition and extinction. The {{results indicate that}} this drug significantly enhances acquisition and may improve retention without having any detectable effects on spontaneous behavior, not even in very high doses (500 mg/kg IP). Sensitivity to footshock, measured as 'flinch' thresholds, was not altered by <b>etiracetam</b> in doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg IP. For a shuttlebox task the effective dose-range lies between 20 - 30 mg/kg IP, provided pretreatment during 4 days is given. Without pretreatment, i. e. when the drug is only administered during the relatively fast acquisition in the shuttlebox, {{it was found that}} acquisition was not enhanced, but extinction of the acquired behavior was significantly inhibited. The effects of <b>etiracetam</b> can be found at lower dose-levels than with piracetam and also in tests (passive avoidance, shuttlebox) in which piracetam has no or only marginal effects.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{determination}} of the solid state nature of (RS) - 2 -(2 -oxo-pyrrolidin- 1 -yl) - butyramide (<b>Etiracetam),</b> the racemic intermediate of (S) - 2 -(2 -oxo-pyrrolidin- 1 -yl) -butyramide, an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, marketed under the name Levetiracetam®. It is show how this information can easily be extracted from solid–liquid phase diagrams of the racemic system. As two polymorphs of <b>Etiracetam</b> are known (Forms I and II), the analyses have been performed considering both polymorphs. The solid–liquid phase diagrams are determined experimentally, using Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and theoretically, using the Prigogine–Defay and Schroeder–Van Laar equations. Only the phase diagram involving the polymorph stable at higher temperatures (Form II) can be constructed experimentally. The theoretical phase diagram involving this polymorph compares well with the experimental one, thus allowing the use of theoretical equations for the prediction of the solid–liquid phase diagram involving Form I, which is meta-stable above 30. 5 ◦C. Our findings confirm that both polymorphs are racemic compounds, which is also confirmed by XRPD analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two distinct}} methods for {{the determination of}} the solid-solid transition temperature (Ttr) separating the temperature ranges of stability of two crystallographic forms, hereafter called morphs, of a same substance. The first method, based on thermodynamic calculations, consists in determining Ttr as the temperature at which the Gibbs free energies of the two morphs are equal to each other. For this purpose, some thermodynamic characteristics of both morphs are required, such as the specific heat capacities, the melting temperatures and the melting enthalpies. These are obtained using the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). In the second method, Ttr is determined directly by an experimental study of the temperature ranges of stability of each morph. The three main originalities of the method developed are (i) to prepare samples composed by an isomassic mixture of crystals of both morphs, (ii) to set them in a thermostated and agitated suspension, and (iii) to use an in situ Raman spectroscopic probe for {{the determination of the}} crystallographic form of the crystals in suspension at equilibrium. Both methods are applied to determine the solid-solid transition temperature of the enantiotropic system of <b>Etiracetam,</b> and both of its two crystallographic forms so far identified, named morph I and morph II. The first method is shown to be very sensitive to the experimental data obtained by DSC while the second experimental method is a more accurate, precise, time- and effort-friendly method for the determination of Ttr. The solid-solid transition temperature of the <b>Etiracetam</b> system, determined with the second method, using three different solvents, is found to be equal to 303. 65 K ± 0. 5 K. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present paper is to show the utility of combining distinct online and in situ probes, tracking both the solid and the liquid phases, {{to come to a}} full understanding of the mechanism underlying polymorphic transformations. The study focuses on the batch crystallization process of <b>etiracetam</b> (racemic intermediate to the synthesis of levetiracetam [Keppra, UCB Pharma], presenting two enantiotropically related crystallographic forms) in methanol, as this process relies on a polymorphic transformation in solution prior to the isolation of the final compound. The polymorphic transformation is shown to follow a solvent-mediated polymorphic transformation mechanism, which is characterized by three successive phases. Identification and understanding of each of these phases requires the knowledge {{on the nature of the}} crystallographic form (Raman probe), the variations in particle size distributions (FBRM probe) as well as the solute concentration in solution (ATR-FTIR probe), showing the necessity of combining these different online analyzers. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{experimental}} method, {{based on the}} Metzner and Otto concept, for the on-line measurement of the apparent viscosity of a crystal slurry during a crystallization process. The first step of this procedure consists of {{the determination of the}} N p-Re-Fr relation for Newtonian liquids, for two impeller-tank configurations, chosen such that this relation is a bijective one. This is achieved both experimentally and numerically, using Computational Fluid Dynamics. In the second step of the procedure, the same impeller-tank configurations are used for the determination of the evolution of the apparent viscosity of the crystal slurry (non-Newtonian liquid) during a reference pharmaceutical crystallization process (<b>Etiracetam</b> - UCB). The paper concludes on the influence of the Particle Size Distribution of the crystals on the apparent viscosity of the suspension. For a given crystal mass fraction, the bigger the crystals are - and then the less abundant they are - and the smaller the span is, the smaller the apparent viscosity of the suspension is. © 2009 WIT Press...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the presentation and the comparison of five experimental methods for {{the determination of the}} solubilities of the two enantiotropically related crystallographic forms of <b>etiracetam</b> (racemic intermediate to the synthesis of leviteracetam, Keppra, UCB Pharma) in methanol. The five experimental methods can be divided into two sets of methods, depending on whether the method is isothermal or whether the temperature varies during the experiment. The results show that the most accurate and reliable determination of the solubility curves of the two crystallographic forms is obtained when combining the different methods. Using a single method limits the amount of information gained, does not allow for a verification of the obtained data, and can even limit the range for which solubility data can be experimentally determined. The results allow distinguishing the solubilities of the stable and the metastable forms and hence confirming the enantiotropic relationship of the two crystallographic forms. The transition temperature is determined to be equal to 30 °C, which confirms previous findings. © 2011 American Chemical Society. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Although {{going to}} complex {{techniques}} {{can be useful}} at some stage of process development of crystallization processes, {{the goal of this}} article is to show that process control can also be achieved with relatively simple measurements, depending of course on what type of control is needed. Focusing on the <b>Etiracetam</b> crystallization process, this work demonstrates the potential of the online monitoring of the power dissipated in the suspension, a property that can be directly related to the suspension apparent viscosity for the detection of the solvent-mediated polymorphic transformation from form II to form I. Even if the work presented in this paper focused on a specific crystallization process, this easy-to-use method seems promising for the control of other crystallization processes exhibiting solvent-mediated polymorphic transformations with similar characteristics: (i) significant difference in the PSD of the crystals of the stable and the metastable forms, (ii) solid volumetric fraction in the suspension higher than 40 % and (iii) absence of phenomena (breaking, attrition, agglomeration, secondary nucleation, etc.) interfering with the polymorphic transformation and affecting the PSD of the crystals. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{development}} of an innovative method, based on thermodynamic considerations and with the use of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), for the estimation of the melting enthalpy of crystalline compounds which are metastable near their melting temperature. The curves obtained, at various heating rates, are analysed in two steps. In the first step, the area of a zone generated by the melting endothermic peak is calculated following a specific method. In the second step, the melting enthalpy is extracted from this area through an enthalpy balance. This method is applied to both identified crystallographic forms, named form I and form II, respectively, of <b>Etiracetam</b> (UCB Pharma). The results show that the melting enthalpy of the stable form II compare well with the ones obtained using conventional methods. The curves of the metastable form I present thermal instabilities (partial solid-solid polymorphic transition and beta-recrystallization) near the form I melting peak leading to difficulties for a direct determination of the melting enthalpy by conventional methods. The proposed method is therefore very useful for the estimation of the form I melting enthalpy. © Akademiai Kiado, Budapest, Hungary 2011. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{performed}} a systematic cocrystal {{search for the}} enantiopure and racemic version of a selected active pharmaceutical ingredient, expecting that a coformer giving a cocrystal with a single enantiomer will also interact with the racemic mixture since they present identical functional groups prone to cocrystallization. We identified several novel cocrystals of levetiracetam and its racemic equivalent, <b>etiracetam,</b> using {{a wide variety of}} nonchiral coformers. Fourteen novel cocrystals of the enantiopure compound were obtained, whereas 18 of the racemic compound were identified. Out of these, 13 share a common coformer. A structural analysis indicates that in most cases the strongest hydrogen bonding interactions occur both in the enantiopure, as well as the racemic cocrystal, whereas van der Waals interactions, or less strong secondary hydrogen bonding interactions, lead to a differentiation of the final structure. On the basis of our work, we suggest an approach {{that could lead to a}} more optimal cocrystal screening of an enantiopure compound, especially when a limited amount of this compound is available.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{predictability}} of the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) for developmental (neuro) toxicity screening, {{we used a}} multiple-endpoints strategy, including morphology, motor activity (MA), histopathology and kinetics. The model compounds used were antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) : valproic acid (VPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), ethosuximide (ETH) and levetiracetam (LEV). For VPA, histopathology was the most sensitive parameter, showing effects already at 60. μM. For CBZ, morphology and MA were the most sensitive parameters, showing effects at 180. μM. For ETH, all endpoints showed similar sensitivity (6. 6. mM), whereas MA was the most sensitive parameter for LEV (40. mM). Inclusion of kinetics did not alter the absolute ranking of the compounds, but the relative potency was changed considerably. Taking all together, this demo-case study showed that inclusion of multiple-endpoints in ZET may increase {{the sensitivity of the}} assay, contribute to the elucidation of the mode of toxic action and to a better definition of the applicability domain of ZET. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Rationale: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} if monitoring lev- <b>etiracetam</b> (LEV) plasma levels can be useful in the management of patients with epilepsy. Methods: This study includes 30 patients with epilepsy, 20 females and 10 males, mean age 39. 4 yrs, 25 with Focal Epilepsy and 5 with Generalized Epilepsy, all already treated with two or more appropriate AEDs. LEV was used as adjunctive treatment of refractory seizures in 28 patients; in the remaining 2, already seizure free, LEV was added with the goal of successively reducing concomitant AEDs. After stabilization of the new therapeuthic regimen, with LEV daily oral dosages ranging between 2 – 3 g, LEV plasma concentrations were evaluated before carrying out further changes of AED treatment. LEV quantitation was performed by a HPLC method (ES/IS) and detected using a PDA. Plasma levels between 10 – 40 µg/mL were considered in therapeutical range. Patients were considered responders to add on LEV therapy when a reduction of seizures ≥ 50 % in respect to baseline was observed. Results: At the time of LEV plasma levels evaluation: 5 patients were seizure free; they were candidate to reduction of concomitant AEDs, which caused side effects in most cases. In 3 of these subjects LEV plasma levels were at the mid of the therapeutical range, and withdrawal of concomitant AEDs was started without any change of LEV oral dosage. In the other 2, inwhomLEVplasma levelswere at the lowest end of the range, withdrawal of concomitant AEDs was accompanied by an increase in LEV oral dosages. All these 5 patients remained seizure free after reduction/withdrawal of concomitant AED therapy. 13 patients were responders with a ≥ 50 % reduction of seizure frequency. In most of them LEV plasma levels were at the lowest end of the therapeutical range, with the remaining showing plasma levels at the mid/high end of the range. In all these 13 subjects LEV oral dosages were increased, resulting in a further reduction of seizure frequency in 8 patients (3 becoming seizure free and 5 reaching a ≥ 75 % seizure reduction). 12 patients were non responders, having shown no change or a < 50 % reduction in seizure frequency. In 2 of themLEV plasma levels were found below the therapeutical range: these patients admitted non compliance to LEV therapy. In the remaining, LEV plasma levels were at the lowest end of the therapeuthical range in 8 and at the mid/high end in 2. In these 10 patients LEV oral dosage was increased, resulting in ≥ 50 %reduction of seizure frequency in 5 cases. Conclusions: In our sample of polytherapy patients, in whom further increase of LEV oral dosage or tapering of concomitant AEDs could have been problematic, evaluation of LEV plasma levels was extremely useful, resulting in increase of responders...|$|E
