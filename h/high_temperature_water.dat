60|$|The Effects of Immersion in Water and {{in various}} Solutions on the {{subsequent}} Action of Phosphate and Carbonate of Ammonia.--We {{have seen in}} the third and seventh chapters that immersion in distilled water causes after a time some degree of aggregation of the protoplasm, and a moderate amount of inflection, {{especially in the case of}} plants which have been kept at a rather <b>high</b> <b>temperature.</b> <b>Water</b> does not excite a copious secretion of mucus. We have here to consider the effects of immersion in various fluids on the subsequent action of salts of ammonia and other stimulants. Four leaves which had been left for 24 hrs. in water were given bits of meat, but did not clasp them. Ten leaves, after a similar immersion, were left for 24 hrs. in a powerful solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, and only one showed even a trace of inflection. Three of these leaves, on being left for an additional day in the solution, still remained quite unaffected. When, however, some of these leaves, which had been first immersed in water for 24 hrs., and then in the phosphate for 24 hrs. were placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 218 of water), the protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles became in a few hours strongly aggregated, showing that this salt had been absorbed and taken effect.|$|E

In order to study the influence of <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> (35 ℃) on the growth of paddy rice, experiments were carried out by varying temperature in day and night. The results obtained are as follows: 1. In case of constant <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> (35 ℃), during day and night the growth of rice plant was remarkably retarded. Retardation of growth was also found for either <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> in daytime only or in night only. 2. Though the number of leaves on main stem was increased in <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> (35 ℃), the boot-leaf appears at the same time or earlier than in natural <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> as the leaf appearance cycle in earlier period was hastened. 3.

40|$|As the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was {{considered}} to be a very important problem to be dealt with in relation to the causes of low productivity of second crop of paddy rice on Okinawa, the influence of <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> to it was tested. The relationship between <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> and the growth of rice plant was already reported in the previous publication. Then the infuence of <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> to a yield of paddy rice was dealt in this paper. The results are as follows: 1. Both culm length and panicle length were dipressed by <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> especially by that of night. The influence of difference <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> to the weights of a panicle and of panicles per hill was clearly observed (Table 1). 2. Not only weight of a panicle but also a number of panicles per hill were decreased for the plots where <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was kept <b>high</b> during night. This, in turn, resulted the increase in weight of panicles per hill (Table 1). 3. The <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> at night affected to decrease both the rachis of second order and the number of grains attached to top of them (Table 2. Fig. 1). This attributed a decrease in grain number per panicle. Since the number of panicles was also decreased with the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> at night, total grains per hill were small in number. 4. The percentage of sterile and defective grains was high in the plots where <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was kept <b>high</b> at night, while it was remarkable low in the plots where <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied between day and night (Table 1). 5. As the growth of both palea-and-lemma and endosperm was good in <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> at night, the weight of 1000 grains and 1000 hullhd grains was increased and the size of hulled grain became large (Table 5) ...|$|R
