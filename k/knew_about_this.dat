25|$|King Alexander {{tried to}} keep a policy of neutral governments {{but he did not}} have much success. Therefore, on 9 May 1894 he {{conducted}} another coup, abolished the Constitution from 1888 and put into force the old one from 1869. Milan's return to Serbia did not last long because he quickly got into a conflict with his son. A week after his departure, Queen Natalija was allowed to return to Serbia. Natalija invited Alexander to come to Biarritz. When he visited his mother, he met Draga - who was 12 years older than him - and immediately fell in love with her. Natalija <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> affair but did not pay much attention to it believing that it would only be a short-lived adventure.|$|E
25|$|In the anime, a Mr. Mime {{lives with}} Delia Ketchum. He does {{housework}} {{for her in}} exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> so when a wild Mr. Mime came to her door and wanted lunch, {{she thought it was}} Ash in costume, and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia, and if anyone else, even Ash, gives it orders, or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Poké Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, it was revealed that Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while {{the two of them were}} sharing the house with Delia.|$|E
500|$|Some {{writers have}} {{commented on the}} {{parallel}} between the love darts of snails and the love darts fired by the mythological being Cupid, known as Eros in Greek mythology. It is even possible {{that there is a}} connection between the behavior of the snails and the myth. Malacologist (mollusk expert) Ronald Chase of McGill University said about the garden snail Cornu aspersum, [...] "I believe the myth of Cupid and his arrows has its basis in this snail species, which is native to Greece". He added, [...] "The Greeks probably <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> behavior because they were pretty good naturalists and observers." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} Jenna's {{scheme to}} con Carvel, Kenneth {{says that it}} is wrong and illegal, and says that if Cookie Puss <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> [...] "he'd tear us apart with his fangs." [...] This is a reference to Cookie Puss, an ice cream cake character created by Carvel in the 1970s. A television commentator opined that the Carvel storyline here referenced the 1973 caper film The Sting that starred Paul Newman and Robert Redford, as two professional grifters, who decide to con a mob boss, played by Robert Shaw. In addition, after ordering the cakes with mistakes on them at a Carvel location, Grammer touches his nose as a sign to Jenna and Kenneth, who are outside, that he has ordered them, a similar gesture that Newman did in the film.|$|E
500|$|Zhou Lian, an {{associate}} professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China, and Ai Weiwei, an artist in Beijing, have publicly criticized Bo and his Chongqing Model for being wrong and lowering trust. Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> stuff, but now they know that it really is true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Maggie and Glenn go {{on another}} supply run at Lori's request, {{specifically}} looking for morning after pills. Maggie and Glenn discuss the walker {{situation on the}} farm, with Maggie sharing the same attitude as her father Hershel. At the pharmacy, Maggie is attacked by a walker but Glenn intervenes and subdues it before it harms Maggie. Back on the farm, Maggie confronts Lori about being almost killed due to her request, and tells Glenn {{the rest of the}} group is using him as [...] "walker bait". Glenn later tells Lori that she should tell Rick about her pregnancy soon. Lori contemplates the act of raising a child in this world, and decides to take the pills, but after a moment, runs away from their camp to immediately regurgitate them. Rick sees the pills and goes to find Lori, who admits she was in a relationship with Shane before Rick found them. Rick reveals he already <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Christian {{community}} of Mangalore accused the police of doing {{nothing to prevent}} attacks by Hindu radicals. Mangalore Police Superintendent N. Satheesh Kumar himself admitted that the police did have information that pro-Hindu organisations were planning to attack Christian places of worship in the district, but failed {{to do anything about}} it. The Christian community accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government under B. S. Yeddyurappa of involvement in the attacks and backing the anti-Christian campaigns. In response to the report that the police had information, Fr. Henry Sequeira, chancellor of the Mangalore Diocese said, [...] "If the police <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> in advance and still could not prevent the attacks, then we have no hope." [...] However, Superintendent Kumar had made security arrangements near the New Life Prayer Centre in Kankanady and had successfully barred the miscreants from entering and vandalising the centre at that particular location, leading to a violent conflict with the police. The police were also criticised by Christians for using excessive force in suppressing the protests and aggressively subduing Christian protesters whilst failing to punish the offending Hindu nationalist perpetrators; photographs and video footage has emerged of the beating of some of the protestors with canes. Caning by the police was also reported at Panemangalore and Farangipet.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} whether General Estienne, the French [...] "Father of the tank" [...] ever <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> project. However, Commandant Léonce Ferrus, who wrote the {{rejection}} report, participated in the Schneider tank experiments on 10 September 1915, and in 1916 became involved {{with the development of}} the Saint Chamond tank, which bore what Gougaud describes as [...] "disturbing similarities" [...] to the Levavasseur project, such as layout, armament (Canon de 75), power plant (80hp engine) and general silhouette.|$|E
2500|$|The tins {{of cooking}} fuel cached along the return route {{were found to}} be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had {{vaporised}} part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers.

2500|$|On 11 May 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission {{announced}} {{a settlement in}} its three-year-long investigation of Warnaco and its auditing firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The investigation stemmed from an overstatement of $145 million worth of inventory on Warnaco’s 1998 Form 10-K. The SEC alleged that Warnaco <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> overstatement when they released a press statement lauding the company’s “record results” for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ending 1998. This overstatement would force Warnaco to restate its earnings for the three prior years. [...] The commission complained Warnaco “falsely portrayed the inventory write-down {{as a part of}} the company's write-off of deferred start-up costs under a new accounting pronouncement.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Suguha, {{also known}} as Sugu, is Kirito's [...] "sister" [...] in the real world; she is in {{actuality}} his cousin, as {{her mother had been}} raising her sister's child from a young age, though neither Suguha nor Kirito <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> until later. She is a diligent worker and has been practicing kendo for 8 years, partially to escape the loneliness and isolation in her life. After Kazuto Kirigaya (the name of Kirito in real life) gets trapped in Sword Art Online, she begins playing Alfheim Online as a Sylph in an attempt to try to understand him better, and it is at this time that she finds out they are cousins rather than siblings; with her mother revealing to her that he is not her biological brother, but is actually her cousin and was adopted into their family when he was young. This causes Sugu to develop feelings for him that she doesn't really understand; however, because he is trapped inside SAO, she never acts on them. That being said, when Kazuto awakens after his two-year ordeal, those feelings come back, but she realizes that he is already in love with someone else, namely Asuna.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 January 1917, 11 torpedo boats of the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, {{including}} G41 left Helgoland {{to reinforce}} the German torpedo forces in Flanders. The British Admiralty <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> transfer due to codebreaking by Room 40, and ordered the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers to intercept the German torpedo boats. During the night of 22–23 January, the 6th Flotilla encountered three British light cruisers ( [...] , [...] and [...] ). The Germans attempted a torpedo attack against the British cruisers, but were driven off by heavy fire and broke off the attack behind a smoke-screen. , leader of the flotilla, and the only torpedo boat to succeed in launching any torpedoes, was hit by three shells, one of which jammed her rudder, forcing her to move in a circle. G41 collided with V69 twice in the resulting confusion, with the second collision caused one of V69s torpedoes to explode. Both torpedo boats were badly damaged {{as a result of}} the collisions, and G41 was hit two more times by British shells, knocking out the ship's aft gun and forward torpedo tubes before managing to lose the chasing British cruisers in the smoke. G41 managed to reach Zeebrugge via Dutch territorial waters, while V69 made for IJmuiden in the Netherlands, where she was repaired, returning to Germany on 12 February.|$|E

2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
