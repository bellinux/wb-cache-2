Nine fingers were loaded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slope <b>grip</b> position and 12 fingers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position. <b>The</b> forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flexor tendons and at the fingertip were recorded. A rupture of the A 4 pulley occurred most often <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position (50 %) but did not occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slope <b>grip</b> position, <b>in</b> which alternative events were the most common (67 %). <b>The</b> forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep flexor tendon (FDP) (slope grip: 371 N, crimp grip: 348 N) and at the fingertip (slope grip: 105 N, crimp grip: 161 N) {{were not significantly different}} between the 2 finger positions, but the forces acting on the pulleys were higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position (A 2 pulley: 287 N, A 4 pulley: 226 N) than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slope <b>grip</b> position (A 2 pulley: 121 N, A 4 pulley: 103 N). <b>The</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position may be the main cause for A 4 pulley ruptures but <b>the</b> slope <b>grip</b> position may be hazardous for other injuries as <b>the</b> forces recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flexor tendons and at the fingertip were comparable at the occurrence of a terminal event...|$|R

5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl into {{a woman in the}} course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the force exertion characteristics and laterality of maximal explosive force exertion of hand grip and toe grip. Fifteen male subjects, aged 19 to 23 years, performed maximal explosive hand grip and toe grip exertions with their dominant and non-dominant sides. Maximal force value and integral force for 2 sec <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>grip</b> exertions were significantly {{larger than those}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toe <b>grip</b> exertions <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> dominant and non-dominant sides. The time required to achieve 90 % maximal force value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>grip</b> exertions was significantly shorter than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toe <b>grip</b> exertions <b>in</b> both sides. Correlations between the dominant and non-dominant sides were significant (r = 0. 710 - 0. 889) in maximal force value and integral force for 2 sec during the hand and toe grip exertions, {{but they were not}} significant (hand grip: r = 0. 242, toe grip: r = 0. 032) with respect to the time taken to achieve 90 % maximal force value.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{configuration}} of the proximal interphalangeal joint volar plate (VP) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position (metacarpophalangeal joint at 0 ° to 45 ° flexion, proximal interphalangeal joint at 90 ° to 100 ° flexion, and distal interphalangeal joint at 0 ° to 10 ° hyperextension) using magnetic resonance imaging techniques in healthy volunteers and cadaver fingers and to compare the results with histological sections. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 24 fingers of 8 healthy volunteers and 12 fingers of 4 embalmed cadaver hands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neutral position and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position. <b>The</b> translation of the VP body relative to the middle phalanx base during finger flexion was measured. In 6 of 12 cadaver specimens, a load of 10 N was applied to the flexor tendons to examine how this would affect the histological VP fiber configuration. RESULTS: When the flexor tendons were under load <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position, <b>the</b> volunteers' VP body was translated an average of 3. 2 mm, and the cadaver fingers' VP body was translated an average of 3. 0 mm, relative to the middle phalanx base in a distal direction. Histological analysis of <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position revealed reversing fibers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VP insertion {{at the base of the}} middle phalanx when the flexor tendons were under load and the VP body was translated. When no load was applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position, no translation of the VP body occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This article describes a VP translation in a distal direction relative to the middle phalanx base <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>grip</b> position when <b>the</b> flexor tendons are under load. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A more precise knowledge of the histological properties of the proximal interphalangeal joint VP during finger flexion can be expected to provide greater diagnostic capabilities and can lead to a better comprehension of injuries...|$|R
