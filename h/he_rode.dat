5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes {{on the right side}} of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} {{that he was to}} answer to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. <b>He</b> <b>rode</b> and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy when he refused to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he prefers the Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would both be named to the squad. He claimed he would ride only to support Roche, if <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown his standing with the team, and that the feud between him and Roche had been forgotten, so he hoped Gadret would ride the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E
5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> his luck to score 151 – his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take. However, {{in the remainder of}} the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.|$|E

5|$|In 1142, a {{cell and}} priory {{dedicated}} to St. Leonard {{was established in}} Kersal. The 12th century hundred of Salford was created as Salfordshire in the historic county of Lancashire and survived until the 19th century, when it was replaced {{by one of the}} first county boroughs in the country. Salford became a free borough in about 1230, when it was granted a charter as a free borough by the Earl Ranulph of Chester. The cell in Kersal was sold in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A 16th-century manor house, called Kersal Cell, was built {{on the site of the}} priory. In the English Civil War between King Charles I and parliament, Salford was Royalist. Salford was also noted as Jacobite territory; its inhabitants supported Charles Edward Stuart's claim to the Kingdom of Great Britain and hosted him when <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> through the area during the Second Jacobite Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In León {{near where}} it moved ashore in Nicaragua, {{the passage of}} Alma left the city without power. Several {{buildings}} were destroyed in the city, and some roads were damaged. Much of the departments of León and Chinandega experienced power outages, due to the strong winds. One person died from electrocution, due to a downed high-tension cable, and another person died in a similar manner. Offshore, one person drowned when <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> out the storm in his boat. In Tegucigalpa, TACA Flight 390 skidded off a runway sodden by torrential rain, killing three passengers (plus two more on the ground) and injuring over eighty. One other fatality was reported in Honduras when a young girl was swept away in a raging stream.|$|E
5|$|With {{the team}} disinvited from Paris–Nice and Tirreno–Adriatico, their next stage race was the Volta ao Distrito de Santarém, a race which neither Astana nor Discovery Channel {{had participated in}} the year before. The team did not win any stage, though Andreas Klöden {{finished}} on the event's final podium, in third. Astana next entered the Vuelta a Castilla y León with a squad that was thought to greatly outclass the squads entered by other teams. Contador won the opening time trial and the mountainous fourth stage en route to winning the race overall. Leipheimer also showed well, finishing 4 seconds off Contador's winning time in the time trial, and falling only on Stage 4, where <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> in support of Contador, to finish in fourth overall.|$|E
