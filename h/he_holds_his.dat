5|$|Against All Odds {{official}} {{began with}} a standard match between Elix Skipper and Petey Williams, who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore. The match ended when Skipper performed a move in which <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> opponent upside-down and around his back. He grabs their head and falls to a seated position to caused their head and neck to be forced into the mat, a move he dubbed the Sudden Death. Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall.|$|E

The four-armed Vishnu should be shown in the background in between Shiva and Parvati; {{in one of his}} front hands is a golden pot from which he pours water over the hands of the couple, symbolizing giving away the bride to the groom. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> usual attributes, the sudarshana chakra (discus) and a shankha (conch), in his back arms. Vishnu's wives, dressed in royal finery, stand behind Parvati and hold her waist, symbolizing the handing over.|$|E

Moments later, Hoover tells Tolson that he needed him, more than he ever needed anyone else. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> hand, kisses his forehead, and leaves.|$|E

Abdi-Heba himself notes that <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> {{position}} not through his parental lineage but by the grace of Pharaoh, but this might be flattery rather than an accurate representation of the situation. At this time the area he administered from his garrison may have had a population of fifteen hundred people and Jerusalem would have been a 'small highlands stronghold' in the fourteenth century BC with no fortifications or large buildings.|$|E
25|$|Superhuman Strength: In human form, Michael is able {{to fully}} stop a truck that had just {{initiated}} its brakes, can break steel chains and rip a first aid kit box from a wall. When changed to his Hybrid form, Michael's strength increases significantly. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> ground against Viktor, a centuries-old Vampire Elder, in physical combat immediately following the transformation, taking the Elder by surprise with his incredible speed and strength before ultimately falling prey to Viktor's much greater combat experience and superior battle technique. Although Michael {{is one of the}} most physically powerful beings of the series, his lack of combat experience tends to put him at a disadvantage when facing particularly experienced combatants, though his raw strength, speed and rage is often enough to compensate for this when facing the average Vampire or Lycan; Viktor is the only non-Hybrid being that Michael couldn't defeat due to Viktor's vast combat experience as an Elder Vampire. He can also punch through a Werewolf's chest with ease. His strength is so great that he {{is able to}} kill William, the first Werewolf in existence (who had been weakened by centuries without sustenance), by tearing his head in half with his bare hands, despite having recently recovered from being impaled by Markus. He also holds his own against another Hybrid, Markus, despite the latter's status as the eldest of the Vampires.|$|E
25|$|In the Book of Cerne the illuminations of {{the four}} evangelists precede each Gospel section {{containing}} the selected extracts from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These miniatures are found on the verso (v) sides of folios 2 (Matthew), 12 (Mark), 21 (Luke), and 31 (John). All four illuminations are consistent using the same format, but with nuanced variations that help to visually discern and introduce each Gospel section. The miniatures exhibit a more linear figural style. In the top center set within a circular medallion or roundel is a partial frontal human bust of the Evangelist who is beardless and has a halo or nimbus. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> Gospel book in his left hand, while the right hand is variable in each image. This medallion {{is located at the}} apex of an arched frame that is supported by two verticals or columns with capitals. These rest on or without a base on a bottom horizontal floor. Each set of capitals in these illuminations is different from each other. Set within the arch is a full-length figure is the particular tetramorph beast symbol of each particular Evangelist – Human/Angel (Matthew), Lion (Mark), Ox/Calf (Luke), and Eagle (John) – inspired by the vision found in the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel 1.10. All four evangelical beast symbols are all winged and haloed or nimbed, and each beast symbol holds a book in its fore or hind limbs. Each miniature is also accompanied by a set of two Latin inscriptions written in capital letters, one at the top flanking the human bust and the other at the bottom flanking the beast symbol.|$|E

25|$|Paul's icon {{continues}} the Apostles tier {{on the right}} side. He {{was not one of}} the twelve disciples of Jesus; Paul, a Roman citizen, was arrested in Jerusalem because he was accused of preaching against the Jewish law and traditions. However, as a Roman citizen by birth, he exercised his right to appeal to Caesar. He was brought to Rome, and after six years' imprisonment, the curia sentenced him to death. Considering his Roman status, they chose the most pious way to execute him: Paul was beheaded with a sword according to tradition. This is the reason he is shown with a sword in his right hand. In his left hand <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> epistles from the New Testament. The next icon portrays John. He has his own gospel in his left hand. Legend has it that John was the only apostle who was not martyred as he died after a long life in Ephesus. Nevertheless, he was unable to escape persecution and had to defend his faith before Domitian. The emperor told him that he should prove the strength of his God with deeds and not just words. John asked for a cup of poisoned wine that he blessed and then drank; the strength of his faith protected him and he remained unharmed. The empty chalice on his gospel is symbolic of this miracle. Luke the Evangelist appears in the next image. As in the icons of Mark and Matthew, he holds a quill and his gospel. The icon of James the Elder follows Luke's image. He was painted with a pilgrim's staff, holding a pack and a letter of pilgrimage in his right hand. James was John's brother, and he was beheaded in Judea in 44 AD. His relics were translated to Spain, where one of the first pilgrimage sites in Europe was born to venerate him. The Camino de Santiago leads to his shrine. Simon's icon is the next on the tier; he preached the Word in Egypt, and he was martyred in Armenia. Simon was put to death by a saw and is portrayed with the symbol of his martyrdom. The last image on the Apostles tier depicts Philip. He lived and spread Jesus' teachings in today's Turkey, and according to Christian traditions he was crucified upside-down. He holds a Latin Cross to commemorate his martyrdom.|$|E

500|$|Ganesha {{images were}} {{prevalent}} {{in many parts}} of India by the 6th century. The 13th-century statue pictured is typical of Ganesha statuary from 900–1200, after Ganesha had been well-established as an independent deity with his own sect. This example features some of Ganesha's common iconographic elements. A virtually identical statue has been dated between 973–1200 by Paul Martin-Dubost, and another similar statue is dated c.12th century by Pratapaditya Pal. Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a big belly. [...] This statue has four arms, which is common in depictions of Ganesha. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>his</b> own broken tusk in his lower-right hand and holds a delicacy, which he samples with his trunk, in his lower-left hand. The motif of Ganesha turning his trunk sharply to his left to taste a sweet in his lower-left hand is a particularly archaic feature. A more primitive statue in one of the Ellora Caves with this general form has been dated to the 7th century. [...] Details of the other hands are difficult to make out on the statue shown. In the standard configuration, Ganesha typically holds an axe or a goad in one upper arm and a pasha (noose) in the other upper arm. In rare instances, he may be depicted with a human head.|$|E

Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at the top of the steps. [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying very hard to be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E
