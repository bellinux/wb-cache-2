5000|$|When {{a mobile}} {{consumer}} requests {{content in the}} form of, for example, <b>e-vouchers,</b> audio files or video clips, the advertiser is charged a nominal sum by the platform that supports the marketing campaign. Each request is defined as an [...] "activity". The platform's pricing charges a cost-per-activity. The amount payable by the advertiser {{is a function of}} the number of requests for content from the consumer, multiplied by the agreed cost/activity. This pricing model was created by Mobilitrix, a mobile solutions company based in Cape Town, South Africa. The advertiser only pays when a potential consumer accesses information or content as prompted by static media (POS poster, billboard, TV, radio or print advertisement). Alternatives include the pay per click, also known as the cost per click model.|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) is {{an increasingly}} adopted production system {{to meet the}} goals of sustainable crop production intensification in feeding a growing world population whilst conserving natural resources. Mechanization (especially power units, seeders, rippers and sprayers) is a key input for CA and smallholder farmers often have difficulties in making the necessary investments. Donors {{may be able to}} provide mechanization inputs in the short term, {{but this is not a}} sustainable solution as a machinery input supply chain needs to be built up to continue availability after external interventions cease. Local manufacture should be supported, as was the case in Brazil, but this is a slow development process, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. A more immediate solution is to equip and train CA service provision entrepreneurs. With the right equipment, selected for the needs of their local clientele, and the right technical and business management training, such entrepreneurs can make a livelihood by supplying high quality CA and other mechanization services on a fully costed basis. Elements of the required training, based on extensive field experience, are provided. To catalyse the growth of CA providers’ business, the market can be stimulated for an initial period by issuing <b>e-vouchers</b> for services and inputs...|$|R

ALLOCATE was officially launched on November 1, 2010 and all clubs were mandated to use the new sustainable <b>e-voucher</b> system. The project has since spawned the creation of Hueritix Software for the future development and maintenance.|$|E

50|$|A voucher {{can also}} be used online {{in the form of an}} <b>e-voucher.</b> These types of {{vouchers}} can be entered when shopping online and the relevant vouchers value added to your order. It can take the form of any code. Many companies have opted to use voucher codes for the last few years but with a massive incline in use towards late 2008 and early 2009. There are many Internet websites devoted to promoting these deals and vouchers online, as well as Facebook groups offering items such as student discounts and 2-for-1 restaurant voucher deals. Many companies have started their business around coupons. It comes under affiliate marketing. Companies like RetailMeNot, Fatwallet, CouponRani & festcoupon deals with online as well as offline coupons.|$|E

30|$|<b>E-voucher</b> Generation: Periodically, {{a vehicle}} {{registers}} for SP’s services. During the registration, the vehicle specifies the service files it wishes to acquire. Then, TA generates an electronic voucher (EV) which contains the secret shares {{corresponding to the}} access structure which the vehicle registered for. <b>E-voucher</b> will work as a transaction evidence for the purchased services.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{problems}} plague the current Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP), including: late delivery of inputs; distribution of standardized inputs {{that may not be}} appropriate for all agro-ecological zones or soil types; crowding out of private sector; poor targeting, and; high cost to the government treasury. The Government of Zambia has yet to pilot an <b>e-voucher</b> system for FISP due to concerns that the private sector in rural Zambia lacks the capacity to effectively provide farmers with inputs and that a failure of FISP would have negative consequences for national food security. Analysis of existing <b>e-voucher</b> systems in Zambia suggests that e-vouchers can be used to distribute FISP inputs to farmers, particularly in high potential agricultural regions. Moreover, the use of e-vouchers for FISP can effectively address many of the problems that plague the current distribution system...|$|E
30|$|System Setup: TA sets up {{its master}} secret key and its {{corresponding}} public key. Each vehicle provides its real identity, and TA generates the corresponding pseudo identity from which a partial private key is computed. SPs and RSCs also provide their real identities, and TA computes their partial private keys. Each SP generates the service files along with their access structures. SPs send securely the attribute master key of each file to TA. SPs also send the service files to RSC along with the corresponding secret keys which {{will be used for}} <b>E-voucher</b> generation through hash chain technique.|$|E
40|$|Though Zambia is well {{endowed with}} natural resources, its {{agricultural}} sector is extremely underdeveloped, and {{almost half of}} the small-scale farmers do not even achieve food security. While internal political problems are a major cause for this, external disturbances such as climate change and economic shocks are additional threats to the sector. This study explores the main challenges and presents suggestions for resolutions based on empirical research. The <b>e-voucher</b> system, crop diversification and conservation agriculture belong to the bundle of suggested measures, which – when implemented together – could lead to pro-poor agricultural development. They would not only buffer climate and economic shocks but also increase income in a pro poor manner and show spill-over effects. Accompanied by suitable “software” measures at all levels in order to increase knowledge as well as adaptive and organisational capacity, farmers’ resilience can be comprehensively strengthened. However, political will and more commitment from all stakeholders, including the engagement of the private sector and the self initiative of farmers, are needed to really make things happen...|$|E
