40|$|Capítulos en librosDuring {{the last}} ten years Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica has built a {{considerable}} number of high voltage/medium voltage transformer stations in urban areas using high voltage (220 kV and 132 kV) Gas Insulated Substations (GISs). The typical configuration of such GISs is double bar with two transmission line bays, two transformer bays and a coupling bay. Overhead transmission lines and power transformers are connected to the GIS using either <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> or Gas <b>Insulated</b> Lines (GILs) of different length. The protection of the power transformers against lightning overvoltages is performed with surge arresters at the connection point of the overhead lines with either the <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> or the GILs. This paper reports an exhaustive study conducted by Iberdrola aimed at assessing the performance of the protective scheme in three configurations in both 132 kV and 220 kV stations: 1. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using GILSs. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using GILs. 2. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> 3. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> Overhead lines are connected to the GIS using GILs. Very detailed models of the stations for electromagnetic transient simulation have been developed using manufacturer data of the GISs, <b>insulated</b> <b>cables,</b> GILs, power transformers and surge arresters. The study has comprised simulation of a reference case of each configuration and several sensitivity studies with respect to the length of the <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> and the GILs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} defects of <b>cable</b> <b>joints</b> always {{accelerate the}} deterioration of insulation, until finally accidents can arise due to {{the explosion of the}} joints. The formation process of this damage often involves changes in the electromagnetic, temperature and stress distribution of the <b>cable</b> <b>joint,</b> therefore, it is necessary to analyze the electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical distribution of <b>cable</b> <b>joints.</b> Aiming at solving this problem, the paper sets up a 3 -D electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical coupling model of <b>cable</b> <b>joints</b> under crimping process defects. Based on the model, the electromagnetic losses distribution, temperature distribution and stress distribution of a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> and body are calculated. Then, the coupling fields characteristics in different contact coefficient k, ambient temperature Tamb and load current I were analyzed, and according to the thermal-mechanical characteristics of a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> under internal defects, the temperature difference ΔTf and stress difference Δσf of cable surface are applied to evaluate the internal <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> defects. Finally, a simplified model of the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> is set up to verify the accuracy of the coupling field model proposed in this paper, which indicates that the model can be used to analyze the coupling fields characteristics of <b>cable</b> <b>joints</b> and the method can be applied to evaluate crimping process defects of <b>cable</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>joint</b> is used {{to connect}} {{different}} sections of cable because a cable section {{is limited to a}} certain length. The design of a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> mainly depends on the cable type, the applied voltage and the cores. These factors contribute to the way of how electric field stress is distributed at the <b>cable</b> <b>joint.</b> If there are defects exist within the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> insulation material, the electric field at that region is altered. The alteration may cause electrical discharges to occur within the defects if the electric field magnitude is larger than the breakdown strength at the defect sites. Therefore, this paper investigates the electric field distribution in a medium voltage <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> in the presence of defects. The investigation was done through modelling a medium voltage (MV) <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> using finite element analysis (FEA) software. Several parameters such as the defect size and location, insulation material dielectric constant and insulation thickness have been studied of their effects on the electric field distribution at the <b>cable</b> <b>joint.</b> The results obtained may be able to help in the designing of <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> structures which can reduce the electric field stress...|$|R
40|$|Defect in a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} reasons of a power system being faulty. A defect can cause the {{electric}} field in the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> to become higher than the material surrounding the defect. This may result in partial discharge (PD) activity to occur within the defect site. When PD is repeating at the defect site, the material surrounding the defect will be affected, where PD may extend its path in the material. This may result in a breakdown at <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> and consequently causes breakdown on the whole system. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study the electric field distribution in 132 kV one piece premolded <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> with and without the presence of defects. A better understanding of the electric field distribution at a <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> can be attained by modelling the <b>cable</b> <b>joint</b> structure using finite element analysis (FEA) method.

This offers a more related to physics alternative to the transfer function model. The equivalence between both models is shown. Materials and Methods: In a first step, the possibility of modeling an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> with a transmission line model was analyzed through full-wave numerical simulations. An electrode model that has a physical meaning was proposed. The transmission line model predictions were confronted to experimental and simulated data of the transfer function of a cable and of the resonant behavior {{as a function of}} length of cables with different termination conditions. Results: The assumption of a transmission line model which underlies the transfer function model is right for a simple cable embedded in tissue imitating gel. A transmission line model extracted from a transfer function allows to predict the resonant behavior of two cables with different termination conditions. Conclusion: A transmission line model of an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> embedded in tissue imitating gel offers a more directly related to physics alternative to the transfer function model...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between impulse breakdown stress and stressed oil volume {{has been extensively}} investigated for uniform field electrodes. In large high voltage transformers {{it is essential to}} extend this relationship to paper insulated non-uniform field situations which are more frequently encountered in practice. This paper develops the stated relationship by experimental tests, using <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> to plane configurations, and statistical methods. These tests show that the impulse breakdown strength of an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> to plane or nonuniform field system has a two parameter Weibull distribution, when the oil is considered to be the weak-link of the system. A non-linear regression analysis is then used to find that the Weibull parameters for insulated non-uniform field electrodes are approximately the same as the parameters for the uninsulated uniform field electrodes provided their stressed oil volumes are equivalent. Statistical calculations are used to derive the fundamental {{relationship between}} the Weibull parameters for any stressed oil volume and the Weibull parameters for the unit oil volume. With this relationship it is possible for design engineers to approximately determine the probability of electrical breakdown of any <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> to plane configuration in large power transformers.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has little}} {{possibility}} that a cable causes any problem in electric power facilities. However, when a trouble occurs in a cable or a <b>cable</b> <b>joint,</b> the damage is very severe. The main causes of the cable defections are bad cable making procedure, poor cable operation and deterioration according to the years and {{it is known that}} defections in insulator of cable generate partial discharges. There are some potential problems due to having lots of <b>cable</b> <b>joints,</b> because of short length of cable, especially in 154 kV facilities. In this study, a novel method to measure partial discharges in <b>cable</b> <b>joints</b> is proposed and the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed method are shown through experiment results in field. The developed system uses specially designed RF detector attached at both edges of <b>cable</b> <b>joints</b> to detect partial discharges and performs on-line continuous measurement of them. The obtained RF signals are converted to digital values and the digital processor manages the data with fault detection algorithm...|$|R
