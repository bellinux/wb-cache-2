40|$|The role of ultralean {{combustion}} {{in achieving}} fuel economy in general aviation piston engines was investigated. The aircraft {{internal combustion engine}} was reviewed with regard to general aviation requirements, engine thermodynamics and systems. Factors affecting fuel economy such as those connected with an ideal leanout to near the gasoline lean flammability limit (ultralean operation) were analyzed. A Lycoming T 10 - 541 E engine was tested in that program (both in the test cell and in flight). Test results indicate that hydrogen addition {{is not necessary to}} operate the engine ultralean. A 17 percent improvement in fuel economy was demonstrated in flight with the Beechcraft Duke B 60 by simply leaning the engine at constant cruiser power and adjusting the ignition for best timing. No detonation was encountered, and a 25, 000 ft ceiling was available. <b>Engine</b> <b>roughness</b> was shown to be the limiting factor in the leanout...|$|E
40|$|A {{light-duty}} automotive Diesel {{engine was}} fumigated with methanol in amounts up to 35 % and 50 % {{of the total}} fuel energy respectively {{in order to determine}} the effect of alcohol fumigation on engine performance at various operating conditons. Engine fuel efficiency, emissions, smoke, and the occurrence of severe knock were the parameters used to evaluate performance. Raw exhaust particulate and its soluble organic extract were screened for biological activity using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay. Results are given for a test matrix made up of twelve steady-state operating conditions. For all conditions except the 1 / 4 rack (light load) condition, modest thermal efficiency gains were noted upon ethanol fumigation. Methanol showed the same increase at 3 / 4 and full rack (high load) conditions. However, <b>engine</b> <b>roughness</b> or the occurrence of severe knock limited the maximum amount of alcohol that could be fumigated. Brake specific nitrogen oxide concentrations were found to decrease for all ethanol conditions tested. Oxides of nitrogen emissions, on a volume basis, decreased for all alcohol conditions tested. Based on the limited particulate data analyzed, it appears that ethanol fumigation, like methanol fumigation, while lowering the mass of particulated emitted, does enhance the biological activity of that particulate...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{arose from}} a programme of {{research into the}} means of reducing combustion noise and <b>engine</b> <b>roughness</b> in a compression-ignition engine. Information on pre-tlame reactions in spark-ignition engines from published literature indicates that these reactions, which yield active partial products of combustion that finally lead to the auto-ignition of the end gas, or ‘knock’,‘may reduce the ignition delay in a compression-ignition engine {{and contribute to the}} smooth running of the engine. Preliminary tests with part of the fuel introduced with the intake air in the form of spray confirmed such a view. They showed how, by slow oxidation of the aspirated fuel, the compression pressure is increased and the ignition delay of the main fuel is reduced with consequent smoothing of the pressure diagram and elimination of combustion noise. The effects on combustion and performance under various loads and speeds are presented, it being found that overall thermal efficiency is im-proved at high load but made worse at low load. Further investigations were then carried out on the various factors that may have effects on the result of introducing fuel with the intake air. Among these were the types of fuel used for the aspirated as well as the main charge, combustion chamber design, compression ratio, and timing of bot...|$|E
40|$|The system directs {{light from}} a source (1) via a linear {{transmission}} grating (2) and telescope (3, 4) at the surface (5) where an image (G') of the grating is formed. The reflection passes through another telescope (6, 7) to a charge-coupled device matrix (8) whose receiving surface is conjugated with {{the plane of the}} grating image. The periodic distribution of brightness is generated by the beam incident at an angle of more than 45 deg. to the normal at the curved surface. The matrix receives a sharply focused image of the region about the line of intersection.

5000|$|The {{performance}} of Opala 3.8L was actually quite pleasing; {{with a top}} speed of 112.5 mi/h km/h and acceleration from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in about 11 seconds, it was the fastest Brazilian car of its time, losing the title the following year to the Dodge Dart whose 318ci V8 had more power and torque. The two 2.5L fours did not offer as much vigor, but had enough torque enough for everyday use. The main complaint with the four-cylinder <b>engines</b> was their <b>roughness</b> - so rough that GM employees of the time called the engine [...] "little Toyota", in allusion to the diesel engine installed in the locally built Toyota Bandeirante.|$|R
40|$|RVCQ 3 D (Rotor Viscous Code Quasi- 3 -D) is a rapid {{computer}} code {{for analysis of}} inviscid or viscous blade-to-blade flows in turbomachinery. It accounts for the quasi-three-dimensional effects of rotation, radius change, and stream surface thickness variation. The code has been heavily used at NASA Glenn and in U.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to produce a stable diesel / water emulsion fuel and use it in a diesel engine under different operating and design conditions. The use of advanced mixing technique and emulsifying agent enabled the production of stable emulsion of up to 30 % water in diesel for up to one week. In some of the water/diesel ratios, the emulsion was stable for about 4 weeks. The physical properties of the stable W/D emulsions in terms of density, surface tension, and viscosity were measured and investigated. The effect of surfactant concentration, mixing time and mixer speed has been studied. A computer image analyzer system was used to investigate the water droplets- fuel interaction and the water droplets distribution within the diesel phase. The stable emulsion has been used in an indirect injection Ricardo E 6 diesel engine and performance and <b>engine</b> <b>roughness</b> parameters have been measured. The engine was fully computerized and the cylinder pressure data, crank angle data and other performance data were stored in a PC for off-line analysis. The effect of water/diesel ratio, engine speeds, loads, fuel injection angle, and engine compression ratio on combustion maximum pressure, maximum pressure rise rate, brake power output and brake specific fuel consumption has been studied. The water/diesel emulsion was stable for long enough time for transportation and use. The addition of water in diesel generally affected the engine combustion noise, brake power output and specific fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|The {{travelling}} {{comfort of}} the driver and the passengers is an indicator that assesses {{the quality of the}} car. The travelling comfort is graded according to the rates of the general vibrations experienced by the driver and the passengers in the car while travelling. The sources of vibrations in the car are the operating internal combustion <b>engine</b> and the <b>roughness</b> of the roadway on which the vehicle is moving. Free non-subsiding and subsiding vibrations and forced vibrations of the car are examined with mathematical models. In this article a kinematic model of a car has been synthesized. The car is presented as a mechanical system composed of perfectly rigid bodies. The bodies are interconnected with holonomic constraints and elastic-damping elements. Equations of the angular velocities of the bodies of the mechanical system and of the linear velocity rates of the centres of gravity of these bodies have been derived...|$|R

40|$|Builders of {{passenger}} rail vehicles need methods for predicting vibrational behaviour {{so that they}} can meet ride quality specifications. Conventional finite-element (FE) models used for stress analysis may not be accurate enough for this because of imponderables such as the stiffness of spot-welded joints. One solution is to adjust FE models based on vibration measurements. This model updating is now possible using commercially available software. Usually, the updating is based on vibration tests carried out under laboratory conditions, which may produce different results from normal operation. In this paper, two simple FE models of a railcar are updated using vibration data obtained from a newly designed railcar under in-service conditions. Measurements were made on a railcar loaded to represent crush-loaded conditions and running down track, with the only excitation that naturally occurring due to track <b>roughness,</b> <b>engine</b> excitation, aerodynamic loading etc. Unlike standard laboratory vibration testing, this input excitation could not be measured, so advanced forms of output-only analysis were required. By using these data as input to a commercial updating package, the simple FE models have been updated and the effectiveness of the technique assessed...|$|R
