40|$|AbstractUnfortunately, a {{complete}} integration of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> aspects into industrial design practice of Energy-related Products (ErPs) {{has not yet}} been achieved. This is in part {{due to a lack of}} solutions (approaches, methods and IT tools) that support designers with rapid assessment of design options and checking their compliance with energy-related regulatory constraints. Particularly important for ErPs are limit-value constraints, which are defined by regulatory elements (laws, norms, labels, company-internal regulations, etc.) that directly specify measurable values and/or limits e. g. <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes.</b> The goal of this paper is to introduce a method that assists designers in rapidly and roughly performing energy assessments of mass-produced ErP design options and verifying their compliance with energy-related limit-value constraints. The introduced method is the result of the integration of a self-developed approach for compliance checking into a previously developed methodical approach for rough energy assessment. The introduced method has been validated by a case study of two washing machine design options. The long-term goal is to develop method-specific IT support. The requirements for such a support have been considered from the outset...|$|R

The algorithms are applied to solve quantum kinetic integral equations describing ultra-fast transport in quantum wire.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the improvement in}} the performance of a domestic hybrid refrigerator that combines vapour compression technology for the cooler and freezer compartments, and thermoelectric technology for a new compartment. The heat emitted by the Peltier modules is discharged into the freezer compartment, forming a cascade refrigeration system.

Thus, the electric power consumption of the modules and the refrigerator decrease by 95 % and 20 % respectively, with respect to those attained with a cascade refrigeration system connected with the cooler compartment. The optimization process is based on a computational model that simulates the behaviour of the whole refrigerator. Two prototypes have been built and tested.

While smart HPA design can alleviate much of this process there is an intrinsic problem which depends on the form how the HPA is operated: high fluctuations of the input signal--typically quantified by means of the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)--enforce operating points typically well below an acceptable efficiency region.

40|$|In a seismic territory, {{one of the}} {{concerns}} of the public administrators is to guarantee people safety in case of earthquake, mainly in public facilities and in particular in school buildings. Public administrations are facing a complex problem and they need to know the level of risk and the criticalities, together with the required countermeasures and their costs, in order to define a rational and effective strategy for the mitigation of seismic risk, and consequently better allocate the resources (money and time). This problem was addressed in the ASSESS (Analysis of the Seismic ScEnarios of the School buildings for a definition of retrofitting priorities for Seismic risk reduction) project, aimed at knowing for preventive purposes the seismic risk of about 1000 school buildings of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region (north-eastern Italy). During the project, the evaluation of people safety was approached with holistic and interdisciplinary methodologies, and with multi-level studies (Figure 1). In particular, geological and geophysical studies together with vulnerability evaluations were carried out in correspondence of the school buildings. For each school a geological-technical map was developed, on which the geomorphological and hydrogeological features are represented, as these aspects can be considered potential seismic amplifiers. Furthermore, geophysical investigations were carried out in order to assess the velocity profiles to be used for evaluating the local amplification, through 1 D modelling. The vulnerability assessment was done in a different way based on the level of investigation: the first level was based on a statistical approach, while a specific methodology, named VISUS, has been applied in the second level: the method, developed during the project, is based on rapid visual screening that permits the identification of weakness or critical effects in the seismic behaviour. Moreover, the vulnerability related to non-structural elements and of the egress system is provided. The ASSESS project implied the definition of decision-making supports in the form of synthesis indicators (Figure 2). In particular, a performance structural class was assigned to each school building, based on the ratio between the capacity and the demand of the structure. The membership to each class is defined, graphically, in analogy to the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes.</b> Furthermore, globally considering safety, five main issues have been identified in order to take into account all the elements that can cause deaths or injuries: site, global structural, local structural, non-structural, and functional weaknesses. The results are synthesized within an “intervention requirement rose”, where the presence of one or more “petals” implies the presence of potential criticalities, while a rose without “petals” implies that the goal of “people safety” has been reached. The data in the “intervention requirement rose” are again synthesized in a single indicator: the “ASSESS safety star”, that provides a global seismic judgment of the school. Finally, it is important to remark that the decision-making support tools defined for public administrators permit to better address the resources for a more effective definition of a strategy aimed at seismic risk mitigation at a territorial scale...|$|R
