500|$|Beginning in 1981, Gibson's stories {{appeared}} in Omni and Universe 11, wherein his fiction developed a bleak, film noir feel.

Remembering the performance in Hull, folk singer Michael Chapman commented:The folkies did not take to him; [...] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point. He didn't say a word the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch.

He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result.

500|$|The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department {{arrived to}} free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, {{and a few others}} were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: [...] "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because {{everybody}} else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> wanted to kill." [...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." [...] His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, [...] "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously." ...|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} leave the role of Mavis in 1997, having played it for 26 years. It was {{reported}} that she had quit following the axing of Peter Baldwin, who played her screen husband Derek Wilton. At the time Coronation Street was undergoing off-screen changes following the introduction of a new executive producer, Brian Park, dubbed [...] "the axeman" [...] in the press after he culled many characters from the regular cast. The actress Jean Alexander, who played the character of Hilda Ogden in the serial, went to the press in protest at the news. She wrote: [...] "Peter Baldwin and Thelma Barlow were a wonderfully funny couple, but they've killed off Derek and now Mavis is about to leave. Even all the humour has been taken out of scenes between Mavis and Rita." [...] Park suggested that when he took over as head producer there was a general feeling among the programme-makers that [...] "Derek and Mavis had had their day". Barlow has stated her belief that the producers killed off Derek {{as a result of her}} own desire to leave. She said: [...] "It was sort of cruel, really; <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> could have killed Mavis off. It was a new director and a new producer, and they wanted to make a big news splash. It was very hard for Peter [...]" [...] The village of Cartmel, near Grange-over-Sands, enjoyed a boost in tourism attributed to the exposure given to it by Mavis's storyline.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start using my legs so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E

In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: [...] "I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because I knew exactly what I {{wanted to do with}} these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ...

2500|$|Widlar and Talbert were {{instrumental}} in the takeover of National Semiconductor by former Fairchild managers Charles Sporck and Pierre Lamond in February 1967. Sporck and Lamond turned National into a leading producer of electronic circuits, and Fairchild slipped into an irreversible decline. Widlar's popularity in the industry soared: advertised as [...] "the man who designed {{more than half of}} the world's linear circuits", he frequently gave lectures to fellow engineers, and on May 23, 1970, spoke to an audience at Madison Square Garden. Regis McKenna, former National Semiconductor executive, said in 1995 that [...] "most of the linear devices that were probably built and marketed for the period of the sixties and seventies were based on Widlar and Talbert's technology. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> created, in many ways, this industry... they were the Steve Jobs and the Bill Gates, and whatever fame you want to give to anybody, they were famous people of those days.

2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's {{inspiration}} {{to direct the}} film came from the controversial lives of Edward and Simpson. She recalled from her experience that if she brought up King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson {{at a dinner party}} or a social gathering, [...] "it's like throwing a Molotov cocktail into the room. Everyone erupts into an argument about who they were. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> were very controversial– and continue to be. So, of course, I'm very attracted to that." [...] She investigated the history behind the abdication and tried to understand what led Edward to leave his royal throne. The singer spent two years researching the life of Simpson and writing the script. She wallpapered an empty room in her house with pictures from auction catalogues and photographs of the Duke and Duchess throughout their lives. [...] "I was sitting in a room that was completely and utterly inundated with their images so I could soak up their energy. I was trying {{to understand the nature of}} their love story and trying to figure out for myself if there is such a thing as perfect love," [...] she said. However, not interested in making a biopic about Simpson, Madonna created the modern-day story about the character Wally Winthrop, so that she could have a point of view in which to tell the narrative. She explained later: [...] "We can all read the same history book and have a different point of view. So it was important for me to not present the story and say, 'This is the one and only story,' but to say, 'This story moved me and inspired me.' That's how the two love stories were created." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2007 it {{had been}} {{announced}} Sebastian would be recording a tribute album of soul classics in Memphis, Tennessee with Stax musicians who played on and wrote some of the original songs. The album was recorded at Ardent Studios, Memphis in August 2007, with Steve Cropper, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, and Steve Potts (a.k.a. The MGs), with Lester Snell on keyboards. Cropper also co-produced the album with Sebastian, which was recorded on analogue tape live in the studio. Sebastian wrote about his time in Memphis {{in a series of}} blogs for Australian newspapers, [...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> are mostly in their late 60s and have such a wealth of experience." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "This kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off. [...] he just took us by storm." [...] Shortly after Sebastian's return to Australia it was announced that The MGs would tour Australia with him in early 2008. The Memphis Album debuted at number three in November 2007, and was the seventh highest selling Australian artist album of the year. The critically acclaimed album reached double platinum certification in 2008. The Memphis Flyer, a weekly alternative newspaper serving the Memphis area wrote a series of articles about Sebastian recording with The MGs. AllMemphisMusic, which specialises in playing music originating from Memphis, began playing The Memphis Album songs in late December 2007. They also had two special programs featuring songs from the album and interviews with some of the people involved in recording it.|$|E

Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election.

[...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} 6 premiere, it is {{discovered}} that the person whom Lucas called is Peyton. She goes {{to the airport and}} they hop on a plane to Vegas to get married. Once they get there, the chapel is too trashy, and so they do not get married. Instead, they drive to L.A. and Lucas proposes to her in the same hotel room he did years before. The two are still in L.A. during Brooke's attack. After Brooke calls Peyton and sounds weird, Lucas and Peyton decide to head back to Tree Hill and have the wedding there instead. Peyton sees that Brooke is beaten up, but Brooke lies and says she fell down the stairs, and Peyton believes her, not knowing that Brooke was attacked. Peyton meets a famous musician named Mick Wolf, who used to know Ellie. He is the one who asked Mia about Peyton during the tour. He keeps dodging around the subject of Peyton's real father, but says a little more about him each time Peyton brings him up. Peyton continues to get to know Mick and continues to ask about her real father. When she asks him why her parents gave her up and, he replies, [...] "We... <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they,</b> had a tough decision." [...] Mick accidentally lets the truth slip out, and suddenly Peyton realizes this is her father. She invites him over for a nice dinner together, he instead goes and gets drunk at a bar after being sober for a year (as shown by a sobriety chip in his pocket). She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book. Peyton closes herself off emotionally with regard to Mick and is angry with him for not being upfront with her about who he is. She tells him to leave. Not long afterward, during a visit to Brooke's, Brooke tells Peyton the truth about how she got all the bruises on her body. Peyton is later seen on the phone with Larry, her adoptive father. She tells him how much she loves him. Though initially concerned about moving in together, Lucas and Peyton eventually decide to accept their differences and reside in the same house. Peyton reconnects with her biological brother Derek, who has returned from the war. Later, she goes to TRIC to meet up with Lucas and a guy named Julian, who is interested in making a movie out based on Lucas's first novel. Julian was asking Lucas {{a lot of questions about}} Peyton before she got there. She runs into Julian near the bathroom, and it is soon revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. Three weeks go by and Peyton still has not told Lucas the truth about her romantic history with Julian. Lucas is left to discover their past on his own, and is initially angry about it. Peyton throws a USO concert in which Angels and Airwaves, Mia, and Haley play. She continues to connect with her brother, Derek, and clash with Julian over Lucas and his film.|$|E
