50|$|The Latécoère 550 had its {{tailplane}} {{mounted on}} top of the <b>fuselage,</b> <b>strut</b> braced from below and bearing twin inboard fins and rudders separately braced {{to the top of the}} fuselage. During flight trials, these vertical surfaces evolved in stages from a rather blunt shape, with extensions below the tailplane to a surface with a smoothly curved trailing edge entirely above the tailplane. The rudders were fitted with trim tabs. Because of the inboard rudders, the elevators had three sections.|$|E
50|$|The {{wing of the}} D.VI was of {{constant}} chord, with straight edges and square tips. It was mounted with slight sweep over the fuselage, parasol fashion, primarily braced {{by a pair of}} long parallel struts on each side from the lower fuselage to points well out along the wings. It was supported centrally on two outward leaning pairs of short parallel cabane struts from the upper fuselage. Unusually the space between each main strut pair was faired-in with a lift-providing aerofoil, supplementing the wing. These surfaces extended from the lower <b>fuselage</b> <b>strut</b> junction {{to the level of the}} cockpit and upper fuselage, the rest of the struts being normally exposed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, with a curved decking {{over most of}} its length, though the upper engine cowling followed around each cylinder bank of the [...] Lorraine-Dietrich 12Db upright V-12 engine. This was water cooled, with Lamblin cylindrical radiators under the wings and between the V-struts on which the rigid axle and wheels of the tailskid undercarriage were mounted. The two cockpits were arranged in tandem, with the pilot under a cut-out in the upper wing trailing edge for better vision; the gunner was equipped with twin Lewis guns on a rotatable, Scarff type mounting. The fin was broad and slightly curved, with a balanced rudder merging smoothly into it; the tailplane was mounted {{on the top of}} the <b>fuselage,</b> <b>strut</b> braced from below and carrying balanced elevators.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} as a single-engined, mid-wing cantilever monoplane, powered by an 880 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Y twelve-cylinder liquid-cooled engine. Two exceptionally large floats were attached to the <b>fuselage</b> by <b>struts,</b> each one containing a fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|All metal with fabric covering, the G.4/31 {{was a large}} single-engined single-bay biplane, with unswept, unequal-span {{wings of}} marked stagger. Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slots; both wings were cut back to the rear spar at the centre section for visibility. A pair of struts braced the two lower wing spars to the upper fuselage, from where another pair braced the upper rear spars; a {{separate}} pair of struts linked the forward spars of the upper wings to the forward fuselage. There was a split axle undercarriage, necessary for torpedo launching, with its main legs connected to the front spar below the <b>fuselage</b> <b>struts</b> and braced for and aft to the lower fuselage. Main wheel brakes were fitted.|$|R

Performance proved disappointing, and only six trial models were built.|$|R
50|$|The FVL-8 was {{constructed}} of a wood framework, {{and covered in}} plywood. The wings were separated from the <b>fuselage</b> by <b>struts.</b> It was powered by a Liberty 8 engine, and armed by two machine guns. Six prototypes were constructed, the first had its first flight in February 1919. No order for production aircraft was received.|$|R

50|$|The Prawn had {{a single}} step {{all-metal}} hull with conventional empennage. The fin had a rounded leading edge and was quite tall, carrying an unbalanced rudder. The tailplane was squarer and mounted just above {{the top of the}} <b>fuselage,</b> <b>struts</b> braced to the fuselage below and wire braced to the fin above. The aircraft was powered with a 65 hp (48 kW) water-cooled Ricardo-Burt engine, driving a four-bladed propeller with a diameter of only about 4 ft 6 in (1.35 m). Fuel was gravity-fed from a prominent tank on top of the wing centre section. The inline engine was contained in a slender, slightly pointed cowling of its own, and hinged at the rear. A bulky, largely rectangular radiator sat on top of the engine cowling, rather spoiling the otherwise neatly streamlined installation that resulted when the engine was in its in-flight position. At take-off, it could be raised through as much as 22° to clear the water.|$|R
50|$|It was {{a single}} bay sesquiplane. Like most Villiers aircraft, the wingplans were {{strictly}} rectangular in plan apart from a shallow cut-out over the forward cockpit; the upper wings had three times {{the area of the}} lower. They were built around spruce box spars, fabric covered and braced together by an outward and forward leaning interplane strut on each side. The lower wings were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and braced to the upper longerons with single struts leaning inwards at about 45°. The upper wing was held over the fuselage by a fore and aft pair of W-form struts, one to each of its two spars. Wing folding was achieved with hinges on the rear longerons, immediately outside of the centre section to <b>fuselage</b> <b>struts.</b> There were full span ailerons, fitted only on the upper wing. A pair of upper wing hoisting points enabled the Villier IV to be lifted back on board its ship by a crane.|$|R
50|$|The low {{aspect ratio}} wings were {{parallel}} edged and almost square tipped, with the thin airfoil section {{typical of the}} time. They were built around two spars, each a spruce-ash-spruce sandwich, and the profile was formed with mixed spruce and ash ribs. Both spars fitted into sockets formed by two transverse <b>fuselage</b> <b>struts,</b> but the rear socket was made oversize and the spar attached with a bolt and split pin to allow movement, as the Dyott was laterally controlled by wing warping. The main in-flight aerodynamic forces on each wing were carried by pairs of cables to the front spar from the forward skid mounting point, an arrangement that caused some concern over the transfer of landing loads to the wing. Each wing was braced from above with four wires, two to each spar, from an inverted V steel pylon {{just in front of}} the cockpit. A short vertical steel post below the rear of the cockpit carried pairs of wing warping wires to the rear spar.|$|R
50|$|The ANT-2's {{construction}} {{was done by}} TsAGI's AGOS division on floors one and three on 16 Radio Street. The design was a cantilever high-wing monoplane with a triangular cross-section, which proved useful because of the increased strength and rigidity, which reduced the need for <b>fuselage</b> <b>struts</b> to keep the same shape, and added the aerodynamic benefit of avoiding vortex drag under the aft fuselage. The fuselage was divided into three sections: the first gave {{easy access to the}} engine for inspection, the second was an enclosed area for the two passengers, who faced each other- with an entrance through a door {{on the side of the}} fuselage, and the third, left vacant, was the tail elements. The passenger area was behind and below the cockpit, where the pilot was in an open canopy. Similar to contemporary Junkers designs, the aircraft skin was made of corrugated iron sheeting. The engine was a British Bristol Lucifer piston engine with 100 HP.|$|R
50|$|The RL.12 had fixed, {{tailskid}} {{landing gear}} with a track of 2.30 m. Each faired mainwheel {{was on a}} V-strut bent to the horizontal near its apex and hinged on the lower fuselage; another strut, with a bungee cord shock-absorber mounted near the wheel, {{was attached to the}} upper <b>fuselage.</b> These <b>struts</b> were a mixture of dural and steel tubes, streamlined {{in the same way as}} the cabane struts.|$|R

50|$|The D.XVI had a fully {{cantilevered}} fabric covered {{parasol wing}} mounted above the fuselage {{on a pair}} of N-form struts from the lower <b>fuselage.</b> These <b>struts</b> were laterally stabilized with a near horizontal strut on each side, joining the upper fuselage and {{the upper end of the}} rear member of the N. In plan the wing was straight tapered with blunt tips and included a trailing edge cut-out to improve upward vision from the cockpit. The wing was quite thick and the ailerons short.|$|R
2500|$|The last {{attempt by}} the LPŻ ( [...] Liga Przyjaciół Żołnierza – Soldier's Friends League) {{paramilitary}} organization to design a single-seat training glider, after SZD-15 and SZD-16 designs, was the SZD-18 Czajka (peewit), which appeared in 1956. It had a simple structure, box <b>fuselage,</b> <b>strutted</b> high wing and low performance typical for the primary type of training glider. The [...] LPŻ held a competition in 1955 {{for the design of}} a new primary style single-seat trainer, which was won in March 1955 by the design by Tadeusz Grudzieński, named X-11. The prototype glider was constructed in the SZD in Bielsko by Władysław Okarmus, and designated SZD-18. Flight trials began on 30 November 1956 (pilot Adam Zientek) proving, that the SZD-18 had good handling qualities and performance adequate for its intended role. It was {{regarded as one of the}} best gliders in its class and the Polish best training glider. However, the aero clubs, now independent of the LPŻ, rejected the single-seat training concept, moving towards the more conventional two-seat pupil/instructor method, which had been proven to be quicker, more efficient and safer. No production was carried out and the sole prototype (SP-1640) flew as a club glider with the Warsaw aero club until 1966, when it was given to the Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków.|$|R

50|$|The 80 R.2 had a {{conventional}} fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. Its wheels were independently mounted, with axles at the vertices of V-struts hinged {{to the central}} lower <b>fuselage</b> and oleo <b>strut</b> shock absorbers from the axles to the upper fuselage. The wheels, 3.0 m apart, were fitted with brakes and fairings. Its tailwheel was steerable.|$|R
5000|$|The Do Komet III of 1924 was a {{practically}} all-new {{design that}} shared many elements with the Delphin III. The cabin was expanded to seat another two passengers, and the wing was raised above the <b>fuselage</b> on short <b>struts.</b> [...] This version was exported to Denmark and Sweden, {{but was also}} produced under licence in Japan by Kawasaki.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two main}} {{problems}} facing Parnall when given an Air Ministry contract to produce such an aircraft were to ensure that, {{so far as}} possible the behaviour of the wing was unaffected by interference with the flow over the fuselage or by prop wash, and to devise a way of measuring lift and drag forces whilst in flight. [...] They decided on a parasol wing design, since this would avoid complications like wing root interference, and made the wing mounting structure into a single unit with some freedom to deflect internally so that the force could be measured. [...] A typical parasol wing aircraft has lift struts from the lower fuselage to the wing plus some upper <b>fuselage</b> <b>struts</b> to support the wing near the centre line. The Parasol had two lift struts under each wing, with their lower ends joined within the fuselage to a horizontal rectangular frame. Two inverted V members were also attached to this frame, one at the front and one at the back, rising almost vertically {{to the front and}} rear wing spars. [...] The V-struts were hinged top and bottom, allowing the wing to move parallel to the horizontal frame under aerodynamic loads. The force was measured by a dynamometer ahead of the front cockpit, via a linkage which ran down and forward from the wing at an angle of about 22°, then turned back to the instrument via a crank.|$|R
50|$|The Chengdu X-7 is a two-seat basic {{training}} glider of glass-fibre construction, which first flew in October 1966. It is a high-winged monoplane with the wing braced to the pod-and-boom <b>fuselage</b> by single <b>struts.</b> The crew of two sit in tandem open cockpits, while the undercarriage is a non-retractable monowheel, with nose- and tailskids. 130 {{had been built}} by 1980.|$|R
50|$|In a {{practical}} landplane design, the lower set of wings are typically set approximately {{level with the}} underside of the aircraft's fuselage, the middle set level with the top of the fuselage, and the top set supported above the <b>fuselage</b> on cabane <b>struts.</b> In {{a practical}} flying boat, even the lowest wing must be placed well above the waterline of the hull, creating a tall structure overall.|$|R
50|$|The G-25 was {{probably}} Gribovsky's only biplane design, aimed {{to compete with}} the Polikarpov U-2 as a basic trainer. Its economic construction was partly based on its use of a Western engine originally designed for automobiles. It was a single bay biplane with large forward stagger. The lower wing was mounted on the lower fuselage longerons with N-form interplane struts between it and the upper wing, which was supported over the <b>fuselage</b> on cabane <b>struts.</b>|$|R
25|$|It was a {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} of fabric-covered all-metal construction. Its slightly swept back wing {{was attached to}} the <b>fuselage</b> by bracing <b>struts,</b> and its two floats were braced to both the wing and fuselage. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine driving a three-bladed propeller, and could carry a single torpedo or bombs under the fuselage. Defensive armament was one fixed forward-firing machine gun, also two in the rear cockpit and one in a ventral tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The E-767's {{exterior}} {{is usually}} painted in gray. The 767's windows were omitted {{in order to}} protect the crew and equipment from the intense radio frequency transmissions from its radar equipment.. A rotodome about 30 feet (9.14 m) in diameter and six feet (1.83 m) thick at the center is mounted above the aft <b>fuselage</b> on two <b>struts.</b> The rotodome rotates at about six rpm during operations and at 0.25 rpm to lubricate the rotation mechanisms even when the radar is not used.|$|R
