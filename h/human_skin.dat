5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate <b>human</b> <b>skin.</b> This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong enough to break <b>human</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of <b>human</b> <b>skin.</b> Beta radiation can penetrate <b>human</b> <b>skin,</b> but cannot go {{all the way through the}} body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.|$|E

5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to <b>human</b> <b>skin</b> and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed <b>human</b> <b>skin</b> nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens <b>human</b> <b>skin</b> is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E

5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate <b>human</b> <b>skin.</b> As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E

5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through <b>human</b> <b>skin.</b> The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fetal skin wounds heal without scarring. To {{determine}} {{the role of}} TGF-beta 1 in fetal wound healing, mRNA expression of TGF-beta 1 was analyzed in human fetal and adult <b>skin</b> wounds. METHODS: <b>Human</b> fetal <b>skin</b> transplanted to a subcutaneous location on an adult athymic mouse that was subsequently wounded heals without scar, whereas <b>human</b> adult <b>skin</b> heals with scar formation in that location. In situ hybridization for TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression and species-specific immunohistochemistry for fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils were performed in human adult wounds, fetal wounds, and fetal wounds treated with a TGF-beta 1 slow release disk. RESULTS: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA expression was induced by wounding adult skin. No TGF-beta 1 mRNA upregulation was detected in <b>human</b> fetal <b>skin</b> after wounding. However, when exogenous TGF-beta 1 was added to <b>human</b> fetal <b>skin,</b> induction of TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression in human fetal fibroblasts occurred, an adult-like inflammatory response was detected, and the skin healed with scar formation. CONCLUSIONS: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 is an important modulator in scar formation. Anti-TGF-beta 1 strategies may promote scarless healing in adult wounds...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe found, by an in situ {{hybridization}} method with riboprobes synthesized {{from human}} cDNA of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), that the RAR genes (predominantly γ-subtype) are intensively expressed in the epidermis of normal and psoriasic <b>human</b> <b>skins,</b> and also in keratinizing fronts of 4 -day-old mouse skins, nail matrices and hair follicles. Thus, target cells of retinoic acid in the skins are concluded to be keratinocytes, which is quite consistent {{with the fact that}} retinoic acid regulates keratinization of epidermis in vivo and also modulates expression of the keratin gene in vitro...|$|R

40|$|Background Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis. Dysregulated Aurora-A leads to mitotic faults and results in pathological conditions. No studies on Aurora-A expression in <b>human</b> diabetic <b>skin</b> tissue have been reported. In light of this, we explored the expression of Aurora-A in <b>human</b> diabetic <b>skin</b> tissue. Methods Aurora-A protein was evaluated by western blotting in 6 <b>human</b> diabetic <b>skin</b> tissue and 6 normal skin specimens. Results Increased expression of Aurora-A protein was detected in all diabetic skin tissue samples in both western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. However, in the case of the normal skin tissue, no bands of Aurora-A protein were detected in either the western blotting analysis or the immunohistochemical staining. Conclusions Thus far, there have been no studies on the expression of Aurora-A in diabetic skin tissue. However, we believe that oxidative DNA damage related to the expression of Aurora-A protein and Aurora-A could be involved inhuman diabetic skin tissue...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{most common}} {{radiation}} sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation, but {{large amounts of}} alpha particles which do not penetrate even {{a sheet of paper}} or the epidermis of <b>human</b> <b>skin,</b> and is therefore invisible to normal radiation detectors. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation which can cause radiation damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon. Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.|$|E
5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, {{particularly in the}} field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned clumps of <b>human</b> <b>skin</b> into blood cells, which may help alleviate the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank.
