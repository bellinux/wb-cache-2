500|$|During his youth, Starr {{had been}} a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, {{but by the time}} he joined the Texans in 1958, he had {{developed}} a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: [...] "He <b>does</b> <b>things</b> with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?'

Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works.|$|E

Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome.
