During the Second World War, the knife's name was bestowed on the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers; the knife also appeared on the division's emblem.|$|E

The capoeirista was 190cm tall and weighed 100kg. Maeda won the match quickly. In 1921, Maeda founded his first judo academy in Brazil.

25|$|He {{then set}} before them the {{advantage}} which the moment presented {{for an attack}} upon Fort Caroline, with its defenses weakened {{by the absence of}} Ribault who might have taken the best part of its garrison with him, and Ribault's inability to return against the contrary wind, which in his judgment would continue for some days. His plan was to reach the fort through the forest and to attack it. If his approach was discovered, he proposed, on reaching the margin of the woods which surrounded the open meadow where it stood, to display the banners {{in such a way as}} to lead the French to believe that his force was two thousand strong. A trumpeter should then be sent to summon them to surrender, in which case the garrison should be sent back to France, and, if they did not, put to the <b>knife.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event of failure the Spaniards would have become acquainted with the way, and could await at St. Augustine the arrival of reinforcements in March.

Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum, who gave the film an A-, described it as [...] "one of the best American cop movies I've {{seen in a long}} time [...] also one of the few I've seen that pay serious attention to what cop life feels like, both on and off duty". In a review for The Globe and Mail, however, Rick Groen opined that the focus on [...] "saintly" [...] police officers was less interesting than Ayer's [...] "trademark grit and authenticity".|$|E
500|$|Emerson {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} other companies on knife-related projects as his own company grew. In some cases these collaborators had become his competition, such as Gerber Knives. In 2002 Emerson collaborated with Gerber Knives to create both companies' first automatic opening knife, the Gerber-Emerson Alliance. In that same year, Emerson collaborated with SureFire Flashlights by making an exclusive CQC-8 (Banana Knife) numbered and marked with the SureFire logo and sold with an identically numbered Emerson-marked Centurion C2 CombatLight. In 2005 Emerson collaborated with Andy Prisco, the CEO of the American Tomahawk Company, to produce the CQC-T Tomahawk. This tomahawk features a curved head machined from 4140 steel with a rear spike and a lightweight fiberglass handle. Although not made by Emerson, the tomahawk was designed by him. In 2007, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom knifemaker and knife thrower Bobby Branton. The collaboration piece is a fixed-blade knife designed primarily for knife throwing dubbed the BETT: Branton-Emerson Tactical Thrower.

500|$|William Walton's Troilus and Cressida is {{the best}} known and most {{successful}} of a clutch of 20th-century operas on the subject after the composers of previous eras had ignored the possibility of setting the story. Christopher Hassall's libretto blends elements of Chaucer and Shakespeare with inventions of its own arising from a wish to tighten and compress the plot, the desire to portray Cressida more sympathetically {{and the search for}} a satisfactory ending. [...] Antenor is, as usual, exchanged for Cressida but, in this version of the tale, his capture has taken place while he was on a mission for Troilus. Cressida agrees to marry Diomedes after she has not heard from Troilus. His apparent silence, however, is because his letters to her have been intercepted. Troilus arrives at the Greek camp just before the planned wedding. When faced with her two lovers, Cressida chooses Troilus. He is then killed by Calchas with a <b>knife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back. Diomedes sends his body back to Priam with Calchas in chains. It is now the Greeks who condemn [...] "false Cressida" [...] and seek to keep her but she commits suicide.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{highlighted}} Haunting Grounds sexual themes {{surrounding the}} objectification of Fiona {{as one of}} its best elements. Jeremy Dunham of IGN stated that [...] "Haunting Grounds success comes from making the player feel like a desired and endangered object." [...] He found the plot was kept interesting due to the disturbing suggestive behaviors of Fiona's pursuers. Kill Screen's Budgor also found the drive for the enemies to kill Fiona creates a continuous tension, as its unclear nature lends to an uncomfortable confusion for both Fiona and the player. GameSetWatch's Leigh Alexander stated that [...] "disparaging Haunting Ground for its copious objectification of women is a facile task...it’s precisely that off-putting sexuality that makes Daniela terrifying, that makes Fiona’s circumstances so explicitly repugnant, that sharpens Haunting Ground’s fear factor to a <b>knife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gut." [...] Alexander praised the game's voyeuristic themes and presenting of Fiona as [...] "an object of desire." [...] She notes that [...] "Fiona is both a sex object and a victim...a fragile little woman...both male and female players can distinctly feel the threat to her person, the disconcerting wickedness of her enemies, thanks to her overt sexualization throughout the game." [...] Budgor found that removing the player's control at critical points highlights Fiona's subjectivity, with the sounds and images expressing ideas of [...] "violation, transgression, and bodily autonomy." [...] Alexander ultimately felt Haunting Ground to be a [...] "perfect illustration of how sexuality can be used to great effect." ...|$|E

I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked.

5|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill <b>knives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below).
