On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast {{game between the}} Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match.

25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures {{of one sort or}} another, the Menasco engines being the primary source of those problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening</b> on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In an {{alternate}} timeline {{referred to as}} Flashpoint, Artemis is the personal bodyguard for Hippolyta's sister Penthesileia. Penthesileia is upset by the upcoming wedding between Wonder Woman and Aquaman. She conspires with Aquaman's brother Ocean Master to stop <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b> Penthesileia orders Artemis to disguise herself in Garth's armor in order to murder Wonder Woman on the wedding day. Hippolyta however stops the assassination from happening by blocking the attack. This ultimately kills Hippolyta in the process. Artemis is caught by Garth wearing his armor. She quickly defeats him and uses his unconscious body to frame him for the murder. Aquaman and the Atlanteans then visit Themyscira to negotiate for peace, while Artemis has bombs dropped on Themyscira. Later, Artemis joins the Amazons in conquering the United Kingdom, renaming it New Themyscira. During this same period, Artemis attempts to kill the resistance movement member Lois Lane. Although, Lois is rescued by Resistance member Britannia using the smoke grenades to escape, Britannia is seriously wounded by Artemis. Later, when Artemis and the Furies battle the Resistance, Artemis follows Lois and Britannia in Westminster's lair. She hits Britannia {{in the back with}} an arrow. When Lois prevents her attack, Artemis grabs her and attempts to kill her, but Britannia is able to reach her armour and kills Artemis by flying through her body, tearing it in half and saving Lois.|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b> Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Borg costume Ryan wore {{during the}} second part of [...] "Scorpion" [...] took approximately {{two and a half hours}} to apply. When Ryan was first measured for the outfit, the costume designers failed to take into account the full head prosthetic required for the first and second episodes of the season. Because of this error in measurement, the costume cut off Ryan's carotid artery, causing her to pass out. After a nurse was called twice to supply oxygen, the costume was modified to prevent <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening</b> again.|$|E
500|$|African-American {{literature}} scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's {{depiction of}} the rape [...] "a burden" [...] of Caged Bird: a demonstration of [...] "the {{manner in which the}} Black female is violated in her tender years and... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, [...] "I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody." [...] When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. [...] She also wanted to prevent <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening</b> to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} of the movie is {{discussed}} in the film's fourth scene. Witwer discusses the PreCrime system with the division's staff. He believes that its main [...] "legalistic drawback" [...] is that it [...] "arrests individuals who have broken no laws." [...] Jad responds, [...] "But they will!" [...] When Anderton later arrives upon this discussion, he acknowledges the paradox Witwer raises; that the precogs' prevent an event accepted as fact, but one which will never happen. To show him that people regularly use predetermination, Anderton picks up a wooden ball and rolls it toward Witwer, who catches it before it lands on the ground. When asked why he caught the ball, Witwer says [...] "Because {{it was going to}} fall." [...] Anderton replies, [...] "But it didn't." [...] Then confidently tells him, [...] "The fact that you prevented <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening</b> doesn't change {{the fact that it was}} going to happen." [...] Kowalski feels this example is faulty in the sense that the ball has no free will; it merely acts according to the laws of physics, but he acknowledges that if an individual were to have freely chosen to commit murder, then it would hold. Film scholar Stephen Mulhall points out that unlike the laws of physics which have a series of scientifically testable causal laws, Anderton merely has the visions of the precogs', whose psychic abilities are not fully explained by science.|$|E

500|$|Bruce Campbell, {{a long-time}} {{colleague}} of director Sam Raimi, has a cameo as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in. Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, {{who worked on}} the storyboards for the cancelled Spider-Man 4 movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio. Ted Raimi, Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant [...] "Hoffman". Sam Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Peter as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, in which he asks Peter, [...] "Hey kid, would you like a pair of these glasses? They're the kind they wore in X-Men." [...] The scene was cut, and Lee only briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin in Times Square. R/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself. One of the stunt performers in the film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen. Robert Kerman, best known for his performances in pornographic and exploitation films, has a bit part as a tugboat captain. Lucy Lawless makes a cameo as a punk rock girl. It was also intended for Hugh Jackman to make an appearance in the film as Logan / Wolverine, reprising the role from 2000's X-Men, but a dispute between Sony and 20th Century Fox over the characters' film rights prevented <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b> The novelization of Spider-Man identifies Liz Allan as the character portrayed by Sally Livingstone.|$|E
500|$|The album debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200, {{becoming}} Usher's first number-one album. Confessions also hit number-one on the Canadian Albums Chart and the US Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. Its early, and successive, progress on the chart was said to be partly sustained by its strong single releases and plenty of press appearances and promotions. With [...] "Yeah!" [...] propelling the album's debut atop the chart, [...] "Burn", the second single off the album, facilitated Confessionss continuing dominance as well. The first two released singles were competing on the Billboard Hot 100; the latter ended the twelve-week number-one chart run of the former. As the album's third single, [...] "Confessions Part II", was about to top the chart and Usher to join with English pop and rock group The Beatles as the only acts to achieve three consecutive number-one singles, American R singer Fantasia Barrino's debut single [...] "I Believe" [...] prevented <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b> Despite this, Usher became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay with three consecutive number-one singles. [...] "Burn" [...] achieved only eight non-consecutive weeks on the Hot 100 after [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] topped the chart; it became Usher's second time to replace his own single at the top. [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn" [...] were 2004's top best-selling singles in the United States, placing at number one and two respectively on the Billboard Chart Year-Ender.

2500|$|Her initial costume {{as seen in}} [...] "Scorpion" [...] and the {{following}} episode, [...] "", saw Seven of Nine as a full Borg.

2500|$|After {{an adverse}} event occurs, each country {{has its own}} {{way of dealing with}} the incident. In Canada, a quality {{improvement}} review is primarily used.

The individual provinces and territories have laws on whether it is required to disclose the quality improvement review to the patient. Healthcare providers have an obligation to disclose any adverse event to their patients because of ethical and professional guidelines.
