Due to the insufficient length of the statistical series, five such variants were adopted: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. As a principal <b>guiding</b> <b>mark,</b> the p-value for the tested null hypothesis was retained, computed for the sample data (normal probability) and for their random repetitions (bootstrap probability). Recent software provided both probabilities (normal and bootstrap) for three options related to the distance used for testing: the fraction of pairs, the standard deviations, and the fraction of range. Therefore, 30 p-values were computed for each technical coefficient, resulting in five dimensions, two tested series (original and bootstrap), and three distances.|$|E

40|$|I {{have often}} been puzzled about the {{remarkable}} change of colour in the roedeer, a species that I can watch almost daily from my house. In the winter the greyish brown coat can hardly be distinguished against the dull, brownish shrubby wood, at the border of which they come to feed. The only visible part of the animal is the white patch on their hindquarters. It is known that this patch is a <b>guiding</b> <b>mark</b> for the young to follow their mother. Some years ago a roedeer calf followed a boy on a bicycle with a white mudguard even to the boy's house. We may take it that also adults follow the leader by this mark. In the summer, on the contrary, the bright reddish coat makes the roedeer very conspicuous against the bright green background. I know how dangerous it is to speculate {{on the meaning of}} colour in animals, and I agree that in many cases no explanation is possible as the colour, so striking for the human eye, may have no significance for the animal and its environment. However, I dare to suggest a hypothetical explanation of what use the red colour can be to the roedeer, and to many other deer too. Roedeer have no enemies in western Europe, with the exception of dogs and men (especially when driving motorcars!), but formerly here and still in other parts of Europe and Asia lynx and wolf are their predators. Now it is known that Carnivora as well as most other mammals, {{with the exception of the}} Primates, are more or less colour blind and hence that for them a bright red object on a bright green background will be much less conspicuous than a dark brown on a bright background. The white patches on the hindquarters of the roedeer are somewhat less developed in the summer coat, but still conspicuous and as we may take it that the deer to...|$|E
