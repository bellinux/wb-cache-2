5|$|Aarhus {{has three}} major men's {{professional}} sports teams: the Superliga team Aarhus Gymnastik Forening (AGF), Danish Handball League's Aarhus GF Håndbold, and Danish Basketball League's Bakken Bears. Notable or historic clubs include Aarhus 1900, Idrætsklubben Skovbakken and Aarhus Sejlklub. NRGi Park has hosted matches in the premiere Danish soccer league {{since it was}} formed in 1920 and matches for the national men's soccer team in 2006 and 2007. The five sailing clubs routinely win national and international titles {{in a range of}} disciplines and the future national watersports stadium will be located on the Aarhus Docklands in the city centre. The Bakken Bears <b>have</b> <b>most</b> recently won the Danish basketball championships in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, The Fairchild Family was {{renowned for its}} {{realistic}} portrayal of childhood and its humor, but Sherwood's book fell from favor as Britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children's literature came to dominate the literary scene, represented by works such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the twentieth century the books <b>have</b> <b>most</b> often been viewed as quintessential examples of the didactic style of children's writing popular before Alice.|$|E
5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae {{because of the}} presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should actually be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesize that monothecate anthers <b>have</b> <b>most</b> likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E

5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} <b>have</b> <b>most</b> of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as}} a model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with kissing {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of kissing and premastication <b>have</b> <b>most</b> likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was {{to retrieve it}} using a space shuttle. Hubble would then <b>have</b> <b>most</b> likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E

5|$|The {{boundaries}} of most counties in Arizona {{do not follow}} the northern boundary of the Gadsden Purchase, but six counties in Arizona do <b>have</b> <b>most</b> of their populations within {{the land of the}} Gadsden Purchase. Four of these also contain areas north of the Gadsden Purchase, but these areas do have low population densities, with the exception of northeastern Pinal County, Arizona, including the towns of Apache Junction and Florence. Maricopa County also extends south into the area of the Gadsden Purchase, but this area is also thinly populated. Tucson is the largest city in the Gadsden Purchase.|$|E
5|$|The two subcommunities of MG5, characterised by species rich {{grassland}} form a belt {{across the}} site, {{but they do}} not cover the whole site. Towards the north there is a community dominated by False oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), a constant species in the MG1 and MG2 communities of the British NVC and therefore not typical of an MG5 community. At Whitton Bridge Pasture it is growing on alluvial soils located at the northern edge of the site, which <b>have</b> <b>most</b> likely been formed by Whitton Beck just to the north. A number of springs at the site are associated with flushes of the Pale sedge (Carex pallescens), which form small populations.|$|E

5|$|West's outspoken {{views and}} life outside of music have {{received}} significant mainstream attention.

His more scrutinized comments include his off-script denunciation of President George W. Bush during a live 2005 television broadcast for Hurricane Katrina relief and his interruption of singer Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West's ventures as a fashion designer include collaborations with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and <b>have</b> <b>most</b> prominently resulted in the YEEZY collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013.

5|$|The SaGa Series 20th Anniversary Original Soundtrack -Premium Box- is a soundtrack album {{collection}} {{of music from}} every released SaGa game. The compilation features 515 tracks on 20 CDs with a total length of 19:02:45, and includes a DVD of developer interviews, a stand display showing an illustration painted by Tomomi Kobayashi, and materials to build a display box for the CDs. The set consists {{of all of the}} soundtrack albums from the SaGa series, with All Sounds of SaGa broken up into one disc per game, rather than the original two discs. The set was published on August 26, 2009 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the release of the first SaGa video game with the catalog numbers SQEX-10145~65. Patrick Gann described it as an excellent collection that was worth the purchase for anyone who wanted to own the entire set and did not already <b>have</b> <b>most</b> of the albums, though he noted that as it included multiple composers and styles the compilation box would not be justified for everyone who liked just some of the music of the SaGa series.|$|E

Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would <b>have</b> <b>most</b> likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E
