40|$|<b>Dimensional</b> <b>inspection</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{sections}} of industrial parts production process. Machine vision is a modern method to inspect produced parts. Using machine vision has some problems in measuring parts dimensions and also these solutions are expensive for small industries. In this paper, problems of visual <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspection</b> have been explained and some solutions have been proposed to improve these systems performance. To do this, a visual inspection system has been implemented to control production quality of a brass gear. This system is an accurate, repeatable, fast and cheap solution for small industries.

40|$|Non-contact sensors are {{becoming}} an increasingly popular tool {{for use in}} <b>dimensional</b> measurement, <b>inspection</b> and quality control. However, there exist a number of challenges {{associated with the use}} of these non-contact sensors in <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspection</b> systems. One important challenge is to understand the associated measurement errors and determine the objective accuracy of such an inspection system. This paper examines the effect of misalignment and scanning methodology on the measurement accuracy of a non-contact <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspection</b> system. It is important to understand this topic since the majority of optical sensor manufacturers do not supply information about the alignment between the optical line of sight and the mechanical interface of the sensor or measurement system. We prove the evidence of this measurement error through both experimental results and simulation. Finally, by using a constant standoff measurement method we succeeded to show that the majority of inherent misalignment error can be eliminated...|$|R

The criteria of comparison for these methods are discussed. Using synthetically generated images, various analysis methods are compared and conclusions for their use are drawn. Results of the comparison show that the selection of a method has to be done with regard to the noise level of the measurement.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the integration of}} vision and touch sensors in a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) controller used for <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspection</b> tasks. A real-time hierarchical control system is presented in which a vision system extracts positions of features on a part to be inspected, and then guides a touch probe to efficiently measure these features. The probe is tracked by the vision system as it scans surfaces so that it's motion can be visually servoed. Minimalist sensorderived representations, involving only task-specific information, are used in this process. Although the camera itself remains uncalibrated, a real-time calibration of very limited scope is performed each processing cycle to transform the task-specific image information into 3 -D information used as feedback to guide the probe. 1.
