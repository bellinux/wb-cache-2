50|$|In economics, price {{dispersion}} is variation in prices across sellers {{of the same}} item, holding fixed the item's characteristics. Price dispersion {{can be viewed as}} a measure of trading frictions (or, tautologically, as a violation of the law of one price). It is often attributed to consumer search costs or unmeasured attributes (such as the reputation) of the retailing outlets involved. There is a difference between {{price dispersion}} and price discrimination. The latter concept involves a single provider charging different prices to different customers for an <b>identical</b> <b>good.</b> Price dispersion, on the other hand, is best thought of as the outcome of many firms potentially charging different prices, where customers of one firm find it difficult to patronize (or are perhaps unaware of) other firms due to the existence of search costs.|$|E

40|$|The {{validity}} of purchasing power parity {{and the law}} of one price have been constantly questioned as it is usually assumed that, {{at least in the}} long-run, commodity prices are perfectly arbitraged.

In order to fulfill the purpose of the study, prices of identical products from H&M are analyzed. The main factors taken into consideration when investigating the nature of price deviations are: tariffs, productivity, trade volume of clothing and how well the producing company is established within the sampled countries. The findings of the regression analysis indicate that price disparities exist and the law of one price, as well as purchasing power parity, fail to hold even when <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> are compared...|$|R

Amongst {{the rhetoric}} {{in the media}} coverage of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is often forgotten that it is businesses not governments that, to a large extent, engage and drive world trade. It is businesses who identify opportunities in other regions and international trade is simply an aggregation of the fruits of those transactions on a national basis. For example, if a firm in Wellington sees an opportunity in Auckland, no one pays any attention. If the same firm sees an opportunity in another country to sell an <b>identical</b> <b>good</b> - politicians and other interested parties feel {{they have a right to}} comment on, become involved in, or even try to stop the transaction...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature by using newly released comprehensive transaction level data on all exports and imports to document facts about the amount of intra-good trade - the simultaneous export and import of <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> by one firm - in Germany. Combined data for trade transactions and for characteristics of a representative large sample of trading firms are then used to report differences between firms that export and import different goods only (inter-good traders) and firms that engage in the simultaneous export and import of <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> (intra-good traders). We find that the share of intra-good trade in total trade was some 17 percent in Germany in 2012. Intra-good trade matters. This share differs widely between broadly defined groups of goods and between industries. Controlling for detailed industry affiliation intra-good traders differ significantly from inter-good traders - they are larger, more human capital intensive, more productive, have a higher R&D intensity, and are more profitable. The data, however, are not rich enough to reveal the direction of causality between intra-good trade and firm performance and to investigate empirically the reasons why some firms engage in intra-good trade...|$|R

40|$|Absent Federal {{legislation}} or leadership on regulatory responses to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) -based climate problems, {{the states have}} sought, either {{on their own or}} through regional agreements, to restrict the amount of GHG released by the electric power plants within their states. These systems are subject to “leakage,” the ability of power providers to receive electricity from an “extra-regional” and hence unregulated source. While practical considerations may limit the immediate impact of leakage, in the long term, state-based systems perversely provide competitive advantages to unrestricted GHG-emitting power sources that do not have the burden of compliance. One logical avenue to address leakage would be to directly or indirectly ban or penalize the purchase of power from other sources. Prohibiting these solutions is the combination of the Supreme Court’s dormant commerce clause analyses that prevents states from discriminating against <b>identical</b> <b>goods</b> based on origin. Most relevant and troubling is the West-Lynn Creamery case, which shows the Court’s willingness to find unconstitutional purpose among several disparate statutory schemes if, in combination, their effect is to penalize an out-of-state supplier of <b>identical</b> <b>goods.</b> This Article reviews this line of reasoning and posits that this limitation is the ultimate rationale for a Federal response to GHG-based climate legislation...|$|R

40|$|The factor {{structure}} of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in Euro-American populations has been extensively studied, but confirmatory factor analytic studies from non-Western societies are lacking. Alternative models of DSM-IV symptoms were tested among Rwandan adults (N= 465) who experienced trauma during the 1994 genocide. A cluster random survey was conducted with interviews held in Rwandan households. PTSD was assessed with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian version.

40|$|Pricing-to-market (PTM), the {{practice}} of differentiating {{the price of a}} good across markets, is commonly attributed to differential distribution and border costs. In this paper we show that some of this price differentiation is sustained by manufacturers selling different versions of an otherwise <b>identical</b> <b>good</b> in different markets. We study price differences across countries in the European car market, using detailed pricing, taxation, and technical information on each car model. Relative car prices show no sign of convergence during the period 2003 – 2011. PTM is pervasive: model-specific real exchange rates for mechanically identical cars differ significantly from unity. They also vary significantly across countries and, within countries, across car manufacturers. We find strong evidence that car manufacturers price discriminate by manipulating the menu of included car options and features available in each country, e. g. by including air conditioning as a standard feature as opposed to pricing it separately. We find that such bundling decisions sustain cross-country price differences of 10 % and more...|$|E
