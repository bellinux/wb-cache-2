5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E

Kaplan was also helped by Champion Sparkplugs who let him use their dyno room to fine-tune and correct any design problems.|$|E
25|$|The hard hitting {{ability and}} match winning {{performances}} in the Zimbabwe series gained <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> attraction to include him to the Twenty20 International series against Sri Lanka in July 2015. But he showed poor performance in the 2-match series, where he got out in both matches below 10 runs. However, Pakistan won the two matches and won the series.|$|E

25|$|In 1954 Bonatti was {{assigned}} to the Alpine regiment and for four days each week he trained men to climb; for the other three he was allowed to head off into the mountains on his own. With all his achievements he had become an unavoidable selection for the Italian assault on K2, which would cause <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble.|$|E
25|$|In Nanterre, Cohn-Bendit was {{a leader}} in claims for more sexual freedom, with actions such as {{participating}} in the occupation of the girls' premises, interrupting the speech of a minister who was inaugurating a swimming pool in order to demand free access to the girls' dormitory. This contributed to attracting to <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> student supporters later {{to be called the}} '22 March Movement', a group characterised by a mixture of Marxist, sexual and anarchist ideology. In the autumn of 1967 rumours of his upcoming expulsion from the university led to a local students' strike, and his expulsion was cancelled. On 22 March 1968 students occupied the administrative offices, and the closing of the university on 2 May helped move the protests to downtown Paris.|$|E
25|$|Daei {{became the}} first Asian player to feature in a UEFA Champions League match. Yet at Bayern he found himself low in the pecking order. This coupled with the Iranian {{national}} team's scheduling, Daei had found very little time for playing. Daei was unhappy with his position in the club and {{decided to make a}} move to Hertha BSC before the end of his three-year contract, when Bayern won the championship title in the 1999 Bundesliga. He scored his first and second goal in the UEFA Champions League on 22 September 1999 in group stage match against Chelsea won by Hertha with 2–1. His famous match against Chelsea gained <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> recognition. Yet even at Hertha he was not a hugely important player, since he was only amongst one of the squad's many successful players, who were to fulfill Hertha's Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League dreams.|$|E

25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E
500|$|... "David Falk {{elected to}} take more {{guaranteed}} money and less revenue percentage", said (Nike Scout) Sonny Vaccaro. [...] "So out of the chute he lost himself a lot of money. But in retrospect, it really amounted to nothing. It wasn't a big-time bidding war. Probably the most determining thing was Adidas wasn't going to offer <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money. It {{was the first time}} that the athlete was going to share in the royalties of the shoe. That was the gamble." ...|$|E
500|$|On Inflikted, Max was the group's {{songwriter}} and lyricist. At {{the time}} of the album recording, he was watching the same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different, and it gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ideas. He said, [...] "What came out of this album was more than enough to fill the void of not working together for so long. It's pretty intense. From the first moment, it's war." ...|$|E
50|$|Knight was a {{far more}} successful, and {{certainly}} regular, one-day player for England. In one-day cricket, this backing away in fact helped <b>him</b> score <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> runs and became something of a hallmark. This same strength/weakness was mirrored in Michael Bevan - one of Knight's contemporaries.|$|R

500|$|During Microsoft's early history, Gates was {{an active}} {{software}} developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role {{in most of the}} company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products. He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, [...] "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack." ...|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{has stated}} that the {{production}} of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to [...] "The Grinning Man", {{as well as his}} own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pleasure this time. He was directing {{for the first time and}} I think he really enjoyed it. So, we'll see." ...|$|E

Over the years, she worked as a nurse {{in addition to being a}} housewife. The latest time period in which Abigail has been shown is 1982, when she was still married to Henry but looked a generation older than him (Janet Zarish); in 1984, she vanished without a trace despite Henry's best efforts to find her. Henry has acknowledged that the end of his relationship with Abigail caused <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pain that prevents him from dating anyone for whom he has real feelings. In the episode [...] "The Night in Question", Henry learns from Adam that Abigail killed herself after a car crash to prevent Adam from finding Henry. [...] Abigail appears in ten episodes.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Kirkland was {{supposed}} to be the sole director for the episode, however, at the time, he was going through a divorce that he [...] "did not see coming". Because of this, Kirkland assigned his assistant director, Matthew Nastuk, to direct the episode in his stead. However, after having directed a scene, Nastuk claimed that he was [...] "terrified" [...] and wanted Kirkland to continue the direction. Kirkland returned to direct the episode, feeling better after getting over the divorce. Despite the circumstances, Kirkland stated that he [...] "loved" [...] working on the episode, and could relate to the story since he had grown up in a [...] "sort of hippie commune school" [...] in the late '60s and early '70s. Kirkland based a lot of the scenery designs in the episode on the state Vermont where, according to <b>him,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> [...] "ex-hippies" [...] live.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things {{that happened to me}} in the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge me for that. But he was right. It was like total therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{tries to}} {{convince}} Homer and Marge that college suits her, but {{they refuse to}} listen, saying that college {{is no place for}} her.

In the meantime, Bart gets used to his bubble, as it brings <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> popularity. Bart tells Lisa what she should do to get her friends back: she has to pull a prank on Principal Skinner. The next day, Chalmers is dedicating the Seymour Skinner parking annex. While Martin takes pictures of Skinner posing next to a giant chocolate cake in his dress polyester, Bart rolls Lisa (inside his bubble) {{to the edge of the}} school's roof. He then pushes her over the edge, splattering the cake all over Skinner. Lisa gets her friends back, while Bart goes paranoid after being outside of his bubble for the first time in days.

500|$|During {{the summer}} between {{his senior year}} of high school and his {{freshman}} year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as [...] "the happiest time in my life." [...] He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American. Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his {{senior year of high}} school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.|$|E
