5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of mental health in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> to send people with mental health issues to prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about the mental health of unemployed young people.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{longitudinal}} {{coordinate systems}} in use for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150°. The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on Hubble photos, {{with the prime}} meridian running {{through the center of}} Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200km across. When Dawn arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the Dawn team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.|$|E
25|$|Historical factors {{played a}} major role in shaping the Polish usage of honorifics. Poland’s history of nobility was the major source for Polish politeness, which {{explains}} how the honorific male-marked pronoun pan (pani is female-marked) was derived from the old word for “lord.” There are separate honorific pronouns used to address a priest (ksiądz), a nun or nurse (siostra). It is acceptable to replace siostra with pani when addressing a nurse, but it <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> when speaking to a nun. Likewise, it <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> to replace ksiądz with pan when speaking to a priest. The intimate T form is marked as neutral when used reciprocally between children, relatives, students, soldiers and young people.|$|E

25|$|The Hebrew Bible {{contains}} no examples of women married {{to more than}} one man, but its description of adultery clearly implies that polyandry <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> and the practice is unknown in Jewish tradition. In addition, the children from other than the first husband are considered illegitimate, unless he has already divorced her or died (i.e., a mamzer), being a product of an adulterous relationship.|$|E

5000|$|Theologian and Christian existentialist philosopher Paul Johannes Tillich (1886-1965), {{who sought}} to {{correlate}} culture and faith so that [...] "faith need not <b>be</b> <b>unacceptable</b> to contemporary culture and contemporary culture need not <b>be</b> <b>unacceptable</b> to faith", argued that revelation never runs counter to reason (affirming Thomas Aquinas who said that faith is eminently rational), and that both poles of the subjective human experience are complementary.|$|R
25|$|He {{says that}} these ideas may converge, {{but since they}} may as well not, it <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> to exclude any {{definitions}} only {{on the basis that}} they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful in their own way. Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by George Dickie and Arthur Danto.|$|E

25|$|Likewise Isenkrahe's {{violation}} of the energy conservation law <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable,</b> and Kelvin's application of Clausius' theorem leads (as noted by Kelvin himself) {{to some sort of}} perpetual motion mechanism. The suggestion of a secondary re-radiation mechanism for wave models attracted the interest of JJ Thomson, but was not taken very seriously by either Maxwell or Poincaré, because it entails a gross {{violation of}} the second law of thermodynamics (huge amounts of energy spontaneously being converted from a colder to a hotter form), {{which is one of the}} most solidly established of all physical laws.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1931 {{series of}} reports for which he {{received}} the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence, Duranty argued that the Russian people were [...] "Asiatic" [...] in thought: they valued communal effort and required autocratic government.

25|$|The Church {{stands by}} its doctrines on sexual {{intercourse}} {{as defined by}} the Natural law: intercourse must at once be both the renewal of the consummation of marriage and open to procreation. If each of these postulates are not met, the act of intercourse is, according to Natural Law, an objectively grave sin. Therefore, since artificial contraception expressly prevents {{the creation of a new}} life (and, the Church would argue, removes the sovereignty of God over all of Creation), contraception <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable.</b> The Church sees abstinence as the only objective moral strategy for preventing the transmission of HIV.|$|E
25|$|Entering somebody's {{personal}} space is normally {{an indication of}} familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, {{it can be difficult}} to maintain {{personal space}}, for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable, though it is accepted as a fact of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> physical contact.|$|E
25|$|Likewise H.D.’s {{revision}} {{of the story of}} Helen of Troy in Helen is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to the reader that the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way <b>is</b> <b>unacceptable</b> and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility of tradition and history paired with the obvious dependence on them.|$|E
