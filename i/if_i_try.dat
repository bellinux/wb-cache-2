2500|$|Welles would {{occasionally}} return to Woodstock, {{the place he}} eventually named {{when he was asked}} in a 1960 interview, [...] "Where is home?" [...] Welles replied, [...] "I suppose it's Woodstock, Illinois, if it's anywhere. I went to school there for four years. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to think of a home, it's that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a thing I {{shall never}} tell plainly; and perhaps <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> {{to tell you}} in riddles you will not care to guess them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] {{returned}} Charlie with a laugh, [...] "but {{they are}} earnest souls, and I'm sure will go <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to persuade them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Would it be well <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to {{help him}} to recover his idea? or would it be wiser (<b>if</b> <b>I</b> could only do it) to keep silence? ...|$|R
60|$|ZOZIM [impressed] You spoke {{that piece}} very well, Daddy. I couldnt {{talk like that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried.</b> It sounded fine. Ah! here comes the ladies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{it would}} please you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to {{straighten}} out things for him? It would be difficult, but I believe it could be accomplished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't it {{be better}} to wait until I'm here in the daylight? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to examine {{anything}} closely with these spectacles, they strain my eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you will}} fail to see any need of my {{speaking}} of my sister at all? Will you kindly listen, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to explain myself?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rip {{the veil}} of the old vision across, and walk through the rent. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to do this--well, why not? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to write down what I see--why not? If a {{publisher}} likes to print the book--all right. And if anybody wants to read it, let him. But why anybody should read one single word if he doesn't want to, I don't see. Unless of course he is a critic who needs to scribble a dollar's worth of words, no matter how.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know, Tom,' {{said his}} sister, blushing, 'I am not quite confident, but I think I {{could make a}} beef-steak pudding, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried,</b> Tom.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> could <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried,</b> but <b>I</b> don't {{want to do}} it," [...] said Gwendolen, rather pettishly; and {{her mother}} was afraid to say more.|$|R
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> {{to do it}} very gradually, {{would they}} see I was {{slipping}} my wrist out of the looser turn? If they did, what would they do? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, I 'm {{afraid of being}} laughed at, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to talk seriously about such things to the girls," [...] said Polly, frankly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care for}} that. I'll run away. I'll do some mischief. I won't bear it; I can't bear it; I shall die <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to bear it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I can't. The bark {{seems to}} be made of needle-joints, all {{sticking}} upwards. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to slip, my trousers vill remain behind, and--and--I can't hold on much longer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe <b>I</b> {{could go}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried,</b> I'm so worn out. But you'll {{take care of}} me, {{and in the morning}} show me the way home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be better <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to show you how the attack was made. Is the old set of Indian chessmen still in the drawer?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1. Ruin 2. Brake 3. Sour Grapes 4. Burning Out 5. Standing Still 6. Strangest Most Beautiful 7. Rescue Us 8. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Tried</b> 9. Story of Our Lives ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't think I ever {{should want}} to play again, but I do. Will you sing it for her, mother? I'm afraid I shall break down <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you do not}} at best {{know her}} name. And what <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> your ideal [...] With something, if not quite so fair, at least more en regle and real? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{seem to be}} {{a rather}} {{turbulent}} public," [...] observed Horne Fisher, [...] "but do go on. What will happen <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to divide this estate decently among decent people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, why not? It {{would be}} quite natural, wouldn't it, if you wouldn't marry me, and even proper. Only I should never take one--husband, I mean--not from any {{particular}} virtue, but just because I couldn't. You see, it would make me ill. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>I</b> should only run away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, I say, look here, Molly. I mean, I've been to him, already. He lent me a fiver. He might kick <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> {{to touch}} him again so soon." ...|$|R
60|$|Yet he {{left the}} place in tears. All the way home he sobbed in the darkest corner of the growler, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to comfort him he struck me.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little patience, please, Mr. Governor; let Philip {{tell his}} own story. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to do it, I shall only cry--and {{we have had}} tears enough lately, in this house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it understood," [...] I asked, [...] "that I am {{not held}} {{personally}} responsible for my thoughts--that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to clothe them with words, I am held free from offence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks. I wanted {{something}} fine to read up here and, judging by what I see, I fancy this will suit. Only Aunt Jessie may think I'm putting on airs <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> Emerson." ...|$|E
6000|$|And if any shall reply--And {{what use}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do <b>try?</b> What use, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do <b>try?</b> What use <b>if</b> <b>I</b> succeed in {{answering}} every question {{which you have}} propounded to-night? Shall I be the happier for it? Shall I be the wiser? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Nancy. I can see that. But {{where can}} I go? Even that {{place in the}} woods, they're {{watching}} that, {{and they would have}} me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to go back." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{to admire}} an' for to see, [...] For to be'old this world so wide-- [...] It never done {{no good to}} me, [...] But I can't drop it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|Eh, {{you knew}} her? No? Ah! it is a story; But I speak not, like Pachita, the English: So? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>try,</b> you will sit here beside me, [...] And shall not laugh, eh? ...|$|E
6000|$|Soon the dragon's {{horse was}} heard panting behind, and he cried out, 'Oh, my brother, {{do not go}} so fast! I shall sink to the earth <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> {{to keep up with}} you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me {{what you}} really think of them?" [...] he begged. [...] "Count Sabatini has been so kind to me that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to think about him at all I am already prejudiced." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{anything}} to remember him by. I was so fond of him, <b>I</b> couldn't forget <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried.</b> <b>I</b> know I ought not to say it, but I don't see why God let him die," [...] said Jack, with a quiver in his voice, for his loving heart could not help aching still.|$|R
6000|$|For {{to admire}} an' for to see, [...] For to be'old this world so wide -- [...] It never done {{no good to}} me, [...] But I can't drop it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet {{we could}} have groaned when in the evening, Clarence brought him back with tidings that {{something}} had gone wrong with the ship. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to explain, <b>I</b> might be twitted with, ...|$|R
