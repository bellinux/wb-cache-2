40|$|In {{recent years}} {{studies have been}} {{initiated}} on {{a new class of}} multipole <b>field</b> <b>generators</b> consisting of cuboid planar permanent magnet (PM) pieces arranged in bi-planar arrays of 2 -fold rotational symmetry. These structures, first introduced for Free Electron Laser (FEL) applications, are based on reducing the rotational symmetry of conventional N-pole <b>field</b> <b>generators</b> from N-fold to 2 -fold. One consequence of this reduction is a large higher-multipole content in a planar PM multipole's field at distances relatively close to the structure's axis, making it generally unsuitable for applications requiring a large high-quality field aperture. In this paper we outline an economical field-cancellation algorithm that can substantially decrease the harmonic content of a planar PM's field without breaking its biplanar geometry or 2 -fold rotational symmetry. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields on ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae using sugar cane molasses was studied during batch fermentation. The cellular suspension from the fermentor was externally recycled through a stainless steel tube inserted in two magnetic <b>field</b> <b>generators,</b> and consequently, the ethanol production was intensified. Two magnetic <b>field</b> <b>generators</b> were coupled to the bioreactor, which were operated conveniently in simple or combined ways. Therefore, the recycle velocity and intensity of the magnetic field varied {{in a range of}} 0. 6 - 1. 4 m s(- 1) and 5 - 20 mT, respectively. However, under the best conditions with the magnetic field treatment (0. 9 - 1. 2 ms(- 1) and 20 mT plus solenoid), the overall volumetric ethanol productivity was approximately 17 % higher than in the control experiment. These results made it possible to verify the effectiveness of the dynamic magnetic treatment since the fermentations with magnetic treatment reached their final stage in less time, i. e., approximately 2 h earlier, when compared with the control experiment...|$|R
