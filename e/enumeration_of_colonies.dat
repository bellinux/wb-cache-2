40|$|Shigella flexneri {{infection}} of human macrophages {{is followed by}} rapid bacterial escape into the cytosol and secretion of IpaB, which activates caspase- 1 to mediate cell death and release of mature interleukin (IL) - 1 β. Here we report a different outcome following {{infection of}} human peripheral blood monocytes. S. flexneri infects monocytes inefficiently {{in the absence of}} complement and, following complement-dependent uptake, cannot escape the endosomal compartment. Consequently, bacteria are killed within the first 60 min in the absence of monocyte cell death, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and <b>enumeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>colonies</b> in a gentamicin protection assay. Despite early bacterial death, wild-type S. flexneri influenced the subsequent monocyte proinflammatory cytokine response and cell fate. Infection with wild-type S. flexneri resulted in IpaB-dependent suppression of IL- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL- 6 compared with that of plasmid-cured avirulent S. flexneri-infected cells. Furthermore, over the following 6 to 8 h, virulent S. flexneri-infected monocytes died by apoptosis whereas avirulent infected monocytes died by necrosis. Together, these results imply that monocytes migrating into the inflammatory site during the early stages of shigellosis kill S. flexneri but that during bacterial uptake, they receive virulence signals from S. flexneri which induce delayed apoptosis associated with suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine response to bacterial phagocytosis. This delayed apoptosis may have important effects on the ordered initiation of the innate immune response, leading to the excessive inflammatory response characteristic of shigellosis...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of silver nanoparticles (SN) against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata adhered cells and biofilms. SN (average diameter 5 nm) were synthesized by silver nitrate reduction with sodium citrate and stabilized with ammonia. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests were performed for C. albicans (n = 2) and C. glabrata (n = 2) grown in suspension following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute microbroth dilution method. SN were applied to adhered cells (2 h) or biofilms (48 h) and after 24 h of contact their effect was assessed by <b>enumeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>colony</b> forming units (CFUs) and quantification of total biomass (by crystal violet staining). The MIC results showed that SN were fungicidal against all strains tested at very low concentrations (0. 4 - 3. 3 μg ml(- 1)). Furthermore, SN were more effective in reducing biofilm biomass when applied to adhered cells (2 h) than to pre-formed biofilms (48 h), with the exception of C. glabrata ATCC, which in both cases showed a reduction ∼ 90 %. Regarding cell viability, SN were highly effective on adhered C. glabrata and respective biofilms. On C. albicans the effect was not so evident but there was also a reduction in the number of viable biofilm cells.

Therefore, understanding processes appertaining to biofilm development is an important prerequisite for devising new strategies to prevent or eradicate biofilm-related infections. In the present study we used an array of both conventional and novel analytical tools to obtain a comprehensive view of Candida biofilm development. <b>Enumeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>colony</b> forming units, colorimetric (XTT) assay, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and novel Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) coupled with COMSTAT software analyses were utilised to evaluate growth kinetics; architecture and viability of biofilms of a reference (ATCC) and a clinical strain each of two Candida species, C. albicans and C. glabrata. Biofilm growth kinetics on a polystyrene substrate was evaluated from the initial adhesion step (1. 5 h) up to 72 h. These analyses revealed substantial inter- and intra-species differences in temporal organisation of Candida biofilm architecture, spatiality and cellular viability, while reaching maturity within a period of 48 h, on a polystyrene substrate. There were substantial differences in the growth kinetics upon methodology, although general trend seemed to be the same.

Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate C. tropicalis biofilm formation on silicone and its effect on epithelial cells and enzyme production (hemolysins and proteinases). Methods and results: This study was performed with C. tropicalis (clinical isolate and reference strain ATCC 750). Biofilms formed on silicone coupons immersed in artificial urine, were quantified by crystal violet (CV) staining and by <b>enumeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>colony</b> forming units (CFU) and the matrix content in proteins and polysaccharides was also determined. Biofilm cells and matrix were assessed in terms of hemolysins and proteinases production and their effect on TCC-SUP urinary epithelial cells was evaluated as well. Biofilms of C. tropicalis ATCC 750 presented a higher number of cells than the clinical isolate although less biofilm biomass and less polysaccharides. Moreover C. tropicalis biofilm was able to express total hemolytic activity and higher proteinase but these factors were not detectable within the matrix. Additionally, C. tropicalis biofilm adhered in higher extent to epithelial cells than their planktonic counterparts. Moreover, epithelial cells showed low metabolic activity when in contact with biofilms. Conclusions: Therefore, it is possible to conclude that enzyme production was detected in C. tropicalis biofilm cells, but not in its matrix and that biofilm cells can cause more damage to epithelial cells than their placktonic counterparts. This highlights the importance of biofilm formation, associated to the use of urinary catheters, on C. tropicalis virulence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To date, the {{detection}} of live microorganisms present in the environment or involved in infections is carried out by <b>enumeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>colony</b> forming units on agar plates, which is time consuming, laborious and limited to readily cultivable microorganisms. Although cultivation-independent methods are available, they involve multiple incubation steps and do mostly not discriminate between dead or live microorganisms. We present a novel generic method that is able to specifically monitor living microorganisms in a real-time manner. Results The developed method includes exposure of cells to a weak acid probe at low pH. The neutral probe rapidly permeates the membrane and enters the cytosol. In dead cells no signal is obtained, as the cytosolic pH reflects that of the acidic extracellular environment. In live cells with a neutral internal pH, the probe dissociates into a fluorescent phototautomeric anion. After reaching peak fluorescence, the population of live cells decays. This decay can be followed real-time as cell death coincides with intracellular acidification and return of the probe to its uncharged non-fluorescent state. The rise and decay of the fluorescence signal depends on the probe structure and appears discriminative for bacteria, fungi, and spores. We identified 13 unique probes, which can be applied in the real-time viability method described here. Under the experimental conditions used in a microplate reader, the reported method shows a detection limit of 10 6 bacteria ml - 1, while the frequently used LIVE/DEAD BacLight™ Syto 9 and propidium iodide stains show detection down to 10 6 and 10 7 bacteria ml - 1, respectively. Conclusions We present a novel fluorescence-based method for viability assessment, which is applicable to all bacteria and eukaryotic cell types tested so far. The RTV method will {{have a significant impact}} in many areas of applied microbiology including research on biocidal activity, improvement of preservation strategies and membrane permeation and stability. The assay allows for high-throughput applications and has great potential for rapid monitoring of microbial content in air, liquids or on surfaces. </p...|$|R

This report concerns the surveillance of mesophilic fungi in tap water and assessment of their potential for causing problems.

Tap water, half-strength corn meal, neopeptone–glucose rose Bengal aureomycin (NGRBA) and oomycete selective agars for the <b>enumeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>colony</b> forming units (cfu) were used. Samples were taken consecutively over 16 months. Filtration and NGRBA gave the highest ff counts. A total of 340 taxa were isolated. There appeared to be a negative correlation between bacterial and yeast (b/y) and ff counts. Highest counts were found in winter months for ff and in the warmer months for b/y. Penicillium (40. 6 %) and Acremonium (38. 8 %) were the most frequently isolated ff. There was a difference in the pattern of isolation of the key taxa with season: penicillia predominated in early summer and Acremonium in winter. P. expansum was isolated in high numbers in May 2004. This species is associated with the production of the mycotoxin patulin and the odour secondary metabolite geosmin. P. brevicompactum was detected throughout the sampling period and is known to produce the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid. Acremonium is associated with ocentol production which is responsible for bad tastes and flavours. The remaining taxa were Phialophora sp. (4. 1 %), Cladosporium sp. (3. 5 %), Rhizopus stolonifer (2. 9 %), Chaetomium sp. (0. 6 %), Alternaria sp. (0. 3 %), Aspergillus sp. (0. 3 %), mycelia sterilia (2. 6 %) and unidentified (6. 2 %).

Sobel, Robert’s, peewit and canny are edge detection technology. Thresholding is technique used to discard irrelevant data and keep only the important segment of data which lie above threshold curve. In this paper used mathematical morphology operator. It is a mathematical theory and technique for analysis and processing of geometrical structures, based on set theory. Image segmentation is the process of dividing image according to its characteristics e. g. colour and objects present in the image.

A total of 1, 000 urine samples were obtained from randomly selected patients and were cultured on agar. Upon <b>enumeration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>colonies,</b> 160 urine samples were shown to contain more than 10 (5) CFU/ml. In the bacteriuria detection device, 150 urine samples could not be processed (pigmenters and cloggers), and of the 850 urine samples processed, 127 were culture positive for 10 (5) CFU/ml or greater, and 150 urine samples contained between 10 (4) and 10 (5) CFU/ml. At 10 (5) CFU/ml, there were 140 false-positives and 14 false-negatives. When duplicate urine samples were processed through and concentrated by our new reverse-flow apparatus, all samples, including the above pigmenters and cloggers, could be tested in the bacteriuria detection device. The 150 unprocessable samples described above yielded 33 additional bacteria-positive urines, 23 at the 10 (5) -CFU/ml cutoff and 10 at the 10 (4) -to- 10 (5) -CFU/ml cutoff.

The microbial results were expressed by calculating the ratios of decimal logarithmic value of each flora (bacteria and yeasts). Triplicates plated were used in each test.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Escherichia coli has the {{potential}} to cause human health problems as well as serving as an indicator of water quality. Temperature and flow rates of streams and rivers potentially impact the levels of E. coli present. The majority of research on E. coli levels has been conducted in warm weather months when the waterways are often used for recreational purposes. Bacterial input to stream sediments may occur during cold weather months and the sediment may act as a bacteria pool that can be resuspended by snowmelt or rainstorm events. The objective of this research was to determine the impact that temperature and discharge rates had on the levels of E. coli during cold weather months. E. coli levels, temperature, and discharge rates were measured once daily at three sites in the Buffalo River Watershed during early spring 2005. <b>Enumeration</b> <b>of</b> E. coli <b>colonies</b> was done using the Coliscan Easygel method. Results showed that levels of E. coli were lower (0 - 500 cfu/ 100 ml and geometric mean of 32. 19 cfu/ 100 ml) than traditionally observed in the Buffalo River Watershed (up to 38, 000 cfu/ 100 ml during storm events) during warmer months. No correlation was found between the levels of E. coli present and temperature or discharge rates. Since these results are in contradiction to previous findings for the watershed, this study indicates that the water temperature, which averaged 5. 5 oC, was low enough to suppress levels of E. coli an...|$|R
