Let an active Loudon, with increased force, try this, their vitally important convoy, from {{the west side of}} the River; an active Ziskowitz co-operating on the east side, where the road itself is; and do their uttermost! That is Daun's plan,--now in course of execution.

Daun has crossed accordingly, and has doubled up northward again to the fit point; Ziskowitz is in the <b>fit</b> <b>point,</b> in the due force, on this east side too. Loudon, on the west side, goes by Muglitz, Hof; making a long deep bend far to westward and hillward of all the Prussian posted corps and precautions, and altogether hidden from them; Loudon aims to be in Troppau neighborhood, [...] "Guntersdorf, near Bautsch," [...] by the proper day, and pay Mosel an unexpected visit in the passage there.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (cMSSM) {{in the light}} of constraining experimental and observational data from precision measurements, astrophysics, direct supersymmetry searches at the LHC and measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson, by means of a global fit using the program Fittino. As in previous studies, we find rather poor agreement of the best <b>fit</b> <b>point</b> with the global data. We also {{investigate the}} stability of the electro-weak vacuum in the preferred region of parameter space around the best <b>fit</b> <b>point.</b> We find that the vacuum is metastable, with a lifetime significantly longer than the age of the Universe. For {{the first time in a}} global fit of supersymmetry, we employ a consistent methodology to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the cMSSM in a frequentist approach by deriving p values from large sets of toy experiments. We analyse analytically and quantitatively the impact of the choice of the observable set on the p value, and in particular its dilution when confronting the model with a large number of barely constraining measurements. Finally, for the preferred sets of observables, we obtain p values for the cMSSM below 10 %, i. e. we exclude the cMSSM as a model at the 90 % confidence level...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare and}} combine {{likelihood}} {{functions of the}} cosmological parameters Omega_m, h and sigma_ 8, from peculiar velocities, CMB and type Ia supernovae. These three data sets directly probe the mass in the Universe, without the need to relate the galaxy distribution to the underlying mass via a "biasing" relation. We include the recent results from the CMB experiments BOOMERANG and MAXIMA- 1. Our analysis assumes a flat Lambda CDM cosmology with a scale-invariant adiabatic initial power spectrum and baryonic fraction as inferred from big-bang nucleosynthesis. We find that all three data sets agree well, overlapping significantly at the 2 sigma level. This therefore justifies a joint analysis, in which we find a joint best <b>fit</b> <b>point</b> and 95 per cent confidence limits of Omega_m= 0. 28 (0. 17, 0. 39), h= 0. 74 (0. 64, 0. 86), and sigma_ 8 = 1. 17 (0. 98, 1. 37).

40|$|Today’s {{building}} façades are not imaginable {{without the}} building material glass. Modern architects capitalise the transparency and the {{load carrying capacity}} of glass elements {{in the design of}} filigree and light-flooded structures. Priority is thereby given to the maximal transparency and the energy efficiency of the glass façade. In fact, the strategy paper “EU 2020 ” formulated by the European Union has an important impact on the design of glass façade and the energy efficiency will be a focal point in the design of glass façades in future. The optimal combination of transparency and energy efficiency is achieved by using <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass units. Their application in glass façades becomes therefore indispensable in the future. Currently, three different point fitting systems for <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass units exist. They however present several disadvantages concerning their installation procedure and the tightness of the glazing cavity. Additionally, a general design concept for <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass does currently not exist. In consequence, <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass is a non-regulated construction product and requires an approval in individual cases from the national building authorities. A model to proof the structural integrity of a developed <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass unit with a suitable point fitting system and edge seal system is proposed. A state of the art investigation reveals the Fischer undercut anchor to be the most suitable type for the application in insulation glass. A novel design concept for <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass with undercut anchors is developed. The concept considers the determination of the climate loads and proposes a verification procedure for each structural element of the insulation glass unit. For this purpose, an existing climate load model for linearly supported insulation glass is analytically extended to the static system of <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass units with undercut anchors. For the verification of the connection undercut anchor in glass, an existing design method for <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> single and laminated glazing is extended to <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass. Component tests are conducted on the Fischer anchor and its ultimate load bearing capacity in glass is determined. A calibrated numerical model of the proposed <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass unit with the Fischer anchor is developed for parametric studies. Large scale tests on the proposed new <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass unit are run with the aim to verify the numerical model, the climate load model and the extended design method and to proof the structural integrity of the entire unit. Finally a new <b>point</b> <b>fitted</b> insulation glass unit with a suitable point fitting type and a corresponding novel design concept is developed...|$|R
