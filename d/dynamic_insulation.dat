50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>{{insulation}}</b> {{is a form}} {{of insulation}} where cool outside air flowing through the thermal insulation in the envelope of a building will pick up heat from the insulation fibres. Buildings can be designed to exploit this to reduce the transmission heat loss (U-value) and to provide pre-warmed, draft free air to interior spaces. This is known as <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> since the U-value is no longer constant for a given wall or roof construction but varies with the speed of the air flowing through the insulation (climate adaptive building shell). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> is different from breathing walls. The positive aspects of <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> need to be weighed against the more conventional approach to building design which is to create an airtight envelope and provide appropriate ventilation using either natural ventilation or mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. The air-tight approach to building envelope design, unlike <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation,</b> results in a building envelope that provides a consistent performance in terms of heat loss and risk of interstitial condensation that is independent of wind speed and direction. Under certain wind conditions a dynamically insulated building can have a higher heat transmission loss than an air-tight building with the same thickness of insulation.|$|E
50|$|As {{air flows}} inwards through the {{insulation}} it picks up, via the insulation fibres, {{the heat that}} is being conducted to the outside. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> is thus able to achieve the dual function of reducing the heat loss through the walls and/or roof whilst {{at the same time}} supplying pre-warmed air to the indoor spaces. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> would appear, therefore, to overcome the major disadvantage of airtight envelopes which is that the quality of the indoor air will deteriorate unless there is natural or mechanical ventilation. However, <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> also requires mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in order to recover the heat in the exhaust air.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> is {{normally}} implemented in timber frame walls and in ceilings.

The following explanation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> will, for simplicity, be set in the context of temperate or cold climates where the main energy use is for heating rather than cooling the building.

Furthermore, just as simple 1D steady state heat flow is assumed in the calculation of the heat transmission coefficients (U-values) that are used in the design, approval and building energy performance rating of buildings so the simple 1D steady state model of <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> is adequate for designing and assessing the performance of a dynamically insulated building or element of the building.|$|E
40|$|In {{building}} energy simulation, indoor {{thermal comfort}} condition, energy use and equipment size are typically calculated {{based on the}} assumption that the clothing insulation is equal to a constant value of 0. 5 clo during the cooling season and 1. 0 clo during heating season. The assumption is not reflected in practice and thus it may lead to errors. In reality, occupants frequently adjust their clothing depending on the thermal conditions, as opposed to the assumption of constant clothing values above, indicating that the clothing insulation variation should be captured in building simulation software to obtain more reliable and accurate results. In this study, the impact of three newly developed <b>dynamic</b> clothing <b>insulation</b> models on the building simulation is quantitatively assessed using the detailed whole-building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus version 6. 0. The results showed that when the HVAC is controlled based on indoor temperature the dynamic clothing models do not affect indoor operative temperatures, energy consumption and equipment sizing. When the HVAC is controlled based on the PMV model the use of a fixed clothing insulation during the cooling (0. 5 clo) and heating (1. 0 clo) season leads to the incorrect estimation of the indoor operative temperatures, energy consumption and equipment sizing. The dynamic clothing models significantly (p< 0. 0001) improve the ability of energy simulation tools to assess thermal comfort.

The HVAC systems were based on the existing district heating substation and included mechanical ventilation with heat recovery and different configurations of exhaust air heat pump. Compared to a renovation without energy saving measures, the combination of new windows, insulation, flow-reducing taps and an exhaust air a heat pump gave up to 24 % lower life cycle cost. Adding insulation on roof and façade, the primary energy consumption was reduced by up to 58 %, CO₂ emissions up to 65 % and non-renewable energy consumption up to 56 %. Ventilation with heat recovery also reduced the environmental impact but was not economically profitable in the studied cases. With a margin perspective on electricity consumption, the environmental impact of installing heat pumps or air heat recovery in district heated houses is increased.

As the conduction heat flow is proportional to the temperature gradient, the slope of the temperature profile on the cold side is a direct indication of the conduction heat loss through a wall or roof. On the cold side of the insulation the temperature gradient is close zero which is the basis for the claim often made that <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> can achieve a U-value of zero W/m2K.|$|E

40|$|Sandwich {{structures}} {{made up by}} {{foam core}} and carbon fiber face-sheets are now seen as a promising technical solution {{for the design of}} railway carbodies by many railway manufacturers. Despite their numerous advantages over the classical metallic structures, transversal load introduction usually result in high stresses in the core of a sandwich structure. Hence, the fastening of equipment on a sandwich carbody must be studied carefully. The focus of this thesis has been put on the seat fastenings. Several technical solutions were compared. A metallic part, called a C-rail, adhesively bonded {{on the top of the}} sandwich panel represents the best solution according to the requirements. The aim of the C-rail is to spread the load and therefore lower the stress concentration in the core. The reaction loads at the seat fastenings, when the seats are loaded according to the European norms, where calculated using finite element (FE) analysis. Guidelines for the design of the C-rail were developed, based on 2 D FE models. The focus was put on the reduction of stress concentration in the core. It was shown that an optimal C-rail cross section can be found for a specific sandwich panel. An analytical solution of the residual shear stresses induced by thermal expansion was developed to facilitate the choice of adhesive. It was shown that thick adhesive layers with low shear stiffness have the best strength with respect to temperature changes. Based on the 2 D FE model, efficient techniques were derived for the modeling of adhesive layers. The influence of the face-sheet and adhesive modelisation on the stress distribution in the adhesive was studied. For that purpose, several combinations of material properties for the face-sheet and adhesive were investigated. In particular a spring based model of the adhesive was derived in order to include the face-sheet out of plane stiffness. It was shown that the stiffness of the adhesive have a high influence on the stress distribution in the adhesive layer. A 3 D model was built up in order to investigate the load cases derived at the fastenings and to validate the qualitative studies based on the 2 D models. The choice of the final sandwich panel depends on numerous issues such as sound <b>insulation,</b> <b>dynamic</b> properties or weight. Various sandwich configurations were investigated in order to determine the influence of issues related to equipment fastening on the final choice of sandwich panel. The face-sheet bending stiffness as well as the core stiffness were identified as the key parameters regarding the sandwich panel out of plane strength. The panel configuration obtained by weight optimization of the carbody represents the weakest configuration with respect to out of plane load introduction.

5000|$|This large {{heat flow}} into the wall has a further consequence.

[...] In a dynamically insulated wall, as the conduction heat {{flow into the}} wall increases then so does the temperature drop across this internal thermal resistance increase. The wall surface temperature will become increasingly colder (Table 2). The temperature profiles through <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> taking into account the decrease in surface temperature with increasing air flow is shown in Fig 4.|$|E
5000|$|A {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} considerably more heat has to be put into the wall if there is air flowing through from outside.

40|$|Three {{building}} components {{exposed to}} natural climate were studied: a <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> {{in the ceiling}} of a house, an outer wall and one window in the same wall. The term <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> implies {{that part of the}} inlet or exhaust air passes through the insulation of a house. A house with <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> was continuously measured for approximately a year and a half. The performance of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> was estimated by using hourly values of the temperature distribution inside the insulation. The air flow through the insulation was calculated as the air flow that best matched the measured temperature distribution. For the calculations both the transient and steady state heat transfer equations were used. The dynamic U-value for the insulation was about 0. 05 W/m 2 °C for the ceiling. This corresponds to a dynamic energy efficiency for the insulation of 35 %. Taking into account that only 40 % of the total supply air passed through the insulation, the total efficiency became 14 %. A heat exchanger for ventilation air have an efficiency above 60 %. The general conclusion from the measurements was that <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> requires a house constructed to much higher standards, as far as air leakage is concerned, in order to work properly. An outer ambient wall with a window were studied with both theoretical analyses and measurements performed under conditions with natural climate. The method used was to estimate the heat flow through wall and window from measured temperatures and solar radiation. The longwave radiation was calculated from surface temperatures. The convective heat transfer was calculated as the difference between the heat flow through the building element and the longwave radiation. With the one-dimensional dynamic heat transfer model for the window which included shortwave radiation it was possible to measure the continuous heat flow through a window from temperature sensors and solar radiation measurements. With the one-dimensional finite difference model for the heat transfer through the wall it was possible to calculate the heat flow through a wall from temperature sensors. It was possible to continuously measure the convective heat transfer coefficient on the inner surface of a wall or a window. The accuracy was not very good: at best ± 15 % for the window and ± 20 % for the wall. Even with this low accuracy the effect of different heating and ventilation strategies on the inside could clearly be detected. The results showed that the importance of the ventilation design and the position of the radiator is crucial.

40|$|Air {{infiltration}} has {{an important}} impact on the energy consumption of buildings. Influenced by the heat exchange in it, the temperature profile in the building envelope deviates from that of conduction. Therefore, energy analysis of a building needs to consider the coupled process of conduction and infiltration. A numerical model is presented to study the heat exchange performance of the building envelope, based on air flow and heat transfer through porous media. The governing equations are derived using the volume average method, and one-medium treatment is adopted for the description of heat transfer in the porous insulation. Computational fluid dynamics approach is used to solve the equations. As Darcy's term is the dominant factor in the momentum equation, an easily-implemented pressure correction method is presented. The model {{has been applied to}} an exterior wall, under four infiltration path conditions. Factors influencing the heat exchange performance have been discussed. The presented model has been verified by comparing its results with the experimental data. Investigation is also conducted for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation,</b> which is a potential implementation of the heat exchange process in the building envelope. Numerical simulation is first performed to study the heat transfer in <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation,</b> under both transient and steady-state boundary conditions. The results show that the steady-state analysis is a good approximation for the estimation of heat loss through the <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation.</b> A steady-state analytical model is hence derived for the thermal performance of a dynamic insulated wall. An analytical model is also presented for the heat exchange performance of air infiltration in a conventional wall, by dividing the wall into ventilated and non-ventilated area, and treating the ventilated area as the dynamic insulated wall. The results in the study show that the heat exchange performance in the building envelope is first determined by the air flow rate, with the secondary impact from the air flow path.

The main goal of this work is to investigate this interaction, {{and its effects on}} the heat transfer phenomena at macroscopic scale using the Volume Average Method. At first, the microscopic geometry of two samples of rock wool is investigated through image analysis, leading to the evaluation of porosity and granulometry. Then, the volume averaging technique is applied to the microstructure of fibrous materials. Thermal dispersion and thermal tortuosity are introduced and evaluated through numerical simulations of simplified geometry in laminar and low-Pe conditions, and two regression equations are defined...|$|E

In order to avoid heat losses according to stricter regulations, building envelope thicknesses are increasing continually when applying traditional thermal insulation materials. Vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) allow the combination of high thermal insulation and thin building envelopes, but unfortunately VIPs are suffering from ageing effects and lack of flexibility and robustness. This work investigates the possibilities of inventing and developing innovative and robust highly thermal insulating materials. That is, within this work the objective is to go beyond VIPs and other current state-of-the-art technologies. New concepts are introduced, e. g. vacuum insulation materials (VIMs), nano insulation materials (NIMs), gas insulation materials (GIMs) and <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> materials (DIMs). These materials may have closed pore structures (VIMs and GIMs) or either open or closed pore structures (NIMs). The DIMs aim at controlling the thermal conductivity. Fundamental theoretical studies aimed at developing an understanding of the basics of thermal conductance in solid state matter at an elementary and atomic level have been addressed. The ultimate goal is to develop tailor-made novel high performance thermal insulation materials and <b>dynamic</b> <b>insulation</b> materials, the latter one enabling to control and regulate the thermal conductivity in the materials themselves, i. e. from highly insulating to highly conducting. Furthermore, requirements of the future high performance thermal insulation materials and solutions have been proposed. Currently, the NIMs seem to represent the best high performance low conductivity thermal solution for the foreseeable future, while DIMs, if they can be made robust and practical, have great potential due to their thermal insulation regulating abilities. status: publishe...|$|E
