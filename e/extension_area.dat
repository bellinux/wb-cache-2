Such projects have since had considerable impact, not only in the <b>extension</b> <b>areas</b> in which they originated but, in many cases, throughout the industry.

40|$|Results {{from the}} {{diagnostic}} service for ratoon stunting disease (RSD) {{indicate that the}} incidence of infection in commercial cane fields and intended seedcane sources in most areas has declined significantly in the last decade. In 1990, a mean of 17 % of commercial fields in all <b>extension</b> <b>areas</b> was estimated to be infested, compared with 25 % in 1982 + 1983. The number of fields with RSD remainshigh in the coastal wards of the South Coast, and in the Natal Cane Growers, Zululand North, Umfolozi, Pongola and Eastern Transvaal areas. The number of intended seedcane sources with RSD has declined from a mean of 13 % in all <b>extension</b> <b>areas</b> in 1982 + 83 to 6 % in 1990, and the health of seedcane planted was probably much better than this. Seedcane produced in the Lower South Coast, Midlands, Zululand and Eastern Transvaal areas is now largely free from the disease. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between the incidence ofRSD in seedcane produced in recent years and the current status of the disease in commercial cane fields {{in most parts of the}} industry...|$|R
