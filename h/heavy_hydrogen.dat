5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Adelaide, South Australia, Oliphant {{graduated}} from the University of Adelaide in 1922. He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1927 {{on the strength of}} the research he had done on mercury, and went to England, where he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. There, he used a particle accelerator to fire <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> nuclei (deuterons) at various targets. He discovered the nuclei of helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons). He also discovered that when they reacted with each other, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{followed}} up the work by constructing a particle accelerator that could fire protons {{with up to}} 600,000 electronvolts of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received {{a gift from the}} American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of a few drops of heavy water. The accelerator was used to fire <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> nuclei (deuterons, which Rutherford called diplons) at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of Helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons).|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} {{does not}} boil until 20°C {{in contrast to}} the <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrogen</b> halides which boil between −85°C (−120°F) and −35°C (−30°F). This hydrogen bonding between HF molecules gives rise to high viscosity in the liquid phase and lower than expected pressure in the gas phase.|$|R

5000|$|Water (H2O), a {{well known}} oxide of hydrogen, is a {{spectacular}} anomaly. Extrapolating from the <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrogen</b> chalcogenides, namely hydrogen sulfide H2S, hydrogen selenide H2Se, and hydrogen telluride H2Te, water should be [...] "a foul-smelling, poisonous, inflammable gas…condensing to a nasty liquid at around -100° C". Instead, due to hydrogen bonding, water is [...] "stable, potable, odorless, benign, and…indispensable to life".|$|R

25|$|Since tritium {{undergoes}} radioactive decay, {{and is also}} {{difficult to}} confine physically, the much larger secondary charge of <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> isotopes needed in a true hydrogen bomb uses solid lithium deuteride as its source of deuterium and tritium, producing the tritium in situ during secondary ignition.|$|E
25|$|Muonic <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atoms with a {{negative}} muon may undergo nuclear fusion {{in the process of}} muon-catalyzed fusion, after the muon may leave the new atom to induce fusion in another hydrogen molecule. This process continues until the negative muon is trapped by a helium atom, and cannot leave until it decays.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{elements}} <b>heavier</b> than <b>hydrogen</b> and helium were created inside the cores of stars.|$|R
50|$|Deuterium bromide is {{hydrogen}} bromide with the <b>hydrogen</b> being the <b>heavier</b> isotope deuterium. <b>Hydrogen</b> represents {{only a small}} fraction of the mass so it is not significantly <b>heavier</b> than typical <b>hydrogen</b> bromide.|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrogen</b> halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|R
25|$|Deuterium, {{also called}} <b>heavy</b> <b>{{hydrogen}},</b> is a stable isotope of hydrogen {{with a natural}} abundance in the oceans of Earth of approximately one atom in 6500 of hydrogen (~154 PPM). It was discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey, who obtained a sample of hydrogen enriched in deuterium by distillation at low temperature and pressure.|$|E
25|$|This is {{discussed}} below. It is notable that although most stars, including the Sun, generate energy {{over most of}} their lives by fusing hydrogen into heavier elements, such fusion of light hydrogen (protium) has never been successful in the conditions attainable on Earth. Thus, all artificial fusion, including the hydrogen fusion that occurs in so-called hydrogen bombs, requires <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> (either tritium or deuterium, or both) in order for the process to work.|$|E
25|$|Tritium is {{generated}} in the fuel of all reactors; CANDU reactors generate tritium also in their coolant and moderator, due to neutron capture in <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> Some of this tritium escapes into containment and is generally recovered; a small percentage (about 1%) escapes containment and is considered a routine radioactive emission (also higher than from an LWR of comparable size). Responsible operation of a CANDU plant therefore includes monitoring tritium in the surrounding environment (and publishing the results).|$|E
50|$|See {{the article}} about {{nucleosynthesis}} for the explanation on how certain nuclear fusion processes in stars (such as carbon burning, etc.) create the elements <b>heavier</b> than <b>hydrogen</b> and helium.|$|R
5000|$|Since kinetic isotope effects {{arise from}} {{differences}} in isotopic masses, the largest observable kinetic isotope effects {{are associated with}} isotopic substitutions of hydrogen with deuterium (100% increase in mass) or tritium (200% increase in mass). Kinetic isotope effects from isotopic mass ratios can be as large as 36.4 using muons. They have produced the lightest hydrogen atom, 0.11H (0.113 amu), in which an electron orbits around a positive muon (μ+) [...] "nucleus" [...] that has a mass of 206 electrons. They have also prepared the <b>heaviest</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atom analogue by replacing one electron in helium with a negative muon (μ−) to form Heμ with an atomic mass of 4.116 amu. Since the negative muon is much heavier than an electron, it orbits {{much closer to the}} nucleus, effectively shielding one proton, making Heμ to behave as 4.1H. With these exotic species, the reaction of H with 1H2 was investigated. Rate constants from reacting the lightest and the <b>heaviest</b> <b>hydrogen</b> analogues with 1H2 were then used to calculate the k0.11/k4.1 kinetic isotope effect, {{in which there is a}} 36.4 fold difference in isotopic masses. For this reaction, isotopic substitution happens to produce an inverse kinetic isotope effect, and the authors report a kinetic isotope effect as low as 1.74 x 10−4, which is the smallest kinetic isotope effect ever reported.|$|R
50|$|Hydrogen is {{an element}} {{inaccessible}} to Rutherford backscattering spectrometry since nothing can backscatter from H (since all atoms are <b>heavier</b> than <b>hydrogen!).</b> But it is often analysed by elastic recoil detection.|$|R
25|$|The {{physical}} properties of deuterium compounds can exhibit significant kinetic isotope effects and other {{physical and chemical}} property differences from the hydrogen analogs. D2O, for example, is more viscous than H2O. Chemically, {{there are differences in}} bond energy and length for compounds of <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> isotopes compared to normal hydrogen, which are larger than the isotopic differences in any other element. Bonds involving deuterium and tritium are somewhat stronger than the corresponding bonds in hydrogen, and these differences are enough to cause significant changes in biological reactions. Pharmaceutical firms are interested in the fact that deuterium is harder to remove from carbon than hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|Different {{isotopes}} {{of chemical}} elements have slightly different chemical behaviors, {{but for most}} elements the differences are far too small to use, or even detect. For hydrogen, however, this is not true. The larger chemical isotope-effects seen between protium (light hydrogen) versus deuterium and tritium manifest because bond energies in chemistry are determined in quantum mechanics by equations in which the quantity of reduced mass of the nucleus and electrons appears. This quantity is altered in heavy-hydrogen compounds (of which deuterium oxide is the most common) more than for heavy-isotope substitution in other chemical elements. This isotope effect of <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is magnified further in biological systems, which {{are very sensitive to}} small changes in the solvent properties of water.|$|E
25|$|In {{physical}} cosmology, Big Bang nucleosynthesis (abbreviated BBN, {{also known}} as primordial nucleosynthesis, arch(a)eonucleosynthesis, archonucleosynthesis, protonucleosynthesis and pal(a)eonucleosynthesis) refers {{to the production of}} nuclei other than those of the lightest isotope of hydrogen (hydrogen-1, 1H, having a single proton as a nucleus) during the early phases of the Universe. Primordial nucleosynthesis is believed by most cosmologists to have taken place in the interval from roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang, and is calculated to be responsible for the formation of most of the universe's helium as the isotope helium-4 (4He), along with small amounts of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (2H or D), the helium isotope helium-3 (3He), and a very small amount of the lithium isotope lithium-7 (7Li). In addition to these stable nuclei, two unstable or radioactive isotopes were also produced: the <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> isotope tritium (3H or T); and the beryllium isotope beryllium-7 (7Be); but these unstable isotopes later decayed into 3He and 7Li, as above.|$|E
500|$|The Sun is a {{population}} I star; {{it has a}} higher abundance of elements <b>heavier</b> than <b>hydrogen</b> and helium ("metals" [...] in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars. Elements <b>heavier</b> than <b>hydrogen</b> and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so {{the first generation of}} stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of [...] "metals".|$|R

25|$|Measurements {{of small}} {{variations}} in the natural abundances of deuterium, {{along with those of}} the stable heavy oxygen isotopes 17O and 18O, are of importance in hydrology, to trace the geographic origin of Earth's waters. The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in rainwater (so-called meteoric water) are enriched {{as a function of the}} environmental temperature of the region in which the precipitation falls (and thus enrichment is related to mean latitude). The relative enrichment of the heavy isotopes in rainwater (as referenced to mean ocean water), when plotted against temperature falls predictably along a line called the global meteoric water line (GMWL). This plot allows samples of precipitation-originated water to be identified along with general information about the climate in which it originated. Evaporative and other processes in bodies of water, and also ground water processes, also differentially alter the ratios of <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and oxygen isotopes in fresh and salt waters, in characteristic and often regionally distinctive ways. The ratio of concentration of 2H to 1H is usually indicated with a delta as δ2H and the geographic patterns of these values are plotted in maps termed as isoscapes. Stable isotope are incorporated into plants and animals and an analysis of the ratios in a migrant bird or insect can help suggest a rough guide to their origins.|$|E

500|$|In 1931, Urey {{set out to}} find it. Urey and George Murphy {{calculated}} from the Balmer series that the heavy isotope should have lines redshifted by [...] Urey had access to a [...] grating spectrograph, a sensitive device that had been recently installed at Columbia and was capable of resolving the Balmer series. It had a resolution of 1 Å per millimetre, so on this machine, the difference was about 1 millimetre. However, since only one atom in 4,500 was heavy, the line on the spectrograph was very faint. Urey therefore decided to delay publishing their results until he had more conclusive evidence that it was <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrogen.</b>|$|E

HF is fully miscible with water (will dissolve in any proportion), while the other hydrogen halides have large solubility gaps with water. Hydrogen fluoride and water also form several compounds in the solid state, most notably a 1:1 compound that does not melt until −40 °C (−40 °F), which is 44 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) above the melting point of pure HF.|$|R

The hydrogen halides are shown to be more stable on the fuel side of the reaction zone than they are on the air side.
