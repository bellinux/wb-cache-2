25|$|The {{earliest}} {{rocks in}} the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest being metasedimentary rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region. These dark-colored <b>hornfels,</b> slates, marbles, and schists {{are found in the}} western foothills (notably around Coarsegold, west of the Tehachapi Pass) and east of the Sierra Crest. The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2Â°N. In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny. Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} about the general geology and {{assessment}} of extraction of drainage pattern in Jelawang, Dabong, Kelantan. The purposes of this research were to produce a geological map of the study area, to extract the drainage pattern from the study area and to evaluate the accuracy of drainage pattern extraction from Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Field observation and mapping at the study area were done. Rock samples were collected for laboratory studies. The drainage pattern is extracted from two methods: (1) topographic map at scale 1 : 25000 and (2) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) extracted from SRTM data using ArcHydro tool. The study area consists of rocks from Permian until Triassic. The rocks included are marble, volcanic origin rocks and sandstone. An acid intrusive granite is the igneous rocks that formed from the cooling of magma below the earth surface. By the finding of <b>hornfel,</b> marble and quartzite nearby the Stong Migmatic Complex, {{it can be the}} evidence of metamorphism that occurred due to the intrusion of granite. The obtained results of drainage pattern extracted by the two methods were evaluated using GPS points and visual interpretation. The results show that the drainage pattern extracted from the previous DEM using ArcHydr 0 tool was more accurate comparing to those extracted from topographic maps at scale 1125000 as this was proved by GPS points...|$|R

5000|$|Seminary Ridge is a {{northern}} {{portion of the}} drainage divide between the Marsh Creek Watershed on {{the west and the}} Rock Creek Watershed (east). At the south end of Oak Ridge (the northernmost portion of the divide), the north-south McPherson and Seminary ridges bifurcate southward at the triple watershed point of Willoughby and Pitzer runs (southward tributaries of Marsh Creek) with a Rock Creek eastward tributary. From the triple point, Seminary Ridge extends southward to an area with eastward drainage into the Rock Cr tributary (Stevens Creek), with the borough of Gettysburg, and with the TBD. Farther south into the Gettysburg National Park, Seminary Ridge continues as far as a branch of Pitzer Run, which divides the ridgeline (...) , around which the drainage divide curves to the east. The ridgeline continues south of the branch, crossing the Millerstown Road. Between the Millerstown and Emmitsburg road crossings, {{the west side of the}} ridgeline is an elevated area (<b>hornfel</b> along the northwest edge of a diabase sheet) about 1 mile wide along the Emmitsburg Road. Along this east side of this elevated area, the ridgeline is Warfield Ridge, the southernmost portion of Seminary Ridge near the south end of the Gettysburg Battlefield. South of the tip of Seminary/Warfield Ridge tip, the Marsh/Rock creeks' drainage divide continues about 4 miles to near the Mason-Dixon line at their confluence to form the Monocacy River.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hornfels</b> (German, meaning [...] "hornstone") {{is called}} {{so because of}} its {{exceptional}} toughness and texture both reminiscent of animal horns. These properties are due to fine grained non-aligned crystals with platy or prismatic habits. <b>Hornfels</b> is the group designation {{for a series of}} contact metamorphic rocks that have been baked and indurated by the heat of intrusive igneous masses and have been rendered massive, hard, splintery, and in some cases exceedingly tough and durable. <b>Hornfels</b> rocks were referred to by miners in northern England as whetstones.|$|E

50|$|When a rock is contact {{altered by}} an igneous {{intrusion}} it very frequently becomes more indurated, and more coarsely crystalline. Many altered rocks {{of this type}} were formerly called hornstones, and the term <b>hornfels</b> is often used by geologists to signify thosefine grained, compact, non-foliated products of contact metamorphism. A shale may become a dark argillaceous <b>hornfels,</b> full of tiny plates of brownish biotite; a marl or impure limestone may change to a grey, yellow or greenish lime-silicate-hornfels or siliceous marble, tough and splintery, with abundant augite, garnet, wollastonite and other minerals in which calcite is an important component. A diabase or andesite may become a diabase <b>hornfels</b> or andesite <b>hornfels</b> with development of new hornblende and biotite and a partial recrystallization of the original feldspar. Chert or flint may become a finely crystalline quartz rock; sandstones lose their clastic structure and are converted into a mosaic of small close-fitting grains of quartz in a metamorphic rock called quartzite.|$|E

50|$|A second great {{group of}} <b>hornfels</b> are the calc-silicate <b>hornfels</b> {{that arise from}} the thermal {{alteration}} of impure limestone. The purer beds recrystallize as marbles, but {{where there has been}} originally an admixture of sand or clay lime-bearing silicates are formed, such as diopside, epidote, garnet, sphene, vesuvianite and scapolite; with these phlogopite, various feldspars, pyrites, quartz and actinolite often occur. These rocks are fine-grained, and though often banded, are tough and much harder than the original limestones. They are excessively variable in their mineralogical composition, and very often alternate in thin seams with biotite <b>hornfels</b> and indurated quartzites. When perfused with boric and fluoric vapors from the granite they may contain much axinite, fluorite and datolite, but the altiminous silicates are absent from these rocks.|$|E
