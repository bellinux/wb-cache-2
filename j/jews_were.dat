5|$|Heinrich Himmler {{ordered that}} the film be shown to SS units about to be sent against Jews, to non-Jewish populations of areas where <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> about to be deported, and to {{concentration}} camp guards.|$|E
5|$|In total, 25,437 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{deported}} from Belgium. Only 1,207 {{of these}} survived the war. Amongst those deported and killed was the surrealist artist Felix Nussbaum in 1944.|$|E

5|$|In German-occupied Poland {{the task}} of rescuing <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> {{especially}} difficult and dangerous. All household members were punished by death if a <b>Jew</b> <b>was</b> found concealed in their home or on their property. It is estimated {{that the number of}} Poles who were killed by the Nazis for aiding <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> as high as tens of thousands, 704 of whom were posthumously honored with medals.|$|R
5000|$|The 1996 {{annual report}} of the Verfassungsschutz of Lower Saxony, quotes from an issue of USA-Bericht: [...] "What I dislike most about <b>Jews</b> <b>is</b> their {{apparent}} deep dishonesty. ... An outstanding example for this deep dishonesty {{of most of the}} <b>Jews</b> ... <b>is</b> the constant denial of Jewish excessive power ... is of course indispensable that the <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> pampered in Germany, just as in nature, it is a parasite's due." ...|$|R
5|$|Restrictions on <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{already in}} place before the invasion, {{including}} a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil rights}} of <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{restricted}} and their religious privileges threatened. Justinian also interfered {{in the internal affairs}} of the synagogue and encouraged the Jews to use the Greek Septuagint in their synagogues in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} campaign to remove certain classes of persons (above all, Jews) from Germany and other German-held territories during World War II, often with extreme brutality, {{is known as}} the Holocaust. It was carried out primarily by German forces and collaborators, German and non-German. Early in the war, millions of <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> concentrated in urban ghettos. In 1941 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> , and by December Hitler had decided to exterminate all Jews living in Europe at that time. The European Jewish population was reduced from 9,740,000 to 3,642,000; the world's Jewish population was reduced by one-third, from roughly 16.6 million in 1939 to about 11 million in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|On July 28, 1947 the 14 Halalei Gesher Haziv, {{carrying}} 685 Eastern European <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> {{intercepted by}} HMS Rowena. Also, the Shivat Zion, carrying 411 North African <b>Jews,</b> <b>was</b> intercepted without resistance by the minesweeper [...]|$|R

5|$|A {{large-scale}} uprising {{erupted in}} Serbia following the Axis {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union in June 1941. Although they took no part in the rebellion, <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> targeted for retaliatory execution by the Germans. The Germans soon implemented a number of anti-Jewish laws, {{and by the end}} of August 1941, all Serbian Jewish males were interned in concentration camps, primarily at Topovske Šupe in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E
5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
2500|$|The hearty cuisine of Ashkenazi <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} centuries {{of living in}} the cold climate of Central and Eastern Europe, whereas the lighter, [...] "sunnier" [...] cuisine of Sephardic <b>Jews</b> <b>was</b> {{affected}} by life in the Mediterranean region.|$|R
5000|$|Klages is an {{important}} anti-semitic thinker. He reportedly said, [...] "To the <b>Jew,</b> everything human <b>is</b> a sham. One might even say that the Jewish face is nothing but a mask. The <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> not a liar: he is the lie itself. From this vantage point, {{we can say that}} the <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> not a man. … He lives the pseudo-life of a ghoul whose fortunes are linked to Yahweh-Moloch. He employs deception as the weapon with which he will exterminate mankind. The <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> the very incarnation of the unearthly power of destruction." ...|$|R
50|$|Finnish <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> <b>Jews</b> who <b>are</b> {{citizens}} of Finland. The country {{is home to}} approximately 1,500 Jews, who mostly live in Helsinki. Jews came to Finland as traders and merchants {{from other parts of}} Europe.|$|R
5|$|Goebbels had {{frequent}} {{discussions with}} Hitler {{about the fate}} of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met. He was aware throughout that the <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He {{was one of the few}} top Nazi officials to do so publicly.|$|E
5|$|Government-run {{health care}} {{insurance}} plans were available, but <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> denied coverage starting in 1933. That same year, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat government-insured patients. In 1937, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat non-Jewish patients and in 1938 their right to practice medicine was removed entirely.|$|E
5|$|In 1478, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, {{established}} an ecclesiastical tribunal {{known as the}} Spanish Inquisition. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms. Hundreds of <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed, and their synagogues destroyed. One {{of the consequences of}} these disturbances was the mass forced conversion of Jews.|$|E
2500|$|In Philip Roth's novel The Human Stain, {{the narrator}} {{states that the}} Mourner's Kaddish signifies that [...] "a <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> dead. Another <b>Jew</b> <b>is</b> dead. As though death were not a {{consequence}} of life but a consequence of having been a Jew." ...|$|R
2500|$|Indoctrination against <b>Jews</b> <b>is</b> a part {{of school}} {{curriculum}} in Saudi Arabia. [...] Children are advised not to befriend <b>Jews,</b> <b>are</b> given false information about them (such as the claim that Jews worship the Devil), and are encouraged to engage in jihad against Jews.|$|R
50|$|In medieval French literature, <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} presented unfavorably. However, those <b>Jews</b> who convert <b>are</b> treated favorably. For example, a <b>Jew</b> who <b>is</b> {{among the}} infidels who convert is viewed positively in the 12th-century Pèlerinage de Charlemagne a Jérusalem (Pilgrimage of Charlemagne to Jerusalem). A rare {{exception to the}} unfavorable stereotyping of <b>Jews</b> <b>is</b> a work by Peter Abelard framed as a dialogue between a Jewish and a Christian philosopher and presents Judaism in a favorable light.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved {{the allocation of}} materials {{for the expansion of}} Auschwitz after two of his assistants toured the facility on a day when almost a thousand <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed. The documents bore annotations in Speer's own handwriting. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny stated that, due to his workload, Speer would not have been personally aware of such activities.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, the Germans {{estimated}} at the Wannsee Conference that Albania was inhabited by 200 Jews. That same month, <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> interned by the Italians at a camp in Pristina. Though they feared {{they would be}} {{handed over to the}} Germans, the Italian commander of the camp promised them that this would never happen. On 14 March 1942, the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews that had been detained there. Some were handed over to the Germans and transported to the Sajmište concentration camp, near Belgrade, where they were killed. Others, together with Serbs, were taken to the camp in Berat, where they were detained until Italy's capitulation. It is estimated that as many as 500 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> interned in the camps in Berat, Krujë and Kavajë during the Italian occupation.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath {{was killed}} in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels {{arranged}} for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, {{and the result was}} the start of a pogrom. <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalized in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.|$|E
2500|$|Following this, {{a three-year-old}} Muslim girl, says that <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> [...] "apes and pigs" [...] because [...] "Allah" [...] said so [...] "in the Qur'an" [...] in an {{interview}} on Iqraa TV. More antisemitism is shown by an unidentified Imam, who says: [...] "The <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> <b>Jews.</b> They <b>are</b> the ones who must be butchered and killed." [...] Child soldiers in uniform are shown holding guns.|$|R
50|$|American <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> largely {{supportive}} of gay rights, though a split exists {{within the group}} by observance. Reform, Reconstructionist, and, increasingly, Conservative, <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> far more supportive on issues like gay marriage than Orthodox <b>Jews</b> <b>are.</b> A 2007 survey of Conservative Jewish leaders and activists showed that an overwhelming majority now supports gay rabbinical ordination and same-sex marriage. Accordingly, 78% percent of Jewish voters rejected Proposition 8, the bill which banned gay marriage in California. No other ethnic or religious group voted as strongly against it.|$|R

5|$|In mid-1940, nearly 56,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{living in}} Belgium {{out of a}} {{population}} of roughly 8 million. Many had fled to Belgium to escape recent persecution in Germany and elsewhere, meaning that only a minority were Belgian citizens. Most of the Jewish population was focused in communities in the towns of Brussels and Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|In the Iberian peninsula, Crusader {{privileges}} {{were given}} to those aiding the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Iberian orders that merged with the orders of Calatrava and Santiago. The Christian kingdoms pushed the Muslim Moors and Almohads back in frequent Papal-endorsed Iberian Crusades from 1212 to 1265. The Emirate of Granada held out until 1492, {{at which point the}} Muslims and <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> finally expelled from the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} century, Caesarius of Arles taught {{that the whole}} glory of the Jewish Sabbath had been {{transferred}} to Sunday and that Christians must keep Sunday {{in the same way}} as the <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> commanded to keep the Sabbath. The Council of Orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency, to apply the law of the Jewish Sabbath to the observance of the Christian Sunday, as Jewish and non-Christian.|$|E
