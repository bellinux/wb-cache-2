5|$|Stigand first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1020 as a royal chaplain to King Cnut of England (reigned 1016–1035). In that year he was appointed to Cnut's church at Ashingdon, or Assandun, which was dedicated by the reforming bishop Wulfstan of York. Little is known of Stigand's life during Cnut's reign, but <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{a place at the}} royal court, as he witnessed occasional charters. Following Cnut's death Stigand successively served Cnut's sons, Harold Harefoot (reigned 1035–1040) and Harthacnut (reigned 1040–1042). After Harthacnut died Stigand became an advisor to Emma of Normandy, Cnut's widow and the mother of Harthacnut and his successor Edward the Confessor. He may have been Emma's chaplain, and it is possible that Stigand was already one of her advisors while Cnut was alive, and that he owed his position at Ashingdon to Emma's influence and favour. Because little is known of Stigand's activities before his appointment as a bishop, {{it is difficult to determine}} to whom he owed his position.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
25|$|Long after Rico's death, Dredd {{would be}} haunted by his memory. He {{tried to stop}} Vienna from {{learning}} about her father's death but she believed <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{a good reason for}} killing him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{like the}} old key," [...] {{returned}} Dick, comparing the two. [...] "That rascal, whoever <b>he</b> is, <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the key made {{for the sole purpose}} of getting into this room!" ...|$|R
60|$|Lanfear {{said that}} he understood, for he could not {{disappoint}} the expectation of the father's boastful love: {{all that was left}} him of the ambitions <b>he</b> <b>must</b> once <b>have</b> <b>had</b> for his child.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Jackson answered, vaguely, and he {{expressed}} by his indirection the sense <b>he</b> <b>must</b> sometimes <b>have</b> <b>had</b> of his impending fate--"I don't know what she's going to do, her or mother, either." ...|$|R
25|$|Carel van Mander's {{biography}} accuses Gossaert of {{an unruly}} life; yet it describes the solid education <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to learn his trade so well. It also describes the splendid appearance of Gossaert, dressed in gold brocade, as he accompanied Lucas van Leyden on a pleasure trip to Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp in 1527.|$|E
25|$|Three {{specific}} {{levels of}} knowledge are often discussed in Christology as beatific, infused and acquired knowledge. Those (such as Thomas Aquinas) who {{adhere to the}} principle of the Perfection of Christ reason that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> beatific knowledge of all things from The Word from the very beginning due to his perfection. However, the views of Aquinas are not generally accepted by all Christians.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have hypothesised that Ducetius returned {{without the consent}} of Syracuse, but this is very improbable. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the permission of Syracuse to end the exile at Corinth (the mother city of Syracuse), and he brought according to Diodorus partly Corinthian settlers for the colonising project at Kale Akte. Syracuse would have had an interest of establishing an allied Sikel-Greek colony on the north coast, without risking too much in a potentially hostile Sikel-dominated area.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the names}} of his family are unknown, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> married and <b>had</b> {{children}} as his will named his sister and grandchildren.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a dear <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been to <b>have</b> {{remembered and}} to <b>have</b> been so faithful!" [...] Philippa observed, looking {{away for a}} moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sure of it!" [...] cried Ethel, {{clasping}} her hands. [...] "But, poor man, how unhappy <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been at <b>having</b> to go {{away when}} she was so ill!" ...|$|R
25|$|Pynson printed {{more than}} 500 books during his lifetime, more than 75% {{of which were}} printed after 1500 and are {{therefore}} not counted as 'incunabula'. He was not as productive as for example Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's one-time assistant, but his books were of a higher quality. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> assistants himself, but only {{two of them are}} named in his will: John Snowe and Richard Withers. It {{is interesting to note that}} he does not seem to have imported books, since his name does not appear on the Customs rolls. This suggests that he was not really a bookseller in addition to being a printer.|$|E
25|$|York {{returned}} to England on 20 October 1445 {{at the end}} of his five-year appointment in France. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> reasonable expectations of reappointment. However, he had become associated with the English in Normandy who were opposed to the policy of Henry VI's Council towards France, some of whom had followed him to England (for example Sir William Oldhall and Sir Andrew Ogard). Eventually (on 24 December 1446) the lieutenancy went to Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, who had succeeded his brother John. During 1446 and 1447, York attended meetings of Henry VI's Council and of Parliament, but most of his time was spent in administration of his estates on the Welsh border.|$|E
25|$|Field's {{claim to}} {{distinction}} does not rest {{entirely on the}} fact that he wrote the first volume of verse to appear in Australia, he also founded the first savings bank in June 1819. He is spoken of with respect in Miss Marion Phillips's A Colonial Autocracy. He was the B.F. {{of one of the most}} famous of Lamb's essays and the recipient of more than one of his delightful letters, which suggests that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> likeable qualities. His verse has little value, but he could do better work in prose and had some claims to be an Elizabethan scholar, his special interest being Thomas Heywood. His Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales, published in 1825, is an interesting collection of some of the earliest scientific papers relating to Australia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nancy," [...] he {{answered}} (how often, and to how many, <b>must</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{to say the}} same thing), [...] "I haven't the money, Nancy. Would to God that I <b>had,</b> Nancy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well!" [...] exclaimed {{the fisher}} in surprise; [...] "it's {{not every day}} I hook a fish like this. A glengarry! And Junkie's glengarry! The small rascal! Crumbs, too! <b>ha!</b> that {{accounts}} for it. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>having</b> his lunch here yesterday, and was so taken up with victuals that he forgot his cap when he went away. Foolish boy! It is like his carelessness; but he's not a bad little fellow, for all that." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Lee Moore {{proved to}} be a man of vision. He decided to knit {{together}} the scores of surrounding farm families, to secure a post office, and some local center for conducting business which could be hastened by direct means of communicating with the outside world. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> also <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the hope of attracting the railroad, which was then being planned but was not built until six years later.|$|R
500|$|Due to {{his poor}} eyesight, Berry wore contact lenses when he played. Because the lenses would often slip {{when he did}} rapid eye {{movements}} toward the ball, he tried many different lenses, which led sportswriters to believe <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> major eye problems. [...] "I tried all kinds of lenses till we got what we wanted," [...] he said. [...] "I even had tinted lenses for sunny days, so I could watch the ball come right across the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|With all his {{frequently}} noted {{attention to}} character and characters—Hazlitt's partly psychological approach to character necessarily referred to observed real-life behavior—he also frequently emphasises the art by which Shakespeare created dramatic [...] "character". Particularly in tragedy, a [...] "sense of power", he believed, {{is the essential}} medium by which a poet of genius operates {{on the minds of}} his audience. When the author instills in the reader or viewer's imagination the sense of power that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> in grasping and conveying intertwined passions, he makes us identify with a character such as Othello, and feel in ourselves the way Iago plays upon his mind so that, ironically, his weakness is made to undermine his strength.|$|E
2500|$|Black {{would develop}} a close {{friendship}} with Carter {{and rely on}} him as a spiritual advisor. On Carter's death, Black wrote: [...] "In the 25 years I knew him, his judgment and personality were always sober but never solemn; and never, not at his most beleaguered {{and not on the}} verge of death, did he show a trace of despair. He was intellectual but practical, spiritual but not sanctimonious or utopian, proud but never arrogant. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> faults, but I never detected any. He was a great man, yet the salt of the earth." ...|$|E
60|$|Sufficiently severe <b>had</b> {{been the}} lesson he <b>had</b> {{received}} for meddling with Imperial fiefs; and <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been mad <b>had</b> <b>he</b> thought of provoking further the {{resentment of the}} Emperor. To Farnese, Charles V was a sleeping dog it was as well to leave sleeping.|$|R
6000|$|Saying he {{was kind}} and generous made her through some obscure {{association}} of ideas feel that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> understanding. She <b>had</b> an impulse to put her whole case before him frankly. [...] "I wonder," [...] she said, [...] "if you can {{understand what it is}} to be a girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A difficulty!" [...] said Mrs. Proudie, [...] "what difficulty? The place <b>has</b> {{been promised}} to Mr. Quiverful, {{and of course}} <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> it. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> made all his arrangements. He <b>has</b> written for a curate for Puddingdale, he <b>has</b> spoken to the {{auctioneer}} about selling his farm, horses, and cows, and in all respects considers the place as his own. Of course <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> it." ...|$|R
2500|$|The author, says Matheson, {{must have}} been a Northerner (based on orthographic and {{linguistic}} evidence), [...] "an educated man with some sense of proportion and critical discrimination", likely a bibliophile with access to many texts and connected to the Peterhouse library. Since he was allowed to make additions to a manuscript in that library <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a certain standing. Matheson calculates that the author may have been in his late twenties when he wrote the chronicle and identified Roger Lancaster (d. 1502) and Thomas Metcalf (d. 1503), both Yorkshiremen, as the most likely candidates from the list of fellows of Peterhouse.|$|E
2500|$|In what Stephen Jay Gould {{has called}} [...] "glorious purple prose," [...] Gosse argued {{that if one}} assumed {{creation}} ex nihilo, there would necessarily be traces of previous existence that had never actually occurred. [...] "Omphalos" [...] is Greek for [...] "navel," [...] and Gosse argued that the first man, Adam, did not require a navel because he was never born; nevertheless <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> one, as do all complete human beings, just as God must have created trees with rings that they never grew. Thus, Gosse argued that the fossil record—even coprolites—might also be evidence of life that had never actually existed but {{which may have been}} instantly formed by God at the moment of creation.|$|E
2500|$|Huxley was {{originally}} not persuaded of [...] "development theory", as evolution was once called. This {{can be seen}} in his savage review of Robert Chambers' Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution. Huxley had also rejected Lamarck's theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution, which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind. It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some particular intuition about Huxley, who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{said after}} the fight [...] "Bruno did his {{homework}} and kept me from throwing my right hand early... but <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> forgotten I <b>have</b> a terrific left hook. I said to myself, 'I'm {{going to let him}} see my hook'". Bruno's manager, Mickey Duff, said [...] "Frank (Bruno) <b>has</b> no chin... once he gets hit clean on the button, he goes".|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> fancied I <b>had</b> grown faint-hearted to {{a certain}} degree, for as we walked on by {{the shore of the}} mill pond, he obeying every motion of mine as does a dog that <b>has</b> been whipped, the scoundrel began to whimper, being fool enough to think that by the use of soft words he could make his {{standing}} good once more.|$|R
5000|$|In the Larry David HBO comedy series, Curb Your Enthusiasm (S2.E5 The Thong), Rob Reiner convinces Larry to {{participate}} in a celebrity auction to benefit Groat's Syndrome (a fictional neurological disorder). Reiner describes it affecting [...] "kids and adults who <b>have</b> a tough time controlling their hyperactivity. It's as if you were on five cups of coffee at all times." [...] Reiner claims it was named after the doctor who discovered it but Larry David's character speculates it was named for Dick Groat, who <b>he</b> assumes <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the disease because, as Larry says, [...] "he didn't field very well because he was excited all the time." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order they were going to go in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E

60|$|This, then, was why Hereward {{had been}} so strangely hurried. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> that letter, and dropped it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And no {{profession}} either;--nothing {{that can}} be called a profession. I {{do not wish to}} argue it, my dear, because {{there is no room for}} argument. The whole thing is preposterous. I cannot but think ill of him for <b>having</b> proposed it to you; for <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> known,--must <b>have</b> known, that a young man without an income cannot be accepted as a fitting suitor for a gentleman's daughter. As for yourself, I can only hope that you will get the little idea out of your head very quickly;--but mamma will speak to you about that. What I want you to understand from me is this,--that there must be an end to it." ...|$|R
50|$|In his {{discussion}} of the action, the author William James, in his naval history, made much of what he termed Thevenard's cowardice. He further opined that as Thevenard <b>had</b> continued in the French navy until 1817, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> misrepresented what <b>had</b> occurred. James did not draw attention to Renard <b>having</b> a broadside twice the weight of Diligents broadside and argued that Thevenard should <b>have</b> attempted to capture Renard by boarding.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 16; Mr. Cuming Walters in his {{interesting}} volume 'In Tennyson Land', p. 75, {{notices that}} the white chalk quarry at Thetford {{can be seen from}} Stockworth Mill, which seems to show that if Tennyson did take the mill from Trumpington <b>he</b> <b>must</b> also <b>have</b> <b>had</b> his mind on Thetford Mill. Tennyson seems to <b>have</b> taken delight in baffling those who wished to localise his scenes. He {{went out of his way}} to say that the topographical studies of Messrs. Church and Napier were the only ones which could he relied upon. But Mr. Cuming Walters' book is far more satisfactory than their thin studies.] ...|$|R
