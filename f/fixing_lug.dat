40|$|Two sets of movable lug {{wheel with}} spring {{mechanism}} for hand tractors {{have been designed}} and tested. The wheels were set on local hand tractors and tested for tilling paddy fields in Cianjur and Subang districts, West Java. A local <b>fixed</b> <b>lug</b> wheel was also tested in each location. The movable lug wheel for Cianjur location was equipped {{with a pair of}} coiled type torsion springs on each lug, while the movable lug wheel for Subang location was equipped with a shaft type torsion spring on each lug. Field performances: theoretical and actual field capacities, wheel slip, and wheel shrinkage, were measured during the test. The test result in Cianjur showed that the movable lug wheel had a better traction performance than the <b>fixed</b> <b>lug</b> wheel. The average wheel slip of the movable lug wheel was 11. 54 %, while the average wheel slip of the <b>fixed</b> <b>lug</b> wheel was 20. 89 %. Field efficiency of the movable lug wheel was 76. 33 %, which was bigger than the <b>fixed</b> <b>lug</b> wheel (68. 45 %). However, the test result using shaft type torsion springs in Subang showed that the spring mechanism did not work well, and the spring mechanism should be modified on its torsion-shaft diameter and welding strength.

50|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{he worked on}} the French C36 cipher machine with <b>fixed</b> <b>lugs,</b> {{designed}} by Boris Hagelin, which was solved by cribs. He later heard from others that cribs were no longer needed.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a problem}} {{including}} traditional built in lugs with the new stainless steel Amphibia case, so for the first case design, model 350, <b>fixed</b> <b>lugs</b> were added on. Later versions included attached lugs that swung before they incorporated integral lugs to the case. Later model cases include the integral lug model (420), the hexagon case, the ministry case (710), and the new curvy 060, and the tonneau/paddle model.|$|R
30|$|Results in Fig. 14 {{reveal the}} {{following}} advantages of the ePaddle module rolling on sandy terrain. The ePaddle mechanism is able to insert the paddle into the soil earlier in the cycle and depart from the soil later to increase the drawbar pull and vertical force over a wider range. Compared with the <b>fixed</b> <b>lugged</b> wheel with a maximum sinkage length of 18 mm, the maximum drawbar pull of the ePaddle module at 18 mm sinkage length is increased by 53 %. In addition, the ePaddle mechanism is able to significantly enhance the vertical reaction force on sandy soil.|$|R
50|$|The HB used a {{completely}} different suspension design from the HA, having double-wishbone and coil springs with integrated telescopic dampers at the front, and trailing arms and coil springs at the rear. Lateral location and anti-squat of the rear axle was achieved using upper trailing arms mounted at approximately 45° <b>fixed</b> to <b>lugs</b> {{at the top of}} the differential. Both front and rear could also be fitted with optional anti-roll bars. The HB set new standards for handling in its class as a result of the adoption of this suspension design, where many of its contemporaries stuck with leaf springs and MacPherson struts.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his early}} racing years, Ritchey began {{building}} bikes for the Palo Alto Bike shop and its national mail order catalog. In 1974, as {{his senior year}} in High School approached Ritchey had already built approximately 200 frames. It was around this time he honed his fillet brazing or “lugless” method of fabricating frames. Ritchey sought to challenge bicycle industry standards of frame tubing diameter at the time limited {{by the use of}} <b>fixed</b> dimensioned <b>lugs.</b> Ritchey’s fillet brazing construction method allowed choice of larger thin-wall tubing diameters and unique ovalizations to create lighter -stiffer frames. By 1979, Ritchey had produced over 1,000 frames on his own.|$|R
50|$|Loose {{wheel nut}} {{indicators}} are small pointed tags, usually made of fluorescent orange or yellow plastic, which are <b>fixed</b> to the <b>lug</b> nuts of {{the wheels of}} large vehicles. The tag rotates with the nut, and if the nut becomes loose, {{the point of the}} tag shifts noticeably out of alignment with the other tags. If too many lug nuts are loosened, the wheel can detach from the wheel stud; loose wheel nut indicators allow identification of loose nuts before this can occur.|$|R
5000|$|The GP100 is a family/line {{of double}} action six-shot (.357 Magnum) seven-shot (.327 Federal Magnum) or ten-shot (.22 LR) revolvers made by Sturm, Ruger & Co., {{manufactured}} in the United States. It was introduced in 1985 as a second generation of the Ruger double-action, exposed-hammer revolvers intended to replace Ruger's Security- / Service- / Speed-Six line. It was made stronger {{with the intent to}} fire an unlimited number of full-power [...]357 Magnum rounds and has been produced in a number of variations with three basic barrel lengths (3 in / 76 mm, 4 in / 102 mm, and 6 in / 152 mm), various barrel profiles (full lug and half <b>lug),</b> <b>fixed</b> or adjustable sights, and in blued carbon steel or polished stainless steel.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 22 was re-introduced as {{the second}} limited {{production}} Thunder Ranch revolver in 2007. This gun features a 4" [...] match barrel with under <b>lug,</b> <b>fixed</b> sights, cocobolo grips, and an internal lock. The popularity of this revolver led S&W to continue its production in its classic line as the 22-4. It is quite an accurate revolver and has a smoother trigger pull than the original, most likely due to improvements in production. A limited production run of bright nickel-plated, non-Thunder Ranch models were made. Only select firearm dealers {{were considered to be}} allowed to sell this particular model. A certain number of Model 22s were made with a case-hardened (case color) finish by Turnbull Restorations. These came in both 4" [...] and (limited) 5.5" [...] Barrel lengths. The finish done by Turnbull is a true case-hardened finish and not the chemical wash finish found on firearms by other manufacturers.|$|R
40|$|A don/doff {{support stand}} {{for use with}} rear entry space suits is disclosed. The support stand is {{designed}} for use in one-g environments; however, certain features of the stand {{can be used on}} future space-craft, lunar or planetary bases. The present invention has a retainer which receives a protruding <b>lug</b> <b>fixed</b> on the torso section of the space suit. When the lug is locked in the retainer, the space suit is held in a generally upright position. In a one-g environment a portable ladder is positioned adjacent to the rear entry of the space suit supported by the stand. The astronaut climbs up the ladder and grasps a hand bar assembly positioned above the rear entry. The astronaut then slips his legs through the open rear entry and down into the abdominal portion of the suit. The astronaut then lowers himself fully into the suit. The portable ladder is then removed and the astronaut can close the rear entry door. The lug is then disengaged from the retainer and the astronaut is free to engage in training exercises in the suit. When suit use is over, the astronaut returns to the stand and inserts the lug into the retainer. A technician repositions the ladder. The astronaut opens the rear entry door, grasps the hand bar assembly and does a chin-up to extricate himself from the suit. The astronaut climbs down the movable ladder while the suit is supported by the stand...|$|R
