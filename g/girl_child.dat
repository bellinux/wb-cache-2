Although not explicitly {{included in the}} original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the percentage of women aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with empowering women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the <b>Girl</b> <b>Child</b> in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the biggest}} reason for {{increase}} in female infanticide is being associated {{with the increase in}} number of private Ultrasound Scanning Centres which often tell the sex of baby, and as they become more accessible and affordable people who could not find out the sex of baby historically, have started finding it out and often results in abortion in case of <b>girl</b> <b>child.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1991 the <b>Girl</b> <b>Child</b> Protection Scheme was launched. This {{operates}} as a long-term financial incentive, with rural families having to meet certain obligations such as sterilisation of the mother. Once the obligations are met, the state puts aside 2000 in a state-run fund. The fund, which should grow to 10,000, is released to the daughter when she is 20: she can use it either to marry or to pursue higher education.|$|E
25|$|Exception 2 {{of section}} 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), {{which deals with}} the {{punishment}} for rape, stated that “sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.” However, the same provision states that a man is said to commit rape if he has sexual relations with a woman with or without her consent, when she is under 18 years of age. Thus, there was a discrepancy between the two sub-clauses. Independent Thought, a non-governmental organisation, in a petition in 2013, had challenged Exception 2. In a landmark ruling on 11 October 2017, the supreme court upheld the age of consent as 18 years. The {{court held that the}} distinction made between a married <b>girl</b> <b>child</b> and an unmarried <b>girl</b> <b>child</b> was illogical and ran against the provisions of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Such a distinction also violated a child’s right to liberty and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. Irrespective of her marital status, sex with a minor girl will now attract a minimum rigorous imprisonment of ten years. Two other significant statues undermined by the IPC section were the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and the Juvenile Justice Act, both of which defines a child as someone below the age of 18.|$|E

25|$|Accustomed {{to writing}} the scripts for movies, Gowariker {{said that he}} found it {{difficult}} to write the script for Everest.

Rather, it is written as the soap opera goes on, analysing various factors such as the TRPs (television rating points) and the audience feedback. Everest, however, was not written this way. Gowariker has also said that it was while writing the story that he realised the self-satisfaction that people get after climbing Mount Everest. After finishing writing the story, he realised not only that he wanted to produce the show, but also that he also needed experts to direct it.

Missionaries such as Ruth Brouwer Crompton, identified the factors responsible for shaping the intellectual climate among Telugu Christians: (1) increased leisure (2) the higher education; study beyond the level of secondary education. Institutions of higher education include not only colleges and universities but also professional schools in such fields as law, theology, medicine, business, music, and art.

500|$|UN Women {{believe that}} {{violence}} against women [...] "is rooted in gender-based discrimination and social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate such violence", and advocate moving from supporting victims to prevention, through addressing root and structural causes.

This strategy, which involves broad educational and cultural change, also involves implementing {{the recommendations of the}} 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (2013).

40|$|Summary We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} agricultural credit program participation on children's school attendance in rural Malawi. Our paired-site sampling survey reveals that credit uptake decreased school attendance by young <b>girl</b> <b>children.</b> This finding raises concerns that young <b>girl</b> <b>children</b> are exploited as child labor, either {{at home or in}} the field, when working adults become more involved in income-generating activities financed by credit. The data, however, do not show clear evidence for young girls staying at home to do household chores or working in the fields in households that obtained credit, but instead find simultaneous occurrence between attending school and taking responsibilities for domestic chores by young children. It would appear, therefore, that credit uptake delays the realization of this concurrence among young <b>girl</b> <b>children</b> and leads to delayed school enrollment. micro-credit education child labor Sub-Saharan Africa Malawi...|$|R
