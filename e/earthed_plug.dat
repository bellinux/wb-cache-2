In her 1914 book Electric cooking, heating, cleaning, etc. Maud Lucas Lancaster mentions an earthed iron-clad plug and socket by the English firm of Reyrolle and Co. The earliest American patent application for an <b>earthed</b> <b>plug</b> appears to be 11 January 1915 by George P. Knapp, {{on behalf of the}} Harvey Hubbell company. This patent covers the use of an earthing pin which extends further than the other two contacts to ensure that it is engaged first. Knapp's design was obsoleted in the US before the modern NEMA designations, but is still used in some other countries including China, Argentina and Australia. The configuration of the socket was not operable with existing two-contact unearthed plugs. Other earthed sockets that are widely used in the US today are operable with unearthed plugs. [...] It is sometimes claimed (e.g., in Illumin) that the modern American version of the <b>earthed</b> <b>plug,</b> was invented by Philip F. Labre who was issued a US patent for an earthed socket and plug in 1928. However, Labre's design is no more similar to the modern version than Knapp's earlier design.|$|E

50|$|Some {{changes have}} been made to the Waterway's {{original}} shape since the construction of the By-Pass. The most significant modification is an <b>earth</b> <b>plug</b> that bisects the Waterway along Ontario Highway 58A (between Humberstone Road and Townline Tunnel Road). This was necessary due to very long (4 km, or 2.5 miles) low-grade approaches to the Townline Tunnel required for trains to travel underneath the new canal segment.|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} ratings of {{plug and socket}} in BS546, (2A, 5A, 15A and 30A).

In practice most BS546 plugs are unfused with fused versions being unusual and expensive.|$|R

5000|$|The tunnel is 330 metres (1083 ft) {{long and}} 35 metres (115 ft) wide. The low grade {{required}} for trains makes necessary that each {{approach to the}} tunnel stretch be 4 km (2.5 miles).

As well, a solid <b>earth</b> <b>plug</b> had to be put into the Welland Recreational Waterway (the old alignment of the canal), cutting it in two (satellite photo). The construction cost was $40 million. The middle rail line was removed in the 1990s and the two remaining tracks now serve as the CPR Hamilton Subdivision and the CPR Brookfield Siding. Townline Tunnel is known locally as the [...] "Stinky Tunnel" [...] due to the strong odor of rotten eggs as one passes through it.|$|R

The {{majority}} of the route follows Townline Road, although a short section at the eastern end travels along Reaker Road and Netherby Road. Beginning at the northern terminus of the southern section of Highway58, the highway travels east, parallel with two railway lines. The road intersects Canal Bank Road (north) / The Kingsway (south) after crossing an <b>earth</b> <b>plug</b> on the old Welland Canal, now the Welland Recreational Waterway. It then curves slightly southwards and begins descending towards the Townline Tunnel. It encounters Humberstone Road and then passes beneath a railway prior to entering the tunnel. At the eastern end of the tunnel, the route encounters Rusholme Road before passing beneath Highway140. It turns north onto Reaker Road and then west onto Netherby Road to end at an at-grade intersection with Highway140.|$|R
