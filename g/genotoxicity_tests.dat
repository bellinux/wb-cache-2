40|$|At {{a recent}} ECVAM {{workshop}} considering {{ways to reduce}} the frequency of irrelevant positive results in mammalian cell <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> [1], recommendations for improvements/modifications to existing tests, and suggestions for new assays were made. Following on from this, it was important to identify chemicals {{that could be used in}} the evaluation of modified or new assays. An expert panel was therefore convened and recommendations made for chemicals to fit 3 different sets of characteristics, namely: ¿	Group 1 : Chemicals that should be detected as positive in in vitro mammalian cell <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests.</b> Chemicals in this group are all in vivo genotoxins, either due to DNA-reactive or non DNA-reactive mechanisms (e. g. induction of aneuploidy, inhibition of topoisomerase). Most of them are also known carcinogens with a mutagenic mode of action. ¿	Group 2 : Chemicals that should give negative results in in vitro cell <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> and routinely do give negative results in existing in vitro mammalian cell <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests.</b> Chemicals in this group are usually negative in in vivo <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> (when tested) and non-DNA-reactive. They are either non-carcinogenic or rodent carcinogens with an assumed non-mutagenic mode of action. ¿	Group 3 : Chemicals that should give negative results in in vitro mammalian cell <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests,</b> but have been reported to induce chromosomal aberrations or tk mutations in mouse lymphoma cells, often at high concentrations or at high levels of cytotoxicity. Chemicals in this group are generally negative in in vivo genotoxicity studies (when tested) and negative in the Ames test. They are either non-carcinogenic or rodent carcinogens with an assumed non-mutagenic mode of action. This paper therefore contains these three recommended lists of chemicals and describes how these should be used for any test evaluation programme. JRC. I. 2 -In-vitro Toxicolog...|$|E

This is a novel, cost-effective genotoxicity screen, developed {{to provide a}} pre-regulatory screening assay {{for use by the}} pharmaceutical industry and in other applications where significant numbers of compounds need to be tested.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown the {{presence}} of numerous organic genotoxins and carcinogens in drinking water. These toxic substances derive not only from pollution, {{but also from the}} disinfection treatments, particularly when water is obtained from surface sources and then chlorinated. Most of the chlorinated compounds in drinking water are nonvolatile and are difficult to characterize. Thus, it has been proposed to study such complex mixtures using short-term <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> predictive of carcinogenic activity. Mutagenicity of water before and after disinfection has mainly been studied by the Salmonella/microsome (Ames test); in vitro <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> have also been performed in yeasts and mammalian cells; in situ monitoring of genotoxins has also been performed using complete organisms such as aquatic animals or plants (in vivo). The combination of bioassay data together with results of chemical analyses would give us a more firm basis for the assessment of human health risks related to the consumption of drinking water.

40|$|AbstractFor the {{assessment}} of genotoxic effects of cosmetic ingredients, a number of well-established and regulatory accepted in vitro assays are in place. A caveat {{to the use of}} these assays is their relatively low specificity and high rate of false or misleading positive results. Due to the 7 th amendment to the EU Cosmetics Directive ban on in vivo genotoxicity testing for cosmetics that was enacted March 2009, it is no longer possible to conduct follow-up in vivo <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> for cosmetic ingredients positive in in vitro <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> to further assess the relevance of the in vitro findings. COLIPA, the European Cosmetics Association, has initiated a research programme to improve existing and develop new in vitro methods.

40|$|Workshop {{participants}} {{agreed that}} <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> in mammalian cells in vitro produce a remarkably high and unacceptable occurrence of irrelevant positive results (e. g. {{when compared with}} rodent carcinogenicity). As reported in several recent reviews, the rate of irrelevant positives (i. e. low specificity) for some studies using in vitro methods (when compared to this "gold standard") means that an increased number of test articles are subjected to additional in vivo genotoxicity testing, in many cases before e. g. the efficacy (in the case of pharmaceuticals) of the compound has been evaluated. If in vitro tests were more predictive for in vivo genotoxicity and carcinogenicity (i. e. fewer false positives) {{then there would be}} a significant {{reduction in the number of}} animals used. Beyond animal (or human) carcinogenicity as the "gold standard", it is acknowledged that <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> provide much information about cellular behaviour, cell division processes and cellular fate to a (geno) toxic insult. Since the disease impact of these effects is seldomly known, and a verification of relevant toxicity is normally also the subject of (sub) chronic animal studies, the prediction of in vivo relevant results from in vitro <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>tests</b> is also important for aspects that may not have a direct impact on carcinogenesis as the ultimate endpoint of concern. In order to address the high rate of in vitro false positive results, a 2 -day workshop was held at the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), Ispra, Italy in April 2006. More than 20 genotoxicity experts from academia, government and industry were invited to review data from the currently available cell systems, to discuss whether there exist cells and test systems that have a reduced tendency to false positive results, to review potential modifications to existing protocols and cell systems that might result in improved specificity, and to review the performance of some new test systems that show promise of improved specificity without sacrificing sensitivity.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the in vitro {{mammalian}} cell tests currently used to identify genotoxins {{has been shown to}} be limited by a high rate of false-positive results, triggering further unnecessary testing in vivo. During an European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods workshop on how to improve the specificity of these assays, testing at high concentrations was identified as one possible source of false positives. Thus far, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>test</b> guidelines have required testing of chemicals using mammalian cells in vitro should be undertaken to concentrations as high as 10 mM (5000 mg/ml). Recently, a draft revision of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>test</b> guidelines has recommended that testing concentrations should be reduced to 1 mM (500 mg/ml). To assess the impact that this lowering would have on the outcome of in vitro <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>testing,</b> we established a database of 384 chemicals classified as rodent carcinogens and reported Ames test results and the test concentrations that produced positive results in the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA), in vitro chromosome aberration (CA) assay and in vitro micronucleus <b>test.</b> <b>Genotoxicity</b> <b>testing</b> results were illustrated for 229 and 338 compounds in the MLA and in vitro CA assay, respectively. Of these test compounds, 62. 5 % produced positive results in the MLA, of which 20. 3 % required testing between 1 and 10 mM. A total of 58. 0 % produced positive results in in vitro CA assays, of which 25. 0 %required testing between 1 and 10 mM. If the testing concentration limit for mammalian cell assays was reduced to 1 mM, 24 (6. 25 %) potential carcinogens would not be detected in any part of the standard in vitro <b>genotoxicity</b> <b>test</b> battery (Ames test, MLA and in vitro CA assay).

40|$|Positive genetic {{toxicity}} data suggest carcinogenic hazard, {{and this can}} stop a candidate pharmaceutical reaching the clinic.

Even treatment with EMS did not induce toxicity compared to untreated tissue control. As expected, DNA single-strand breaks were increased dose-dependently and significantly after exposure to EMS. Here, tail length rose from 24 µm to 75 µm. In contrast, formalin resulted in a significant induction of DNA cross-links.
