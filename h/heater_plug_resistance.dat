30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  16, {{the value of}} soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> of {{numerical}} solution is slightly {{greater than that of}} analytic solution at the early stage of sleeve driving. When the sleeve reaches a certain depth, the numerical solution agrees well with analytic solution, and this certain depth is defined as minimum critical depth. Because the arching effect is weak during the penetration of sleeve, the soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> is withstood by the whole soil plug. As a result, the numerical solution obtained from the integral along the sleeve length is larger than the analytic solution obtained from the integral along the active height of soil plug. When the sleeve is driven into deep soil layers, an obvious arching effect occurs in soil plug. At this time, the soils within the active height of soil plug undertake the major part of the soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance,</b> and soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> obtained from the numerical simulation is identical to that given by analytic study. As the penetration depth increases, a maximum critical depth exists in the penetration process. When the penetration depth is deeper than the maximum critical depth, the numerical solution of soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> is smaller than analytic solution. This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} fact that the cyclic shearing and sliding between the sleeve wall and deep soils lead to plastic failure in soils.|$|R

Distinctly, when f ≥  25  Hz, a more precise solution of soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> can be obtained by Eq. (16). The regression analysis indicates that the minimum critical depth is 3.2 D, and the maximum critical depth is 15.5 D. Therefore, the soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> obtained from the Eq.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of field tests performed to study the effect of soil plugging during installation on the base resistance developed by an open-ended (pipe) pile in clay. Three instrumented pipe piles were installed in soft clay, and the installation <b>resistance</b> and soil <b>plug</b> development were recorded. The tests revealed that the annular base resistance was equal to the cone penetration test q c resistance and was independent of the soil plug development. In contrast, the soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> increased from a minimum when the pile was fully coring to a maximum when the pile was fully plugged. A simple expression is proposed that links the <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> to the cone penetration test q c value at the specified depth and the incremental filling ratio value developed during installation. This expression is shown to provide reasonable estimates of the <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> developed by a large-diameter pipe pile driven into stiff to hard clay in the North Sea.

40|$|Variability {{characterization}} {{and analysis}} in advanced technologies {{are needed to}} ensure robust performance as well as improved process capability. This thesis presents a framework for device variability characterization and analysis. Test structure and test circuit design, identification of significant effects in design of experiments, and decomposition approaches to quantify variation and its sources are explored. Two examples of transistor variability characterization are discussed: contact <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> variation {{within the context of}} a transistor, and AC, or short time-scale, variation in transistors. Results show that, with careful test structure and circuit design and ample measurement data, interesting trends can be observed. Among these trends are (1) a distinct within-die spatial signature of contact <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> and (2) a picosecond-accuracy delay measurement on transistors which reveals the presence of excessive external parasitic gate resistance. Measurement results obtained from these test vehicles can aid in both the understanding of variations in the fabrication process and in efforts to model variations in transistor behavior. by Karthik Balakrishnan.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{contacts}} on device and circuit performance is becoming larger with technology scaling because of higher resistance {{as well as}} increased variability. Thus, techniques are needed for measurement, analysis, and modeling of variation in contacts, and for devices, interconnects, and circuits in general, {{in order to ensure}} robust circuit design. A test chip for characterizing contact <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> variability is designed in a 90 nm CMOS process. Each chip is capable of characterizing over 35, 000 devices under test. Statistical analysis of the measurement results show that the contact <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> changes as a function of key layout parameters, such as the distance from the contact to the polysilicon gate and the distance from the contact {{to the edge of the}} diffusion region. Spatial variation analysis shows that the resistance distribution has a systematic die-to-die pattern, possibly caused by variability in the lithography process. Spatial correlation analysis is also performed to identify the possibility of additional systematic trends or separation-distance dependent correlated random variation. Results of these analyses motivate the need for both numerical and compact models for contacts which incorporate variability information. Samsung ElectronicsFocus Center Research Progra...|$|R
30|$|According to the coupled finite-infinite element {{modelling}} of sleeve penetration by vibratory hammers, {{the soil}} plugging effect during the penetration was investigated. The main conclusions were as followings: (1) During vibratory sleeve driving, the soil strength and cohesion decrease, which is induced by cyclic shearing action. As a result, soil plug is partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance {{is less than}} those by other installation methods; (2) In the vibratory penetration process, annular soil arches form inside the soil plug, which induces an obvious increase in internal shaft resistance. The soils within the active height of the soil plug undertake the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance; (3) A threshold value exists in the influence of the vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance. When the vibration frequency is less than the threshold value, internal shaft resistance decreases with the increase in vibratory frequency, which correspondingly reduces the degree of soil plug. When the vibration frequency reaches the threshold value, the influence of vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance can be ignored. Hence, the vibration frequency has little influence on the degree of soil plug; (4) The internal shaft resistance of the sleeve end gradually decreases as the sleeve diameter increases, while the internal shaft resistance in {{the upper part of the}} sleeves increases as the sleeve diameter increases. Moreover, the increase in sleeve diameter gradually decreases the degree of the soil plug. The internal shaft resistance depends closely on the soil layer properties as well; (5) During penetration of the sleeve, the distribution of soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> along the height of soil plug can be described by index curve. Soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> is mainly undertaken by the soils within the active height of soil plug. At the same time, the analytic expression of soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> during vibratory driving was given under the conditions of f ≥  25  Hz and 3.2 D < H <  15.5 D.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for estimating the base capacity of open-ended steel pipe piles in sand, a difficult problem involving great uncertainty in pile foundation design. The method, {{referred to as}} the Hong Kong University (HKU) method, is based on the cone penetration test (CPT), and takes into consideration the mechanisms of annulus and <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> mobilization. In this method the annulus resistance is properly linked to the ratio of the pile length to the diameter-a key factor reflecting the influence of pile embedment-whereas the <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> is related to the plug length ratio, which reflects the degree of soil plugging in a practical yet rational way. The cone tip resistance is averaged over a zone {{in the vicinity of the}} pile base by taking into account the failure mechanism of the piles in sand, the condition of pile embedment (i. e., full or partial embedment), and the effect of soil compressibility. The predictive performance of the new method is assessed against a number of well-documented field tests including two fully instrumented large-diameter offshore piles, and through comparisons with major CPT-based methods in current engineering practice. The assessment indicates that the HKU method has attractive capabilities and advantages that render it a promising option. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. <b>Heater</b> <b>plugs</b> were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit.

40|$|The use of cone {{penetration}} test results to evaluate the capacity of single piles, referred to as in-situ test-based design method in China, is restricted largely to precast concrete piles. This method may not be applicable to small-displacement steel pipe piles which further encounters the problem of soil plug. Attempts have been made overseas {{for the design of}} steel pipe piles such as the ICP and UWA methods and more recently the HKU method developed by the authors. The three methods have similar theoretical background, and they all correlate the base and shaft resistances to the cone tip resistance. The predicted capacities of full-scale test piles, however, differ significantly. Such uncertainty is associated with several important factors such as separate/combining evaluation of the annulus and <b>plug</b> <b>resistances,</b> proper considerations of influence zone and friction fatigue and, utilization of plug indices to include the effects of partial plugging and soil displacement due to driving. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In the latter case, we identify the source of the instability to be a combination of a flow memory resulting from liquid film deposition on the walls and a lubrication effect, i. e. a reduction of the <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> to motion when the walls are prewetted. Second, we show that contrary to unidirectional pressure forcing, cyclic forcing enables breaking of large plugs in confined space though it requires longer times.

30|$|During {{driving sleeve}} of cast-in-place piles by {{vibratory}} hammers, soils were squeezed into sleeve and then soil plugging was formed. The physic-mechanical {{properties of the}} soil plug have direct influence on the load transmission between the sleeve wall and soil plug. Nevertheless, the researches on this issue are insufficient. In this study, finite element and infinite element coupling model was introduced, through the commercial code ABAQUS, to simulate the full penetration process of the sleeve driven from the ground surface to the desired depth by applying vibratory hammers. The research {{results indicated that the}} cyclic shearing action decreases both in soil shear strength and in granular cementation force when the sleeve is driven by vibratory hammers, which leads to a partially plugged mode of the soil plug inside the sleeve. Accordingly, the penetration resistance of sleeve driven by vibratory hammers is the smallest compared to those by other installation methods. When driving the sleeve, the annular soil arches forming in the soil plug at sleeve end induce a significant rise in the internal shaft resistance. Moreover, the influence of vibration frequencies, sleeve diameters, and soil layer properties on the soil plug was investigated in detail, {{and at the same time}} improved formulas were brought forward to describe the soil <b>plug</b> <b>resistance</b> inside vibratory driven sleeve.|$|R
30|$|The {{differences}} in gel properties and flooding depth under different vibrating time {{might account for}} above results. Gel strength, under vibration after gel cross-linking, was reduced obviously, which had caused decline in <b>plugging</b> ratio and <b>resistance</b> factor in the core. The increased matrix permeability and the looser cementation under vibration might {{also play a role}} in reducing the plugging effect. Gelation change under short-time vibration in induction stage and accelerating stage had proved that gel strength was scarcely influenced when gel was injected under vibration. About the increase in <b>plugging</b> ratio and <b>resistance</b> factor, another factor, the gel injection depth, might play a main role. As mentioned in introduction, low-frequency vibration could increase the fluid flow in porous media, so gel was easy to be impulsively displaced forward when its viscosity was relatively much low during the gel injection process. The increase in gel injection depth enabled the decrease in overall permeability and degree of water channeling.|$|R

Sulfuric acid controls are becoming of increased interest for coal-fired power generating units for a number of reasons. In particular, sulfuric acid can cause plant operation problems such as air <b>heater</b> <b>plugging</b> and fouling, back-end corrosion, and plume opacity. These issues will likely be exacerbated with the retrofit of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOX control, as SCR catalysts are known to further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO{sub 2 } to SO{sub 3 }. The project tested the effectiveness of furnace injection of four different magnesium-based or dolomitic alkaline sorbents on full-scale utility boilers. These reagents were tested during one- to two-week tests conducted on two FirstEnergy Bruce Mansfield Plant (BMP) units. One of the sorbents tested was a magnesium hydroxide slurry byproduct from a modified Thiosorbic{reg_sign} Lime wet flue gas desulfurization process. The other three sorbents are available commercially and include dolomite, pressure-hydrated dolomitic lime, and commercially available magnesium hydroxide. The dolomite reagent was injected as a dry powder through out-of-service burners. The other three reagents were injected as slurries through air-atomizing nozzles inserted through the front wall of the upper furnace. After completing the four one- to two-week tests, the most promising sorbents were selected for longer-term (approximately 25 -day) full-scale tests on two different units. The longer-term tests were conducted to confirm sorbent effectiveness over extended operation on two different boilers, and to determine balance-of-plant impacts. The first long-term test was conducted on FirstEnergy's BMP Unit 3, and the second was conducted on AEP's Gavin Plant, Unit 1. The Gavin Plant test provided an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sorbent injected into the furnace on SO{sub 3 } formed across an operating SCR reactor. A final task in the project was to compare projected costs for furnace injection of magnesium hydroxide slurries to estimated costs for other potential sulfuric acid control technologies.

The molar ratio of alkali to flue gas sulfuric acid content (under baseline conditions) required to achieve 90 % sulfuric acid removal was lowest for the byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry. However, this result may be confounded because this {{was the only one of}} the three slurries tested with injection near the top of the furnace across from the pendant superheater platens.

The Gavin Plant testing provided an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sorbent injected into the furnace on SO{sub 3 } formed across an operating SCR reactor. This report presents the results from those long-term tests. The tests determined the effectiveness of injecting commercially available magnesium hydroxide slurry (Gavin Plant) and byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry (both Gavin Plant and BMP) for sulfuric acid control. The results show that injecting either slurry could achieve up to 70 to 75 % overall sulfuric acid removal. At BMP, this overall removal was limited by the need to maintain acceptable electrostatic precipitator (ESP) particulate control performance. At Gavin Plant, the overall sulfuric acid removal was limited because the furnace injected sorbent was less effective at removing SO{sub 3 } formed across the SCR system installed on the unit for NOX control than at removing SO{sub 3 } formed in the furnace. The long-term tests also determined balance-of-plant impacts from slurry injection during the two tests. These include impacts on boiler back-end temperatures and pressure drops, SCR catalyst properties, ESP performance, removal of other flue gas species, and flue gas opacity.

Nitro vehicles also require a means of cranking the engine over, which can be achieved using a pullstart, starterbox, battery operated rotostart, or by an electric drill. Relatively expensive model fuel, spare glow-plugs, and after-run oil are also needed. Gasoline-powered vehicles require only a receiver battery pack and a means to start the engine, usually the included pullstart. Hobby-grade vehicles almost always require 8 AA size batteries to power the transmitter, though some can use rechargeable transmitter pack or simply rechargeable AAs.|$|R
40|$|A cadmium {{resistance}} gene, designated cadD, {{has been}} identified in and cloned from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pRW 001. The gene {{is part of a}} two-component operon which contains the resistance gene cadD and an inactive regulatory gene, cadX*. A high degree of sequence similarity was observed between cadD and the cadB-like gene from S. lugdunensis, but no significant similarity was found with either cadA or cadB from the S. aureus plasmids pI 258 and pII 147. The positive regulatory gene cadX* is identical to cadX from pLUG 10 over a stretch of 78 codons beginning at the N terminus, but it is truncated at this point and inactive. Sequence analysis showed that the cadmium resistance operon resides on a 3, 972 -bp element that is flanked by direct repeats of IS 257. The expression of cadD in S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis resulted in low-level resistance to cadmium; in contrast, cadA and cadB from S. aureus induced higher level resistance. However, when the truncated version of cadX contained in pRW 001 is complemented in trans with cadX from plasmid <b>pLUG</b> 10, <b>resistance</b> increased approximately 10 -fold suggesting that the cadmium resistance operons from pRW 001 and pLUG 10 are evolutionarily related. Moreover, the truncated version of cadX contained in pRW 001 is nonfunctional and may have been generated by deletion during recombination to acquire the cadmium resistance element...|$|R
40|$|Wind, {{wave and}} current forces cause {{significant}} overturning loads to be transmitted to foundation systems of fixed-bottom offshore structures, while buoyancy forces, {{in conjunction with}} environmental loading, impart direct tensile loads to foundations of floating facilities. Shallow skirted foundations are a potentially attractive foundation solution when overturning or tension loading is significant, as suctions mobilised within the soil <b>plug</b> provide tensile <b>resistance.</b> While passive suctions are maintained, undrained reverse end bearing will govern failure providing enhanced uplift resistance compared with vented pull-out of the foundation unit (with or without the soil plug), governed by skirt/soil friction. Currently uncertainty exists over the limiting ratio of skirt depth to foundation diameter to mobilise undrained reverse end bearing and the duration over which passive suctions can be sustained. This paper reports results from beam centrifuge tests investigating the response of shallow skirted foundations in lightly over-consolidated clay to concentric transient and sustained uplift. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical timber {{connections}} {{can fail}} both in a brittle and a ductile manner {{depending on the}} joint layout. Plug shear failure in nailed timber connections is a brittle failure mode, which shall be avoided in timber structures. This failure mode occurs in nailed connections loaded in tension parallel to the grain, for instance in the lower chord of a timber truss. The failure mode is not described in the Swedish building code of today, {{but there is an}} informative annex in the upcoming Eurocode 5 concerning the subject. In the thesis, plug shear failure is studied and a new prediction model developed based on experimental work on nailed steel-to-timber connections. The experiments were short-term experiments and the effect of long-term conditions is not considered. The total amount of joints tested was 86, which together with results from other researchers formed the base for the prediction model. The stress state and the effect of fastener placement were analysed and showed that plug shear failure is initiated at the nail farthest from the free end of timber. Increased spacing between fasteners lessens the risk for plug shear failure to occur, especially the spacing perpendicular to the grain is important. The prediction model is based on structural mechanics and suggests that the <b>plug</b> shear <b>resistance</b> R = blfv, where b is the joint width, l the joint length and fv the shear strength of wood. The shear strength is determined through fv = KAs- 0. 25, where As = bl and K is a constant. Furthermore, an analysis based on fracture mechanics was performed showing the importance of the softening behaviour of the joint failure. The overall goal with the development of a prediction model is to avoid brittle failures and promote ductile failures. As a tool to promote ductile failures, a measure was developed to aid the designer in designing ductile and strong joints. Recommendations on nail spacing and overall design of the joint are finally given with the aim to avoid plug shear failure. Godkänd; 2004; 20061030 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|For {{the large}} pores and cracks of {{reservoirs}} with low temperatures, high salinity, and low permeability, {{a new type}} of high strength gel ABP system is developed in this paper. The defects of conventional gels such as weak gel strength, no gelling, and easy dehydration are overcome under the conditions of low temperature and high salinity. The temperature and salt <b>resistance,</b> <b>plugging</b> characteristics, and EOR of the gel system are studied. Under the condition of 32 °C and 29500 [*]mg/L salinity, the ABP system formulation is for 0. 3 % crosslinking agent A + 0. 09 % coagulant B + 3500 [*]mg/L polymer solution P. The results show that when the temperature was increased, the delayed crosslinking time of the system was shortened and the gel strength was increased. The good plugging characteristics of the ABP system were reached, and the plugging rate was greater than 99 % in cores with different permeability. A good profile control performance was achieved, and the recovery rate was improved by 19. 27 % on the basis of water flooding. In the practical application of the gel system, the salinity of formation water and the permeability of fractures are necessary to determine the appropriate formulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the bearing {{capacity}} of soil <b>plugs</b> (internal shaft <b>resistance)</b> through fundamental research on the bearing mechanism of dry silica sand plugs. Push-up load tests on the dry silica sand plugs inside a model pipe pile and DEM simulations were carried out to investigate the plugging behaviour. The influences of the packing state of the soil plugs (the relative density), and {{the height of the}} plugs on the bearing capacity were investigated. Prior to the pushup load tests, element tests on the silica sand and DEM analyses were performed to characterise the silica sand and to determine suitable DEM analysis parameters. The experimental and DEM results clearly show that the push-up force increases significantly with the increase in the aspect ratio of the soil plug, H/D, and with the relative density of the soil plug. The DEM analyses show a good agreement with the experimental results when the push-up force is small. Furthermore, the DEM results reveal that only the density of the soil plug in the lower portion, adjacent to the pile tip, increases gradually with the increase in the push-up displacement as well as the increase in H/D. Hence, it is the lower portion of the soil plug that mainly controls the capacity of the soil plug...|$|R
