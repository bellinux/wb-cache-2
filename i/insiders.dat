40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first comprehensive}} global study of <b>insider</b> trading laws and their first enforcement. In a sample of 4, 541 acquisitions from 52 countries, I find that <b>insider</b> trading enforcement increases both the incidence, and the profitability of <b>insider</b> trading.

40|$|A {{framework}} for understanding and predicting <b>insider</b> attacks In this paper an <b>insider</b> attack {{is considered to be}} deliberate misuse by those who are authorized to use computers and networks. Applying this definition in real-life settings {{to determine whether or not}} an attack was caused by an <b>insider</b> is often, however, anything but straightforward. We know very little about <b>insider</b> attacks, and misconceptions concerning <b>insider</b> attacks abound. The belief that “most attacks come from inside ” is held by many information security professionals, for example, even though empirical statistics and firewall logs indicate otherwise. This paper presents a framework based on previous studies and models of <b>insider</b> behavior as well as firsthand experience in dealing with <b>insider</b> attacks. This framework defines relevant types of <b>insider</b> attack-related behaviors and symptoms—“indicators ” that include deliberate markers, meaningful errors, preparatory behaviors, correlated usage patterns, verbal behavior and personality traits. From these sets of indicators, clues can be pieced together to predict and detect an attack. The presence of numerous small clues necessitates the use of quantitative methods; multiple regression equations appear to be a particularly promising approach for quantifying prediction.

40|$|<b>Insider</b> trading {{has been}} a widely {{discussed}} topic since the 1980 s. Apart from discussing whether <b>insider</b> trading should exist, previous studies gradually began to study the factors affecting <b>insider</b> trades. This study establishes a market equilibrium model to identify factors that may affect the expected earnings and expected losses in <b>insider</b> trades. It also offers new evidence that factors, such as social factors, cost factors, moral factors, and bad news factors, may affect evaluation of the expected earnings and expected losses in <b>insider</b> trades.

40|$|<b>Insider</b> trading {{activity}} contains important information for understanding momentum.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the verdict of acquittal in “Sweden’s largest <b>insider</b> trading case” once again a debate concerning illegal <b>insider</b> trading has arisen and a lot of criticism is directed towards the laws. The purpose of this master´s thesis is to investigate the occurrence of <b>insider</b> trading and whether or not Swedish legislation has decreased the presence of <b>insider</b> trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. For this purpose the legal aspects and relevant arguments are presented and discussed. An event study is performed in order to see if profit warnings show evidence of <b>insider</b> trading on the Swedish stock exchange. The event study show statistically significant evidence of illegal <b>insider</b> trading in 21 out of 44 cases on the Stockholm stock exchange. There is no significant difference in <b>insider</b> trading between profit warnings and reversed profit warnings. The regression show evidence of that the law has had a small negative impact on <b>insider</b> trading in the sample which is surprising and that <b>insider</b> trading is industry correlated. The high frequency of <b>insider</b> trading shows evidence of that the laws are inefficient in stopping <b>insider</b> trading. Since {{it is clear that the}} law is seriously flawed in stopping <b>insider</b> trading and that <b>insider</b> trading actually may positively affect the market and its participants, it is argued that it is very questionable if the legislation is necessary and if <b>insider</b> trading should be prohibited at all...|$|R

The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry <b>insiders,</b> including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} and empirically {{explore the}} interaction between repurchases and <b>insider</b> trading as signaling devices about private information on firm valuation. Our theory predicts that repurchases, when coupled with <b>insider</b> buying, further the signal of firm undervaluation; <b>insider</b> selling signals the opposite. We find that for the following quarter, repurchases generate 1. 2 % abnormal returns on average, while repurchase with net <b>insider</b> buying generate 3. 7 % abnormal returns, an increase of 2. 5 %. While coupled with <b>insider</b> selling, the abnormal returns are not discernable, implying strong negative <b>insider</b> seller effects.

5|$|One of the {{principal}} RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learned of the invasion the warden, Charles Uwihoreye, telephoned the government in Kigali, to request instructions.

Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him to repeat the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually the RPF stormed the buildings, and the prisoners were saved.
