40|$|An altitude-test-chamber {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the operational characteristics and altitude blow-out limits of a Solar afterburner in a 24 C engine. At rated engine speed and maximum permissible turbine-discharge temperature, the altitude limit as determined by combustion blow-out occurred as a band of unstable operation of about 8000 feet altitude in width with maximum altitude limits from 32, 000 feet at a Mach number of 0. 3 to about 42, 000 feet at a Mach number of 1. 0. The maximum fuel-air ratio of the afterburner, as limited by maximum permissible turbine-discharge gas temperatures at rated engine speed, varied between 0. 0295 and 0. 0380 over a range of flight Mach numbers from 0. 25 to 1. 0 and at altitudes of 20, 000 and 30, 000 feet. Over this range of operating conditions, the fuel-air ratio at which lean blow-out occurred was from 10 to 19 percent below these maximum fuel-air ratios. Combustion was very smooth and uniform during operation; however, <b>ignition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>burner</b> was very difficult throughout the investigation.

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a model based on fundamental experimental data to predict lean flammability limit, L, and flame propagation velocity, Sb, for oxy-fuel combustion conditions. The basic model system {{consisted of two}} particles. One side of the two particles burns first, then, the other particle is ignited by the heat of combustion of the one burning particle. This phenomenon was defined as flame propagation. We analyzed at what distance the first burning particle could ignite the next particle (flame propagation distance d, and related to L), and how fast the first burning particle could ignite the next particle (flame propagation time s, and related to Sb) under various conditions. The proposed model was verified with data of both fundamental and pilot-and actual-scale experiments. We also applied the model to develop burner systems for lignite-fired oxy-fuel combustion. Local Sb and L near the <b>ignition</b> points <b>of</b> the <b>burner</b> systems could be analyzed from the concentration and temperature profiles of the general CFD results (k−ε method). Flame stability was judged by the calculated Sb and L profiles, and past results of blow-off limits obtained with actual- and pilot-scale experiments. We call this proposed technique flammability analysis. By using combination with the technique and Large Eddy Simulation, we could quickly clarify points for improvement <b>of</b> the <b>burner</b> systems. The calculated results were applied to a DS®T-burner designed by Hitachi Power Europe, installed at Schwarze Pumpe pilot plant...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} wherein wood shavings and Ponderosa pine needles in quiescent air {{were subjected to}} a steady radiation heat flux from a planar ceramic burner. The internal temperature of these particles was measured using fine diameter (0. 076 mm diameter) type K thermocouples. A narrow angle radiometer {{was used to determine}} the emissive power generated by the burner. A model was developed to predict the steady-state temperature of a cylindrical particle with an imposed radiation heat flux under both quiesc-ent air (buoyancy-induced cooling) and windy (forced convection cooling) conditions. Excellent agreement was observed between the model predictions and the experimental data. Parametric studies using the validated model explore the effect <b>of</b> <b>burner</b> (flame) tem-perature and distance, fuel size, and wind speed. The data suggest that <b>ignition</b> <b>of</b> the fuel element by radiation heating alone is likely only under circumstances where the fire is very intense (such as crown fires), and even then may still be dependent on pilot ignition sources...|$|R

The reason of failure was obtained based on the analysis of experimental data together with the structural study of the gasifier.
