5|$|Central Saint Giles is a mixed-use {{development}} in central London. Built {{at a cost}} of £450million and completed in May 2010, it was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano and is his first work in the UK. The development consists of two buildings of up to 15 storeys in height, arranged around a public courtyard lined with shops and restaurants. It is chiefly notable for its façades, covered with 134,000 <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles</b> in vivid shades of green, orange, lime and yellow. It has attracted a number of high-profile tenants including NBCUniversal, MindShare and Google.|$|E
5|$|When the {{building}} {{was transformed into a}} mosque from a cathedral, most of the previous Crusader construction was completely replaced, but the mosque's facade with its arched entrance is a typical piece of Crusader ecclesiastical architecture, and columns within the mosque compound still retain their Italian Gothic style. Some of the columns have been identified as elements of an ancient synagogue, reused as construction material in the Crusader era and still forming part of the mosque. Internally, the wall surfaces are plastered and painted. Marble is used for the western door and the dome's oculus. The floors are covered with <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles.</b> The columns are also marble and their capitals are built in Corinthian style.|$|E

25|$|The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3000 to 4000 {{years of}} {{architectural}} development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The post-Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, {{as well as}} surfaces that are richly decorated with <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles,</b> carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.|$|E
25|$|Ananda temple is a {{perfectly}} dimensioned stylistic structure, a fusion of Mon and Indian architectural styles and is the central monument built in the Pagan valley.

25|$|Located on {{a narrow}} plot in a {{suburban}} setting, the building itself is narrow, and has an austere façade which encloses the various rooms {{and a number of}} small courtyards. Surrounded by birch trees, the exterior walls are faced with white prefabricated concrete panels and white <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles.</b> The aluminium roof gives the church a rather industrial look. Glass sections provide lighting over the connecting corridors. Covering an area of 1,700 square meters, the tight geometrical plan consists of three sections and a courtyard between two parallel corridors.|$|E
25|$|For centuries, Arba Rukun (1269), the Friday mosque of Merca (1609) and Fakr ad-Din (1269) were, in fact, {{the only}} mosques in East Africa to have minarets. Fakr ad-Din, which {{dates back to}} the Mogadishan Golden Age, was built with marble and coral stone and {{included}} a compact rectangular plan with a domed mihrab axis. <b>Glazed</b> <b>tiles</b> were also used in the decoration of the mihrab, one of which bears a dated inscription. The 13th century Al Gami University consisted of a rectangular base with a large cylindrical tower architecturally unique in the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|The domes of the Safavid dynasty (1501–1732) are {{characterized}} by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated {{with a variety of}} colored <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles</b> and complex vegetal patterns, and they were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India. An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the Shah Cheragh (1852–1853), first appeared in the Qajar period. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, and domed cisterns and icehouses remain common sights in the countryside.|$|E

25|$|A {{miniature}} painted at Samarkand {{shows that}} bulbous cupolas {{were used to}} cover small wooden pavilions in Persia {{by the beginning of}} the fifteenth century. They gradually gained in popularity. The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors. The Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, situated in southern Kazakhstan was never finished, but has the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia, measuring 18.2m in diameter. The dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles</b> with gold patterns.|$|E
25|$|Traditional shophouses facade {{ornamentation}} draws {{inspiration from}} the Malay, Chinese and European traditions. European neo-classical motifs include egg-and-dart moldings and ionic or Corinthian capitals on decorative pillasters. From the Malay building tradition, elaborate woodwork has been borrowed {{in the form of}} carved panels. Fascia boards, louvres, screens and fretwork. Finally, from the Chinese tradition comes Sino-Portuguese influences and mythological motifs like phoenixes as well as butterfly-shaped windows. Other traditions include the use of Peranakan pastel coloured <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles,</b> often with floral or geometric motifs. The degree of a shophouse's ornamentation depended on the prosperity of its owner and the surrounding area; shophouse facades in cities and (former) boomtowns are generally more elaborate than spartan rural shophouses.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{examples}} of muqarnas domes are found in Iraq and the Jazira, dated {{from the middle of}} the twelfth century to the Mongol invasion. The use of stucco to form the muqarnas pattern, suspended by a wooden framework from the exterior vault, was the least common in Iraq, although it would be very popular in North Africa and Spain. Because it used two shells, however, windows were restricted to the bases of the domes. They were otherwise used frequently in this type. In Iraq, the most common form was a single shell of brick, with the reverse of the interior pattern visible on the exterior. The Damascus mausoleum of Nur al-Din (1172) and the shrine of Zumurrud Khatun in Baghdad are examples. A third type is found only in Mosul from the beginning of the thirteenth century. It has a brick pyramidal roof, usually covered in green <b>glazed</b> <b>tiles.</b> Of the five preserved examples, the finest is the shrine of Awn al-Din, which used tiny colored tiles to cover the muqarnas cells themselves and incorporates small muqarnas domes into the tiers of muqarnas supporting the large eight-sided star at the center. This design led to a further development at the shrine of Shaykh Abd al-Samad in Natanz, Iran.|$|E
