40|$|Aging-in-place is a {{well-established}} concept, but discussions rarely consider that many older adults live with pets. In a ‘pet-friendly’ city, we conducted semi-structured interviews to explore perspectives of community-based social support agencies that promote aging-in-place, {{and those of}} animal welfare agencies. Applying a relational ecology theoretical framework, we found that pets may contribute to feeling socially- situated, yet may also exacerbate constraints on autonomy experienced by some older adults. Pet-related considerations at times led to <b>discretionary</b> <b>acts</b> of more-than-human solidarity, but also created paradoxical situations for service-providers, impacting their efforts to assist older adults. A shortage of pet-friendly affordable housing emerged as an overarching challenge.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 1 st Aug 2018. The {{literature}} on “open innovation” so far focuses {{almost exclusively on}} strategic issues. In this largely conceptual paper we propose behavioral foundations for knowledge exchange and knowledge sharing to address this gap in the literature. Innovation and knowledge development that result from knowledge transfer, is an uncertain and cumulative process that typically involves a number of parties. Knowledge transfer between people and firms has been fruitfully studied from a structural or network perspective. The social network literature however, faces an “action problem”. Focusing on structural elements such as an agent’s position in a network {{and the types of}} relations entertained cannot explain why actors actually do share knowledge. The exchange of knowledge is elusive and is a <b>discretionary</b> <b>act</b> for the people involved, certainly in the case of open innovation (OI). It is argued here that social network analysis is to be complemented by the concept of gift exchange, drawing on social exchange literature. Gift exchange – following Mauss’ dictum to “give, receive and reciprocate”– establishes obligations between people especially under circumstances of ambiguity, which explain why and how knowledge exchange relations are established, persist, and may also end. Relationships in a social network and the social capital that inheres in these cannot be drawn on at will to exchange knowledge. These obligations established by gift exchange between individuals who share a connection explain why agents exchange knowledge with each other {{even in the absence of}} markets or hierarchy...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the plight of defectors from the Mujahedin-e Khalq ('MeK'), an Iranian {{opposition}} group hosted by Saddam Hussein in Iraq until the United States took control of their main camp, Camp Ashraf, in April 2003. In the period of US control, nearly 600 persons defected from the MeK. The US Army housed the defectors in what {{was known as the}} Temporary Internment and Protection Facility ('TIPF'). It was contractually agreed upon that the voluntary internment of the TIPF residents, who were granted refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2006, would end as soon a viable disposition option was available: either voluntary repatriation to Iran, local integration in Iraq or resettlement in a third state. For a group of approximately 200 refugees, none of these options were available when the US closed the TIPF in April 2008. These refugees were advised to make their way to Europe via Iraqi Kurdistan and Turkey. Most of them suffered extreme hardship along the way in the form of detention, refoulement and sometimes torture and death. The plight of the defectors raises a number of legal questions regarding the basis of their internment; the conformity with international humanitarian law in respect of their living conditions and treatment in the TIPF; and the lawfulness of their rather sudden release. The fact that, from the possible dispositions, only resettlement turned out to be appropriate {{raises the question of whether}} the US had, under these specific circumstances, an obligation to ensure the continued protection of those under its control by means of resettlement in the US or elsewhere, despite the fact that resettlement is, as a rule, a <b>discretionary</b> <b>act...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-cultural}} {{survey of}} 58 cultures was undertaken {{to investigate the}} thwarting-disorientation theory of suicide. It was hypothesized that suicide takes place in contexts in which a person's social ties are disrupted or threatened with disruption by the <b>discretionary</b> <b>acts</b> of himself or someone else. Also, it was posited that the more opportunities that a society provides for the occurrence of thwarting disorientation, the greater would be its suicide case rate. Evidence confirming these hypotheses was obtained. In {{the scientific study of}} suicide, two approaches have been most evident. The first, deriving its impetus from psychoanalytic theory, focuses the search for the cause of suicide upon the individual and his idiosyncratic history. The second derives from the sociologist Durkheim and his investigation of the influence of societal variables upon suicide rates. The theory of suicide investigated in this paper, the thwarting-disorientation theory, is an attempt to afford recognition to the interaction of both sociological and psychological factors in determining the suicidal act. The thwarting-disorientation (TD) theory of suicide developed from the work of Naroll (1962, 1963). He noted (1963), in a matrix of correlations generated to study a more general frustration-aggression hypothesis, significant correlations between the number of words written about suicide by ethnographers across a sample of 58 societies (see Table 1), and the presence of 7 culture traits: (1) marriage restriction (MR), (2) frequent warfare (FW), (3) drunken brawling (DB), (4) wifcheating (WB), (5) witchcraft accusation (WA), (6) men's divorce freedom (MDF), and (7) defiant homicide (DH). The greater the number of those traits present, the greater the number of words devoted to suicide.

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{analysis}} of immigration detention in Australia as the worst form of detention without trial. It {{is based on a}} border-control, anli-terrorist policy fortified by unconfined, unstructured and unchecked discretion by the executive and its officers. Such unfettered discretion has led to extraordinary injustices against detainees. This is so, despite judicial authority that states the assumption of the power of control over detained persons (while immigration eligibility is assessed) creates in the government a non-delegable duty to act to safeguard detainee welfare and rights. The plight of two women, Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez 1, one wrongfully detained, the other wrongfully deported under the Migration Act (Oh) 1958 has captured for the public, much of what is wrong with Australia's immigration processing system. Their experiences expose a system based on opaque unfettered discretion. Such discretion is buttressed by a culture of indifference to international human rights obligations, the abrogation of the Rule of Law, and the denial of natural justice. The article is divided into four parts. It begins with an overview of the architecture of the detention regime by way of background and to provide context to the discussion. Part two, the centrepiece of this article, is a chronology of discretionary decisions exercised during the detention of Ms Rau and Ms Alvarez. The chronology aims to illustrate the extent and impact of the innumerable <b>discretionary</b> <b>acts</b> and omissions committed by public officials and then, by privately contracted servants of the Commonweaith. It exposes the human consequences of the exercise of discretionary power without boundaries. It is by assembling the myriad of frequent failures by the Department of Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) and State mental health and missing persons systems that a sense of the magnitude of the dysfunctionality and hazards of unfettered discretion develops. Part three provides {{an analysis of}} the discourses of the various reports about the DIMIA's conduct in terms of the detention of Ms Rau and deportation of Ms Alvarez. Part four analyses the lack of accountability in these cases. It concludes with a review of the fortress! security state's responses to the recommendations made by the various reports on these detention scandals. ...|$|R
40|$|Does {{a liberal}} state have a {{legitimate}} interest in defining the terms of intimate relationships? Recently, several scholars have answered this question with a no {{and concluded that the}} state should abolish marriage, along with all other categories of intimate status. While politically infeasible, these proposals offer a powerful thought experiment. In this Article, I use this thought experiment to argue that the law cannot avoid relying on intimate-status norms and has legitimate reasons to retain an intimate status like marriage. The argument has three parts. The primary lesson of the thought experiment is that the state cannot abolish intimate status. Even if a state abolished formal status registries, private law would recreate ad hoc status distinctions. As long as intimates can bring claims against one another in contract, tort, or restitution, ordinary private-law doctrines will require judges or juries to interpret the parties’ legal rights in light of their relationship. The law might exempt intimates from these ordinary doctrines, but that would place a systemic status distinction at the heart of private law. Second, these private-law tailoring doctrines inevitably rely on intimate status, because intimate norms are what moral philosophers call “imperfect duties. ” A duty is imperfect when the actor has discretion to decide how and when to fulfill it. Whether a <b>discretionary</b> <b>act</b> fulfills an imperfect duty depends on whether it expresses the actor’s subjective commitment to the values and ends of the relationship. Consequently, the only way for a third party to make precise judgments about imperfect duties is to interpret the parties’ conduct in light of normative standards for that type of relationship. The law can enforce imperfect intimate duties only if it supplants the couple’s discretion to interpret their duties and replaces their commitment with legal sanctions. Finally, marital status offers a way to manage the tension created by imperfect intimate rights. The law refuses to enforce marital rights in ongoing relationships, which prevents the state from displacing couples’ discretion and commitment. When a couple separates, they abandon their commitment and thus lose their discretionary authority. At that point, the state may use equitable and egalitarian norms to protect the former spouses’ legitimate expectations. This combination of deferred protection and equitable remedies offers a framework for legally protected imperfect rights...|$|E
40|$|This work aims {{to assess}} the impact of fiscal {{decentralization}} on local (regional) development in the EU Member States while controlling for macroeconomic and local autonomy specific factors. Using a panel data approach with dynamic effects, we examined the implications of fiscal decentralization on local development across European Union countries over the 1990 - 2004 period. The novelty of the study is emphasized by including in the analysis a variable which tests local fiscal discipline, more exactly, Fiscal Rule Strength Index for local level of government. Our findings suggest that prosperity of regions, measured in GDP growth depends on variables such as characteristics of decentralization undertaken by each country or local fiscal discipline, confirming our primary hypothesis. This supports the view that recently implemented reforms aiming to enforce fiscal discipline following-up the Fiscal Compact strengthened the local budgetary framework and restrained, therefore, the local <b>discretionary</b> power to <b>act</b> towards development...|$|R

Com base nesses dados, discutidos à luz da doutrina e da jurisprudência, bem como do direito norte-americano, conclui-se que, chegados os dias da pós-modernidade, o vetusto e rigoroso instituto da coisa julgada, no campo dos interesses difusos e em sede de ação civil pública, não mais responde plenamente às necessidades de salvaguarda {{judicial}} dos direitos fundamentais, tanto quanto suas garantias irmãs (direito adquirido e ato jurídico perfeito), ao ponto de os tribunais consagrarem a afirmação de que ninguém possui o direito adquirido de poluir. Portanto, a imutabilidade da sentença não pode, em tempos de modernidade líquida e de ruas tomadas pelo corpo social sem rosto (multidão), servir de bloqueio para que o Judiciário assegure a todos os direitos difusos, consagrados como direitos de índole objetiva.

40|$|This {{response}} to Professor Motomura considers what is lost through {{the elaboration of}} formally defined boundaries around prosecutorial discretion. Professor Motomura and others in this Issue rightly extol the many benefits of the President 2 ̆ 7 s November 2014 executive actions. While I share the view that those benefits are considerable, I believe a full accounting requires us to consider what gets lost in this process, including identification of the immigrants in the limbo space between the actions 2 ̆ 7 prospective beneficiaries at the one end {{and those who are}} priorities for removal on the other. This Essay focuses on the cost that comes from the loss of a different kind of discretion in immigration law, where <b>discretionary</b> authority can <b>act</b> as a corrective measure at the edges of rules, where defined edges bump up against immigrants in limbo. Discretion is always an elusive concept: 2 ̆ 2 interstitial, 2 ̆ 2 and like the hole in a doughnut, as Professor Dan Kanstroom has written-defined more by what is around it than by the space itself. The less defined the edges of that space are, the more that space is full of possibility. The malleability of this space generally cuts against the values of transparency and accountability that are rightly lauded by many of the scholars in this symposium Issue. Individualized discretion, guided generally by policy interests and preferences, and not subject to carefully drawn limits and clearly defined edges, is indeed anathema to those values-and yet it serves an important purpose. The discretion available at the law 2 ̆ 7 s margins constitutes a vital means to correct the errors that inevitably happen at the law 2 ̆ 7 s edges, where even the best rules do an imperfect job of capturing the world 2 ̆ 7 s complexity. This kind of remedial, equitable discretion is a kind of discretion that has been steadily whittled down over the past twenty-five years in immigration law...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} local government elected members to progress urban sustainability, and the views of Māori leaders’ on governance and sustainability. It is set within a wider context of local government reform and changing expectations of governance and captures {{a point in time}} in the evolution of Pākehā and Māori governance structures in Aotearoa New Zealand. The thesis contributes to the paucity of scholarship in these fields. Local government has evolved from the early provincial legislatures, to acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi and recognise the importance of sustainable development. The Local Government Act 2002 fundamentally changed the role and purpose of New Zealand local government. At the heart of both Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the LGA was the aspiration for community and Māori participation in local governance and progress towards sustainable development. The ‘three-house concept’ described in the Raukawa Trustees partnership-two cultures development model (Winiata 2005) and the Community Sector Taskforce (2006) model is reflected in the structure of this thesis. It provides for a Pākehā House, a Tikanga Māori House and a Treaty House – a conceptual space where Māori and Pākehā values and practices can come together in mutual respect. The Pākehā House of the thesis establishes a broader role for New Zealand elected members to promote urban sustainability by focusing on cross-sector collaboration and multi-level governance. While multi-level governing was found to be widespread across urban territorial authorities, an elected member focus on collaboration was notably absent. Aotearoa New Zealand’s urban local authorities had begun mainstreaming sustainable development practices. Environmental management and restoration activity was widespread. Initiatives progressing social and cultural well-being were gaining prominence. The Tikanga Māori House recognises that the LGA 2002 had failed to bring about transformation of Māori participation in local government. Where the Māori voice struggled to be heard, the <b>Act’s</b> <b>discretionary</b> provisions had tended to preserve the status quo. Two paths to the future are offered: firstly, constitutional change - a new system of local government that recognises the validity of tino rangatiratanga as an equal authority, which could be modeled on the working examples of Treaty-based governance presented in this thesis. Secondly, improvements to the current system of local government are recommended. They are: - Hui and whanaungatanga, as a path to consensus decision-making. - Iwi authorities be recognised as local authorities, to provide opportunities for urban Māori to participate in local government. - The status of iwi management plans be lifted, and they be mandatory in the way that a district plan is mandatory. - The mana whenua relationship be strengthened to increase the capacity of mana whenua to consult with tauiwi in their rohe, and exercise kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga. These improvements need to be based on an effective parallel model of Māori representation, or Māori wards and seats. The Treaty House presents a case for strengthening a partnerships approach to governance. The effective inclusion of both Pākehā and Māori communities alike is identified as a prerequisite for further progress towards urban sustainability in Aotearoa New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} how school board members and superintendents in Arizona view their own and each other's role and function in the organization and operation of school systems. A second objective was to determine whether the demographic factor of school district locale (urban or rural) contributes to school boards' and superintendents' perceptions. In Arizona, the rights, responsibilities and <b>discretionary</b> powers to <b>act</b> are all given to local school boards. There is no mention of local superintendents' powers or duties in the Arizona State Statutes. This failure to grant statutory power to the superintendents or to formulate district-level policies for the delineation of duties and responsibilities between the school board and the superintendent has frequently led to conflict in district operation. Sixty-five districts were chosen using stratified random sampling from among all the urban and rural districts in Arizona. The Administrative Role Perception Questionnaire was sent to one board member and to the superintendent in each of the 65 districts. The questionnaire contained 22 items representing seven Task Areas: Curriculum Development, Pupil Services, Teaching Materials, Personnel Administration, School Plant Management, Finance and Budget, and Public Relations. The data were analyzed using a series of t-tests. There was substantial disagreement between board members and superintendents on their role and function in the school system. Board members and superintendents differed significantly on Personnel Administration (p<. 01), Curriculum Development (p<. 03), Teaching Materials (p<. 008), Finance and Budget (p<. 05), and Public Relations (p<. 002). The widest disagreement in perception of the role and function of school boards and superintendents was found between rural board members and rural superintendents. The widest agreement in perception was found between urban and rural board members and between urban and rural superintendents. This would indicate that board members from both urban and rural areas tend to agree more with each other than they do with superintendents. Superintendents from urban and rural areas also tend to agree more with each other than they do with board members. This study has shown that there is still substantial disagreement between boards of education and superintendents. The disagreement indicates an absence of district policies delineating the duties and responsibilities between boards of education and superintendents. Where such policies do exist, they are apparently widely disregarded. The result is the inability of board members and superintendents either to fully understand or to be allowed to discharge their respective roles and functions within the school system. This study recommends that boards of education and superintendents work to define their respective roles in written policy statements which are as broad as possible and cover every major aspect of school district governance and operation. Boards of education and superintendents should work to enact state laws which delineate the duties of the board of education and those of the superintendent. Boards of education should provide adequate funds annually for school board member and superintendent in-service training designed to facilitate understanding and agreement between board members and superintendents. It is also recommended that boards of education offer their superintendents contracts containing policy statements defining respective roles and allowing for redress if a violation occurs. It is hoped that the findings of this study will encourage school districts to formulate policies for the delineation of duties and responsibilities between the board of education and the superintendent...|$|R
