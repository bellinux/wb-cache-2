40|$|Abstract. A {{test bed}} of closed-end {{mechanical}} beveloid <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes</b> {{is designed to}} measure various parameters. In order to analyze the reasonableness of the structural design and test {{the performance of the}} test bed, a three-dimensional solid simulation model of the test bed is set up first with virtual simulation technology to analyze motion characteristics of test-bed and modal analysis to analyze the vibration characteristics of the key components. Simulation test obtains the vibration mode of the test gear box and drive gear box, providing a useful result for the optimization of the test bed. This solves some problems such as that a common test bed cannot test <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> <b>intersecting</b> axis and must have the same test pair gear, and inaccuracies of measuring transmission efficiency...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of face-gear drive <b>with</b> <b>intersected</b> <b>axes</b> of {{rotation}} formed by a helical involute pinion and conjugated face-gear has been investigated. Generation of face-gears by a shaper free of undercutting and pointing has been investigated. A new method of grinding or cutting of face-gears by a worm of special shape has been developed. A computerized design procedure has been developed to avoid undercutting and pointing by a shaper or by a generating worm. Also, a method to determine {{the limitations of the}} helix angle magnitude has been developed. The method provides a localization of the bearing contact to reduce the shift of bearing contact caused by misalignment. The analytical method provides a simulation of the meshing and contact of misaligned gear drives. An automatic mesh generation method has been developed and used to conduct a 3 D contact stress analysis of several teeth. The theory developed is illustrated with several examples...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel and simple method to compute all {{possible}} solutions of the inverse kinematics {{problem of the}} five-oblique-axis thumb model <b>with</b> <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes</b> at the metacarpophalangeal joint. This thumb model {{is one of the}} suggested results by a magnetic-resonance-imaging- based study that, in contrast to those based on cadaver fingers or on the tracking of the surface of the fingers, takes into account muscle and ligament behaviors and avoids inaccuracies resulting from the movement of the skin with respect to the bones. The proposed distance-based inverse kinematics method eliminates the use of arbitrary reference frames as is usually required by standard approaches; this is relevant because the numerical conditioning of the resulting system of equations with such traditional approaches depends on the selected reference frames. Moreover, contrary to other parametrizations (e. g., Denavit-Hartenberg parameters), the suggested distance- based parameters for the thumb have a natural, human- understandable geometric meaning that makes them easier to be determined from any posture. These characteristics make the proposed approach of interest for those working in, for instance, measuring and modeling the movement of the human hand, developing rehabilitation devices such as orthoses and prostheses, or designing anthropomorphic robotic hands...|$|R

40|$|Compared <b>with</b> {{mechanical}} <b>gears,</b> {{a magnetic}} gear (MG) has many merits {{by virtue of}} its contactless feature, high efficiency and inherent overload protection. In this paper, a novel MG <b>with</b> <b>intersecting</b> shaft <b>axes</b> based on the flux modulation effect is proposed. Compared with previous MGs, the transmission direction of the novel MG can be designed very flexibly and it also has good competitive edge in relation to the use of permanent magnets, which enables it to have a relatively high-torque density. The working principle and performance are validated by an example design using finite element method. The effects of the dimensional parameters on the torque performance are analyzed. It is also verified that the torque density can be further improved by adopting a flux concentration configuration in its rotor design. It is concluded from the torque per unit volume density performance that the novel MG is very promising as a substitute to conventional gears. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This article builds {{upon the}} methodological and {{intellectual}} approach taken in our co-authored book Why Feminism Matters to explore {{some of the}} synergies and disconnections {{in the experience of}} being in the academy at different historical moments which range from the 1970 s to the present. We use the interrelationship between different feminisms in the context of our lived experiences as a mother and daughter whose experience of the academy has crossed, in the language of waves that of second wave feminism into third wave. It also bridges the mainstreaming of women’s studies in many universities, and claims of post feminism. By focusing upon trajectories of change both within the specificities of our own lived experience and the wider terrain of social change, albeit often marked more by continuities than transformation, we examine the particularities of life in higher education in the different roles than we have performed and which we each still have. There have been significant demographic, cultural and legislative shifts, for example within the culture and practice of equal opportunities, but our conversations demonstrate the endurance of imbalances of power and the continuing need for a feminist politics of difference which can engage with contemporary life in the academy <b>with</b> its <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes</b> of inequality...|$|R

The complete mathematical models of the gear pair, including the working tooth surfaces and the fillets have been derived based on the theory of gearing and the generation mechanism. The commercial software, ABAQUS, capable of contact analysis of two 3 -D deformable bodies is applied to evaluate the stress distribution on the tooth surfaces. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the stress analyses of the <b>gear</b> pairs <b>with</b> various <b>gear</b> design parameters.

In order to do so I will first discuss theory regarding intersectionality and the deconstruction of dichotomies. Secondly, I will sketch a brief historical outline regarding slavery and Dutch involvement herein. Then I will focus in each chapter on a specific woman with a relation to slavery, namely Elizabeth Samson (1715 - 1771), Maria Susanna Du Plessis (1739 - 1795) and Petronella Moens (1762 - 1843).

40|$|This {{editorial}} discusses {{a collection}} of papers examining gender {{across a range of}} health policy and systems contexts, from access to services, governance, health financing, and human resources for health. The papers interrogate differing health issues and core health systems functions using a gender lens. Together they produce new knowledge on the multiple impacts of gender on health experiences and demonstrate the importance of gender analyses and gender sensitive interventions for promoting well-being and health systems strengthening. The findings from these papers collectively show how gender <b>intersects</b> <b>with</b> other <b>axes</b> of inequity within specific contexts to shape experiences of health and health seeking within households, communities and health systems; illustrate how gender power relations affect access to important resources; and demonstrate that gender norms, poverty and patriarchy interplay to limit women’s choices and chances both within household interactions and within the health sector. Health systems researchers have a responsibility to promote the incorporation of gender analyses into their studies in order to inform more strategic, effective and equitable health systems interventions, programmes, and policies. Responding to gender inequitable systems, institutions, and services in this sector requires an ‘all hands-on deck’ approach.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of an advanced control system for articulated robots is the capability of transforming the work space coordinates, which naturally characterize any robot task, into the corresponding joint coordinates, on which control actions are developed. For each task, the coordinate transformation problem consists in calculating one trajectory in the joint space which corresponds to the end effector trajectory, usually given in the Cartesian space. While simple kinematical structures allow for closed-form solutions, there is a class of robots for which this is not true. Typical articulated robot structures have three revolute joints at the end effector; the geometric parameters of these joints actually determine the spatial configuration of the last axes of motion. The large majority of today's nonredundant structures have three <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes</b> at the end effector, and closed form solutions do exist in this case. If the <b>axes</b> <b>intersect</b> two-by-two, as in some rather common arm design, an exact solution seems not to exist. A quite different solution algorithm is established, as compared to the trigonometric approach widely adopted so far, which yields solutions in case of two-by-two <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes.</b> The convergence of the algorithm along any trajectory is proved. Effectiveness of the proposed technique can be argued {{by the fact that it}} only makes use of direct kinematics, thus resulting in a contained computational burden. A robot prototype of the kind described above is taken as a reference in order to discuss digital implementation and develop numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} T-shirts as semiotic tools of the politics of visibility, showing which role these sartorial artefacts may play in competing struggles for recognition in which gender and sexuality <b>intersect</b> <b>with</b> other <b>axes</b> of social categorisations. Drawing on a queer multimodal approach, the article offers an analysis of the four promotional T-shirts that were distributed each year between 2011 and 2014 by the Transformation and Employment Equity Office at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), Johannesburg, in the context of the annual Pride parade on campus. Our main argument is that changes over time in the design of Wits Pride T-shirts represent a shift both in what is claimed to be the main goal of campus sexual politics and in the proposed means to achieve such a goal. If one were to imagine that each T-shirt is a corporeal embodiment of Wits Pride, then this body has changed considerably in four years: from a gay man who is (supposedly) ashamed of voicing his sexual identity; into a camp though masculine figure that loudly urges to counter racial division within same-sex desire; into a more multifaceted individual who proudly carries their gender and sexual uniqueness; and finally, into an activist who, in tension with the complex intersections that underpin discrimination, is perhaps a little reluctant to foreground gender and sexuality at all. </p...|$|R
