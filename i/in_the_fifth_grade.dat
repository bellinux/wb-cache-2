5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>grade</b> and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E
