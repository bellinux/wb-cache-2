During the race, the car set a distance record by driving 1500 km on a single charge, with an average speed of some 80 km/h, and all the while having two people on board.

50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to engage the starter ring gear. The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|E
50|$|Since {{at least}} the mid-1960s, {{battery-operated}} electric razors have been available using rechargeable batteries sealed inside the razor's case, previously nickel cadmium or, more recently, nickel metal hydride. Some modern shavers use Lithium-ion batteries that do not suffer from memory effect. Sealed battery shavers either have built-in or <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> devices. Some shavers may be designed to plug directly into a wall outlet with a swing-out or pop-up plug, or have a detachable AC cord. Other shavers have recharging base units that plug into an AC outlet and provide DC power at the base contacts (eliminating {{the need for the}} AC-to-DC converter to be inside the razor, reducing the risk of electric shock).|$|E

50|$|The {{requirements}} for a BMS in mobile applications (such as electric vehicles) and stationary applications (like stand-by UPSs in a server room) are quite different, {{especially from the}} space and weight constraint requirements, so the hardware and software implementations must be tailored to the specific use. In the case of electric or hybrid vehicles, the BMS is only a subsystem and cannot work as a standalone device. It must communicate {{with at least a}} charger (or charging infrastructure), a load, thermal management and emergency shutdown subsystems. Therefore, in a good vehicle design the BMS is tightly integrated with those subsystems. Some small mobile applications (such as medical equipment carts, motorized wheelchairs, scooters, and fork lifts) often have <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> hardware, however the on-board BMS must still have tight design integration with the external charger.|$|E

50|$|Vehicles in the WSC's Cruiser {{class are}} allowed a small battery-pack {{which can be}} plugged in to the power mains for {{additional}} charging. Although Stella was mostly relying on its 1.5 kilowatt solar array, the team did use their maximum allowance of 64.0 kWh of <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> during the race. For comparison: according to the EPA, one gallon of gasoline is equivalent to 33.7 kWh. So, effectively, each top-up of the 15.0 kWh lithium-ion battery gives the car about 0.44 gallons of gas, and for the entire 3022 km race distance, the total external energy consumption was equal to less than two gallons of gas. On average, the car's solar array is able to generate more energy than would be consumed by normal daily commuting for most people, and if the car were plugged into the electrical grid, or to an owners house, when parked, it could contribute more energy than it would need to take out, making the car energy positive.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) have an on-board charger {{that uses a}} rectifier circuit to transform alternating current from the electrical grid (mains AC) to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond around 240 V AC and 75 A it is better for an <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> station to deliver direct current (DC) to the vehicle's battery pack. Given these limits, most conventional charging solutions are based on either 240V/30A service in the USA and Japan, 240 V, 70 A service in Canada or the 230 V, 15 A or 3Φ, 400 V, 32 A service in Europe and Australia.

Effects of the exchange and correlation interactions are also briefly discussed for undoped graphene at zero temperature. Nonlinear results are compared with both the linearized TF model and the dielectric screening model within random phase approximation (RPA). In addition, image potential of the <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> is evaluated from the solution of the nonlinear integral equation and compared to the results of linear models.

30|$|S has fixed energy {{supplying}} {{and wants}} to transmit information to D. Due to the great attenuation caused by long distance or barriers between S and D, the direct link S–D is unavailable. Thus, R is used to assist the information forwarding from S to D. The energy constrained R relies on <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> since it has no internal energy source. Specifically, R harvests energy from the received RF signals transmitted from S, and uses all the harvested energy to assist the information relaying. In practical systems, R can be either idle mobile users (in cellular network) or sleeping nodes (in wireless sensor network) which are battery driven and lack of energy-supply. We assume that R operates in a half-duplex mode and all nodes have perfect knowledge of the channels of both hops.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cost competitiveness of different electrified propulsion technologies from hybrid cars to full battery electric {{vehicles in the}} time horizon 2010 to 2020. The assessment shows that the current TCO gaps for alternative drivetrains will increasingly converge over time mainly driven by decreasing production cost.

40|$|Molecular orbital {{calculations}} {{are carried}} out {{on a number of}} carotenoids in the presence of an <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> and a constant electric field. The <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> is used to represent the strong permanent field that is believed to polarize carotenoids in photosynthetic membranes and thus to account for their linear response to the transmembrane potential. Our calculations show that the in vitro leads to in vivo spectral shifts of carotenoids (approximately 25 nm) can be produced by a charge in close proximity to the molecule. The interaction of the induced dipole moment with a constant field accounts for the observed magnitude of the electrochromic response in photosynthetic bacteria. The existence of a second pool of carotenoids that shows a significant (approximately 20 nm) wavelength shift but no electrochromic response can be explained by an <b>external</b> <b>charge</b> positioned {{near the center of the}} molecule that affects its absorption maximum while inducing essentially no dipole moment. The spectral shift for this pool is due to the induction of higher multipoles. These also account for discrepancies that arise when one attempts to account quantitatively for available experimental results on carotenoid band shifts in terms of classical electrochromic theory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) have attracted {{a lot of}} attention due to environmental and efficiency reasons. Typically, an HEV combines two power trains, a conventional power source such as a gasoline engine, a diesel engine, or a fuel cell stack, and an electric drive system (involving a motor and a generator) to produce driving power with a potential of higher fuel economy than conventional vehicles. Furthermore, such vehicles do not re-quire <b>external</b> <b>charging</b> and thus work within the existing fueling infrastructures. The power-split power train configuration of an HEV has the individual advantages of the series and parallel types of HEV power train configurations. A sophisticated control sys-tem, however, is required to manage the power-split HEV power trains. Designing such a control system requires a reasonably ac-curate HEV system plant model. Much research has been done for developing dynamic plant models for the series and parallel types...|$|E
