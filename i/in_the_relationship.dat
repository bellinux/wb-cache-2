40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of support reciprocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> with principals and colleagues on self-efficacy and burnout among teachers. The respondents wore 122 school teachers (51 elementary school teachers, 9 junior high school teachers, 44 senior high school teachers, 17 teachers of school for the disabled, and 1 unidentified by school). They completed measures of social support exchange <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> with principals and colleagues, measurements of self-efficacy in student guidance, course instruction, and job relations, and a burnout assessment with a Japanese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Teachers, support reciprocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> with principals related significantly to their self-efficacy in course instruction and job relations, and marginally significantly to their self-efficacy in student guidance. Results also indicated that teachers, support reciprocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> with colleagues correlated significantly with their self-efficacy in course instruction and marginally significantly with emotional exhaustion...|$|R

5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship.</b> He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E

During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.|$|E

In recent episodes, Mike Delfino (James Denton) married an unidentified bride, who was either Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), his ex-wife, or Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany), his fiancée and Susan's close friend. Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) learned that she and her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), are expecting twins, two of what will be six children. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) agreed to take in his niece, Ana (Maiara Walsh), and she and Gabrielle began to antagonize one another. Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) sought a divorce from her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan); however, Orson refused to end their marriage and blackmailed her into staying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship.</b> As a result, Bree began an affair with her divorce lawyer and Susan's ex-husband, Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi).|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{was named}} to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the {{appointment}} to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to deal with problems that had developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between the church and royal government.

5|$|In 1998, as {{a result}} of the {{continuing}} development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between the university and the nearby Roehampton Institute, it was decided to form an academic federation. In November 1999, the Privy Council approved the necessary changes to the university's Charter and Statutes and the Roehampton Institute became The University of Surrey Roehampton at the beginning of 2000. Between 2000 and 2004, the university and Roehampton worked together as the Federal University of Surrey. In June 2004, the Privy Council granted Roehampton an independent university title, and it became Roehampton University from 1 August 2004. This move ended the federal partnership between the two institutions, although collaboration between the two is being maintained.|$|E

Method: Participants were 187 secondary school children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> age of 11 to 15 years who lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south of the Netherlands. Data were gathered through self-report questionnaires over two years. Results: The research questions were answered with regression analyses.

Discussion: <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> expectation was the influence of attachment to peers on warmth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sibling <b>relationship</b> stronger than <b>the</b> influence of warmth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sibling <b>relationship</b> on attachment to peers.

The study uses a sample of 108 Hong Kong-based Chinese family-owned firms from the manufacturing sector. Largely supporting the theoretical predictions, the results from multiple regression and structural equation model tests show that information sharing plays a mediating role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> between three dimensions of social capital (trust, network ties, and repeated transactions) and firm competitiveness improvement.

5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny {{the possibility that the}} Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E
5|$|Justinian saw the orthodoxy of {{his empire}} {{threatened}} by diverging religious currents, especially Monophysitism, which had many adherents {{in the eastern}} provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature or a synthesis of a divine and human nature, had been condemned as a heresy by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of Zeno and Anastasius I had {{been a source of}} tension <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> with the bishops of Rome. Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them.|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play, and {{was first}} {{released}} on 16 February 1728. Though {{the play was}} never revived and only ran for four nights, it still did moderately well especially {{when compared with the}} competing plays at that time. In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{significance of}} the Device Forts declined during the 18th century. Some of the fortifications were redesigned to provide more comfortable housing for their occupants. Cowes Castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation, demolishing much of the keep and adding residential wings and gardens over the landward defences, and Brownsea Castle began to be converted into a country house from the 1720s onwards. Walmer became the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, carried out extensive work there after 1708. There was probably some rivalry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between Sackville and the naval officer Sir John Norris, who redeveloped nearby Deal Castle during the same period, creating comfortable wood-panelled quarters for himself there overlooking the sea.|$|E

Tensions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was going on at the PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium. The team was co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races. The deal was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.|$|E
