40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to tackle the problem an <b>electricity</b> <b>trader</b> faces when trying to set and {{validate}} his sale prices. Design/methodology/approach - The solution approach consists inoffering adequate incentives to the customers in order to encourage them to shift their consumptions to more favorable time periods; this is achieved by suitable price modifications. The problem of determining the most sensible prices to offer yields to a quadratic programing model which can be efficiently solved to optimality. Findings - This paper analysesan opportunity that traders can exploit for increasing their profit margins and, in general, for setting and validating their electricity sale prices. The real case of an Italian trader has been analysed and the numerical results show that the obtained sale price modifications may produce savings, both for the trader and for his customers. Originality/value - This research provides insights about the problem an <b>electricity</b> <b>trader</b> faces when setting his sale prices; it mainly focuses on the Italian market although the developed mathematical model is sufficiently general to be adopted in different scenarios...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{approaches}} the energy markets {{from the point}} of view of an <b>electricity</b> <b>trader</b> acting on the retail markets, in particular an electricity supplier to the end customers. The first part introduces the reader into the basic practices applied in the management process of the portfolio of end customers, which includes metering and evaluation of the real take-off, planning and prediction and, of course, final evaluation of the imbalances. Second part explains the principles of balance management in case of the entire ČEPS electrical grid, mechanics of the imbalances settlement and describes its actual setting with focus on the way it motivates the market participants for minimization of their own imbalances and therefore improvement of the overall electrical grid balance. The final part describes the basic construction of the risk surcharges, which the supplier adds to the commodity price to cover the costs caused by the existence of his end customers' imbalances. Furthermore, it is shown how the dependence on the system imbalance influences the size of the risk surcharge and the basic model is extended to include even this factor. Because the supplier does not set the surcharge at the level of individual end customer but for the entire portfolio, the functioning and power of the portfolio effect, which brings an extra savings in the imbalances settlement costs, is also explored in the final part. The possibility of dependence presence in the imbalances of individual end customers is also accounted for. For the first time in the Czech academic literature the economic problems that are faced by the electricity supplier to the end customers are examined and the analysis and solution of one important problem is provided in the full picture. However, the most important contribution of this master thesis lays in the opening of this topic to further examination on the academic ground...|$|E

30|$|Wind {{energy is}} {{increasingly}} being utilized globally, {{in part as}} it is a renewable and environmental-friendly energy source. The uncertainty caused by the discontinuous nature of wind energy affects the power grid. Hence, forecasting wind behavior (e.g., wind speed) is important for energy managers and <b>electricity</b> <b>traders,</b> to overcome the risks of unpredictability when using wind energy. Forecasted wind values can be utilized in various applications, such as evaluating wind energy potential, designing wind farms, performing wind turbine predictive control, and wind power planning. In this study, four methods of forecasting using artificial intelligence (artificial neural networks with radial basis function, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, artificial neural network-genetic algorithm hybrid and artificial neural network-particle swarm optimization) are utilized to accurately forecast short-term wind speed data for Tehran, Iran. A large set of wind speed data measured at 1 -h intervals, provided by the Iran Renewable Energy Organization (SUNA), is utilized as input in algorithm development. Comparisons of statistical indices for both predicted and actual test data indicate that the artificial neural network-particle swarm optimization hybrid model with the lowest root mean square error and mean square error values outperforms other methods. Nonetheless, all of the models can be used to predict wind speed with reasonable accuracy.|$|R

30|$|Forecasting the {{behavior}} of the wind resource can provide valuable information for energy managers, energy policy makers and <b>electricity</b> <b>traders,</b> as well as times of operation, repair and replacement of wind generators and conversion lines. However, reliable power generation and effective integration of wind energy systems into the power distribution grid are affected by the intermittent and nonlinear nature of the wind resource. Accurate forecasting of wind velocities not only can address the challenges such as adverse shocks in conventional power units caused by excessive wind speed but also can provide useful information regarding voltage and frequency instabilities resulting from variation in wind power. ANNs are robust tools with advantageous capabilities for addressing the unpredictable complexities of nonlinear phenomena such as the stochastic behavior of the wind resource, which cannot be handled by conventional methods accurately. In this paper, wind velocity data for 1  year at 1 -h intervals are utilized to train various artificial neural network (ANN) architectures for prediction of wind velocity data of Tehran, Iran. Structure analysis and performance evaluations of the established networks determine that the MLP network with a 4 - 7 - 13 - 1 architecture is superior to others. The best network was deployed to the unseen data and found to be capable of predicting velocity data via the sliding window technique successfully. Applying the statistical evaluation indices with the predicted and the actual test data results in acceptable RMSE, MSE and R 2 values of 1.19, 1.43 and 0.85, respectively. Predictions of wind power density or wind energy density, which are related to wind velocity, as well as comparing the performance of the ANN with other forecasting approaches, merit further investigation {{as an extension of the}} present study.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three parts dealing with both game theoretic and general equilibrium models, which were originally motivated by research questions regarding liberalized electricity markets. However, the model frameworks developed {{can more or less}} be applied to other industries as well. In Chapter 2, I study two electricity markets connected by a fixed amount of crossborder capacity. The total amount of capacity is known to all <b>electricity</b> <b>traders</b> and allocated via an auction. The capacity allocated to each bidder in the auction remains private information. We assume that traders are faced with a demand function reflecting the relationship between electricity transmitted between the markets and the spot price difference. Therefore, traders act like Bayesian-Cournot oligopolists in exercising their transmission rights when presented with incomplete information about the competitors’ capacities. Our analysis breaks down the welfare effect into three different components: Cournot behavior, capacity constraints, and incomplete information. We find that social welfare increases with the level of information with which traders are endowed. In Chapter 3, I study a Cournot oligopoly in which firms face incomplete information with respect to production capacities. For the case where the firms’ capacities are stochastically independent, the functional form of equilibrium strategies is derived. If inverse demand is concave, a unique symmetric equilibrium exists, and if demand is linear, then every equilibrium is symmetric. In the case of duopoly, I analyze the impact on social welfare when firms commit ex-ante on exchanging information. Sharing information increases expected output and social welfare in a large class of models. If the demand intercept is sufficiently large, sharing information increases producer surplus and decreases consumer surplus (and vice versa). In Chapter 4, I study the interdependency between two markets. In the first market, production capacity is offered; in the second, the produced commodity itself is sold. Selling capacity initially leads to foregone product market profits due to a lower output. These opportunity costs decrease with a firm’s marginal costs. The key issue of the model is that there arises an additional cost component of selling capacity: Keeping capacity ready for delivery on demand induces ready-to-operate costs that increase with a firm’s marginal costs. It is shown that a competitive equilibrium not only exists, but is unique and efficient. In this equilibrium, the cumulative supply function of the capacity market is u-shaped, meaning that it is convex with respect to marginal costs. The leading example is the electricity industry, {{in which there is a}} capacity market that clears before the spot market is able to follow. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{competitive}} electricity {{market has}} been established in many European countries including the Czech Republic. The electricity market includes a limited number of significant producers and traders, which can be described by oligopoly model. Since the electricity transmission and distribution are regulated, I consider two types of players performing in the electricity market: producers of <b>electricity</b> and <b>traders,</b> who buy <b>electricity</b> from producers and sell it to final customers. I derive oligopoly model with producers and traders "a la Cournot" and calculate a formula of equilibrium strategies. I use these theoretical findings to build a dynamic oligopoly model Ele. Ele is formulated as a mixed complementary problem and calibrated on data for the Czech Republic and neighbor states for several scenarios. The model was specified and calculated in GAMS software by the PATH solver. The results represent a Nash equilibrium. That means for individual producers: electricity generation, investment in new power plants construction and emission permits purchases. For traders the results are: equilibrium purchases, sales and cross-border transfers of electricity in each particular time period. Ele derives also equilibrium regional wholesale and retail electricity prices, emission permit prices and prices of cross-border auctions. Ele results point to an economic profitability of new nuclear power plants constructions. Further, I formulate a game in short-term electricity market, where I advise to Czech market participants, subjects of settlement, how much and in which circumstances to buy or sell electricity. Equilibrium results obtained through simulations based on the principle of a fictive game show that the current payment system of imbalance in the Czech Republic does not increase the risk of instability of electricity networks...|$|R

The developing competition confronts the suppliers with new endeavours but also brings new opportunities. Due to the growing price and eliminatory competition the enterprises are trying to position themselves through low electricity prices and tariffs. Besides the changes in prices, the structural changes are of special interest. On the one hand new participants like <b>electricity</b> brokers and <b>traders</b> which bundle private demand to realize price cuts for their customers are entering the market. On the other hand especially the development of market structure {{and its impact on the}} market conduct of the enterprises are of scientific interest. For this purpose a computer based model for analysing the market structure LEMI (Liberalized Electricity Market Investigations) has been developed. The focus of the investigation is aimed on a state of equilibrium after simultaneous profit maximisation given the structure of the firms. Hence with LEMI simulations of the different strategic options of the suppliers in the liberalized market can be carried out in order to investigate whether a changed frame of conditions leads to significant changes of market results in terms of prices, sells and market shares.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} societies, {{industrial processes}} {{as well as}} domestic activities rely {{to a large degree}} on a well-functioning electricity system. This reliance exists both structurally (the system should always be available) and economically (the prices for electricity affect the costs of operating a business and the costs of living). After many decades of stability in engineering principles and related economic paradigms, new developments require us to reconsider how electricity is distributed and paid for. Twowell-known examples of important technological developments in this regard are decentralised renewable energy generation (e. g. solar and wind power) and electric vehicles. They promise to be highly useful, for instance because they allow us to decrease our CO 2 emissions and our dependence on energy imports. However, a widespread introduction of these (and related) technologies requires significant engineering efforts. In particular, two challenges to themanagement of electricity systems are of interest to the scope of this dissertation. First, the usage of these technologies has significant effects on howwell (part of) supply and demand can be planned ahead of time and balanced in real time. Planning and balancing are important activities in electricity distribution for keeping the number of peaks low (peaks can damage network hardware and lead to high prices). It can become more difficult to plan and balance in future electricity systems, because supply will partly depend on intermittent sunshine and wind patterns, and demand will partly depend on dynamic mobility patterns of electric vehicle drivers. Second, these technologies are often placed in the lower voltage (LV) tiers of the grid in a decentralised manner, as opposed to conventional energy sources, which are located in higher voltage (HV) tiers in central positions. This is introducing bi-directional power flows on the grid, and it significantly increases the number of actors in the electricity systems whose day-to-day decisionmaking about consumption and generation (e. g. electric vehicles supplying electricity back to the network) has significant impacts on the electricity system. In this dissertation, we look into dynamic pricing and markets in order to achieve allocations (of electricity and money) which are acceptable in future electricity systems. Dynamic pricing and markets are concepts that are highly useful to enable efficient allocations of goods between producers and consumers. Currently, they are being used to allocate <b>electricity</b> between wholesale <b>traders.</b> In recent years, the roles of the wholesale producer and the retailer have been unbundled in many countries of the world, which {{is often referred to as}} “market liberalisation”. This is supposed to increase competition and give end consumers more choice in contracts. Market liberalisation creates opportunities to design markets and dynamic pricing approaches that can tackle the aforementioned challenges in future electricity systems. However, they also introduce new challenges themselves, such as the acceptance of price fluctuations by consumers. The research objective of this dissertation is to develop market mechanisms and dynamic pricing strategies which can deal with the challenges mentioned above and achieve acceptable outcomes. To this end, we formulate three major research questions: First, can we design pricing mechanisms for electricity systems that support two necessary featureswell, which are not complementary—namely to encourage adaptations in electricity consumption and generation on short notice (by participants who have this flexibility), but also to enable planning ahead of electricity consumption and generation (for participants who can make use of planning) ? Second, the smart grid vision (among others) posits that in future electricity systems, outcomeswill be jointly determined by a large number of (possibly) small actors and allocations will be mademore frequently than today. Which pricing mechanisms do not require high computational capabilities from the participants, limit the exposure of small participants to risk and are able to find allocations fast? Third, automated grid protection against peaks is a crucial innovation step for network operators, but a costly infrastructure program. Is it possible for smart devices to combine the objective of protecting network assets (e. g. cables) from overloading with applying buying and selling strategies in a dynamic pricing environment, such that the devices can earn back parts of their own costs? In order to answer the research questions, our methods are as follows: We consider four problems which are likely to occur in future electricity systems and are of relevance to our research objective. For each problem, we develop an agent-based model and propose a novel solution. Then, we evaluate our proposed solution using stochastic computational simulations in parameterised scenarios. We thus make the following four contributions: In Chapter 3,we design a market mechanism in which both binding commitments and optional reserve capacity are explicitly represented in the bid format, which can facilitate price finding and planning in future electricity systems (and therefore gives answers to our first research question). We also show that in this mechanism, flexible consumers are incentivised to offer reserve capacity ahead of time, whichwe prove for the case of perfect competition and showin simulations for the case of imperfect competition. We are able to show in a broad range of scenarios that our proposed mechanism has no economic drawbacks for participants. Furthermore (giving answers to our second research question), the mechanism requires less computational capabilities in order to participate in it than a contemporary wholesale electricitymarket with comparable features for planning ahead. In Chapter 4, we consider the complexity of dynamic pricing strategies that retailers could use in future electricity systems (this gives answers to our first, but foremost to our second research question). We argue that two important features of pricing strategies are not complementary—namely power peak reduction and comprehensibility of prices—and we propose indicators for the comprehensibility of a pricing strategy from the perspective of consumers. We thereby add a novel perspective for the design and evaluation of pricing strategies. In Chapter 5, we consider dynamic pricing mechanisms where the price is set by a single seller. In particular, we develop pricing strategies for a seller (a retailer) who commits to respect an upper limit on its unit prices (this gives answers to both our first and second research question). Upper price limits reduce exposure of market participants to price fluctuations. We show that employing the proposed dynamic pricing strategies reduces consumption peaks, although their parameters are being simultaneously optimised for themaximisation of retailer profits. In Chapter 6, we develop control algorithms for a small storage device which is connected to a low voltage cable. These algorithms can be used to reach decisions about when to charge and when to discharge the storage device, in order to protect the cable from overloading as well as to maximise revenue from buying and selling (this gives answers to our third research question). We are able to show in computational simulations that our proposed strategies perform well when compared to an approximated theoretical lower cost bound. We also demonstrate the positive effects of one of our proposed strategies in a laboratory setupwith real-world cable hardware. The results obtained in this dissertation advance the state of the art in designing pricing mechanisms and strategies which are useful for many use cases in future decentralised electricity systems. The contributions made can provide two positive effects: First, they are able to avoid or reduce unwanted extreme situations, often related to consumption or production peaks. Second, they are suitable for small actors who do not have much computation power but still need to participate in future electricity systems where fast decision making is needed.
