5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by mammals {{such as the}} <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis catus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), as well as rodent species, and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), and shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.), and {{reptiles}} such as goannas (Varanus spp.).|$|E
5|$|The <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> {{is known}} to prey on the red-capped robin, and several bird species {{including}} the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus) and white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus) raid nests and take young. There is one record of a brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris) feeding on an egg. Predation is the commonest cause of nest failure.|$|E
5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. About {{two thirds of}} eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. Nestlings may be preyed upon by both pied butcherbirds, (Cracticus nigrogularis) black butcherbirds (C. quoyi), the spangled drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus), and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), {{as well as the}} <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis catus), and rat species. The proximity of nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Carol Reichert {{founded the}} Richmond Animal Protection Society (then Richmond Homeless Cats), the first {{organization}} in the Richmond area helping <b>feral</b> <b>cats.</b> At the time, <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> were quickly killed upon entering local animal control pounds, which Reichert was horrified to learn. Volunteers started to do trap-neuter-return of <b>feral</b> <b>cats,</b> including fostering and taming feral kittens, and fostering tame cats for adoption. There were soon 43 feeding stations for <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> tended each day in Richmond and south Vancouver.|$|R
50|$|<b>Feral</b> <b>cats</b> (Felis catus) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} introduced mammals and one of the most effective predators on ground-nesting seabirds. On the Kerguelen Islands in the Southern Ocean, cats kill 1.2 million nesting seabirds annually. One study stated that introduced <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> have been responsible for the extinction of 10 petrel species in the 20th century alone. <b>Feral</b> <b>cats</b> are such effective predators on ground-nesting seabirds because seabirds did not evolve with terrestrial predators and therefore did not develop defenses against them. In many cases, seabirds do not even recognize <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> as a threat. It has also been demonstrated that <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> on islands preferentially eat seabirds, but during the nonbreeding season cats switch their prey base to insects, rats, and mice for subsistence.|$|R
50|$|The anti {{predator}} liquid {{that gets}} sprayed at attackers from the tail {{has been observed}} to be aimed for birds. However, the southern spiny tailed gecko might also encounter some introduced species of predators such as <b>feral</b> <b>cats.</b> In central Australia, <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> {{have been known to}} feed on a wide range diet, including reptiles. It seems that during the summer, <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> frequently feed on reptiles, including geckos:.|$|R
5|$|Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets {{are also}} found in the Everglades, their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native {{wildlife}} is the domestic or <b>feral</b> <b>cat.</b> Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have devastating effects on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats {{at some of these}} sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> {{introduced}} to a flower market in Los Angeles, California, were noted to have helped lower rat populations. In Chicago's 47th Ward, <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> were introduced in 2012 to help the city deal with the rat problem there. Efforts to eradicate <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> in Ventura, California, were noted in 2002 to have resulted in increasing numbers of rats, which were being monitored for health problems such as bubonic plague.|$|R
50|$|Since 1988, killing <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> {{has been}} illegal in Rome, Italy, and the Latium Region which {{includes}} Rome. Since August 1991, <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> have been protected throughout Italy when a no kill policy was introduced for both <b>cats</b> and dogs. <b>Feral</b> <b>cats</b> {{have the right}} to live free and cannot be moved from their colony, and cat caretakers can be formally registered. TNR methods are outlined in the national law on the management of pets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Feral</b> <b>cats</b> {{primarily}} subsist on food scavenged from garbage when it {{is available}} to them. They also eat animals they kill, and carcasses of animals already dead. <b>Feral</b> <b>cats</b> living in managed colonies are fed cat food by volunteers.|$|R
5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|Although wildcats are solitary, {{the social}} {{behavior}} of domestic cats {{is much more}} variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, {{they do not have}} a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.|$|E

40|$|Outdoor cats {{represent}} a global threat to terrestrial vertebrate conservation, but management has been rife with conflict due {{to differences in}} views of the problem and appropriate responses to it. To evaluate these differences we conducted a survey of opinions about outdoor cats and their management with two contrasting stakeholder groups, cat colony caretakers (CCCs) and bird conservation professionals (BCPs) across the United States. Group opinions were polarized, for both normative statements (CCCs supported treating <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> as protected wildlife and using trap neuter and release [TNR] and BCPs supported treating <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> as pests and using euthanasia) and empirical statements. Opinions also were related to gender, age, and education, with females and older respondents being less likely than their counterparts to support treating <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> as pests, and females being less likely than males to support euthanasia. Most CCCs held false beliefs about the impacts of <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> on wildlife and the impacts of TNR (e. g., 9 % believed <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> harmed bird populations, 70 % believed TNR eliminates cat colonies, and 18 % disagreed with the statement that <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> filled the role of native predators). Only 6 % of CCCs believed <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> carried diseases. To the extent the beliefs held by CCCs are rooted in lack of knowledge and mistrust, rather than denial of directly observable phenomenon, the conservation community can manage these conflicts more productively by bringing CCCs into the process of defining data collection methods, defining study...|$|R
5|$|In Australia, 2012 {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} there are more than 7.2million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the <b>feral</b> <b>cat.</b> As such it {{has become one of the}} continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.|$|E
25|$|Feral cats live on all continents {{except for}} Antarctica. The {{worldwide}} <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> population {{is estimated to}} be at least 100 million. The United States' <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> population is estimated at 60 million, Australia's at 12 million, and Britain's at one million.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to control}} <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> populations are widespread, {{although}} the techniques differ significantly. Some advocate for trap-neuter-return programs {{to prevent the}} cats from continuing to breed; others suggest euthanasia.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} conducts trap-neuter-return {{for community}} cats (free-ranging stray and <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> not belonging to individuals). A Barn Buddies program is offered for <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> needing relocation. One {{of the first}} cats trapped by the program in 1989 became the shelter cat, Norman, who died in 2014.|$|R

2500|$|However, adult <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> without human {{assistance}} {{have been}} found in surprisingly good condition. In Florida, a study of <b>feral</b> <b>cats</b> admitted to a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program concluded that [...] "euthanasia for debilitated cats for humane reasons is rarely necessary". A further study of over 100,000 community <b>cats</b> (<b>feral</b> and stray) admitted to TNR programs in diverse locations of the U.S. resulted in the same 0.4% rate of euthanasia for debilitating conditions.

25|$|A 2013 {{article in}} the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery found that rescuers and veterinarians in the United Kingdom tended to {{distinguish}} feral cats from domesticated cats based on traits such as their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and {{on the amount of}} fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. They found that rescuers and veterinarians tended to agree that feral cats were cats that had not had much human contact (particularly before eight weeks of age), would try to avoid humans, and would prefer to escape rather than attack a human. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a <b>feral</b> <b>cat</b> would tend to hiss and spit at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult ferals could potentially be tamed.
