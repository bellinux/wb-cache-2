40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. It focuses on the kind of situation presented by the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation where racist stereotypes and assumptions infect both police inquiries into serious violent crime and the treatment of victims or their families. It first demonstrates the limited scope of <b>individual</b> <b>redress</b> available prior to the Act in such situations (examining police complaints mechanisms, private prosecutions, misfeasance in public office, judicial review and negligence). It links limitations in the scope of <b>individual</b> <b>redress</b> to a traditional priority accorded to public interests. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 gives individuals a general right to sue the police for racial discrimination in investigations. It is argued that a similar right probably now exists – at least in the context of life-threatening violence – under the Human Rights Act 1998. These developments seem to signal a shift in the balance between individual rights and the limiting claims of public interests. But the singularity of the 2000 Act is that, in introducing the mechanisms and logic of anti-discrimination law into the criminal process, it creates the potential for a more interactive relationship between individual complaint and the public interest in the collective promotion of change...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 25 years, class actions {{have emerged as}} a central feature of Canadian law. The {{conceptual}} heart of these class actions comes from the Ontario Law Reform Commission’s 1982 Report on Class Actions, particularly in common law Canada. [1] Drawing on {{the experiences of the}} early-adopter provinces of Québec, Ontario and British Columbia, the Report set out the objectives of the modern class action: judicial economy, access to justice, and behavior modification. The reasoning in the Ontario Report as insufficient to explain the need for class actions. The stated premises are all classic accounts of the lack of <b>individual</b> <b>redress</b> that require collective action. As such they form the classic argument for the state. Class actions are private sources of collective authority, even if formed pursuant to legal rules governing class certification. Put simply, if it is public goods we seek, why not use public authority to obtain them? This chapter addresses the question of the relation of private aggregation in relation to public authority. The discussion is illuminated by looking to the U. S. experience in this light, an experience that looms large in the Canadian debate...|$|E

40|$|This article explores {{citizens}} ’ use {{of administrative}} hearings to appeal adverse government {{decisions about their}} welfare benefits. It draws on interviews with 79 welfare participants and observations of hearings and interviews with administrative law judges in a state in the United States to understand what hearings, and the act of appealing, mean to citizens. I find that beyond <b>individual</b> <b>redress,</b> participants view appealing {{as an opportunity to}} expose and repair social injuries and to renegotiate social relationships, social identities and their status as citizens. Their ability to rehabilitate strained social identities and establish their deservingness as citizens is contingent and variable, with hearings sometimes reproducing appellants ’ powerlessness and other times allowing for a more positive enactment of citizenship and social status. Over time, participants experience an increase in legal consciousness, using the knowledge of the law and bureaucratic practices they glean from hearings to better navigate the welfare bureaucracy. While this transformation of legal consciousness emphasizes individual gains rather than collective or systemic change, it cultivates a culture of complaining, rather than acquiescing, within the welfare bureaucracy.

There is a case for differentiating the pension policy by occupation when longevity is (imperfectly) correlated with occupation. The short-lived workers in the safe occupation are however made worse-off, more so when the social objective includes a higher social weight on short-lived <b>individuals</b> to <b>redress</b> the implicit bias towards long-lived that the unweighted utilitarian objective entails. The maximin criterion ensures equal utility for short-lived workers regardless of occupation but those in the safe occupation consume the most when young, the least when old and retire the earliest.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the implementation of sexual harassment law in the workplace in Germany and the United States. Both countries have developed different approaches to the issue, with certain trade-offs for the pursuit of gender equality and changes in gender workplace culture. Germany has developed a corporatist, collective strategy. Yet, few German employers have adopted policies and training programs. New policy approaches focus on sexual harassment as a group-based, but gender-neutral, issue {{in the context of}} general unfair workplace practices of "mobbing. " In contrast, sexual harassment is primarily understood as an individual rights issue in the U. S. This approach emphasizes <b>individual</b> (internal) <b>redress.</b> Social and organizational change comes at a high cost for individuals who have been harassed. Employers' practices in both countries have turned sexual harassment into a gender-neutral issue. I conclude that a synthesis of both individual and collective approaches with an explicit focus on gender inequality would be desirable. Copyright 2003 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R
40|$|Notice and Choice is {{the model}} for {{protecting}} privacy online in the United States. Under the model, users of online services are given notice about services information and privacy practices {{in the form of}} privacy policies. Based on this information, users can choose whether to use particular online services and whether to exercise any options for protecting their privacy that the services might offer. In theory, Notice and Choice seems like a sound regulatory mechanism. Indeed, state and federal regulatory agencies prefer the model as a basis for privacy enforcement action. But Notice and Choice faces harsh criticism from privacy advocates. This Note adds a new critique to the list—that Notice and Choice leaves individual consumers who are affected by privacy policy breaches, legally, empty-handed. This is because website privacy policies—the principal mechanism for effectuating Notice and Choice—are generally not considered to be legally binding agreements. As a result, individuals’ contract theory-based actions against companies for privacy policy breaches almost categorically fail. As a result, the users of online services are largely left without <b>individual</b> <b>redress</b> for privacy policy breaches. Much has been written about Notice and Choice, and even more has been written about online contracting. Yet, like Notice and Choice and contract theory themselves, these two bodies of scholarship remain misaligned. This Note fills that gap by addressing Notice and Choice in the context of contracts, and offers alternative solutions to give individuals the opportunity to seek redress in the Notice and Choice scheme through contract theory...|$|E
40|$|Collective redress is a {{procedural}} mechanism {{that allows for}} reasons of procedural economy and efficiency of enforcement many similar legal claims to be combined into a single court action. Consumers and investors encounter problems with the enforcement of their rights through the <b>individual</b> <b>redress,</b> especially in times of the financial crisis. If {{a substantial number of}} harmed individuals decide not to pursue their, usually low, claims, the unduly gained profits of the opposite party can be extremely high. Thus, collective redress mechanisms can represent better option for consumers and investors, as their claims tend to be much less burdensome in case of the collective action. However, such mechanisms can trigger the abuse of the procedures, with the most commonly quoted threat being the example of American regulation of class actions. Negative characteristics of American model are the reasons that EU decided to shape its own concept of collective redress mechanisms. The binding act in this field in the EU is directive on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests; however, there is no binding act yet regarding compensatory actions. In June 2013, the European Commission published the Recommendation on common principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms in the Member States concerning violations of rights granted under Union Law. It is not binding on Member States, however, it can serve as a guideline to improve their existing legislations, especially the regulation of collective compensatory actions. In so doing, consumers and investors might be given the possibility to use more efficient mechanism to compensate the harm suffered...|$|E
40|$|The EU Law on Injunctive Collective Redress The article aims to {{illustrate}} the EU policy on consumers specifically facing with the injunctions {{for the protection of}} consumers’ interests. According to EU legislation (as well as to national legislation), the current mechanism available for ensuring the effective judicial protection is twofold: consumers can bring an action before the judges either personally (<b>individual</b> <b>redress)</b> or through consumer associations (collective redress). Due to the ontological weakness of the individual consumer against the infringement, the EU strengthened the protection of collective interests. The legal ground is Directive 2009 / 22 /EC on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests, which, for the sake of clarity and rationality, codifies Directive 98 / 27 /EC which has been amended several times. An in-depth analysis of the ‘injunctions’ shows that this procedural instrument aims at terminating or prohibiting infringements which are contrary to the collective interests of consumers. The approximation of legislation performed by this Directive allows an increase of the effectiveness of these injunctions and a smoother functioning of the internal market. In addition, the research illustrates the two new legislative acts which, since 2013, implemented and partially amended the Directive in force, i. e. Directive 2013 / 11 /EU (Directive on consumer ADR), and Regulation (EU) 524 / 2013 (Regulation on consumer ODR), as well as the critical remarks about the application of Directive 2009 / 22 resulting from the Report of the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council COM(2012) 635. The analysis focuses on the obstacles that prevent the injunctive actions to be effective, and on the future trends drafted by the Commission Recommendation on common principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms in the Member States concerning violations of rights granted under EU Law (2013 / 396 /EU) ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis aims to {{investigate}} a new approach put to use by the European Court of Human Rights {{for the first time}} in 2004, known as the Pilot Judgement Procedure, and asks whether this procedure contributes to the constitutionalisation of the human rights protection under the Court's jurisdiction. It is widely claimed that the European Convention system has become a victim to its own success". After enlargements and Protocol No. 11, which made acceptance of the individual right to petition the Court mandatory on all Contracting States, the Court has seen a rise in application figures with which it has been unable to deal efficiently. The majority of applications are repetitive applications that originate in a structural problem in the given state, and in which precedent has already been established in the Court's case-law. The Pilot Judgement Procedure seeks to deal more efficiently with these cases by addressing the structural problem in which the applications originated. The thesis assembles a theoretical framework of constitutional dimensions, encapsulating how the process of constitutionalisation may proceed. Constitutionalism entails that certain domains are fenced off from majoritarian control and given protection as higher-order norms, but the extent and scope may vary. Thus, constitutionalisation is conceptualised as the process of institutionalising higher-order norms, with which lower-order norms must conform. Furthermore, the special nature of legal systems' authority, their inherent powers to decide on their jurisdiction, and their lack of hard enforcement mechanisms may drive and obstruct constitutionalisation respectively. In form of an explorative case study thirteen judgements of the new approach are analysed and contrasted to the Court's traditional approach. The thesis finds that whereas the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights have traditionally only had <b>individual</b> <b>redress,</b> by ordering the states to give monetary compensation on individual basis for human rights violations, the Court now orders the states, in the formal binding part, to ensure that their domestic practices are in conformity with the principles of the Convention and the Court's case-law. In doing that, the Court has on several occasions ordered the states to bring concrete legislation into conformity with these principles, or has ordered the states to set up effective domestic remedies, in order to reach compliance with the Convention and the standards established in the Court's case-law, thus to a greater extent establishing these norms as higher-order norms. The findings indicate that this development has mainly been court-driven". Due to the recentness of the phenomenon, the thesis can only indicate the procedure's effectiveness based on the first docket of judgements. Thus, this aspect needs to be more systematically investigated as the number of judgements increases...|$|E
40|$|Policing the Elephant is a {{companion}} volume to John Reid 2 ̆ 7 s Law for the Elephant: Property and Social Behavior on the Overland Trail (1980). Through an incisive {{analysis of the}} diaries, journals, and letters of emigrants crossing from Missouri or Iowa to Oregon or California, Reid examines how overland travellers experienced and responded to anti-social actions and theii 2 ̆ 7 punishment. Along the trail, emigrants watched for the elephant. 2 ̆ 2 To see the elephant, 2 ̆ 2 Reid explains, 2 ̆ 2 meant undergoing hardships, to learn the realities of a situation firsthand, or to encounter the unbelievable. 2 ̆ 2 Reid skillfully adapts {{the symbol of the}} elephant to explore what average nineteenthcentury Americans understood about the social meaning of crime and the justification for punishment without benefit of police, attorneys, or courts, focusing ultimately on the emigrants 2 ̆ 7 adherence to the rule of law. The study is arranged in roughly three parts. The first section examines traditional categorizations of crimes such as robbery, homicide and larceny. Reid observes that although some crimes were overlooked, even tolerated, or left to <b>individual</b> <b>redress</b> (such as shooting a horse thief from his saddle), most crimes were met with a collective response: emigrants joined in pursuing or supporting attempts to apprehend and then try and punish miscreants. This collective response clearly demonstrates for Reid that the fortyniners shared obedience to law and justice. A detailed analysis of trials and tribunals forms the study 2 ̆ 7 s second part. In a telling chapter Reid elaborates on the efforts of emigrants to re-create judicial procedures, arguing persuasively that emigrants established overland juries to perform the same function nineteenth-century American criminal-law juries provided back home. Instead of reverting to an earlier English pattern-relying on witnesses to render the verdict overlanders sought out jurors who were estranged from the circumstances-defendants, victims, and witnesses- of the alleged crime. Above all, Reid argues, the men and women on the overland trail wanted to conduct 2 ̆ 2 fair 2 ̆ 2 trials. Standards of fairness were determined by observable similarities to trials held in home county courts. In the final section, Reid examines various punishments in terms of their specific meaning 2 ̆ 2 on the trail, 2 ̆ 2 suggesting that their purpose was 2 ̆ 2 the maintenance of order, the deterrence of antisocial acts, and the enforcement of the rules of social behavior that the emigrants had long respected as 2 ̆ 7 law. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 This point is underscored in a particularly cogent chapter on 2 ̆ 2 social harmony 2 ̆ 2 in which the author challenges previous interpretations of 2 ̆ 2 banishment 2 ̆ 2 for failing to grasp the practice 2 ̆ 7 s significance in maintaining harmonious relations within the journeying group. Reid concludes his study by commenting on its implications beyond the recorded reminiscences of a literate, disproportionately male, middle-class, mostly rural population. He cautions readers to consider the emigrants 2 ̆ 7 experiences in broader terms, suggesting that 2 ̆ 2 the attitudes of the emigrants toward the judicial process, and the consistency with which they appealed to legal principles, were more indicative of those of the average American than those of 2 ̆ 7 frontiersmen. 2 ̆ 72 ̆...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between international humanitarian law and international human rights law remains a vexed one. In recent years, human rights lawyers and activists have sought to apply human rights norms to military conduct in international and internal conflicts, and during belligerent occupations. With varying degrees of success, complainants have brought their cases before international tribunals, and to national courts able to apply international human rights standards. This development has occurred largely because forums exist to hear human rights claims, whereas they do not for persons claiming <b>individual</b> <b>redress</b> for violations of international humanitarian law. However, human rights norms have also been seen as more restrictive: as placing greater constraints on States' freedom to conduct hostilities, preventively detain, and administer occupied territories. It {{is for this reason that}} some States have resisted attempts to extend the reach of international human rights law into areas traditionally seen as governed by international humanitarian law. This chapter argues that principles have now developed to govern the relationship between the two bodies of law. However, their application to different situations remains a work-in-progress and controversies remain. In particular, despite valient efforts, it remains unclear what what happens in situations where the two bodies of law cannot be read together? There are only few rules of norm-conflict resolution in international law, all of which have limited application in the context of the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law. Most inconsistencies between the rules of the two bodies of law are not true conflicts at all, as they do not require States to conduct themselves in different ways. It is simply that international humanitarian law is the more permissive system. In such situations, to argue that the two bodies of law are ‘complementary and mutually reinforcing’ is to do little more than issue a policy prescription. In reality, in such cases States have to make a choice as regards which rules they wish to comply (a choice which is likely to be a political one) and take the consequences. There are fundamental incompatibilities between international humanitarian law and human rights law, not only as regards discrete rules but in their theoretical bases. Attempts can be made to reconcile them, to avoid conflicts, but they can only be provisional and on a case-by-case basis. The legal tools available cannot always provide an answer. Absent legislation, conflicts will remain. And in a world of States with differing interests and values, the adoption of new rules governing armed conflict and belligerent occupation will be difficult, if not impossible. One difference between the two bodies of rules, in particular, remains fundamental. Despite developments over past decades which are said to indicate a ‘humanization of humanitarian law’, international humanitarian law, in contrast to human rights law, is not based on an individual rights paradigm. It is this difference, even excluding the differences in the substantive protections accorded individuals under the two bodies of law, which will ensure that individuals continue to bring complaints regarding their treatment in situations of armed conflict before human rights bodies. And even if human rights bodies take the view that States’ human rights obligations in situations of armed conflict are to be interpreted using the yardstick of international humanitarian law, their interpretations of humanitarian law are likely to differ from lawyers advising States’ defence ministries and armed forces, who are likely to continue to be unhappy with such trespasses into what they see as their chasse gardée...|$|E

The paper uses a simple framework to demonstrate that the legal measures in the Damages Directive are unlikely to foster compensation because they fail to create incentives for harmed <b>individuals</b> to seek <b>redress.</b> If Member States seek to encourage full compensation, they should devise a framework for private antitrust actions that goes beyond the Directive’s remit by, for example, allowing class actions...|$|R
25|$|While {{prostitution}} controls {{have been}} relaxed {{at a local}} level, there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level. Importantly, legalisation does not have much public support. Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women. Surveys conducted in China suggest that clandestine forms of prostitution will continue to proliferate alongside the establishment of legal prostitution businesses, because of social sanctions against working or patronising a red-light district. Problems associated with female employment also limit the effectiveness of legalisation. These include the lack of independent trade unions, and limited access of <b>individuals</b> to civil <b>redress</b> with regard to {{occupational health and safety}} issues.|$|R

Unlike amnesty, the forgiveness law proposal is lawful under international law, for it guarantees prosecution of international crimes, discovery of the truth, a fair trial, adjudication of <b>individual</b> criminal responsibility, <b>redress</b> for victims, guarantees of non-repetition, and mercy for perpetrators.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

50|$|While {{prostitution}} controls {{have been}} relaxed {{at a local}} level, there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level. Importantly, legalisation does not have much public support. Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women. Surveys conducted in China suggest that clandestine forms of prostitution will continue to proliferate alongside the establishment of legal prostitution businesses, because of social sanctions against working or patronising a red-light district. Problems associated with female employment also limit the effectiveness of legalisation. These include the lack of independent trade unions, and limited access of <b>individuals</b> to civil <b>redress</b> with regard to {{occupational health and safety}} issues.|$|R

While it was hardly possible altogether to avoid the discussion of underlying theory, the intention was to reserve for separate articles an examination of the several theories which have been advanced to deny or sustain the responsibility of the state or government in tort. It is not believed to be desirable to confine the discussion to theories evolved in England or the United States, which on the whole rest upon an ancient doctrine that consigns the issue to sterility. But the western world has much the same economic and social system, and its political conceptions have much in common.

50|$|General {{sentiment}} in Jacksonian America was that {{right to bear}} arms was limited to militia service.The debate over the Second Amendment in this era centered, as it continues to do today, around the relationship between self-defense, militia service, and the {{right to bear arms}}. In State v Buzzard, Chief Justice Ringo contends that {{the right to bear arms}} was intended to apply to the militia due to a consensus that a well-regulated militia offered the best security available to a free state. Since the people of the United States were intimidated by the idea of a large army in times of peace, a lesser means of security was to be provided which would allow states to defend themselves from conspirators and attacks on civil liberties. For this reason, the State of Arkansas did not interpret the second amendment as an individual right. Furthermore, according to Chief Justice Ringo, to carry a concealed weapon would imply that <b>individuals</b> may seek <b>redress</b> in their own manner for invasions of their own liberty. However, to ensure justice and protect liberty are the duties of the government, not the individual. This decision is the precedent of choice for contemporary Americans who champion a narrow reading of the Second Amendment.|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the Australian federal {{government}} introduced a 2 ̆ 7 new 2 ̆ 7 graduate visa scheme, the 485 visa sub-class. This visa facilitates {{the transition from}} student to worker for overseas graduates from Australian higher education institutions, {{with the potential to}} significantly increase their numbers in the country. At the same time, local governments have introduced various policies designed to attract and retain human capital in rural areas to address the shortfall of highly skilled <b>individuals.</b> This paper <b>redresses</b> the current lack of research into the spatial dynamics of overseas human capital in Australia and their relation to the new visa scheme in combination with shifts in rural development policies. Drawing on survey data of graduates describing the 2 ̆ 7 before 2 ̆ 7 (2005) and 2 ̆ 7 after 2 ̆ 7 (2008) periods of the introduction of the 485 visa scheme, this paper shows that the propensity of overseas graduates to move between Australia 2 ̆ 7 s regions has increased substantially. In particular, there have been an increasing proportion of overseas graduates moving to major cities despite rural development policy efforts to attract human capital to rural areas. However, these policy efforts appear to have attracted overseas graduates with particular qualifications (education and health) to work in such locales...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of two {{national}} apologies in 2008 and 2009 centred on the forced removal of children from their families and communities, and {{on the eve of}} a possible third national apology to families separated through past forced adoption practices in Australian states and territories, it seems an appropriate time to ask: do any of the considerations which apply in the cases of the Stolen Children, Forgotten Australians, Lost Innocents, and mothers and children separated by domestic forced adoption practices apply to intercountry adoption? In other words, has Australian policy and practice in ICA created grounds for affected groups and <b>individuals</b> to seek <b>redress</b> for wrongs, and to demand of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments an apology for injustices committed against them? Drawing on the national apologies delivered to date, and written submissions and transcripts associated with the HR&EOC inquiry into the Stolen Generations (1995 - 97), Senate inquiries into forced imperial child migration (2001) and the Forgotten Australians (2004), and the Senate inquiry into past forced adoption practices (2012), this paper identifies parallels between the now publically acknowledged wrongs for which apologies have been made and the experiences of many intercountry adoptees and their birth families. This is corroborated by a small but growing body of research into the separation of children from their families in ICA, and by emerging mothers’ activism in significant ICA sending countries.

40|$|Defence date: 23 May 2012 Examining Board: Professor Adrienne Heritier (EUI/RSCAS) (Supervisor); Professor Lisa Conant (Univ. Denver); Professor Bruno De Witte (formely EUI/Univ. Maastricht); Professor Daniel Sabbagh (CERI, Sciences Po, Paris). Ten {{years after}} its {{enthusiastic}} adoption in 2000, the Race Equality Directive (RED) - a deeply innovative and indeed overall far-reaching piece of equal treatment legislation – seems to be still little enforced {{at the level of}} European courts. Why? Neither a sudden retrenchment of race discrimination in Europe, nor the inaptitude of the policy to generate European Union (EU) -law litigation, can easily explain the scarce signs of the extensive judicial enforcement that characterise other EU equal treatment policies, such as those on EU-nationality, gender and age. This study zooms in on the realm of domestic politics and judicial enforcement to inquire into cross-sectional and cross-national variations in the implementation of EU equal treatment policy. To do so, I rely upon analytical tools developed by three branches of EU studies scholarship — Europeanization, compliance and judicial politics literature — and I apply them to the yet unexplored domain of race equality policy. Tracing the process of transposition, in the first place, and analysing case law databases and expert interviews with legal practitioners, in the second place, I inquire into compliance and judicial enforcement in three EU countries: France, Germany and Italy. The findings of this comparative study confirm a very limited judicial enforcement of the RED, especially as domestic patterns of adversarial litigation in the domain of race equality are concerned. I explain this divergence looking at the ‗containment‘ action that domestic policymakers may exert on directives at the moment of transposition. In the case of the RED, this action crucially impinged on aspects likely to determine enforcement dynamics, such as those elements of the process regulating access to judicial redress. This work shows {{that in the case of}} a policy measure such as the RED, focused on <b>individual</b> judicial <b>redress</b> and mainly targeted towards disadvantaged end-users, the harmonization of some process elements is crucial to determining converging implementation dynamics. If Europeanization is contained at the moment of transposition, judicial enforcement can be seriously hindered at the national as well as the supranational levels even in presence of domestic legal mobilization. In addition to that, the thesis shows how limited raceconsciousness is to be found in contemporary European jurisprudence as well as in the claims filed by antidiscrimination law applicants...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} process of seeking {{compensation}} for occupational illness under a no-fault accident insurance scheme. The author uses two case studies—firefighters who attended a fire at a chemical storage depot and timbermill workers who worked with pentachlorophenol—to illustrate how science {{can be used to}} deny compensation to sick and dying workers. The results of the studies suggest that a no-fault accident compensation scheme, considered to be a victory for workers, offers no guarantee of just outcomes for working people. And science can be co-opted and used to support business and state interests against workers; this ideological support is increasingly hidden behind the development of “objective ” systems of assessing com-pensation claims. New Zealand has two main types of accident insurance: the government’s Acci-dent Compensation Corporation scheme and private insurance. Since 1974, the country has had a no-fault response to adverse events associated with injuries. Civil claims for damages arising from personal injury due to accidents were abolished, so employers could no longer be sued for workplace accidents. This type of system is aimed at providing “for those in need rather than an acknowl-edgement of their <b>individual</b> rights to <b>redress.</b> While it deals with the economic needs of the patients, it does so on a basis of social goodwill rather than entitle-ment. The victim of an injury would, of course, still have to satisfy the eligibility criteria: the existence of the scheme, however, would represent the beneficence of medicine and state welfare. The tort system, on the other hand, is the social insurance of a market society ” (1, p. 60). The development of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) scheme {{can be seen as a}} form of regulation restricting the market practices of business. This is in line with what Crouch and Streeck (2, p. 1) term “institutional capitalism, ” in which society is capable o...|$|R
40|$|Algorithms, {{particularly}} {{of the machine}} learning (ML) variety, are increasingly important to individuals' lives, but have caused a range of concerns evolving mainly around unfairness, discrimination and opacity. Transparency {{in the form of}} a "right to an explanation" has emerged as a compellingly attractive remedy since it intuitively presents as a means to "open the black box", hence allowing <b>individual</b> challenge and <b>redress,</b> as well as potential to instil accountability to the public in ML systems. In the general furore over algorithmic bias and other issues laid out in section 2, any remedy in a storm has looked attractive. However, we argue that a right to an explanation in the GDPR is unlikely to be a complete remedy to algorithmic harms, particularly in some of the core "algorithmic war stories" that have shaped recent attitudes in this domain. We present several reasons for this conclusion. First (section 3), the law is restrictive on when any explanation-related right can be triggered, and in many places is unclear, or even seems paradoxical. Second (section 4), even were some of these restrictions to be navigated, the way that explanations are conceived of legally — as "meaningful information about the logic of processing" — is unlikely to be provided by the kind of ML "explanations" computer scientists have been developing. ML explanations are restricted both by the type of explanation sought, the multi-dimensionality of the domain and the type of user seeking an explanation. However “subject-centric" explanations (SCEs), which restrict explanations to particular regions of a model around a query, show promise for interactive exploration, as do pedagogical rather than decompositional explanations in dodging developers' worries of IP or trade secrets disclosure. As an interim conclusion then, while convinced that recent research in ML explanations shows promise, we fear that the search for a "right to an explanation" in the GDPR may be at best distracting, and at worst nurture a new kind of "transparency fallacy". However, in our final sections, we argue that other parts of the GDPR related (i) to other individual rights including the right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") and the right to data portability and (ii) to privacy by design, Data Protection Impact Assessments and certification and privacy seals, may have the seeds we can use to build a more responsible, explicable and user-friendly algorithmic society...|$|R
