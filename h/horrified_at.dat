5|$|Rosebery's {{own mother}} was <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> {{the thought of}} a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that any {{children}} could be reared as Jews. Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, especially in later life.|$|E

The Doctor (David Tennant) and his {{companion}} Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) investigate Ood Operations, a company that is selling the Ood as a servant race, to discover the reason the Ood are happy to serve. When they find a group of unprocessed Ood, they become <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> the alterations performed and resolve to free the Ood.

5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's family did.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) {{falls for}} a new staffer, a blind woman named Jennifer (Maria Thayer). Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him. On their date, at the 30 Rock studios, Kenneth and Jennifer are joined by Tracy—who does all the talking. Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was doing all the talking. Jennifer tells him she does not mind of what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> his appearance.|$|E
5|$|The MR {{management}} were <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> {{the potential}} {{loss of income}} and restarted negotiations with the GCR, and a 1906 agreement meant that GCR traffic was shared between {{the old and new}} routes. Management of the shared route north of Harrow alternated every five years between the MR and GCR. (A proposed link between Marylebone and the sub-surface section of the Metropolitan Railway, which would have allowed GCR trains to run across London via the MR-controlled Thames Tunnel and on to the south coast, was abandoned.) The sharing arrangement meant through trains running from Chesham to Marylebone, as well as the MR terminus at Baker Street, and that the branch was worked by GCR trains as well as the ageing MR rolling stock.|$|E

5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{place in}} 1997, {{the story begins}} when Laura Harris is {{contacted}} by Los Angeles police, receiving a disturbing message: her father, Dr. Richter Harris, has gone on a mass murdering spree and barricaded himself in the hospital. Laura rushes {{to the scene of}} the crime, desperate to find an explanation for the well-respected doctor's actions. Upon entering the hospital, she is so <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> the murdered bodies lying about the halls that she covers her eyes. When she uncovers them again, she finds herself in an unknown medieval castle. Unwilling to give up her search, Laura continues through the dark corridors of the castle. While attempting to find her father, she experiences a series of flashbacks of her mother being stabbed to death. Laura's father (taking the form of apparitions) warns her to leave, saying that staying too long means being stuck in the alternate reality forever. He warns that he will soon become an emotionless monster and will eventually try to kill her. Still shaken, Laura proceeds to find her father.|$|E
5|$|Vinnie runs off, finding {{himself on}} the black area of the beach where he bumps into rival gang leader Boogaloo Jones and his gang, the Chaplains. Boogaloo sets up a rumble between his gang and the Stompers. Vinnie later meets up with Roz and the girl Crazy dates, Eva; Crazy has {{meanwhile}} beaten all the mobsters. The four head out to a party, where Vinnie tells the Stompers {{that they are going}} to fight with the Chaplains, to which the gang responds negatively. Much of the gang and their girls head out to a rock and roll show. Vinnie is <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> the idea of Crazy and himself having to fight the Chaplains alone. One of the Stompers named Sal and his girl have a run-in with Boogaloo while driving, and wind up in a car crash. Vinnie finally persuades the Stompers to rumble with the Chaplains.|$|E
5000|$|Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke helped {{influence}} {{the design and}} approach of the monsters, Vogt-Roberts stated, [...] "Miyazaki‘s Princess Mononoke was actually a big reference {{in the way that}} the spirit creatures sort of have their own domains and fit within that. So a big thing was trying to design creatures that felt realistic and could exist in an ecosystem that feels sort of wild and out there, and then also design things that simultaneously felt beautiful and <b>horrifying</b> <b>at</b> the same time." [...] However, biophysical analysis of Kong and other creatures concludes that although biophysically they are viable, the ecosystem of the island could not support them.|$|R
6000|$|Father {{took one}} <b>horrified</b> glance <b>at</b> Mother. The {{prospect}} of the Hartwigs planted here in Eden, like a whole family {{of the most highly}} irritating serpents, seemed to have paralyzed her. It was Father who turned Harris's flank. Said he: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{now that}} we have made it up, she will be <b>horrified</b> again <b>at</b> all your wickednesses. You have been a turtle dove lately;--now you will be an ogre again. But, Oswald, you must not be an ogre to me." ...|$|R
5|$|Unfortunately, all has transpired {{according}} to Shockwave's plans: the Ammonites, Lost Light and Necrotitan were pupeteered {{to ensure that}} Metroplex would return to Cybertron and bring {{the last of the}} ores with him, while Optimus Prime was deliberately lured into the Dead Universe so that he could destroy Nova Prime and remove his control over it. Using all of his combined ores, fueled by the energy of the Dead Universe — channeled through an unwitting Galvatron — Shockwave intends to bend space and time to his will, collapsing all of reality into a singularity that will be used to feed Cybertron for eternity. As the majority of the Autobots and Decepticons battle the colossal Ammonite army Shockwave summons to the planet, a small team ventures into Crystal City to confront him, where they are soon rejoined by Optimus Prime's team, who emerge through a portal within the unknowingly-undead Brainstorm. Metalhawk sacrifices himself to unbalance the ore equation, destroying the Ammonites, while Bumblebee is killed by Shockwave; inspired by the words and the sacrifice of his new friend, Megatron dons the Autobot symbol, an action that throws Shockwave into confusion. The scientist's loss of focus causes him to lose control of his chronal drive, setting his mind adrift in time and resulting in the re-emergence of his pre-Shadowplay self. <b>Horrified</b> <b>at</b> what he has become, Shockwave allows Optimus and Megatron to kill him, destroying the drive and bringing an end to his plan.|$|E
25|$|Augusta was {{particularly}} <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> Bismarck's {{foreign policy and}} his cause in the commencement of the Austro-Prussian War.

25|$|As late as in 1699 Celle, {{the courts}} were {{sufficiently}} <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> how the Jewish {{leader of a}} robber gang (condemned to be hanged in the normal manner), declared blasphemies against Christianity, that they made a ruling on the post mortem treatment of Jonas Meyer. After 3 days, his corpse was cut down, his tongue cut out, and his body was hanged up again, but this time from its feet.|$|E
50|$|In {{a charity}} legends race on March 20, 2010, Glotzbach was {{involved}} in a <b>horrifying</b> crash <b>at</b> Bristol Motor Speedway. He T-boned the driver's side of Larry Pearson at near full speed after Pearson spun. Both drivers suffered injuries, but none were life-threatening.|$|R
50|$|They {{camp for}} {{the night in the}} burned ruins of Rustin Parr's house and Jeff places cameras around to capture {{evidence}} of the Blair Witch. As the group gets drunk around a campfire, another tour group arrives and claims to have jurisdiction over the ruins. Jeff and his group convince the others that they saw something <b>horrifying</b> <b>at</b> Coffin Rock earlier, and the other group leaves to investigate. Jeff and his group wake the next morning with no memory of the previous night. Tristen and Stephen's research documents are shredded and strewn about, and Jeff's cameras are destroyed. However, Jeff's tapes are found unharmed in the same spot the Blair Witch Project footage was discovered. Tristen notices that she is bleeding and has miscarried.|$|R
5000|$|Another element {{noted by}} both critics and film {{scholars}} is the film's overt references to cross-dressing in the Leatherface character, which was briefly explored {{in the original}} film but implemented to a greater extent. Robert Wilonsky of the Houston Press commented on the film's treatment of the character, writing that the film [...] "turns Leatherface (here played by Robbie Jacks, an Austin songwriter who used to host a smacked-up radio show with Butthole Surfer Gibby Haynes) into a cross-dressing nancy boy who screams more than he saws." [...] According to Henkel, he wrote the character as one who assumes the persona of the person whose face he wears: [...] "The confused sexuality of the Leatherface character is complex and <b>horrifying</b> <b>at</b> the same time," [...] {{he said in a}} 1996 interview.|$|R
25|$|While Rosebud looks on, {{everyone}} {{is affected by}} the magic and must play their harlequinade parts. When she is not watching, however, they regain their true personalities and are all <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> the excesses of their harlequinade characters. Matters go from bad to worse, and Rosebud finally relents, agreeing to marry the demon and asking Aloysius to perform the ceremony. All are restored to their original characters, Aloysius embraces Clarissa, and Sir Trevor embraces Lady Angela.|$|E
25|$|His {{conservative}} economic approach won him {{support among}} business, but angered {{many in the}} Labor caucus, who wanted to expand the deficit to stimulate the economy, and were <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> the prospect of cuts in salaries and government spending. Alienated by their attacks, Lyons began to consider suggestions {{from a group of}} his new business supporters, including influential members of the Melbourne Establishment, that he leave the government to take over the leadership of the conservative opposition.|$|E
25|$|During a royal {{hunt the}} {{following}} day, Aaron persuades Demetrius and Chiron to kill Bassianus, {{so they may}} rape Lavinia. They do so, throwing Bassianus's body into a pit and dragging Lavinia deep into the forest before violently raping her. To keep her from revealing what has happened, they cut out her tongue and cut off her hands. Meanwhile, Aaron writes a forged letter, which frames Titus's sons Martius and Quintus {{for the murder of}} Bassianus. <b>Horrified</b> <b>at</b> the death of his brother, Saturninus arrests Martius and Quintus, and sentences them to death.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she began}} to laugh. It was a strange, hysterical {{ebullition}} of feeling, frankly <b>horrifying.</b> Naida gazed <b>at</b> her with distended eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{was only}} a few yards from the door, but lacked the courage to rise and fly. Her knees shook, her breath came fast, she almost felt the lurid effect of those tiny patches of rouge upon her pallor-stricken cheeks. Her eyes were dilated--fixed in a <b>horrified</b> stare <b>at</b> the parting in the {{curtains}} which hung before the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{leave me}} here alone?" [...] she cried, with a <b>horrified</b> glance <b>at</b> the abyss. [...] "No, thank you! I should be over that ledge {{before you came}} back!

25|$|In March 1906, Cadogan {{was made}} Honorary Aide-de-Camp to George, Prince of Wales (later George V), with a {{corresponding}} {{appointment to the}} Royal Victorian Order, as a Member, Fourth Class (MVO). From September 1912, he was Equerry to Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), having been promoted major the previous year. In that role, he accompanied the Prince during his time at Magdalen College, Oxford. The Prince's father, the King, was <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> his riding technique, and had Cadogan make the Prince ride four hours {{a week in the}} hope of improving it.|$|E
25|$|When the Scarlet Witch {{inadvertently}} alters reality, Hawkeye is resurrected with {{no memory}} of previous events. When a young mutant named Layla Miller gives several heroes (including Hawkeye) the ability to remember, he is <b>horrified</b> <b>at</b> the Scarlet Witch's actions.

Nicholas promises her that everything would be okay. With the help of Tama, and the technology of 1995, a neutralising agent for the toxic waste is discovered, and a sufficient quantity is manufactured to render the waste in the container safe.|$|E
60|$|My end had come. I knew it; but {{had there}} been a {{doubt in my mind}} the nasty leer of triumph upon that wicked face would have {{convinced}} me. Beyond Thurid I could see my Dejah Thoris, wide-eyed and <b>horrified,</b> struggling <b>at</b> her bonds. That she should be forced to witness my awful death made my bitter fate seem doubly cruel.|$|R
5000|$|Carrie {{received}} largely positive {{reviews and}} {{is widely regarded}} as one of the best films of 1976. The film currently holds a 93% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: [...] "Carrie is a <b>horrifying</b> look <b>at</b> supernatural powers, high school cruelty, and teen angst - and it brings us one of the most memorable and disturbing prom scenes in history." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Horrified,</b> furious <b>at</b> this {{breach of}} discipline, Pierce ran to meet them, waving {{his hat and}} raising the wild yell, [...] "Whoo-ee!"
