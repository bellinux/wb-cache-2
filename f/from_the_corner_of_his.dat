2500|$|In November 1987, Dahmer—at {{the time}} {{residing}} {{with his grandmother}} in West Allis—encountered a 25-year-old from Ontonagon, Michigan, named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded {{him to return to}} the Ambassador Hotel, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, {{he had no intention of}} murdering Tuomi, but simply intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest [...] "crushed in" [...] and [...] "black and blue" [...] with bruises. Blood was also seeping <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had absolutely no memory of having killed Tuomi, and later informed investigators that he simply [...] "could not believe this had happened." [...] To dispose of Tuomi's body, he purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later, he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso, then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. He then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags. He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into splinters with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and all of Tuomi's remains—excluding the severed head—were disposed of in the trash.|$|E
2500|$|Walters {{was denied}} an {{opportunity}} to tour South Africa in 1966-67 when he was conscripted to two years of National Service training, although effectively being exempted from Vietnam service in order to pursue his professional, cricketing career in Australia, and it wasn't until 1968 that {{he returned to the}} test arena. [...] In the 1968-69 series against the West Indies, Walters was injured and unavailable for the first Test match, but in the remaining four Tests he scored a Bradmanlike 699 runs, at an average of 116.5, with a highest score of 242 (in the process he became the first player to score a century and a double century in a single Test). In 1969-70 he showed a weakness against the South African fast bowlers Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, ducking while leaving his bat upright like a submarine periscope. This weakness was exploited by England's John Snow in the 1970-71 Ashes Series, who repeatedly sent down fast, short-pitched balls against Walters. Even so, Walters made 205 not out for New South Wales against the tourists, 112 in the First Test and three fifties thereafter, but few runs in between, making 373 runs (37.30) in the series. Walters starred in an unofficial Test series to a Rest of the World team led by Gary Sobers that toured in 197172 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans, scoring 355 runs in four matches at an average of 71.00, with 2 centuries. He famously hit a century in a session at the WACA against England in 1974, where he hit Bob Willis for six from the last ball of the day to bring up his ton. His 250 against New Zealand in 1977 is the highest by any batsman in the number six position. Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] broke many partnerships and yielded 49 Test wickets at 29.08. He wore the large sideburns popular in the 1960s and [...] 1970s and when not on the field was seldom seen without a cigarette hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth. He was also famous for his Laconic humour.|$|E
