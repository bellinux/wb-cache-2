Patient procedure dose area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy duration of 131 PCI patient cases from each X-ray system were compared using a Wilcoxon test on median values.

40|$|Abstract-Our idea is {{to improve}} the {{performance}} and efficiency of multicore processors. Using piezoelectric materials, the power supply to each core can be cut off if the load is low. This way, the number of cores running for performing light tasks is less. Improving efficiency and improving performance drastically. The piezoelectric material can be used between the processor cores. Once a processor reaches it’s peak load, the change in current and voltage can change the dimensions of the piezoelectric material. The piezoelectric material is used as the power source connection for the cores in the microprocessor. The connections are made in a mesh design. This connection provides power for the next core and hence the load is shared instantly. Based on the load, multiple cores can be switched on or off.

40|$|This PhD thesis models {{the whole}} power chain of a {{marine current turbine}} (MCT) system and investigates the use of energy storage devices to improve power quality and energy {{management}} capability. First, various energy storage technologies concerning their applications to address the power fluctuation phenomena in tidal <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> are reviewed and compared. Then, a two-stage power smoothing control strategy for compensating swell-induced short-time fluctuations is proposed. The proposed control strategy uses a modified MPPT with filter strategy on the generator-side and supercapacitors on the grid-side for injecting a smoothed power to the grid. Afterwards, a flow battery system for daily energy management of a hybrid MCT/battery/diesel system is proposed. The MCT dominant power supply case and an island power supply (with diesel generators as the main source) are investigated. Finally, power limitation controls with a robust flux-weakening strategy for a PMSG-based non-pitchable MCT system are proposed for over-rated marine current speed periods. In this context, the constant power control and maximum power control modes at the flux-weakening stage are compared; {{and the influence of}} the generator parameters on the joint operating characteristics of the turbine and generator are also discussed...|$|R
