50|$|The glow stick {{contains}} two chemicals and a suitable dye (sensitizer, or <b>fluorophor).</b> This creates an exothermic reaction. The chemicals inside the plastic tube are {{a mixture of}} the dye and diphenyl oxalate. The chemical in the glass vial is hydrogen peroxide. By mixing the peroxide with the phenyl oxalate ester, a chemical reaction takes place, yielding two moles of phenol and one mole of peroxyacid ester (1,2-dioxetanedione). The peroxyacid decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide, releasing energy that excites the dye, which then relaxes by releasing a photon. The wavelength of the photon—the color of the emitted light—depends {{on the structure of}} the dye. The reaction releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat. The {{reason for this is that}} the reverse 2+2 photocycloaddition of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a forbidden transition (it violates Woodward-Hoffmann rules) and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism.|$|E

The area (approximately 6. 5 X 9. 5 mm) covering the lens section was scanned automatically by the microprobe programmed to measure the fluorescence intensity at 1200 data points. The spectrometer output was accumulated in a microcomputer and displayed as a three-dimensional perspective view showing the fluorescence intensity at each point on the grid. The method permits the precise and detailed mapping at high resolution of the spatial distribution of a <b>fluorophor</b> or Raman-emissive constituent in a plane of the frozen lens to give results not obtainable by any other feasible procedure. The green <b>fluorophor</b> (441. 6 nm, excitation wavelength; 520 nm, peak emission wavelength) has a distribution indicating a metabolic rather than a photochemical mode of production. Moreover, the lower level of <b>fluorophor</b> in the anterior segment suggests the existence of mechanisms in the anterior cortex (including the epithelium) that reduce significantly the accumulation of <b>fluorophor.</b> Such distribution studies are invaluable in clarifying metabolic interrelationships among the different zones of the lens, including especially photochemical reactions postulated to involve the effect of daylight on the lens in human subjects...|$|E
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 2064 - 2073 The most {{extensive}} data set yet generated correlating photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra is presented for aged (equilibrated) porous silicon (PS) samples. The observed features, which are temperature independent {{over the range}} 10 − 300 K, show a detailed correlation {{with the results of}} photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) and with molecular electronic structure calculations. The observed energy level patterns are reproduced in the photoabsorption (PA) of PS films released after the etching of a silicon wafer. It is concluded that the energy level pattern found for the photoluminescing surface of PS results from a structure which is neither uniquely molecule- or bulk-like but represents a hybrid form for which the density of states associated with a polyatomic vibrationally excited surface-bound <b>fluorophor</b> dominates the nature of the observed features which are not those of a semiconductor. These <b>fluorophor</b> features are broadened and shifted to lower excitation energy {{as a result of the}} intimate presence of the silicon surface to which the <b>fluorophor</b> is bound. The dominance of the surface-bound <b>fluorophor</b> accounts for the temperature-independent PLE and PL features. The observed spectral features are thus suggested to be the result of a strong synergistic interaction in which the silicon surface influences the location of surface-bound <b>fluorophor</b> excited states whereas the nature of the vibrationally excited surface-bound <b>fluorophor</b> coupling to the silicon surface provides the mechanism for an enhanced vibronic structure dominated interaction and energy transfer. The observed PLE, PL, PAS, and PA measurements are found to be consistent with previous photovoltaic and photoconductivity measurements, correlating well with a surface-bound oxyhydride-like emitter. This study suggests the important role that the overtone structure of a molecule bound to a surface can play as one forms a hybrid system...|$|E

40|$|These {{innovative}} applications {{have led}} to a new dye chemistry. At present, the design of functional fluo-rophores is the most significant and enticing field in dye chemistry (Daehne et al., 1998). There are several requirements for an ideal fluorescent label in biotechnology. First, the fluorophore should be soluble and stable in water because most measurements are performed in aqueous solution. This requirement al-ready excludes the great majority of commercially avail-able organic fluorophores because many of them are not water-soluble, and others decompose in water. Second, labels should possess a reactive group for covalent cou-pling to targets. Third, molar absorbances of potential la-bels should be quite high, because only the photons that are absorbed can be emitted as fluorescent light again. Fourth, labels should exhibit a high emission quantum yield to reduce detection limits of tagged species. Other, more special demands include thermal and photostabili-ty as well as tunable charge of the labels to avoid unde-sired electrostatic attraction between label and target. Until now there has been no single label that fulfills all the requirements described above.

Intensity of the fluorescent signals was measured for three bacteria having various sensitivities to environmental stresses, Bacillus subtilus (spores and vegetative cells), Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Micrococcus luteus. The performance of the UVAPS was found to depend on the type of airborne bacteria. In addition, the fluorescence signals for stationary-phase bacteria were generally stronger than for their log-phase counterparts. These results indicated that bacterial injury due to environmental stresses has a strong influence on the measured fluorescence signals. This hypothesis was confirmed by obtaining a linear relationship between the percentage of fluorescent particles and the proportion of injured bacteria in the total population of cultivable bacteria in samples simultaneously collected with the AGI- 30 impingers. This indicates that the amount of <b>fluorophors</b> (specifically NADH) within injured bacteria is below the UVAPS sensitivity level.
