60|$|<b>Barbara</b> did so, <b>and</b> Brooke's fingers closed {{more tightly}} than was {{necessary}} on the cup she handed to him, while the cracker {{he forced himself}} to eat came near choking him. This was absurd sentimentality, he told himself, but, for all that, he dared scarcely meet the eyes of the lady who had, he realized, prepared that meal out of compliment to him. It was a relief when it was over {{and he was able to}} take his leave, but, as it happened, he forgot the plan he had laid <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Barbara,</b> who noticed it, overtook him in the log-hall. Devine had not come back yet.|$|R
2500|$|When casting {{about for}} the role of Norma Desmond for the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder offered West the role. Still smarting from the {{censorship}} debacle of The Heat's On, [...] and the constraints placed on her characterization, she declined. The theme of the Wilder film, she noted, [...] was pure pathos, while her brand of comedy was always [...] "about uplifting the audience". [...] Mae West had a unique comic character that was timeless, in the same way Charlie Chaplin did. After Mary Pickford also declined the role, Gloria Swanson was cast. In subsequent years, West was offered the role of Vera Simpson, opposite Marlon Brando, in the 1957 film adaptation of Pal Joey, which she turned down, with the role going to Rita Hayworth. [...] In 1964, West was offered a leading role in Roustabout, starring Elvis Presley. She turned the role <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> Stanwyck was cast in her place. West was also approached for roles in Frederico Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits and Satyricon, but rejected both offers.|$|R
60|$|He turned <b>and</b> plunged <b>down</b> the stairs, <b>and</b> <b>Barbara,</b> {{seeing that}} Shillito had vanished, {{ran along the}} veranda.

5000|$|Delan {{was given}} his start in {{television}} in 1979, working for ABC News in the ABC News Closeup documentary unit [...] under Pamela Hill.

Titles that Delan worked on include After the Sexual Revolution and Growing Old in America, and Rain of Terror, termed by the Wall Street Journal {{in an editorial}} as [...] "the single best piece of television journalism we've ever witnessed." ...|$|R
60|$|The tugs' engines stopped <b>and</b> <b>Barbara's</b> heart beat, for {{a yellow}} flag went up. She hated the ominous signal, and turning the glasses, {{followed}} the doctor's launch. The boat ran alongside Terrier, a man went on board, returned and climbed a ladder to Arcturus' deck. He {{did not come}} back for some time <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> looked for Lister, but could not see him. Then the yellow flag was hauled <b>down</b> <b>and</b> Arcturus moved slowly up the harbor.|$|R

60|$|The cab, {{moving at}} unaccustomed speed along these deserted roads, moaned dismally; <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> was possessed now {{by a desire}} which she dared not put in practice, to pull his head <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> rock it against her.

Among these flying dark ghosts of pine-trees--as it were the unfrequented borderland between two worlds--the feeling of a cheek against her breast alone could help muffle the deep disquiet in her, lost like a child in a wood.|$|R
