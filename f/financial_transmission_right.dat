The question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structure. We show that even with perfect foresight of average congestion rents the clearing prices for the FTRs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>right</b> (FTR) auction. In particular, we demonstrate that if all FTR bid quantities are equal to the corresponding average transaction volumes and the bid values are set at the expected congestion rent level, then the resulting auction prices systematically deviate from the known FTR values.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} {{with the introduction of}} competition in the power sector is the strategic behaviour of market participants. Computable models of strategic behaviour are becoming increasingly important to understand the complexities of competition. Such models can help analyze market designs and regulatory policies. In this thesis, further developments on the modelling and analysis of strategic behaviour in electricity markets are presented. This thesis work has been conducted along three research lines. In the first research line, an oligopolistic model of a joint energy and spinning reserve market is formulated to analyze imperfect competition. Strategic behaviour is introduced by means of conjectured functions. With this integrated formulation for imperfect competition, the opportunity cost between generation and spinning reserve has been analytically derived. Besides, inter-temporal and energy constraints, and <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rights</b> are taken into account. Under such considerations, competition in electricity markets is modelled with more realism. The oligopolistic model is formulated as an equilibrium problem in terms of complementarity conditions. In the second research line, a methodology to screen and mitigate the potential exacerbation of market power due to the ownership of <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rights</b> is presented. Hedging position ratios are computed to quantify the hedging level of <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rights.</b> They are based on the actual impact that each participant has in the energy market, and on the potential impact that it would have with the ownership of <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rights.</b> Thus, hedging position ratios are used to identify the potential gambling positions from the <b>transmission</b> <b>rights</b> bidders, and, therefore, used to prioritize critical positions in the auction for <b>transmission</b> <b>rights.</b> In the last research line, alternative equilibrium models of markets for <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rights</b> are formulated. The proposed equilibrium framework is more natural and flexible for modelling markets than the classic cost-minimization markets. Different markets for <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rights</b> are modelled, namely: i) forwards, ii) options, and iii) joint forwards and options. Moreover, one-period, multi-period and multi-round markets for forwards are derived. These equilibrium models are proposed to analyze the bidding strategies of market participants.

Reasons for this can be a lack of consensus about the definition of transmission output and the complexitity of the relationship between optimal grid expansion and output expansion. Knowledge of transmission cost functions could help firms (Transcos) and regulators plan transmission expansion and could help design regulatory incentive mechanisms. We explore transmission cost functions when the transmission output is defined as point-to-point transactions or <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>right</b> (FTR) obligations and particularly explore expansion under loop-flows. We test the behavior of FTR-based cost functions for distinct network topologies and find evidence that cost functions defined as FTR outputs are piecewise differentiable and that they contain sections with negative marginal costs.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{model for}} oligopolistic {{competition}} in electricity markets is presented. Most previous proposed models have been static and focused only on the energy market incentives for strategic behavior. In contrast, in this paper, a multiperiod market for energy and spinning reserve (SR) is considered. By including such factors, the competition among participants is modeled with more realism. Competition in the energy market is modeled by means of conjectured supply functions, while conjectured reserve-price response functions are used to con-sider the generators ’ ability to alter the SR prices. The resulting equilibrium problem is modeled in terms of complementarity conditions. Based upon a complementarity model, the opportunity cost between the energy and SR markets is derived for oligopolistic markets. The proposed model is illustrated by a six-node network using a dc approximation. Index Terms—Complementarity, conjectured function, energy market, oligopoly, spinning reserve (SR).

40|$|In vein {{with the}} new energy market rules drafted in the EU this paper {{presents}} and discusses two contract types for hedging the risks connected to long-term transmission rights, the <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>right</b> (FTR) and the electricity price area differentials (EPAD) {{that are used in}} the Nordic electricity markets. The possibility to replicate the FTR contracts with a combination of EPAD contracts is presented and discussed. Based on historical evidence and empirical analysis of ten Nordic interconnectors and twenty bidding areas, we investigate the pricing accuracy of the replicated FTR contracts by quantifying ex-post forward risk premia. The results show {{that the majority of the}} studied FTR contain a negative risk premium, especially the monthly and the quarterly contracts. Reverse flow (unnatural) pricing was identified for two interconnectors. From a theoretical policy point of view the results imply that it may be possible to continue with the EPAD-based system by using EPAD Combos in the Nordic countries, even if FTR contracts would prevail elsewhere in the EU. In practice the pricing of bi-directional EPAD contracts is more complex and may not always be very efficient. The efficiency of the EPAD market structure should be discussed from various points of view before accepting their status quo as a replacement for FTRs in the Nordic electricity markets...|$|E

40|$|To {{facilitate}} the U. S. wholesale electric power restructuring process and promote competitive market outcomes, in April 2003 the U. S.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} renewable energy {{in recent years has}} led to more uncertainties in power systems. These uncertainties have to be accommodated by flexible re- sources (i. e. upward and downward generation reserves). In this paper, a novel concept, Uncertainty Marginal Price (UMP), is proposed to price both the uncertainty and reserve. At the same time, the energy is priced at Locational Marginal Price (LMP). A novel market clearing mechanism is proposed to credit the gener- ation and reserve and to charge the load and uncertainty within the Robust Unit Commitment (RUC) in the Day-ahead market. We derive the UMPs and LMPs in the robust optimization framework. UMP helps allocate the cost of generation reserves to uncertainty sources. We prove that the proposed market clearing mechanism leads to partial market equilibrium. We find that transmission reserves must be kept explicitly in addition to generation reserves for uncertainty accommodation. We prove that transmission reserves for ramping delivery may lead to <b>Financial</b> <b>Transmission</b> <b>Right</b> (FTR) underfunding in existing markets. The FTR underfunding can be covered by congestion fund collected from uncertainty payment in the proposed market clearing mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the implementability of locational marginal price (LMP) and <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>right</b> (FTR) mechanisms {{in the presence}} of high voltage dc (HVDC) lines in the regulated (i. e., under the control of system operator) network. The established framework of LMP-FTR mechanism assumes that the system under regulation is fully ac. Unregulated (or private) HVDC lines are taken into account within this framework through proxy-transaction bids from the line owners. However, as the flow over a regulated HVDC line has to be controlled by the system operator himself, the existing LMP-FTR framework becomes insufficient if the system contains or is expanded with regulated HVDC lines. The augmentation that should be made to the existing framework to include regulated HVDC lines is explained in this paper. It is shown that the flow over a regulated HVDC line can be modeled as a non-chargeable bilateral transaction without causing any threat of negative congestion surplus. For this power dispatch model, revenue adequacy of FTRs can be still ensured by means of the conventional simultaneous feasibility test (SFT) model. By utilizing the capacities of dc lines, a more general SFT model is further developed. The modified auction problem is discussed and tested for the non-negativity of net auction collection. The process of revenue adequate issuance of auction revenue rights is explained. Finally, the relative merit of a regulated HVDC line over a private HVDC line is discussed through a case study.

40|$|The {{acceptance}} of the nodal pricing system as a mechanism to organize wholesale power markets has exposed both generators and consumers to unprecedented volatile prices. Most of the volatility follows from the method for valuing congestion on the network. Generators and wholesale consumers pay or collect a charge depending on whether their actions cause or relieve congested bottlenecks on the grid. The charges {{vary according to the}} location of the injection (source-node) or withdrawal (sink-node) relative to the overall grid topography. Following Hogan (1992), a hedging contract called <b>Financial</b> <b>Transmission</b> <b>Right</b> (FTR) Obligation was introduced in most wholesale power markets. A FTR Obligation, designated in Megawatts, is defined by a source node and sink node. The holder of the contract is entitled (obligated) to a stream of cash flows that exactly offsets the volatile congestion charges. They are initially sold in an auction. ^ This thesis advances the understanding of the market for FTR Obligations. Two specific areas are addressed. Firstly, the format of the auction for initial sale of FTR Obligations is examined for possible inefficiencies. One such inefficiency – that the multi-round format creates an opportunity for acquiring a zero-payoff portfolio for net negative cost – is described. Secondly, this dissertation develops a method for consistently comparing the value of different source-sink node FTR Obligations. ^ 1. Auction Structure and Implications for Bidding Strategy. Congestion charges across the network are jointly determined. Among a subset of FTR Obligations, the relationship assumes a simple form. The thesis demonstrates that the dependency together with a particular auction format creates a profitable opportunity. Examination of the annual auction conducted by PJM Interconnection reveals that investors benefit from this opportunity through systematic bidding beyond first round. ^ 2. Valuing FTR Obligations. FTR Obligations are essentially non-hedgeable contracts. Owing to the joint determination of congestion charges, the values of FTR Obligations exhibit a structure. This thesis capitalizes on the dependence structure to relatively value FTR Obligations. By suitably depicting the common sources of uncertainty, the dissertation derives the parameters of individual contracts’ payoff distributions thus facilitating a consistent comparison among different source-sink FTR Obligations. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} transmission pricing, transmission congestion {{risks and}} their associated hedging instruments {{as well as}} mechanisms for stimulating investments in transmission expansion. An example of risk management {{in the case of}} a hydropower producer is included. After liberalization and restructuring of electricity markets, risk management has become important. In particular the thesis analyzes risks due to transmission congestion both in the short- and long-term (investments) for market players such as generators, loads, traders, independent system operators and merchant investors. The work is focused on the northeastern United States electricity markets and the Nordic electricity markets. The first part of the thesis reviews the literature related to the eight research papers in the thesis. This describes the risks that are relevant for an electricity market player and how these can be managed. Next, the basic ingredients of a competitive electricity market are described including the design of the system operator. The transmission pricing method is decisive for hedging against transmission congestion risks and there is an overview of transmission pricing models considering their similarities and differences. Depending on the transmission pricing method used, locational or area (zonal) pricing, the electricity market players can use financial transmission rights or Contracts for Differences, respectively. In the long-term it is important to create mechanisms for investments in transmission expansion and the thesis describes one possible approach and its potential problems. The second part comprises eight research papers. It presents empirical analyses of existing markets for transmission congestion derivatives, theoretical analyses of transmission congestion derivatives, modeling of merchant long-term financial transmission rights, theoretical analysis of the risks of the independent system operator in providing financial transmission rights, an analysis of inefficiencies associated with ignoring losses when utilizing area (zonal) pricing, and an application of an integrated risk management model on the power system of Norway’s second largest hydropower producer. The most important research findings include the following issues. First, Contracts for Differences in the Nordic market appear to be over-priced. Second, a merchant long-term financial transmission rights model is possible to realize in mathematical and economic terms. Third, by including the proceeds from a <b>financial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>right</b> auction the independent system operator can issue a higher volume of rights because there is a relationship between the congestion rent, the proceeds from the auction and the payments to the financial transmission rights holders. Fourth, ignoring losses in the Norwegian area pricing, can lead to inefficiencies. Next, an integrated risk management model is applicable on large-scale power systems. Then, an overview is presented of different contractual arrangements that can be used to hedge transmission congestion risks. Finally, empirical data from existing financial transmission rights markets demonstrate how these markets work. </p...|$|E
