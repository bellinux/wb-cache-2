Several tour dates were cancelled and rescheduled due to the collapse of lightning systems. An extended play entitled Justin & Christina was released exclusively at Target Stores in July 2003 to promote the tour. The CD contains four remixes of Aguilera and Timberlake's songs from their two albums, and two new tracks. In late 2003, The Stripped Tour, the former's extension, happened without Timberlake's acts. The tour took place in Europe, Japan and Australia. The former grossed total US$30,261,670, becoming the sixteenth highest-grossing tour of 2003. In summer 2004, Aguilera was expected to return to North American during the second leg of the tour. However, the 29 tour dates were cancelled in the last minute due to the singer's vocal strain. On November 15, 2008, an accompanying video release of the tour, Stripped Live in the U.K., was released worldwide. On December 8, 2004, a compilation album which includes Stripped and the DVD was released in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Eve served in the United States Army from 19531955 and achieved the rank of corporal. [...] Eve holds an Associate's degree from Erie Community College and a Bachelor of Science from West Virginia. He had been an All-High basketball player in Florida and became an All-Europe player during his Army tour of duty in Germany, where he ran a program for orphans. [...] After completing his Army service he returned to Buffalo in 1955. [...] Eve's first job in Buffalo was in a Chevrolet plant. While working there he became aware of drugs problems with local youths in the city's parks, and observed a lack of guidance for youth in the community. He surrendered his job to pursue a post in parks recreation, but learned that such jobs were doled out by political patronage to party loyalists. [...] Eve joined the Democratic Party and <b>got</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the patronage parks jobs.

500|$|Steiger apperared {{in three}} films {{released}} in 1957. The first was John Farrow's film noir The Unholy Wife, {{in which he}} played a wealthy Napa Valley vintner who marries a femme fatale named Phyllis (Diana Dors). In its original review of the film, The New York Times described Steiger's performance as [...] "curious" [...] further stating that the actor's voice modulation [...] "ranges from Marlon Brando to Ronald Colman and back." [...] During the production of Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow, in which he played a confederate veteran who refuses to accept defeat following the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox {{at the end of}} the American Civil War, Steiger badly sprained his ankle before shooting one of the battle scenes and was unable to walk, let alone run. Fuller instead <b>got</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Native American extras to run in Steiger's place, which is why the scene was shot showing only the feet, instead of using close-ups. Steiger had researched the history behind the film and decided to play the character as an Irishman, becoming [...] "the first Irish cowboy" [...] as he put it. Later that year, Steiger took the lead role in the British thriller Across the Bridge, in which he played a German conman with British citizenship who goes into hiding in Mexico after embezzling company funds. Film critic Dennis Schwartz stated that Steiger gave [...] "one of his greatest performances".|$|E
500|$|On ButterFly, Streisand {{departed}} from the pop and rock influences that were strong on her previous efforts and instead relied more {{on a variety of}} experimental, contemporary pop music. The singer also explored the reggae and classic R genres that were, at the time, popular on mainstream radio. The album opens with a [...] "seductive" [...] version of [...] "Love in the Afternoon", a song originally performed by American singer Evie Sands earlier in 1974. It was written by Sands, Ben Geminaro, and Richard Wiseman; production of [...] "Love in the Afternoon" [...] and all songs on ButterFly were solely handled by Peters. [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] is track two and a cover of Bob Marley's 1971 single. One of the reggae songs on the album, it features [...] "risqué lyrics" [...] that suggest that guava jelly {{could be used as a}} type of sexual lubricant. Bill Withers's R ballad [...] "Grandma's Hands" [...] follows and is primarily a [...] "gospel-flavored" [...] song. Lyrically, it details a woman who shares a strong bond with her grandmother. [...] "I Won't Last a Day Without You" [...] is the fourth track and a cover of the Carpenters' 1974 single; it was written by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols. The album's second and final single, [...] "Jubilation", was a song made famous by Paul Anka in 1972. In response to Streisand's rendition of the track, Anka questioned her decision to have Peters produce but remarked, [...] "Barbra can sing the phone book. She has no problem singing anything.

McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, waiting anxiously for any signals from Minh to [...] "broad hints of our interest in other subjects which we gave him during breaks in the game".

2500|$|At {{the time}} of release, {{professional}} reviews were overall mixed. Record Mirror stated: [...] "Assuming that the title {{should be taken to}} mean that the group are trying to visit the territorial war grounds of their golden years in the singles charts I reckon they are in for a shock. I expect a little more than references to Big Brother, Stereo, Radio etc, in the otherwise catchy [...] "Sign of the Times" [...] and the reflection of [...] "Born to Run" [...] in [...] "Wheels Ain't Coming Down". On [...] "Nuts Bolts & Screws" [...] and [...] "My Baby's Got It" [...] Slade start to rock, but there's nothing here to distinguish them from any other rocking combo. I wasn't expecting another [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "My Friend Stan" [...] but just something a little more inspired. From a new band this would be a fairly good debut, from Slade I want more." [...] Sounds were similar in their reception, writing: [...] "Slade have managed to pull a fair to impressive performance out of the bag with this one. Sure to new wave lugs it sounds dated, but Return to Base still rocks like a good un', utilising standard rock 'n' roll/hard rock foundations for commendable displays of tightness and old time rock bite. Noddy's <b>got</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the all time classic rock voices as he belts through ten steamy originals and one Chuck Berry cover. Slade may have stood still, but their own brand of rock shout clout still sounds good to these biased ears." ...|$|E

[...] By 1982, Calder was introduced to a young fresh college graduate named Barry Weiss who, for his job interview with Zomba, took Calder out to hip-hop and black clubs all over New York City. [...] Calder was immediately impressed with the man and had him scanning sales data {{all over the country}} searching for unknown acts on small labels selling large numbers. [...] Calder <b>got</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his songwriters Thomas Dolby to create a catchy hook for a local DJ Mr. Magic to rap over. [...] Mr. Magic had to cancel at the last minute, but fortunately he knew another rapper, Jalil Hutchins. [...] Weiss's stress level shot up when Hutchins came to the session with another unknown rapper named Ecstasy and no rhymes. [...] After two days, the group created and recorded [...] "Magic's Wand" [...] which turned into a hit single. [...] Weiss named the group Houdini, but Calder changed it to Whodini. [...] Calder flew the group to London to record an album, then to Germany to record with producer Konrad [...] "Conny" [...] Plank of Devo and Ultravox fame.
