5|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} its Island Records debut, The Artist in the Ambulance. The album's title is {{in reference to}} Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band's desire {{to do more than}} make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations. A portion of the album's proceeds were this time donated to the Syrentha Savio Endowment, a financial aid organization for breast cancer patients. <b>First</b> <b>pressings</b> of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band.|$|E
5|$|The full {{series is}} set to be {{released}} over two uncut DVD box-sets in Japan. The first was announced for a July 2, 2010 release and retails for 19,950 yen ($212 USD), with the second following on September 15. On August 3, 2010, the first volume was released on Blu-ray with the second set to follow on October 20, both priced at 25,200 yen ($268 USD). The <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> included replica NSS ID cards, a postcard set, a bonus disc, and a 24-page data booklet.|$|E
500|$|The very <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of {{the album}} feature a hidden spoken message by Spears after [...] "The Beat Goes On". In it, Spears thanks fans and {{promotes}} the then-upcoming Backstreet Boys album, Millennium, with snippets of songs featured on the album.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to change the}} album's name {{at the last minute}} resulted in a few different versions of the album. There are also different versions of the album that are unrelated to the title. Regarding the different versions of the album, some of the <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of the cassette still contained Five Against One printed on the cassette itself, the first couple of pressings of the cassette do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the lyrics to [...] "Indifference" [...] are included in the cassette version. The first couple of pressings of the CD do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the initial versions of the CD came in an Ecopak, which was a variation on the traditional CD-sized Digipak. While not rare, they went out of print quickly and are now hard to find. The song titles are not printed on the back cover of this version, but the artwork remains the same. The vinyl version has never had the title printed on it, and the cover art on the vinyl copies is different from the CD and cassette. For all versions, the picture of the [...] "elderly woman" [...] changed at some point after the <b>first</b> <b>pressings.</b> Allegedly, the original woman never gave permission for her picture to be used, so Pearl Jam changed the picture to another woman. The difference is easy to spot, as [...] "the new and improved woman behind the counter" [...] is printed below the picture.|$|E
500|$|Before and After Science was {{released}} in December 1977 on Polydor in the United Kingdom and on Island in the United States. The <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of the album included four offset prints by Peter Schmidt. The back cover of the LP says [...] "Fourteen Pictures" [...] under the album title, referencing Eno's ten songs and Peter Schmidt's 4 prints. These prints included [...] "The Road to the Crater", [...] "Look at September, look at October", [...] "The Other House" [...] and [...] "Four Years". The album did not chart in the United Kingdom, but was Eno's first album since Here Come the Warm Jets to chart in the United States, where it peaked at 171 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart. [...] "King's Lead Hat" [...] was remixed and released as a single in January 1978, featuring the B-side [...] "R.A.F.", which is credited to [...] "Eno & Snatch" [...] (in the UK, not the US). This single failed to chart {{and has never been}} reissued in any form.|$|E
2500|$|<b>First</b> <b>pressings</b> of the US single have a {{quote from}} Aleister Crowley inscribed in dead wax by the run-out groove: [...] "Do what thou wilt shall be {{the whole of the}} Law." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dinah Lee's debut single, [...] "Don't You Know Yockomo?", was {{released}} in August 1964 – under the name Diane Lee, chosen by Viking – and peaked at No.1 in New Zealand. Viking used Merritt's band to back her {{in the studio and}} after the <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> had sold out, Viking changed the attribution to Dinah Lee. Ray Columbus & the Invaders' single, [...] "She's a Mod" [...] became the first by a New Zealand act to reach No.1 on an Australian chart. Only weeks later, Lee's single, [...] "Don't You Know Yockomo?" [...] was issued there by EMI on their HMV label and reached No.1 in Brisbane and Melbourne.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of the Vee-Jay single, {{which was}} {{assigned}} the catalog number 498, featured a typographical error: the band's name was spelled [...] "The Beattles" [...] with two [...] "t"s. WLS used this spelling on its Silver Dollar Surveys in 1963. Later {{copies of the}} single corrected this. Also, the composers on the Vee-Jay edition were credited on both sides as [...] "J. Lennon-P. McCartney", unlike on the UK Parlophone edition (which listed the names in the reverse order). However, {{with the exception of}} Chicago, the record was a flop as it sold approximately 7,310 copies. Today, copies of Vee-Jay 498—whether with the incorrect or correct spelling of the Beatles on the label—are valuable collector's items.|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2012, the Residents {{released}} Coochie Brake; it {{focused on}} an ambient, slightly ethnic sound, with lyrics in Spanish spoken by, apparently, a new singer. On 7 December 2012, {{as part of}} the celebrations of the upcoming 40th anniversary of its first release, the Santa Dog EP, the Residents released an infomercial starring its lead singer, [...] "Randy Rose", who notified the public of the release of the Residents' Ultimate Box Set—a 28-cubic-foot refrigerator that contained the <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of every Residents release to date as well as other ephemera (such as an eyeball mask and top hat). The Cryptic Corporation advised in a press release that the intended audience for this project was the realm of fine art, and, accordingly, the price of the set is $100,000.|$|E
5000|$|<b>First</b> <b>pressing</b> CD and DVD - Consists {{of eleven}} songs on one disc. Includes two music videos and one live {{performance}} on the second disc. <b>First</b> <b>pressing</b> issues include a bonus poster and cardboard sleeve case.|$|R

50|$|Tracks 7-9 {{were not}} {{included}} on the <b>first</b> <b>pressing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of {{the album}} {{included}} the phrases [...] "So mote be it" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} [...] "So mote it be"), then later on included the phrase [...] "Do what thou wilt", inscribed on the lacquer itself by engineer Terry Manning during the final mastering process. This phrase is identical to one in the core tenet of Aleister Crowley's philosophy of Thelema: [...] "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. Love is the law, love under will. There is no law beyond do what thou wilt." [...] But it is also the same as a portion of a variant of the Wiccan Rede. Page was a scholar of Crowley's work, once owning a private collection of Crowley manuscripts, artwork and other ephemera, and in the 1970s even bought one of his residences, Boleskine House on the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|His next album, Poems, Prayers, and Promises (released in 1971), was a {{breakthrough}} {{for him in}} the U.S., {{thanks in part to the}} single [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads", which went to number 2 on the Billboard charts despite the <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a re-issue of the track and began a radio-airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten album with Rocky Mountain High, with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973. Between 1974 and 1975, Denver experienced an impressive chart dominance, with a string of four No.1 songs ("Sunshine on My Shoulders", [...] "Annie's Song", [...] "Thank God I'm a Country Boy", and [...] "I'm Sorry") and three No.1 albums (John Denver's Greatest Hits, Back Home Again, and Windsong).|$|E
2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, {{but the only thing}} I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, because I had to be in L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, and quite frankly I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When I went there, it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the <b>first</b> <b>pressings</b> of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, who taught me how to pray".|$|E
