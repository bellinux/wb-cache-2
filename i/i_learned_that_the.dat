25|$|The {{delegation}} {{arrived in}} Pliska {{in the beginning}} of 868. Boris <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pope had offered him to choose the archbishop of the Bulgarian Church from among the presbyters he had sent. By order Hadrian II, Formosus of Portus and Paul of Populona returned to Rome as early as February in the same year, accompanied by Peter. Boris I was disappointed with the Pope's answers and decided to end the negotiations with Rome.|$|E
500|$|Wolverine's Native American (Blackfoot/Niitsítapi) mutant love {{interest}} and pawn of Stryker. She has {{the powers of}} tactile telepathy and hypnosis which allows her to control or convince others {{to do the things}} she wants them to by physical touch. However, Victor is immune to telepathy. Describing her role, Collins said [...] "I had to play off all the guys and their testosterone-heavy abilities. But <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> female powers of persuasion easily trump fangs and knives and guns." [...] Michelle Monaghan turned down the role because of scheduling conflicts, despite her enthusiasm to work with Jackman.|$|E
2500|$|Fanny Crosby, the hymn writer {{recalled}} that Scott's [...] "gentle manner {{did not indicate}} a hero of so many battles; yet there was strength beneath the exterior appearance and a heart of iron within his breast. But from him <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> warrior only it is, who can fully appreciate the blessing of peace. ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Government {{has just}} {{refused to give}} the Museum a grant of five {{thousand}} pounds to be employed in what are called [...] "Excavations in Ancient Phaeacia," [...] diggings, that is, in Boothland.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{troops of}} Sun Yat Sen, President of South China, [...] which are stated to be marching north from Canton, are a rabble. [...] Many are without weapons {{and a large}} {{percentage}} of the uniforms [...] are merely rags. There is no discipline, and gambling and [...] opium-smoking are rife.|$|R
5000|$|From {{members of}} Secretary War William W.Belknap's party who came down recently,... <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spoliations {{in the park}} are great. There is at present no way of {{checking}} them. Several of the geysers are now nearly ruined and the Government should take some action to preserve these wonderful and beautiful curiosities {{before it is too}} late.

60|$|Fifteen {{minutes later}} he was out again, without leopard skins, but full of information. By means of my card, of my hotel card, of my watch, and of the boy's fingers, I learned the following: that at six o'clock that evening he would arrive at my hotel with ten leopard skins for my inspection. Further, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> skins were the {{property}} of one Captain Ernesto Becucci. Also, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boy's name was Eliceo.|$|E
60|$|P.S. On {{my return}} to California after the voyage, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Snark was forty-three {{feet on the}} water-line instead of forty- five. This {{was due to the}} fact that the builder was not on {{speaking}} terms with the tape-line or two-foot rule.|$|E
6000|$|Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship's {{crew had}} escaped {{in one of}} their own boats, and taken refuge in the South Sand Head Lightship, whence they were {{conveyed}} next day to land, so that the gallant men of Ramsgate and Broadstairs had all their toil and trouble for nothing! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then go I will,' replied Swithin firmly. 'I {{have been}} {{fortunate}} enough to interest some leading astronomers, including the Astronomer Royal; and in a letter received this morning <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of the Cape Observatory has been offered me for any southern observations I may wish to make. This offer I will accept. Will you kindly let Lady Constantine know this, since she is interested in my welfare?' ...|$|R
6000|$|I am indebted for {{a curious}} ground-plan of the Castle of Kenilworth, as it existed in Queen Elizabeth's time, to the {{voluntary}} kindness of Richard Badnall Esq. of Olivebank, near Liverpool. From his obliging communication, <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original sketch was {{found among the}} manuscripts of the celebrated J. J. Rousseau, when he left England. These were entrusted by the philosopher {{to the care of}} his friend Mr. Davenport, and passed from his legatee into the possession of Mr. Badnall.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps by your hand, then," [...] said Noie, {{looking at}} her curiously. [...] "Well, soon or late he will die a red death--the reddest of deaths, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> from <b>the</b> spirit of my father." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{was about}} to leave the place, several more {{passengers}} came in, and by what they said <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> train would not start for Chicago till noon, the bridge being so badly damaged that the road engineer would not let anything cross until it was propped up.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{commander}} of a Chinese man-of-war who received {{a copy of the}} edict of 1972 from the hand of my illustrious ancestor, Admiral Turck, on one hundred seventy-five, two hundred and six years ago, and from the yellowed pages of the admiral's diary <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fate of the Philippines was even then presaged by these Chinese naval officers.|$|E
60|$|About {{three o'clock}} there began the thud {{of a gun}} at {{measured}} intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, {{in the hope of}} destroying that object before it opened. It was only about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first body of Martians.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>learn</b> from Mrs. Coleridge, who {{has lately}} heard from C----, <b>that</b> Alston, <b>the</b> painter, has arrived in London. Coleridge speaks {{of him as}} a most {{interesting}} person. He has brought with him a few pictures from his own pencil, among others, a Cupid and Psyche, which, in C.'s opinion, has not, for colouring, been surpassed since Titian. C. is about to deliver a Course of Lectures upon Poetry, at some Institution in the city. He is well, and <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'Friend' has been a good deal inquired after lately. For ourselves, we never hear from him.|$|R
6000|$|He comes {{even now}} [...] From sacrilege. <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that,</b> since <b>the</b> fight, [...] In marching here by Potsdam yesterday, [...] Sans-Souci Palace drew his curious feet, [...] Where even great Frederick's tomb was bared to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Disdain {{had been}} {{chartered}} by Mr. Ranson. He had found Captain Flagg without anything to do, {{a party that}} was to have gone out for a week's cruise having disappointed him at the last moment. It had not taken long to get the yacht in trim for the trip, and in the mean time the lawyer had hunted up Mr. Henshaw and related the particulars of the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the time}} I thought {{we must have}} failed in our purpose, but I was mistaken. Though we had lost one boat {{and some of our}} men, many of them being captured, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Albemarle had sunk in fifteen minutes after the {{explosion}} of the torpedo, only her shield and smoke-stack being left out of the water to mark the spot where a mighty iron-clad had succumbed to a few pounds of well-applied gunpowder!" ...|$|E
6000|$|And years afterward, in China, I had {{the grief}} of {{learning}} that the device we employed to navigate the rapids of the Des Moines--the one-two-one-two, head-boat-tail-boat proposition--was not originated by us. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese river-boatmen had {{for thousands of years}} used a similar device to negotiate [...] "bad water." [...] It is a good stunt all right, even if we don't get the credit. It answers Dr. Jordan's test of truth: [...] "Will it work? Will you trust your life to it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I nursed {{you when}} you were so ill, Macumazahn," [...] she began, [...] "but now <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> for <b>the</b> milk with which I fed you, you would force me to drink bitter water that will poison me." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the mean}} time the belligerent {{feelings}} of the inhabitants were encouraged, by learning how the rumor of their being cannonaded had been received in the General Congress, and by assurances from all parts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cause of Boston would be made the common cause of America. [...] "It is surprising," [...] writes General Gage, [...] "that {{so many of the}} other provinces interest themselves so much in this. They have some warm friends in New York, and <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people of Charleston, South Carolina, are as mad as they are here." [...] [Footnote: Gage to Dartmouth, Sept. 20.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Prisintly, <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that,</b> acrost <b>the</b> river, {{about nine}} miles away, was a town just dhrippin' wid dahs, an' bohs an' arrows, an' dacoits, an' elephints, an' jingles. [...] "Good!" [...] sez I; [...] "this office will now close!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{had nothing}} to do but to bow and retire, but if {{possible}} I will send a message to your admiral that you are here. At present, however, that is out of the question; for while I was waiting in the anteroom <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blockading fleet has sailed away, and that there is no news whatever as to the direction which it has taken. It is very unfortunate, but you may be assured that, as soon as it returns, I will somehow or other communicate with the admiral.” ...|$|E
60|$|Observing {{that the}} streets of the {{industrial}} centres were everywhere filled with idle men, I gathered that they were unemployed: and when <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> moving picture houses were full to the doors every day and that the concert halls, beer gardens, grand opera, and religious concerts were crowded to suffocation, I inferred that the country was suffering from an unparalleled depression. This diagnosis turned out to be absolutely correct. It has been freely estimated that at the time I refer to almost two million men were out of work.|$|E
60|$|On the {{way from}} the {{junction}} to Grand Gulf, where the road comes into the one from Vicksburg to the same place six or seven miles out, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last of the enemy had retreated past that place on their way to Vicksburg. I left Logan to make the proper disposition of his troops for the night, while I rode into the town with an escort of about twenty cavalry. Admiral Porter had already arrived with his fleet. The enemy had abandoned his heavy guns and evacuated the place.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a question how the icreasing of the excise tax in the Czech Republic in the year 2010 influenced the state budget. Using the estimations {{with the help of}} regression analysis <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demand for diesel in the Czech Republic is unit elastic. But due to the increase of the excise tax was percentually higher than the percentual decrease of the refueled litres of diesel, the state budget incomes were higher due to this taxation {{than it would have been}} when the taxes were set in the preceeding rate. With the help of analysis <b>I</b> also <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cross elasticity regarding the price of diesel inneighbouring countries has the value of 0, 79 and the intensity elasticity of transportation is 1, 07. In the last chapter the thesis {{deals with a}}lternative situations that would upcome in case of not changing the excise tax rate of the last year in the Czech Republic or possibly Slovakia and their influence to tax incomes to the state budget in the first eight months of the year 2010...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{afterward}} <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shaft rests {{directly over}} the magnetic pole of Mars, but whether this adds {{in any way to}} its incalculable power of attraction I do not know. I am a fighting man, not a scientist.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{afterwards}} <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Boer ambulances removed twenty-seven {{of their}} wounded. The {{condition of the}} others was too serious to allow of their being moved, {{and in spite of}} every attention they all died while in our hands.|$|R
60|$|This was unexpected, but I {{preserved}} a non-committal attitude, {{knowing full}} well that our actions in themselves are neither mad nor sane. But I did not see what there was to be excited about. And Fyne was distinctly excited. I understood it better when <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> captain of the Ferndale wanted little Fyne {{to be one of the}} trustees. He was leaving everything to his wife. Naturally, a request which involved him into sanctioning in a way a proceeding which he had been sent by his wife to oppose, must have appeared sufficiently mad to Fyne.|$|E
6000|$|Before I {{had been}} out and about a week <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "fit" [...] theory had been {{discarded}} in favor of insanity. However, I made no change in my mode of life. I called, rode, and dined out as freely as ever. I had {{a passion for the}} society of my kind which I had never felt before; I hungered to be among the realities of life; {{and at the same time}} I felt vaguely unhappy when I had been separated too long from my ghostly companion. It would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods from the 15th of May up to today.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{knowing what}} to say I remarked that I had spent a most {{instructive}} evening in the museum, which seemed to make her angrier than ever. At any rate she whisked off without even saying [...] "good night" [...] and left me standing there. Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> A.-S.'s had calmly informed Lady Ragnall that she had stolen their property and demanded that [...] "as an act of justice" [...] she should make a will leaving everything she possessed to them, and meanwhile furnish them with an allowance of £4,000 a year. What I did not learn were the exact terms of her answer.|$|E
5000|$|... "This name is {{the title}} of a guano from McKean's Island, {{situated}} in the neighborhood of Baker and Jarvis Islands and occupied with a similar deposit. A sample representing the cargo of the White Swallow, imported by the general agents, Messrs. Williams and Haven, into this State, at the port of New London, gave me on analysis 23¼ percent of phosphoric acid, equivalent to 50 percent of bone-phosphate of lime, and I have not hesitated to recommend it to our farmers, especially, as <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price will be entirely reasonable, viz: $27.50 per ton, or in quantities over five tons $25 per ton." ...|$|R
5|$|I King Æthelstan, declare <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{public peace}} {{has not been}} kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid down at Grately, and my councillors say that I have suffered this too long.|$|R
50|$|George thanked Ron, quaffed down a good pint {{and then}} we all began to talk. Later <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> this was the Hell's Angel biker Chocolate George. <b>I</b> also <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> milk carton {{contained}} only half chocolate milk {{and the other half}} some unspecified hard stuff.|$|R
