5|$|Krypton {{is mixed}} with argon in energy {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output and raising the cost. Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill <b>incandescent</b> lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional <b>incandescent</b> lamps.|$|E
5|$|William Joseph Hammer {{started to}} collect <b>incandescent</b> light bulbs from 1879 {{while they were}} being {{developed}} in the Edison laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He was an associate of Thomas Edison and in his engineering career {{he was able to}} collect early filament electric light bulbs from Edison and others because of his association in the field. The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of <b>incandescent</b> electric light bulbs known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable {{resident}} of Low Fell was Sir Joseph Swan. Swan, most famous as {{the inventor of the}} <b>incandescent</b> lightbulb (though also instrumental in improvements to photographic film and rechargeable batteries), lived at Underhill, 99 Kells Lane in Low Fell between 1869 and 1883.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Robert Stevenson {{and built}} by James Smith of Inverness {{the light was}} first {{exhibited}} on 15 October 1833. The oil-burning light was converted to <b>incandescent</b> in 1906 and the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation on 23 October 1980, when the last keepers were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Due to its heat {{resistance}} and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium {{is a good}} scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and <b>incandescent</b> lamps. Hafnium is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because {{of its ability to}} shed electrons into air.|$|E
5|$|In 1774, Antoine Lavoisier {{used the}} {{reaction}} of water steam with metallic iron inside an <b>incandescent</b> iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the conservation of mass, which was instrumental in changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one.|$|E
5|$|Lamps in {{this case}} also show how some of these {{experimental}} bulbs progressed into vacuum tubes {{that were used in}} radios and TVs. Below are some of the <b>incandescent</b> electric lamps that were in this display case. These were numbered 530 to 871.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than <b>incandescent</b> lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). <b>Incandescent</b> and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Tungsten's many alloys have {{numerous}} applications, including <b>incandescent</b> {{light bulb}} filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in TIG welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also {{often used as}} industrial catalysts.|$|E
5|$|Bubble lights, {{a type of}} <b>incandescent</b> novelty light, {{were invented}} by Carl Otis in 1935, who then sold the patents to the NOMA (National Outfit Manufacturer's Association) Electric Corporation. NOMA {{launched}} the novelty lights on the Christmas market in 1946 when war shortages ended. Bubble lights became hugely popular. Their main feature was a sealed glass tube with a colored bubbling liquid inside.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 4 further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the <b>incandescent</b> electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case No. 1 and Case No. 3. These lamps showed a time period of from 1893 to 1903 and included special regulating lamps, styles for advertising signs, and novelty lamps like those made for Christmas trees.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. After {{only a few}} years, osmium {{was replaced by the}} more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of <b>incandescent</b> lamps.|$|E
5|$|In 1916 mines {{were laid}} in the {{vicinity}} of the rock by the German submarines SM U-71 and SM U-78. In July 1940 during World War II a stick of bombs was dropped by a passing German plane. The explosion cracked two lantern panes and shattered one of the <b>incandescent</b> mantles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Incandescent</b> {{lights are}} filled with argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers.|$|E
5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the <b>incandescent</b> pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption {{are very similar}} to that of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons Ride uses new {{technology}} that cuts down on its energy consumption. According to Universal Studios, the ride is able to save over 55,000 watts on average and 662,000 watt-hours per day. The ride includes over 2,500 LEDs, the largest number in theme park history, which allows the ride {{to cut down on}} lighting energy by almost one quarter when compared to <b>incandescent</b> lighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} {{contained a}} ban on using federal funds to enforce the phase-out of <b>incandescent</b> light bulbs that had been mandated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, but requires recipients of more than $1 million in Department of Energy grants {{to comply with the}} energy efficiency standards.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the New York area, Washington founded a company producing kerosene gas mantles. At this time, they lived in New Brighton on Staten Island, but his company, George Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby Jersey City. This business was abandoned with the maturation of <b>incandescent</b> light bulb technology. Washington also had a camera company for a time. By {{the time of the}} 1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child of two of the servants.|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in <b>incandescent,</b> fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical <b>incandescent</b> light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E
5|$|Europa Lighthouse {{was inaugurated}} on 1 August 1841 {{in a brief}} {{ceremony}} witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the amount of light emitted was increased. A three <b>incandescent</b> mantle burner was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was fully automated in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three <b>incandescent</b> mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{hardware}} and software behind the fountain's operation were replaced. At the time there were plans to replace LED lighting with <b>incandescent</b> bulbs {{on each of the}} non-video display surfaces and to replace the video surface LEDs. Plensa, who maintained control of the video faces for {{the first two years of}} the fountain's operation, understands that future generations may wish to update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward. In 2014, an additional 1000 faces were anticipated for 2016.|$|E
5|$|The ball's {{design has}} been updated {{over the years}} to reflect {{improvements}} in lighting technology; the original design was made from wood and iron and lit with 100 <b>incandescent</b> light bulbs, while its current incarnation, designed by Harlem-based architectural lighting firm Focus Lighting, features a computerized LED lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangle-shaped crystal panels. Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop the building year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 is on display at Times Square's visitor center.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{eruption}} {{was observed}} on the 25-26 November by the HMS Conway captained by Basil Hall, and involved {{the eruption of}} <b>incandescent</b> material. According to reports it lasted intermittently for the whole morning that day. A volcanic explosivity index of 2 has been estimated. These volcanic activities were at first assumed to {{have occurred in the}} local Andes mountains, but a geological expedition by Giacomo Bove in 1882 found no evidence of a volcano there; the field itself was accidentally discovered by geologists of SERNAGEOMIN in 1978.|$|E
5|$|This {{case had}} a lamp and socket used by Hammer {{for the first}} {{electric}} sign ever made. It lit up the name EDISON letter by letter in sequence when a set of switches were turned on by hand – {{one at a time}} in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at the Crystal Palace in London. The lamp bulbs in this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the <b>incandescent</b> electric lamps that were in this case.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of <b>incandescent</b> lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor <b>incandescent</b> lighting citywide {{in the form of an}} electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of <b>incandescent</b> street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had <b>incandescent</b> light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet <b>incandescent</b> illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of <b>incandescent</b> filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light <b>incandescent</b> bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 <b>incandescent</b> lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{town centre}} {{and its environs}} contain many {{examples}} of Regency, Victorian and Edwardian villas and hotels. Many of the houses were built during the Industrial Revolution, and Malvern's boom years as a spa town, by wealthy families from the nearby Birmingham area. Following {{the collapse of the}} spa industry, many of the hotels and villas became schools, and some have since been further converted to apartments, while some of the smaller hotels are now retirement homes. The Imperial Hotel in red brick with stone dressings, which later became a school, {{is one of the largest}} buildings in Malvern. It was built in 1860 by the architect E. W. Elmslie who also designed the Great Malvern railway station, and the Council House on the plot where Dr. Gully's original house stood. The Grove in Avenue Road in 1867, originally to be his private residence in 1927 became part of the Lawnside School for girls, and in 1860 Whitbourne Hall, a Grade II* listed building, in Herefordshire. The Imperial was the first hotel to be lit by <b>incandescent</b> gas. It was equipped with all types of baths and brine was brought specially by rail from Droitwich.|$|E
