500|$|The video {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "psychedelic" [...] and as an anthem to Marijuana, rather than one about drunkenness. Brad Wete for Entertainment Weekly explained that Mars was [...] "ready to drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol" [...] and tipped [...] "find out what concoction Mars and Marley are whipping up" [...] by watching the clip. Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time". He furthered that Damian, [...] "might as well be in McDonald's commercials. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> song is supposed to make you THINK about stuff [...] but mostly it makes me try to find someone to blame for this".|$|E
500|$|... "Pathetic" [...] {{is a tale}} of [...] "abject self-pity in {{the face}} of {{collapsed}} relationship." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. The song's themes include maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is growing up." [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was named after an insult bandied around at Big Fish during recording. It was written about DeLonge's experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated. [...] "Waggy" [...] was a word Hoppus created while belching, prompting him to name the song with it. [...] "Untitled" [...] is inspired by the emerging ska punk scene, and [...] "Emo" [...] by its namesake, which is partly a tribute to DeLonge's favorite band, Jimmy Eat World.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the less}} {{favorable}} contemporary critiques, a Melody Maker reviewer dismissed the album as [...] "Not typical Byrds music, which is rather a pity." [...] Writing in Crawdaddy! {{just before he}} withdrew from city life and temporarily retired from music journalism, Paul Williams lamented: [...] "I'm beginning to think I'll have to make this jailbreak unaided … The Byrds have gone country and Big Pink is out, and it's beautiful stuff, man, beautiful … But country is just more relaxation, wonderful stifling inertia … and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> isn't the summer to look to be rescued by music." [...] Robert Shelton of The New York Times similarly commented that [...] "The latest Byrds album adheres {{to most of the}} 'rules of the game' about country sound, and yet, sad to say, to this old fan of the Byrds, the album is a distinguished bore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll go down, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> Phibbs. <b>This</b> may be my {{last day}} on earth, and I'll spend an hour with my flowers before I bid them good-bye forever." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't s'pose you 'spected {{to get him}} yourself," [...] said Uncle Jaw, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> by <b>this</b> time you've {{pretty much}} gin up trying, hain't ye? But Susan does, I'm pretty sure." ...|$|R
500|$|Greatest Hits {{opens with}} [...] "Carousel", {{which was the}} very first song Hoppus and DeLonge wrote {{together}} upon their meeting in August 1992. It {{has been described by}} journalist Joe Shooman as [...] "a satisfyingly fast-assed punk song in the vein of NOFX with some very adept dynamic breakdowns." [...] The band's first promotional single, [...] "M+M's", follows, which is based around power chords and Hoppus' lead vocal of a vacation elsewhere. [...] "Dammit", which was the band's first major-label single and also their first radio hit, is themed around maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is growing up." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. It reached number 11 on Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1998, and received heavy radio airplay. [...] "Josie" [...] is about [...] "being stoked on a girl." [...] It contains references to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers ("My girlfriend likes UL and DHC"), two groups the band toured with in the mid-1990s.|$|E
2500|$|On the album’s evolution, Rygg commented, [...] "I {{was pretty}} set on keeping it more bare this time. When we did Blood Inside, we'd been holding {{back with all}} that minimal stuff for so long — the soundtracks (Lyckantropen Themes and Svidd neger), the Silence EPs and all that. So Blood Inside was an {{outburst}} of sorts. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> record is a withdrawal again, so that's an inherent dynamic...flux and reflux." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sherlock {{recorded}} {{an album}} between July 11–15, 1994. He played, produced, and mixed everything himself. A person under the pseudonym [...] "Unblack Mark" [...] handled {{the studio and}} recording techniques. As a graphic artist himself, Sherlock created the album's packaging and cover picture. Sherlock marked himself under the pseudonym [...] "Anonymous" [...] in the album's booklet since neither he nor the record company were supposed to reveal his identity. The album was named Hellig Usvart, which is Norwegian for [...] "holy unblack". Sherlock {{said in an interview}} about the name: [...] "I read on the back of an early Dark Throne album, 'Dark Throne play Unholy Black Metal'. Horde was always going to be lyrically the opposite of this, hence: 'Holy Unblack Metal'. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is how the 'unblack' name or title came about. The music sounded like BM, but because of the lyrics and the spirit behind it, it is not BM." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> not, <b>this</b> time," [...] {{the little}} man returned, after a moment's reflection. [...] "Know {{anything}} of a family named Claxon, down the road, here, a piece?" [...] He twisted {{his head in the}} direction he meant.|$|R
50|$|I don’t {{remember}} much about making this first record, {{too long ago}} maybe. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> remember <b>this</b> Mexican dive bar we’d go to after sessions with GW (Gregg Williams) who was engineering the record. We’d drink tequila and play pool and watch Blazers games. Drew took the cover shot down at the coast at some junk shop off the highway. An Indian and a zebra. That says it all.|$|R
5000|$|... "Undertow" [...] (While {{the band}} decided {{to pass up}} adding this song to their [...] "A Hangover You Don't Deserve" [...] album, it was {{featured}} on the Summerland soundtrack. Reddick says, [...] "I don't {{have a copy of}} that Summerland soundtrack, but <b>I</b> am <b>guessing</b> <b>this</b> is one of the strongest tracks on it.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talk about Greenland's icy mountains, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is bad enough!" [...] cried Chet, as {{he slapped}} {{his hands to}} keep them warm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's that blamed officer? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is his job," [...] said one; but the worthy {{mentioned}} drew {{further back}} {{from the edge of}} the group.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure!" [...] he said. [...] "The {{charge for}} packing is pretty steep; {{but when you}} mean to beat the export-prohibition-- Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> fixes it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you. When {{you find}} how dreadfully it hurts you'll bear the traps in mind forever afterward. People don't {{remember}} dreams unless the dreams are unusually horrible. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you'll remember <b>this</b> one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep it up--put it on! Don't {{get up in}} a hurry. I don't {{need you}} to canvass, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you enjoy <b>this</b> 'bout as well." [...] He ended with a sly wink and cough.|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{hesitate}} on that ground, since we're two men short," [...] Scott answered, smiling. [...] "Well, {{suppose we}} {{wait until we}} have talked to him. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you know <b>this</b> silver-lode is getting hold of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on, Em!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Quit {{the eagle}} eye conquest an' take courage. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> {{is the same}} Cowardly Lion Dorothy has told us about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough is plenty," [...] said he, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> {{will do for}} to-day. We want {{to leave}} some for the boys next summer. We'll take the lines up after dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it," [...] she explained. [...] "I don't {{know whether}} you've had any talk with Mr. Quest, but we've been through some queer times lately. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> death {{business}} is getting on my nerves." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chicago Sun Times critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 1½ stars, disputing the characters' {{longevity}} and comparing the series to the Detroit car manufacturing industry. [...] "Why do they persist in making these retreads? Because 'RoboCop' is a brand name, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> and <b>this</b> is this year's new model. It's an old tradition in Detroit {{to take an}} old design and slap on some fresh chrome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, he isn't!" [...] {{the young}} man {{retorted}} pleasantly. [...] "Or, as I should say in the vernacular of <b>this</b> amazing country, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> not! <b>This</b> gentleman gives a very creditable rendering of the part, but he is no more Doctor Bardolf than the Johnny upstairs is Mr. Samuel Pratt. The fact is, Jacob, {{the whole thing is}} a layout, and you've been very nearly pinched." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jake judiciously disregarded this suggestion. [...] "There's one trick most dogs learn quite easy. It's to guard. You {{put down}} some of your clothes, for instance, and make him see that nobody's to touch them until you come back. Then he'll sit tight until you do, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> in <b>this</b> fellow's case there'd be mighty little wrong with the nerves of the man who'd {{put a hand on}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wall, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is Eden," [...] cried Big Waller, gazing {{around him}} with unfeigned delight. [...] "Leastwise, if it ain't, {{it must be}} the very nixt {{location}} to them there diggins of old Father Adam. Ain't it splendiferous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't waste time," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "We can talk just as {{straight}} in the dark, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> meeting will finish up outside on the prairie. You've given me {{a good deal of}} trouble to trail you, Mr. Guyler." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> will do," [...] {{he said at}} last, {{and cracked}} the baked mud from the grouse. With the mud came the {{feathers}} of the bird, leaving the meat clean. The grouse was tender and juicy and done to a turn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to be troublesome, please the court," [...] {{returned}} the witness, with admirable self-possession; [...] "but law is law, all over the world, and <b>I</b> rather <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> question is ag'in it. In the Granite State, it is always held, when a thing can be proved by the person who said any particular words, that the question must be put to him, and not to a bystander." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Self-discovery {{is such an}} {{important}} thing," [...] lead vocalist and bassist Tyson Ritter explained, [...] "I feel like in music you're a virtual Magellan as you discover new, vast territories, sonically and lyrically. If you're not discovering something new, you're not doing it right. I knew we needed to find a different place, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> in <b>this</b> accidental sort of...I don't know man, in the journey I found a different way and a new voice for our music and even a new voice for me to sing with." ...|$|R
6000|$|The firm owes Mrs. Clemens and me--I do {{not know}} quite how much, but it is about $170,000 or $175,000, I suppose (<b>I</b> make <b>this</b> <b>guess</b> from the {{documents}} here, whose technicalities confuse me horribly.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean Cynthy? Well! I {{guess when}} Cynthy can't {{get along with}} the sight of Jeff Durgin, she'll be a {{different}} girl from what she's ever been before. If she's got to see that skunk ag'in, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is about {{the best time to}} do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{replied the}} captain meditatively, [...] "you mayn't {{just see the}} way that I view it in, but I'd 'most rather stay here upon this island. I found peace here, peace in believing. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> island is about good enough for John Davis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Self-protection is no murder, anyhow," [...] said McMurdo, smiling grimly. [...] "It's him or us. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> {{man would}} destroy us all if we left him {{long in the}} valley. Why, Brother Morris, we'll have to elect you Bodymaster yet; for you've surely saved the lodge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our courier {{says they}} take you {{right up to the}} castle," [...] the young girl continued. [...] "We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn't go. Randolph wouldn't go either; he says he doesn't think much of old castles. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we'll go <b>this</b> week, if we can get Randolph." ...|$|R
60|$|Probably I {{could not}} run a boat right with {{perfectly}} fresh and well hands, {{and with my}} lacerated and stinging ones I surely made a mess of it. This brought language from my boatman--well, to say the least, quite disrespectable. Fortunately, however, I got the boat around and we ran down on the fish. Dan, working with long, powerful sweeps of the rod, got the line back and the fish close. The game began to look great to me. All along <b>I</b> had <b>guessed</b> <b>this</b> fish to be a wonder; and now I knew it.|$|R
5000|$|... "Love the Fall" [...] became Paynter's first top 20 {{single to}} make it into the ARIA Singles Chart. Speaking of the single's success, Paynter said [...] "I didn't expect this reaction. I thought I had a great chance and a good song but <b>I</b> couldn't have <b>guessed</b> <b>this.</b> It makes every bit of {{brokenness}} and frustration and lonely travel worthwhile." ...|$|R
