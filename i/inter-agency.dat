25|$|The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) {{coordinates}} <b>inter-agency</b> {{information about}} the CRA. Information about the CRA ratings of individual banking institutions from the three responsible agencies (Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC), is publicly available from the website of the FFIEC. These ratings were first made available by the Clinton administration to enable public participation and public comment on CRA performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{reorganisation}} {{also saw}} an adjustment in how investigations works, moving geographically-based investigation teams into newly created Police Investigation Centres (PICs), combining CID and other investigative teams, alongside {{the newly created}} Resolution Centre to resolve a greater volume of crime. Finally, the former Safer Neighbourhood Teams were adjusted, becoming Neighbourhood Police Teams aligned with local authority wards, easing the administrative strain of <b>inter-agency</b> collaboration.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the ongoing}} {{renewals}} {{are part of}} a wider urban revitalisation project of the larger Circular Quay area, involving a range of developments from the CBD and South East Light Rail project to new walkways and public domains along Sydney's various waterfronts.

25|$|The National Security Bureau of the ROC National Security Council was {{established}} {{at the suggestion of}} Chiang Ching-kuo in 1956. This bureau served as the primary intelligence unit in Taiwan and headed by Cheng Jie-Min (鄭介民), a heavy-weight three-star army general from Military-Statistics. The purpose of creating such a new intelligence agency was to settle the <b>inter-agency</b> rivalry among the intelligence community in Taiwan and allow more direct access for Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{became interested}} in the potential of the helicopter during the 1930s. In 1938, the government allocated two million dollars toward development of the machine, and an <b>inter-agency</b> board—which included a representative from the U.S. Coast Guard, Commander William J. Kossler—was established to oversee the program. Kossler had difficulty persuading the U.S. Navy of the utility of the helicopter and eventually enlisted the aid of Executive Officer Lieutenant Commander Frank Erickson of Coast Guard Air Station Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Inter-Agency</b> Archaeological Salvage Program was {{organized}} by the National Park Service in 1946 {{at the request of}} the Committee for Recovery of Archaeological Remains to coordinate the salvage of irreplaceable pre-historic and historic Indian artifacts from projected reservoir sites in river valleys throughout the United States, before flooding. This program, which has been conducted for a quarter of a century in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and universities, museums, and research institutions throughout the country, has enormously deepened knowledge of American prehistory.|$|E
25|$|Various {{parties are}} {{responsible}} for the commercial venues, site management and day-to-day operations of the cruise terminal. Among them are a mix of private firms as well as government departments and quasi-autonomous government entities which permeates through local, state and federal levels of governance in Australia. With these many affiliations, interests and governance and management authorities affecting the OPT and its surrounding public space, an <b>Inter-agency</b> Project Control (IPC) Group for Circular Quay has been established by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority to oversee and manage the operations and upgrade works.|$|E
25|$|Within {{hours of}} the accident, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began daily {{sampling}} of the environment at the three stations closest to the plant. Continuous monitoring at 11stations was not established until April 1, and was expanded to 31 stations on April 3. An <b>inter-agency</b> analysis concluded that the accident did not raise radioactivity far enough above background levels to cause even one additional cancer death among {{the people in the}} area, but measures of beta radiation were not included. The EPA found no contamination in water, soil, sediment or plant samples.|$|E
25|$|Differences and {{divisions}} might emerge {{within the}} ranks of analysts, across the spectrum of the USG Intelligence Community. Helms as DCI had a statutory mandate giving him responsibility for reconciling the discrepancies in information, or the conflicting views, promoted by the various American intelligence services, e.g., by the large Defense Intelligence Agency or by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at State. While the CIA might agree on its own Estimates, other department reports might disagree, causing difficulties, and making <b>inter-agency</b> concord problematic. The process of reaching the final consensus could become a contentious negotiation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of U.S. combat {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, there was considerable argument about progress among the Department of Defense under Robert McNamara, the CIA, and, to some extent, the intelligence staff of Military Assistance Command Vietnam. In general, the military was consistently more optimistic than the CIA. Sam Adams, a junior CIA analyst with responsibilities for estimating the actual damage to the enemy, eventually resigned from the CIA, after expressing concern to Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms with estimates that were changed for <b>inter-agency</b> and White House political reasons. Adams afterward wrote the book War of Numbers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} armed camps in Los Angeles's Koreatown was at the California Market. On the first night after the {{verdicts}} were returned {{in the trial of}} the four officers charged in the beating of Rodney King, Richard Rhee, the market owner, posted himself in the parking lot with about 20 armed employees. One year after the riots, fewer than one in four damaged or destroyed businesses reopened, according to the survey conducted by the Korean-American <b>Inter-Agency</b> Council. According to a Los Angeles Times survey conducted eleven months after the riots, almost 40% of Korean-Americans said they were thinking of leaving Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|The Military Academy of the Puerto Rico National Guard was {{established}} on June 1, 1963, at Camp Tortuguero on an initiative of César Cordero. Its curriculum was equivalent to Fort Benning's and lasted {{for a year}} and 15 days, at which point graduates received their certification. The institution was subsequently translated to the Henry Barracks in Cayey and from there to Campamento Santiago. On May 1, 1964, the PRNG underwent another reorganization, the second under Gen. Cordero. On March 20, 1966, Salvador Roig was placed in charge of the PRNG by Roberto Sánchez Vilella. The PRNG also engaged in other civil activities, such as cooperativism (several becoming involved with Cooperativa El Sentinela) and <b>inter-agency</b> softball tournaments.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Blackstone sold Strategic Hotels & Resorts to Anbang Insurance Group, a Beijing-based Chinese {{insurance}} company, in a $6.5 {{billion deal}} involving multiple resorts. Anbang thus bought 16 luxury American hotel properties including the Hotel del Coronado. Fifteen of the 16 were immediately transferred to Anbang. However, {{the sale of}} the Hotel Del Coronado was held up because of concerns expressed by the federal <b>inter-agency</b> Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign investors for possible national security risks. The agency was concerned about the hotel's proximity to major Navy bases. In October 2016 it was reported that he deal had fallen through and the hotel would remain in Blackstone's ownership.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, FAO {{launched}} its Initiative on Soaring Food Prices to help small producers raise their output and earn more. Under the initiative, FAO {{contributed to the}} work of the UN High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis, which produced the Comprehensive Framework for Action. FAO has carried out projects in over 25 countries and <b>inter-agency</b> missions in nearly 60, scaled up its monitoring through the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, provided policy advice to governments while supporting their efforts to increase food production, and advocated for more investment in agriculture. It has also worked hand-in-hand with the European Union. One example of its work is a US$10.2 million, €7.5 billion scheme to distribute and multiply quality seeds in Haiti, which has significantly increased food production, thereby providing cheaper food and boosting farmers' incomes.|$|E
25|$|DSPD often {{coordinates}} and collaborates {{with other}} state agencies {{to provide care}} for recipients of ID/RC HCBS waiver serves. Perhaps the strongest <b>inter-agency</b> partnership exists between the Division and the Division of Child and Family Services. These two state agencies often work together on crossover issues regarding their two respective populations. The most common crossover issue involves children who have experienced traumatic abuse or neglect and demonstrate extreme behavioral issues. Unfortunately, victims of acute abuse and neglect also experience significant developmental delays and thus qualify for services. In cases where these children have no other family or guardians, DSPD steps in to provide long-term care. Often, the child remains in the custody and guardianship of Child and Family Services. Division and Child and Family Services staff work closely together in these cases to ensure that services are administered appropriately and {{that the child is}} safe and healthy.|$|E
25|$|Members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee {{traveled}} to Ukraine and Poland in 2016 and learned about Russian operations to influence their elections. Senator Angus King said the problem frustrated both political parties. On November 30, 2016, seven {{members of the}} committee asked President Obama to declassify and publicize more information on Russia's role in the U.S. election. Representatives in the U.S. Congress took action to monitor the national security of the United States by advancing legislation to monitor propaganda. On November 30, 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department to act against propaganda with an <b>inter-agency</b> panel. The initiative was developed through a bipartisan bill, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, written by U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy. Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden said frustration over covert Russian propaganda was bipartisan.|$|E
25|$|Vernon Hunter, a 68-year-old Revenue Officer Group Manager for the IRS, {{was killed}} in the {{incident}} along with Joseph Stack. Thirteen people were reported as injured, two of them critically. Debris from the crash reportedly struck a car being driven on the southbound access road of Route 183 in front of the building, shattering the windshield. Another driver on the southbound access road of Route 183 had his windows and sunroof shattered during the impact, and had debris fall inside his car, yet escaped uninjured. Robin DeHaven, a glass worker and former combat engineer for the United States Army, saw the collision while commuting to a customer's house for his job, and used the extension ladder on his truck to rescue six people from the 2nd floor of the building. By coincidence, the Travis County Hazardous Materials Team— an <b>inter-agency</b> group of firefighters from outside the City of Austin— had just assembled for training across the freeway from the targeted building, observed the low and fast flight of Stack's plane, and heard the blast impact. They immediately responded, attacking the fire and initiating search-and-rescue. Several City of Austin fire engines for the area of the Echelon building were already deployed at the fire at Stack's home {{at the time of the}} impact.|$|E
25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 <b>Inter-agency</b> Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} is the UK's [...] "quota refugee" [...] resettlement scheme. Refugees {{designated as}} particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are {{assessed by the}} Home Office for eligibility under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. If they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted indefinite leave to remain. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) helps facilitate pre-departure medical screening, counselling, dossier preparation, transport and immediate arrival assistance. Once in the UK, refugees are entered into a 12-month support programme intended to aid their integration. The programme has involved local authorities and NGOs including the British Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee, Migrant Helpline, Refugee Action, the Refugee Arrivals Project, the Refugee Council, Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Support. These organisations formed the Resettlement <b>Inter-Agency</b> Partnership {{at the planning stage}} of the programme, in order to pool their resources and form a partnership for the delivery of services to the resettled refugees.|$|E
