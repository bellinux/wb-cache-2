5|$|The volcano {{is formed}} by {{andesite}} and dacite rocks, with fragmentary rocks prevailing over lava flows. The rocks have typical arc-volcano chemistry and composition, with a progression from andesite to dacite in the eruption products with younger age. Potassium-argon dating has <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> age range from 5,900,000 to 90,000 years. Subsequent erosion has generated a large debris apron {{around the base}} of the volcano and carved rock formations which impressed early explorers; one well-known rock formation is Neza e Sultan.|$|E
5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} typhoon status, Paka strengthened fairly quickly, and by December 12 {{it reached}} sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) for a ten-minute (10 min) duration, or 215km/h (135mph) over a one-minute (1 min) duration. Subsequently, it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased. However, Paka again re-intensified, and at 1200UTC on December 14 it attained the unofficial ranking of super typhoon status while over the open Pacific Ocean. At the same time, the JMA classified it with 10 min sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph). After reaching its initial peak intensity, Typhoon Paka began to weaken as it approached the southern Mariana Islands; the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar from Guam revealed {{the presence of}} a primary eyewall of 74km (46mi) in diameter, with a fragmented inner wall cloud of 19km (11mi) in diameter. Additionally, satellite imagery <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> eyewall mesovortex within the eye of the typhoon. It slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward, and at 0530UTC on December 16 the northern portion of the outer eyewall of Paka passed over the island of Rota; 20minutes later, the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern Guam. As it tracked through the Rota Channel, the center of Paka passed about 8km (5mi) north of the northern tip of Guam, its closest approach to the island.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal {{has little to do with}} any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know much about him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E
5|$|Midday on July20 Koni {{began to}} develop a partial eye. This <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in intensity, and as such Koni reached a peak in strength at 1800UTC that day with maximum sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg). This intensity was maintained for roughly six hours, during which time Koni began to curve westward. However, moderate wind shear conditions returned the following day, weakening the tropical cyclone. At around 1200UTC on July21, Koni made landfall on the southeastern coast of Hainan with winds of 95km/h (60mph). Land interaction further weakened Koni, and the restrengthening of the subtropical ridge to the cyclone's north resulted in a more westerly path. After a brief reemergence into the Gulf of Tonkin, the system made another landfall, this time south of Hanoi, Vietnam at 0800UTC on July22. At this landfall Koni was only estimated to have winds of 85km/h (50mph). Upon tracking inland, the storm began to quickly weaken, and was downgraded to tropical depression intensity at 1800UTC that day over northern Laos. Six hours later, the JMA declared Koni to have dissipated over the same general region.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.|$|E

5|$|Palynology (the {{study of}} pollen), {{as well as}} studies of fossil megaflora and invertebrates, had {{initially}} suggested that the uppermost Cedar Mountain Formation – including the Mussentuchit – dated to the Albian stage. A 1997 argon-argon dating of sanidine crystals recovered from a volcanic ash layer in the upper Cedar Mountain Formation by Cifelli and colleagues <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> age of 97 ± 0.1 million years, which was then considered to be just after {{the boundary between the}} Albian and Cenomanian stages. This is similar to the early Cenomanian age reported for the overlying Dakota Formation. Subsequently, in 2007, James Garrison and colleagues dated the volcanic ash layer passing through the Cifelli #2 Quarry – which is likely the same layer dated previously by Cifelli and colleagues – to 96.7 ± 0.5 million years ago. At an approximate level, the Cifelli and Garrison estimates agree with each other, thus indicating a Cenomanian age for Eolambia. Garrison and colleagues also re-analyzed the pollen assemblage from localities throughout the Mussentuchit, concluding that the assemblage spans the Albian-Cenomanian boundary.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after it}} was named, Dujuan quickly {{intensified}} after an upper level low to the northwest improved outflow to the north. On August30, the ridge to the north built eastward, causing the storm to slow and turn more to the northwest. That day, an eye developed in center, and the JMA upgraded Dujuan to typhoon status. Subsequently, the typhoon accelerated to the west-northwest and later to the west. On September1, the JMA estimated Dujuan attained peak 10minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Around the same time, the JTWC assessed peak 1minute winds of 230km/h (145mph), making it {{the equivalent of a}} Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. While near peak intensity, the center of Dujuan passed about 45km (30mi) south of the southern tip of Taiwan. While moving westward through the South China Sea, the typhoon weakened slightly after its peak intensity due to an eyewall replacement cycle. Radar from the Hong Kong Observatory <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> inner eye about 20km (12mi) in diameter, and an outer eye about 100km (60mi) in diameter. At around 1200UTC on September2, Dujuan made landfall just east of Hong Kong, near Shenzhen. The JMA estimated the typhoon had weakened into a severe tropical storm by the time of landfall, while the JTWC estimated winds of 185km/h (115mph). It was considered the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979. Dujuan rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China, dissipating on September3 over Guangxi.|$|E
5|$|The United States Coast Guard first {{performed}} an aerial {{assessment of damage}} on Wake Island on September 2, {{three days after the}} typhoon struck.

5|$|US8 {{was created}} with the {{beginnings}} of the United States Numbered Highway System on November 26, 1926. The highway was originally shown on maps running between Forest Lake, Minnesota and Powers, Michigan. At the time, its planned routing was not previously designated as part of the State Trunkline Highway System in Michigan. The trunkline connection from Quinnesec south into Wisconsin was part of M-57, which met WIS57 at the state line. US8 ended at WIS57 in Pembine at the time, with no connection into Michigan shown on official maps. A map by the American Automobile Association does show the highway continuing east through Faithorn and Hermansville in Michigan to end at US2. The Wisconsin Highway Commission previously <b>indicated</b> <b>an</b> unnumbered state highway on their 1925 state map that connected Pembine with the Menominee River near Hermansville. A later extension in 1927 moved US8 to run along US141, which had replaced WIS57 and M-57, ending in Quinnesec at US2. By the next year, the highway was shifted to end in Norway, utilizing a separate crossing of the Menominee River to enter Michigan.|$|E
