40|$|Purpose. The task of {{automatic}} process {{control of the}} slime water thickening and flotation tailings clarification is the stabilization of thicken product density within the given range and keeping up the solids content in the overflow not above the permissible level with minimum use of the flocculants. In existing systems for automatic control the <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosing</b> is carried out according to the solids content in the device input (the principle of open-loop control). This leads to the excess consumption of the flocculants and increase the dispersion density of the overflow. To perform the synthesis of the optimal digital controller {{in order to minimize}} the deviations from the master control and ensure the specified quality of the transition process. Over controlling value should not exceed 5 %. To perform the system operation modeling {{in order to determine the}} quality of transient processes. Methodology. Synthesis of the optimal digital controller is based on the method of dynamic programming. Findings. A mathematical model of the object control is represented in the normal form of Cauchy and further in the form of differential equations. The optimum period of quantization as the function from specified error of control and the output coordinate change is calculated. The differential equation of Bellman is obtained and the condition for minimization of the quality functional. Bellman function is represented as a quadratic form from the variables of the system condition. In order to limit possible control, the weight coefficients of the functional are calculated based on maximum permitted values of the system condition variables and the control actions during the transient process.

Using the modeling of ACS of the <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosing</b> it was established that the over controlling amount is 3. 5 %, the transient process life 5. 6 sec, the transient process is aperiodical, non-static control, which meets the requirements imposed on the ACS...|$|E

The effect of flocculation operational conditions (the <b>flocculant</b> <b>dose</b> in the range from 16 to 240 mg/dm 3 and the process temperature of 8 – 30 °C) on the transport-separation properties of ultrafiltration membranes has been examined. To establish the effectiveness of the conducted processes, the contaminant retention coefficients, among others, were determined (based on the measurements of turbidity and UV 254 ultraviolet absorbance).

The research aimed to identify the optimal cationic flocculant and its application procedure which would enable a dosage that would be both economically and ecologically acceptable.

The configuration of the feed tank and the laser particle size measurement cell installed at the facility (280, 000 t/year of aggregates) allowed characterization of flocs with particle size between 4. 2 and 3473 μm under hydrodynamic conditions that were highly favorable for the examination of large and very fragile flocs. Two days of analysis of the floc formation process along the path followed by the slurry showed that flocculation was optimal during standard operation of the facility when the flow rate of waste fines and concentrations of solids were close to those used to calibrate the flocculant injection control system. Conversely, when the concentration of solids in the flocculator feed slurry dropped by 57. 3 %, the <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosing</b> fluctuated during stabilization of the mechanism, the kinetics of flocculation slowed, the mean size of flocs arriving at the settling tank dropped by 69 %, and the mode of smaller flocs shifted from 77. 8 to 10. 4 μm in relation to normal operation. On-site analyses confirmed that the measurements made with laser diffraction (using a methodology developed in the laboratory) allow determination of the effects of conditioning on the characteristics of flocs in terms of particle size, porosity, density, and volume fraction in the slurry. Evolution of these characteristics according to the local parameters of conditioning (mean detention time, mean slurry velocity, and mean velocity gradient) provides a significant part of basic information necessary to a diagnosis of the operation of an industrial circuit of flocculation. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 200...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was done into {{the recovery of}} invert sugar from sugar cane molasses. A pilot plant was designed and constructed to evaluate the clarification and separation of molasses to produce invert sugar syrup. The aim of the pilot plant was to prove the process and deliver data so as to facilitate the design and prove the financial viability of a commercial plant. The pilot plant had to process 300 kg/day of molasses. The clarification of molasses by centrifugal separation, a known desludging process, did not produce a product of acceptable quality {{which could be used}} in a chromatographic separator. The results were disappointing. The product obtained was also not suitable for dead end pressure filtration. The turbidity remaining after the centrifugal separation also did not respond to a second flocculation process. Conventional settling clarification was investigated. Seven factors that could influence the consolidation and settling of suspended solids in molasses were identified, namely: the age of the diluted molasses, the temperature of the flocculated mixture, the variations across various batches of flocculant, the effect of reaction time of the phosphoric acid, the optimum <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosing</b> concentration, the optimum concentration of the molasses solution and the effect of increasing the acid dosage. The optimum conditions to clarify molasses through settling were found to be: fresh molasses, at 28 Brix and 60 °C, allowing 10 min intervals between acidification with 3, 75 g (as 100 %) phosphoric acid/ kg dry material (assumed equal to Brix) and neutralisation with 5 g (as 100 %) caustic/kg dry material (assumed equal to Brix), flocculation with any batch of flocculant 6195, dosed as a 1000 ppm solution. Commercial equipment was evaluated. The pilot plant E-cat clarifier was operated at 300 l/h and a thick sludge formed. The overflow was clear and it could be filtered. The molasses obtained was suitable for chromatographic separation. The recovery of sugars from molasses sludge has economic merit. From the evaluation of centrifugal separation and gravity separation it is clear that gravity separation again is the best method. The sweet-water obtained is consistent within the clarity requirement of 10 NTU/Brix and can be used to dilute raw molasses in the upstream processing step. The clarification process that was developed is patented. [Bekker, Stolz et. al. (2001) ] A sugar recovery of 93. 9 mass % at a purity of 99. 7 mass % from molasses, was achieved using a simulated moving bed, ion exclusion, pilot plant. The operating conditions for this performance were: feed flow at 14 l/h and at a temperature above 60 °C; water flow at 63 l/h and at a temperature above 65 °C; extract flow at 21 l/h; raffinate flow at 56 l/h; loop flow at 78 l/h and step time at 1326 seconds. This relates to the following bed volumes of the various separation zones: Bed Volume Zone 1 = 0. 694; Bed Volume Zone 2 = 0. 591; Bed Volume Zone 3 = 0. 661; Bed Volume Zone 4 = 0. 383. There is a trade-off between purity and recovery and a reduction in water usage. A preliminary environmental impact assessment and conceptual mass balance were done. The proposed plant integrates well into the existing Komati Mill of TSB and does not pose any significant environmental threat. The plant requires certain services from the mill. The mass balance investigated the water and steam consumption of the plant. Process integration was done so as to obtain the optimum utility consumption. The utility consumption of the plant does not exceed the capacity available at the mill. A small boiler is however required to produce steam during the annual mill maintenance period. Various techniques were used in a cost estimation for the invert sugar plant. The internal rate of return (IRR) is 42 % for a fixed capital investment of R 94, 270, 000. 00.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of removing algae from {{water and wastewater}} by chemical flocculation techniques was investigated. Mixed cultures of algae were obtained from both continuous- and batch-fed laboratory reactors. Representative cationic, anionic, and nonionic synthetic organic polyelectrolytes were used as flocculants. Under the experimental conditions, chemically induced algal flocculation occurred {{with the addition of}} cationic polyelectrolyte, but not with anionic or nonionic polymers, although attachment of all polyelectrolyte species to the algal surface is shown. The mechanism of chemically induced algal flocculation is interpreted in terms of bridging phenomena between the discrete algal cells and the linearly extended polymer chains, forming a three-dimensional matrix that is capable of subsiding under quiescent conditions. The degree of flocculation is shown to be a direct function of the extent of polymer coverage of the active sites on the algal surface, although to induce flocculation by this method requires that the algal surface charge must concurrently be reduced to a level at which the extended polymers can bridge the minimal distance of separation imposed by electrostatic repulsion.

Cost-effective biomass harvesting and thickening pose a challenge for massive microalgae production for biofuels. In this study, coagulation-flocculation and sedimentation with natural flocculants (Ecotan and Tanfloc) was evaluated on microalgae grown in an experimental high rate algal pond treating urban wastewater. Jar tests showed how <b>flocculant</b> <b>doses</b> of 10 and 50 mg/L of Ecotan and Tanfloc enabled over 90 % biomass recovery. Furthermore, settling column tests showed that both flocculants increased microalgae settling velocity, performing fast and efficient biomass recovery (> 90 % recovery in 10 - 20 min). Thus, the use of either flocculant would enhance microalgal biomass reducing the HRT and settler volume. Finally, the potential toxicity of flocculants upon biomass production was assessed in biochemical methane potential tests. Results indicated that doses of 10 - 50 mg/L of Ecotan and Tanfloc did not affect anaerobic digestion, leading to the same methane yield (162 - 166 mL CH 4 /g VS) with the same methane content (70 %) as the control without flocculants.

This paper reports on {{one part of a}} process to pelletise mud and ash, aimed at making mud and ash more attractive to growers across entire mill districts. The full process is described in a separate paper. The part described in this paper involves re-constituting mud cake from the filter station at Tully Mill and processing it in a decanter centrifuge. The material produced by re-constituting and centrifuging is drier and made up of separate particles. The material needs to mix easily with boiler ash, and the mixture needs to be fed easily into a flue gas drier to be dried to low moisture. The results achieved with the particular characteristics of Tully Mill rotary vacuum filter cake are presented. It was found that an internal rotor with a 20 º beach was not adequate to process re-constituted rotary vacuum filter mud. A rotor with a 10 º beach worked much more successfully. A total of four tonnes of centrifuged mud with a moisture content ranging from 60 % to 65 % was produced. It was found that the torque, <b>flocculant</b> rate and <b>dose</b> rate had a statistically significant effect on the moisture content. Feed rate did not have a noticeable impact on the moisture content by itself but torque had a much larger impact on the moisture content at the low feed rate than at the high feed rate. These results indicated that the moisture content of the mud can most likely be reduced with low feed rate, low <b>flocculant</b> rate, high <b>dose</b> rate and high torque. One issue that is believed to affect the operation of a decanter centrifuge was the large quantity of long bagasse fibres in the rotary vacuum filter mud.

Polysaccharides derived from potato starch and chitosan have been modified with benzyl- {{and the first one}} with additionally cationic hydroxypropyl-trimethylammonium groups of different degrees of substitution (DS). The aim of this work was to characterize the solution properties of these novel amphiphilic polysaccharides concerning the impact of their DS on charge density, particle size, dynamic surface tension and viscosity behaviour. The work is further focused on investigations on flocculation properties of these amphiphilic polyelectrolytes in dispersions of kaolin and silica to identify the interplay between charge density and hydrophobicity. Flocculation efficiency has been evaluated via joint analysis of charge density measurements (using polyelectrolyte titration), turbidity and TOC measurements, as well as dynamic surface tension measurements applying the drop profile analysis. Particle sizes and particle size distributions have been determined by dynamic light scattering and laser diffraction methods. In addition, these amphiphilic starch derivatives have been used to remove substances which impact negatively the paper production process when using recycled paper, so called stickies. Model suspensions have been studied using a multitude of different measurement techniques with the aim to predict a “sticky potential” and to reduce containing dissolved and colloidal substances such as micro stickies. The surface activity and viscometric behaviour have been studied of solely cationic and moderately and highly substituted, amphiphilic polysaccharides in salt-free and 0. 05 M NaCl aqueous solution. For the first time dynamic surface tension measurement results have been correlated with particle sizes and apparent charge density. Rheological investigation of large concentration ranges (0. 01 – 20 g/L) was used to discuss Huggins plots and typical polyelectrolyte behaviour for all polysaccharide derivatives could be found. Overlap concentration and, in dilute aqueous solution, intrinsic viscosity could be determined. For polysaccharide solution in dilute regime semi-empirical equations of Rao and Wolf have been applied, making it possible to get insights to polyelectrolyte conformation in dependence on the DS of both substituents. It is shown that for intrinsic viscosity a change of the impact of both substituents takes place when having derivatives with enhanced hydrophobicity. Data evaluation via the ratio of both DS values had been successfully utilized and thus, the applied method has been identified as being a promising tool to compare a multitude of starch derivatives with substituents of different polarity in various degrees of substitution to get tendencies regarding overall hydrophobicity. Moderate hydrophobic substitution was found to lead to a decrease of the efficient <b>flocculant</b> <b>dose</b> and to an increase of the flocculation window width. Amphiphilic starch derivatives with high DS of hydrophobic moieties showing strong hydrophobic association are effective only at significantly higher doses, but in a broader concentration range compared to cationic starch of the same DS. Joint analysis of adsorption isotherms and flocculation test data has revealed, that the surface coverage required to induce phase separation ranges between 10 and 25 % and is minimal for amphiphilic starch derivatives. This gave the evidence of the complex mechanism of flocculation via combination of electrostatic “charge patch” interactions and bridging. Concerning sticky reduction experiments by systematically studying the interactions between the novel amphiphilic starch derivatives and the model suspension it turned out, that dynamic surface tension is a very suitable property to characterize the surface active compounds in the model suspension giving additional information about the sticky potential of waste water, e. g. white water, being a new and sensitive method to describe the parameter “hydrophobicity”. Moderate cationic and hydrophobic starch derivatives have been proved to be the most effective ones for sticky removal...|$|R

One year after the application, the macroinvertebrate numbers and taxa exceeded the pre-application situation and Gastropoda and Oligochaeta prospered. The effects one month after the treatment are most likely due to the combination of physical impacts of the use of bentonite and chemical impacts of the use of FeCl 3, while effects after one year are likely attributed to the shift in trophic state of the lake...|$|R
40|$|The pre-desilication step {{within the}} Bayer Process seeks to {{transform}} reactive silica in bauxite into desilication product (DSP) prior to digestion, thereby reducing post-digestion precipitation and scaling. The precipitated DSP is removed {{with the other}} residue phases in the primary settling stage. While the proportion of DSP within the residue can be significant, there are surprisingly few open-literature studies that consider the impact of DSP on residue flocculation and settling. Such studies typically involve bauxites of a fixed composition, which limits the scope to vary residue properties while investigating flocculation mechanisms. In this study, DSP has been formed from the reaction of standard kaolin in synthetic Bayer liquor {{in the presence of}} iron oxides. Variation of the reaction conditions (temperature, duration, kaolin to iron oxide ratio) has produced a range of synthetic residue slurries that have been characterised in terms of their physical and flocculation properties.

40|$|Abstract Eutrophication of Lake De Kuil (The Netherlands, 6. 7  ha, {{maximum depth}} 9  m) has {{frequently}} caused cyanobacterial blooms resulting in swimming bans or {{the issue of}} water quality warnings during summer. The eutrophication was mainly driven by sediment phosphorus (P) -release. The external P-loading was {{in the range of}} the critical loading for phytoplankton blooms. Hence, the reduction of the internal P-loading provided a promising way to reduce cyanobacterial blooms. To mitigate the cyanobacterial blooms, the combination of a low <b>dose</b> <b>flocculant</b> (iron(III) chloride; Flock) and a solid phase phosphate fixative (lanthanum modified bentonite; Lock) was applied in May 2009. This combined approach both removed cyanobacterial biomass from the water column and also intercepted P released from the bottom sediments. Immediately after treatment, the Secchi depth increased from 1. 5  m up to 5  m. Sediment P-release decreased from 5. 2  mg P m− 2  d− 1 (2009) to 0. 4  mg P m− 2  d− 1 (2010) but increased in later years. Mean summer concentrations of total P decreased from 0. 05  mg L− 1 (1992 – 2008) to 0. 02  mg L− 1 (2009 – 2014) and chlorophyll-a from 16  μg L− 1 (1992 – 2008) to 6  μg L− 1 (2009 – 2014). Mean summer Secchi depth increased from 2. 31  m (1992 – 2008) to 3. 12  m (2009 – 2014). The coverage of macrophytes tripled from 2009 to 2011.

The eutrophication was mainly driven by sediment phosphorus (P) -release. The external P-loading was {{in the range of}} the critical loading for phytoplankton blooms. Hence, the reduction of the internal P-loading provided a promising way to reduce cyanobacterial blooms. To mitigate the cyanobacterial blooms, the combination of a low <b>dose</b> <b>flocculant</b> (iron(III) chloride; Flock) and a solid phase phosphate fixative (lanthanum modified bentonite; Lock) was applied in May 2009. This combined approach both removed cyanobacterial biomass from the water column and also intercepted P released from the bottom sediments. Immediately after treatment, the Secchi depth increased from 1. 5 m up to 5 m. Sediment P-release decreased from 5. 2 mg P m− 2 d− 1 (2009) to 0. 4 mg P m− 2 d− 1 (2010) but increased in later years. Mean summer concentrations of total P decreased from 0. 05 mg L− 1 (1992 – 2008) to 0. 02 mg L− 1 (2009 – 2014) and chlorophyll-a from 16 μg L− 1 (1992 – 2008) to 6 μg L− 1 (2009 – 2014). Mean summer Secchi depth increased from 2. 31 m (1992 – 2008) to 3. 12 m (2009 – 2014). The coverage of macrophytes tripled from 2009 to 2011. In the winter of 2010 / 2011 Planktothrix rubescens bloomed, but cyanobacterial biomass decreased during the summers after the Flock and Lock treatment in comparison to prior years. After the Flock & Lock the bathing water requirements have been fulfilled for six consecutive summers. As the sediment P-release has gradually increased in recent years, there is a risk of a reversion from the present mesotrophic state to a eutrophic state...|$|R
40|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) {{combine the}} {{activated}} sludge process with a membrane separation unit for biomass retention. Main advantages of MBR over conventional {{wastewater treatment plants}} are a smaller footprint due to higher biomass concentration {{and the absence of}} a clarifier, but also the production of a high quality effluent. Nevertheless, membrane fouling still is an obstacle for the economical operation of MBR systems. One promising strategy to reduce this fouling in MBR is to modify the sludge filtration characteristics by the addition of flocculants or adsorbents. Within the scope of this work 30 different chemicals were screened with regards to their potential for flux enhancement in MBR. Their impact on SMP (soluble microbial products) removal, particle size distribution and fouling propensity of the sludge was considered, but also their impact on the microorganisms (nutrient removal and respiration) and optimum concentrations were studied. The most promising chemicals were investigated in long-term trials in two identical parallel pilot MBR (1. 6 m³ and 22 m² membrane module each) fed on real municipal sewage. While <b>flocculants</b> were <b>dosed</b> into one system, the other served as a reference. Especially the synthetic polymers showed a high potential – in lab tests as well as in long-time pilot trials – as flux enhancers. However, their usage is limited by several patents. Metal salts might be an economic choice but can cause disturbances of the biomass. Also strong dosing effects (over- and underdosing) were observed. When adding a starch to a membrane system it must always be considered that as being a polysaccharide itself it is strongly suspect of causing fouling in the system. This was also observed in the pilot trials. As the starch was not bound to the flocs it permeated through the membrane and caused fouling. While chitosan strongly reduced the SMP concentration in mixed liquor supernatant and showed the best floc enlargement, the results of cross flow test cell trials showed no improvement of the apparent critical flux. Also the relatively high price of this product limits its application. For a conclusive rating of this substance further tests would be necessary. Activated carbon has been reported in literature for its positive effects on filtration. While synthetic polymers and starch mainly eliminated large molecular weight substances, the tested activated carbons were able to remove the whole range of molecular weight compounds. For activated carbons the activation method (physically or chemically) should be considered as it strongly influences the price. Also residuals from chemical activation were found to negatively impact the biomass in own trials. Commonly used shaker or jar tests are an efficient and quick tool to determine the optimum additive concentration. Several parameters such as SMP or TOC removal in supernatant or quick filterability or dewaterability tests can be used for an assessment. Interestingly, the optimum concentration in terms of SMP removal was also found to be the optimum for the cross flow test cell trials in all but one case. Nevertheless, long-term matrix effects can only be evaluated in pilot trials. Own studies showed that the lab-test results overestimate the effects of flux enhancers. Even elaborate test cell trials did not predict the filtration trends within the pilot plant rightly. E. g. the starch showed promising results in test cell trials, but was washed out and accelerated fouling in the pilot plant. Due to the broad range of tested substances and experimental set-ups used within this work the operating conditions (addition and mixing of the additives, mixed liquor properties such as MLSS concentration, pH, etc.) were not optimized for single substances and varied between the different experiments. Nevertheless, a comparable assessment would otherwise not have been possible. The different results in small- and pilot-scale might possibly be caused by these different conditions. Further research in these fields, especially in effective mixing methods for the activated sludge/additive system in larger scale is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Current Waikato {{sediment}} {{retention pond}} design {{is based on}} guidelines developed by the Auckland Regional Council. As soils in the Auckland and Waikato Regions are different, {{there is a need}} to investigate the effectiveness of sediment retention ponds in retaining sediments from Waikato soil materials. The objectives of this study were to: i) do a comparison between pipette, hydrometer and lasersizer methods for determining soil particle size and to characterise the sand, silt and clay in a range of Waikato soil materials, ii) evaluate turbidity and suspended solid concentration between the inlet and outlet of sediment retention ponds, and iii) investigate the use of chemical treatment (flocculants) in assisting sediment settling. Ten samples representing a range of Waikato soil materials were collected. Particle size was determined using hydrometer, pipette and lasersizer analysis. The pipette and hydrometer gave similar results. Lasersizer analyses were similar to pipette-hydrometer analyses for six samples. The remaining four samples analysed by lasersizer did not give a close agreement to conventional methods. However, error bars showed that between-sample variability was not large. The pipette was found to be the most reliable method for determination of particle size, however the lasersizer gave fast measurements which were easily repeatable. The soil texture of the ten Waikato soil materials tested ranged from sand to clay. A rain gauge connected to an autowater sampler was installed at the inlet of two sediment retention ponds, one at SH 1 in Piarere and the other at a quarry in Ngaruawahia. Water samples were collected when rainfall reached 2 mm in the previous 30 minute period. Samples were analysed for turbidity and suspended solids. The sediment retention ponds at both sites were effective, reducing suspended solids and turbidity by at least 94 %. Water samples collected at Piarere showed a 94 % reduction in turbidity (from 558. 68 NTU to 35. 27 NTU) and a 97 % declination in suspended solids concentrations (from 2365. 63 mg/L to 78. 41 mg/L). Results from water samples collected at Ngaruawahia demonstrated a 97 % reduction in turbidity (from 491. 33 NTU to 14. 46 NTU) and a 95 % drop in suspended solids concentration (from 210. 43 mg/L to 9. 5 mg/L). Flocculants (Polyaluminium Chloride, PAC) were being used at the sediment retention pond at Ngaruawahia. Further investigation into the effectiveness of flocculants in removing sediments from the water column found that samples 1 and 2 collected from the Ngaruawahia study site and allophanic soil materials do not require treatment with <b>flocculants.</b> The recommended <b>dose</b> of 8 ppm/litre of PAC was sufficient to treat sediment runoff without lowering pH level to a point that might induce aluminium toxicity in aquatic life of downstream rivers and streams for Ngaruawahia 3 and coarse materials of Hinuera Formation. PAC doses of 2. 7 ppm in the Hamilton Ash materials and 5. 3 ppm in Hinuera Formation (fine materials) were sufficient to ensure flocculation. For the Piarere soil materials an 8 ppm PAC dose gave reasonable flocculation and 10. 7 ppm PAC further reduced the turbidity after 24 hours...|$|R
