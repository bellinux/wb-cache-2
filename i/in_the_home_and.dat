5|$|Tamazight, {{along with}} other Berber {{languages}} of Morocco, has a low sociolinguistic status, used mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> rarely in official or formal contexts; {{it is not an}} official language.

Bandleader Eric Robinson and television personality David Nixon were heavily involved in the instrument's original publicity. A number of other celebrities such as Princess Margaret were early adopters.|$|E
5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E

5|$|HMS Comet was a C-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. She saw service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>and</b> Mediterranean Fleets and the ship spent six months during the Spanish Civil War in late 1936 in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Comet transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in 1938 and renamed HMCS Restigouche. During World War II, she served as a convoy escort in the battle of the Atlantic, on anti-submarine patrols during the invasion of Normandy, and was employed as a troop transport after VE Day for returning Canadian servicemen, before being decommissioned in late 1945. Restigouche was sold for scrap in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the country, {{to the delight of}} the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as an officer in the Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance and Baroque periods, {{positive}} organs {{were used}} at {{many kinds of}} civil and religious functions.

Despite police investigation, none of the burglaries were ever solved.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} making beer is known as brewing. A {{dedicated}} building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer {{is made in the}} home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E

50|$|A {{standing}} desk or stand-up desk is a desk conceived for writing or reading while standing up or while {{sitting on a}} high stool.

Standing desks have regained some popularity due to purported health benefits, though such benefits {{have not yet been}} clearly established.|$|R
