40|$|Abstract Background In 2003, Timor-Leste {{successfully}} obtained {{its first}} Global Fund grant for a three-year programme for malaria control. The grant aimed to reduce malaria-related {{morbidity and mortality}} by 30 [*]% {{by the end of}} the implementation. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used to assess the impact of the grant implementation. Fifty-eight in-depth interviews, eight group interviews, 16 focus group discussions, and on-site observations were used. Morbidity data reported to the Ministry of Health were also examined to assess trends. Results The National Malaria Programme with funding support from the Global Fund grant and other development partners contributed considerably to strengthening malaria control and the general health system. It also brought direct and indirect benefits to pregnant women and to the community at large. However, it failed to achieve the stated objective of reducing malaria morbidity and mortality by 30 [*]%. The implementation was hampered by inadequate human resources, the rigidity of Global <b>Fund</b> <b>rules,</b> weak project management and coordination, and inadequate support from external stakeholders. Conclusion Despite limitations, the grant was implemented until the agreed closing date. Considerable contributions to malaria control, health system, and the community have been made and the malaria programme was sustained. </p...|$|E

On {{the basis}} of {{newspaper}} articles {{the author of this}} paper details the beginnings of the Zionist movement in the Brod district and describes the foundation of the Association of Zionists in Southslavic lands in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in Brod in 1909. The author also addresses the issue {{of the impact of the}} Association on further development of the Zionist movement in Croatia and Slavonia. At the beginning of the 20 th century Croatia had not yet been ready to embrace Zionist ideas. Namely, at the time of the emergence of the Zionist movement in Europe, what were later to become Zionist leaders in Croatia were only high school students. Herzl’s ideas did reach them, however, they still opposed assimilation. Later when they went off to attend universities in the cities of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (Vienna, Budapest, Brno, Prague etc.), the Jewish youth grew to accept the ideas of Zionism, they joined in the Zionist movement and took these ideas back to Croatia and Slavonia. At the time of the Zionist Congresses in Croatia, as well as during the Congress held in Brod, the Zionist ideas still did not enjoy wide popularity and did not recieve wide support among the Jewish population. The movement only came into full swing after World War I, after the unification of the Jewish communities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia. Through their intense activity, Croatian Zionists prepared the ground for the emergence of the future Zionist movement in Croatia; in 1902 the Society of Academics from Southslavic lands Bar Giora was founded in Vienna; the unique Zionist organization was founded in Osijek and later in Zagreb, the first Zionist society in Vinkovci was established in 1904; and 1906 saw the emergence of the Zionist Society «Theodor Herzl» in Osijek. Zionist Congresses were held in Osijek in 1904 and 1906, in Zemun in 1908 and in Slavonski Brod in 1909. Books were published and the newspaper Židovska smotra was launched in 1906. The Croatian Zionists thus laid the groundwork for the future Zionist Conference held in Slavonski Brod in August 1909. At this conference the Association of Zionists in Southslavic Lands of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was established, whose goal was to found one joint Zionist association which would bring together the Zionists from Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Rijeka and to organize major fund raising for the Jewish National <b>Fund.</b> <b>Rules</b> of procedure were also adopted and a board was elected with headquarters in Osijek. Although after the Brod held Conference a Zionist movement sprang in Brod and in other places in Slavonia, in parallel to the foundation of Zionist societies and stronger activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (which hosted the last Zionist conference in Sarajevo in 1910), the Zionist movement was not strong or numerous enough to develop into a massive campaign. Nevertheless, it did lay the foundations for the future Zionist movement in Croatia...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} the risk sharing features of pension plan design in selected OECD and non-OECD countries and how they correspond with the <b>funding</b> <b>rules</b> applied to pension funds. In addition to leading {{to a better understanding of}} differences in <b>funding</b> <b>rules</b> across countries with developed pension fund systems, the study considers the trend towards risk-based regulation. While the document does not enter the debate over the application of riskbased quantitative funding requirements to pension funds (as under Basel II or Solvency II), it identifies the risk factors that should be evaluated and considered in a comprehensive risk-based regulatory approach, whether prescriptive or principles-based. The three main risk factors identified are the nature of risks and the guarantees offered under different plans designs, the extent to which benefits are conditional and can be adjusted, and the extent to which contributions may be raised to cover any funding gap. In addition, the strength of the guarantee or covenant from the sponsoring employer(s) and of insolvency guarantee arrangements should be carefully assessed when designing funding requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|Multiemployer {{defined benefit}} (DB) pension plans are {{pensions}} sponsored {{by more than}} one employer and maintained as part of a collective bargaining agreement. About 3. 2 % of all DB pension plans, covering 25 % of all DB pension plan participants, are multiemployer plans. Nearly all of the remaining DB pension plans are maintained by a single employer. A few DB pension plans are maintained {{by more than one}} employer but are not maintained under a collective bargaining agreement. In DB pension plans, participants receive a monthly benefit in retirement that is based on a formula. In multiemployer DB pensions, the formula typically multiplies a dollar amount by the number of years of service the employee has worked for employers that participate in the DB plan. DB pension plans are subject to <b>funding</b> <b>rules</b> in the Internal Revenue Code (26 U. S. C. § 431) to ensure they have sufficient resources from which to pay promised benefits. Because single employer and multiemployer DB pension plans have different structures, Congress has established separate <b>funding</b> <b>rules</b> for these plans. Although most multiemployer DB pension plans have sufficient resources from which to pay their promised benefits, a few large plans are expected to become insolvent in the next 20 years. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a U. S. government agency that insures the benefits of participants in private-sector DB pension plans. As with the <b>funding</b> <b>rules,</b> Congress established separate PBGC programs to insure single and multiemployer DB pensions. For example, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated single employer DB pension plans. PBGC does not become the trustee of multiemployer DB pension plans; rather, it makes loans to insolvent multiemployer DB plans so the plans may continue to pay participants’ guaranteed benefits. Although PBGC has sufficient resources to make loans to smaller multiemployer DB plans, the insolvency of a large multiemployer DB pension plan would likely result in a substantial strain on PBGC’s multiemployer insurance program. In the absence of increased financial resources for PBGC, participants in insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans might not receive all of the benefits guaranteed by PBGC. In a report released in June 2014, PBGC indicated that the multiemployer insurance program is highly likely to become insolvent by 2025. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, enacted as Division O in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (MPRA; P. L. 113 - 235) made changes to some of the <b>funding</b> <b>rules</b> for multiemployer DB pensions and allowed plans that are expected to become insolvent to cut benefits to plan participants or to apply for a partition of the plan...|$|R
