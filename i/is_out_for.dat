500|$|The Dimitri {{character}} took {{a darker}} turn in 1997, in what Soap Opera Digest considered {{an effort to}} make Erica more sympathetic after her role in the kidnapping of the baby Maddie Grey (then known as Sonya). Soap Opera Digest praised the move in an article naming Nader Performer of the Week, saying, [...] "Nader has been surprisingly effective as a meanie, and nothing short of brilliant taking an already complex character and making him more compelling." [...] Soap Opera Weekly's Gabrielle Winkel expressed similar sentiments, saying, [...] "Michael Nader is far more entertaining and compelling now that Dimitri <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> himself than when he was as Erica's devoted husband...AMC was right on target when it developed Dimitri's dark side. Nader's brooding looks and raspy voice have always given Dimitri that evil edge. Nader, though, wisely keeps Dimitri's obsessiveness sufficiently in check to make it believable." [...] At the conclusion of the storyline Soap Opera Digest again named him Performer of the Week for [...] "unleashing the sort of go-for-broke fury and fray that actors are usually reluctant to release unless they're certain their character is about to be killed off." ...|$|E

[...] Another parent, Kathy Geib, is working with Piehl and others, but their main goal now is just to get police to take a compulsory second look at cases of alcohol-related drownings.|$|E
