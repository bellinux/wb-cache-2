50|$|On February 29, 2008, {{the first}} day of free agency, after {{speculation}} that Anderson would leave Cleveland to pursue a bigger contract, Anderson agreed to a three-year contract to stay with the Browns through the 2010 season. With <b>fans</b> <b>split</b> between the proven Anderson and the locally-homegrown Quinn (an image of Quinn wearing a Bernie Kosar jersey as a kid was shown at the 2007 NFL Draft), many were speculating if the Browns were in a similar position the San Diego Chargers were in a few years back with Drew Brees and their first-round pick Philip Rivers.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, <b>fans</b> were <b>split</b> as to {{whom was}} winning the first fight between the co-champions: while Tszyu fans {{generally}} had him ahead, Mitchell fans felt Mitchell was winning {{it until the}} point when he could go on no longer.|$|R
5|$|The Bebington Kop, simply {{referred}} to as the Kop, is a large single-tier, all-seater stand with a capacity of 5,696. Completed in 1995, it replaced the earlier open terrace (also called the Kop) which had stood behind the goal at the Bebington End. The Bebington Kop is also the biggest Kop stand in Non league football. Originally the Kop housed both home and away <b>fans,</b> <b>split</b> down the middle, and occasionally was handed entirely to the away fans. However, following the 2000 League Cup semi-final against Bolton, when the Kop was given entirely to the home fans, a campaign was begun to claim the Kop as a home end. From the 2000-01 season this became the case, with away fans housed in the Cowshed.|$|R
50|$|The {{disciplinary}} measure set off huge days-long, often violent protests in Split that quickly assumed a distinctly anti-Belgrade and anti-Serbian tone. Led by the club's hardcore <b>fans</b> Torcida <b>Split,</b> {{the practice of}} seeking out parked cars with city of Belgrade license plates and pushing them into the sea from the docks was especially widespread in Split during the protests.|$|R
50|$|Tudor {{possesses}} great {{amounts of}} stamina and pace {{but he is}} loved by Hajduk <b>Split</b> <b>fans</b> because of his extremely high work rate and a never-going-to-give-up attitude on the pitch.|$|R
50|$|Simić's family {{originates}} from Prijedor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but {{lived and}} worked in Zagreb, Croatia before moving to Prague, before his birth. He considers himself a <b>fan</b> of Hajduk <b>Split</b> and Slavia Prague.|$|R
5000|$|For the Last Time is a British music {{show where}} long-running {{established}} bands perform {{one last time}} before saying goodbye to their most loved <b>fans</b> as they <b>split</b> up for good. Episodes were presented by Christine Bleakley.|$|R
50|$|The annual college {{football}} {{game between the}} University of Oklahoma Sooners and the University of Texas at Austin Longhorns, also known before 2005 as the Red River Shootout, is played at the Cotton Bowl during the State Fair of Texas, instead of on either school's campus. Ticket sales are equally divided between the two schools, and the <b>fans</b> are <b>split</b> on the 50-yard line. The Longhorns {{have a record of}} 61-45-5 against the Sooners.|$|R
2500|$|Tylo {{emerged as}} a fan {{favorite}} in the 1990s, with Ridge and Taylor considered a soap opera supercouple. The character's rivalry with Brooke {{has resulted in the}} [...] "Brooke and Taylor wars" [...] among <b>fans,</b> which has <b>split</b> audience poll opinions.|$|R
50|$|He {{is famous}} amongst Hajduk <b>Split</b> <b>fans</b> {{thanks to his}} epic {{performance}} in the 1986-87 Yugoslav Cup final against NK Rijeka. He entered {{the game in the}} 119th minute so that he can join the penalty shootout where he managed to save 3 penalties and score the winning one.|$|R
50|$|Shōnen-Hoshi Kirimaru (少年法師 霧丸) - Adopted son of Nu. He greatly respects his {{somewhat}} over-protective {{father and}} struggles {{to live up}} to his legacy. When he is extremely angered, however, he is possessed by a dragon spirit which goes ballistic on everything in sight (This happens once only). Kirimaru is plagued by self-doubt, often relying on Retsumaru to build up his confidence. He wields the Bukabuka No Tenyoku <b>fan,</b> which <b>splits</b> into powerful Fin Funnels to attack. Ironically, Kirimaru and Nu are probably the pair which have one of the most demonstrative father-son relationships.|$|R
50|$|Lewin {{had great}} early {{success in a}} matinee-idol babyface tag team with Don Curtis, {{headlining}} in major territories like New York and Chicago. The team's brief heel turn {{was a shock to}} its many <b>fans.</b> The team <b>split</b> up in the early '60s and Mark embarked on a singles career.|$|R
50|$|The {{desire for}} more fame and artistic freedom without {{limitations}} {{from the political}} regime made The Beatmen decide to emigrate to West Germany, but without Ursiny, who decided to stay. As a replacement they took on Juraj Eperjesi. On their travel after the concert in Vienna, Peter Petro decided to return home. In Germany they released one single with a new line-up, but it didn't obtain much interest from <b>fans.</b> They <b>split</b> soon thereafter due to personal problems and disappointment from the little success they gained. After some time, Ursiny founded a new band, The Soulmen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fans</b> {{were mainly}} <b>split</b> between those {{welcoming}} {{the addition of}} Elzhi {{and those who were}} against it and felt that J Dilla was too instrumental in the group's previously established identity to be replaced. Many critics, however, wrote favourable reviews and gave praise for the group's original song concepts as well as Elzhi's lyrical abilities.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{mainstream}} success of Gravity and [...] "Somewhere Out There", Our Lady Peace's <b>fan</b> base was <b>split</b> between <b>fans</b> {{of the new}} material and fans of the old material who, like several critics, cited the band's new direction as sell-out tactic. In 2010, online music magazine Popmatters looked back on the rift saying: ...|$|R
50|$|Bachalo {{was also}} the artist on Captain America for 6 issues (21-26, running December 2003-May 2004 cover dates) {{pencilling}} a divisive run written by Robert Morales. In an attempt to humanize Steve Rogers, the pair managed to <b>split</b> <b>fans</b> opinions fairly resoundingly with both leaving the title - Morales 10 issues short of his intended contract for the series.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2009, it was {{announced}} that {{as a consequence of the}} Diaspora fork, BtRL's subsequent inactivity, and BtRL's perceived hostility toward its <b>fans</b> since the <b>split,</b> BtRL would no longer be hosted at Game Warden, its historical home. [...] BtRL's primary website has been moved and the demo hosting mirrored on a number of providers.|$|R
5000|$|The club's main rivals are Dinamo Zagreb, with matches {{between the}} two {{referred}} to as the [...] "Eternal Derby". Hajduk <b>Split</b> <b>fans</b> are called Torcida Split, who are the oldest organized firm in Europe, being founded in 1950. The inspiration of the name were the Brazilian fans at the 1950 FIFA World Cup which were called [...] "Torcida".|$|R
5|$|Thelephora palmata (commonly {{known as}} the stinking earthfan or the fetid false coral) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae. The fruit bodies are {{leathery}} and coral-like, with branches that are narrow at the base before widening out like a <b>fan</b> and <b>splitting</b> into numerous flattened prongs. The wedge-like tips are whitish when young, but darken as the fungus matures. The common names of the fungus refers to its pungent odor, likened to fetid garlic. A widely distributed but uncommon species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, where it fruits {{on the ground in}} both coniferous and mixed forest.|$|R
40|$|The {{innervation}} of {{the lung}} was studied with Fukuyama 2 ̆ 7 s <b>fan</b> wise <b>split</b> preparation method and Seto 2 ̆ 7 s silver impregnation method in 60 adult dogs. The myelinated fibers in pulmonary plexus were examined macroscopically and histologically, then the route {{and distribution of}} the fibers were researched by the nerve degeneration experiments. The result obtained are summarized as follows : 1. There were many myelinated fibers in pulmonary plexus, i. e. 4406 fibers (right side 2491, left side 1915) on the average of 10 dogs. 2. The myelinated nerve fiber constitution of pulmonary plexus was as follows: The maximum sized fibers occupied 14. 8...|$|R
50|$|Much {{like his}} {{departure}} at St Pats, no formal {{announcement was made}} as to the reasons behind it. In another mirroring of the St Pats departure, Cork <b>fans</b> were <b>split</b> into Pro and Anti Dolan camps. Dolan had finished building a strong team at Cork, following the good work first laid out by Dave Barry and then Liam Murphy, and the club {{went on to win}} the league title in 2005 under new manager Damien Richardson, with the notable addition of Roy O'Donovan. A key factor in the victory in 2005 was the ability for Cork City to finally beat Shelbourne, something which they never managed while Dolan was in charge.|$|R
50|$|Several patches {{have been}} applied to the game since its initial release. One of these patches made the game {{slightly}} easier, in response to feedback about the game's difficulty. This patch {{made a number of}} minor changes to the game, most notable of which was the addition of a brief period of invincibility when the player uses the Dash mechanic. The reduction in difficulty led to debate amongst the game's <b>fan</b> community, <b>split</b> between those who liked the new patch, and those who preferred the old, more challenging version. Three days after this patch, the developers re-balanced the game to add back some of the difficulty.|$|R

2500|$|Barden {{accused the}} others in the race of making him fall, cutting away his front wheel through their riding so he would not win. The National Cyclists Union held an inquiry and Barden made himself more unpopular by accusing the {{witnesses}} of [...] "out and out lies". The issue <b>split</b> <b>fans</b> of cycling but race promoters were more united and Barden found it harder to get engagements.|$|R
50|$|The Brazilian {{influence}} {{stretched into}} Europe through Torcida Split, a formal association of Hajduk <b>Split</b> <b>fans</b> in the Croatian Dalmatia region. Torcida Split {{is now the}} oldest (1950) organized supporters' group in Europe. Thanks to Torcida Split, many other Torcida organized supporters' groups were created, among them rapidly growing and acting Górnik Zabrze fans, called Torcida Górnik, and FK Novi Pazar fans, called Torcida Sandžak.|$|R

5000|$|Record {{producer}} Jerry Dennon of Jerdon Records {{was responsible}} for bringing The Kingsmen (of Portland, Oregon), best known for their national hit [...] "Louie Louie", to the ears of northwest audiences. The Kingsmen soon found themselves embroiled in a rivalry with local favorite Paul Revere & the Raiders, who also released a version of [...] "Louie, Louie". Local music <b>fans</b> were <b>split</b> between the two groups, and the city's music scene polarized as a result. The Kingsmen's version eventually caught on nationally after a Boston radio station picked up the song and Dennon negotiated distributing rights with Wand Records out of New York City. The song's supposedly suggestive lyrics led to it being banned in some localities, including Indiana.|$|R
50|$|The {{penultimate}} {{match was}} the Raw brand's main event between John Cena and Batista. The <b>fans</b> were <b>split</b> {{on the two}} fan favorites, and each man performed numerous signature moves on the other to try to score the pinfall. After paying tribute to his former mentor, Ric Flair, by using his chop block and figure four leglock submission hold, Batista attempted to end the match but was trapped in the STFU. Towards {{the end of the}} match, Cena successfully countered a powerslam attempt into a fireman's carry, and executed the FU to Batista for a near-fall. In turn, Batista countered a top-rope leg drop into the Batista Bomb for a near-fall. Batista pinned Cena following a second Batista Bomb for the pinfall.|$|R
5000|$|Green {{has been}} making {{controversial}} films since 1996, when {{one of her first}} documentaries I'm Your Number One <b>Fan</b> (C4) <b>split</b> the critics. Victor Lewis-Smith stated that it [...] "transcended the documentary format" [...] due to its opening sequence shot on Super 8 film [...] and was [...] "a true work of art that deserves to win every award it's entered for", but Jim Shelley thought it was exploitative. The film followed three stalkers quietly going about their daily business as they harassed the likes of Princess Diana. German doctor Klaus Wagner believed Princes Diana was at the centre of a hate campaign by the Queen. Blue Tulip Rose Read is seen crowing like a cockerel as she pursues DJ Mike Read.|$|R
25|$|The {{rivalry with}} the Los Angeles Dodgers has been {{referred}} to as the Freeway Series because of the freeway system (mostly via I-5) linking the two teams' home fields. The Freeway Series rivalry developed mostly over the two teams sharing similar regions and <b>fans</b> having been <b>split</b> in Los Angeles, similar to the Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox rivalry, the San Francisco Giants vs. Oakland A's rivalry, or the New York Mets vs. New York Yankees rivalry.|$|R
5000|$|Doris Dragović {{was known}} in the early 80s for her work with bands from Split. One of her best known singles [...] "Hajde da se mazimo" [...] {{was one of the}} most {{interesting}} pop songs of the decade called the [...] "golden eighties". She is a known supporter of Torcida, <b>fans</b> of Hajduk <b>Split</b> football club. In 2001, Dragović was threatened by Torcida supporters as she sang to Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Đukanović at the 2000 New Year's Eve.|$|R
50|$|Finally, large {{ceiling fans}} are {{installed}} in every room, even those using air conditioning. Ceiling fans ensure {{that even in}} the absence of the necessary breezes, the airflow needed to feel comfortable in the room is provided for the users. This solution significantly reduces the amount of energy consumed. The overall consumption of the ceiling <b>fans</b> and the <b>split</b> system (the latter used to cool the technical rooms) is only 3.7kWh/m².yr compared to a classic air conditioning system in a standard building consuming 80kWh/m².yr.|$|R
500|$|The Cricket Field Stand, {{also known}} as the David Fishwick Stand for {{sponsorship}} reasons, is the oldest current stand at Turf Moor. It was constructed in 1969 and backs onto the clubhouse and pavilion of Burnley Cricket Club. It contains both teams' dressing rooms as well as the officials' lounge and the tunnel leading to the pitch. Turf Moor {{is one of the few}} remaining football grounds in England to have the changing facilities behind the goals. The stand was made available to home supporters for Burnley's first Premier League season in 2009–10, having previously been the away section of the stadium. This was repeated again during the early part of the 2015-16 season and, following work within the concourse and on the stand the permanently segregate <b>fans,</b> this <b>split</b> was made permanent. [...] The current stand capacity is 4,112, with 2,430 away seats and 1,682 home seats.|$|R
50|$|McDonald {{was drafted}} in the 12th round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft (363rd overall) by the Cleveland Indians, and entered the Indians' minor league system. In 1996, he played for the Watertown Indians of the Single A New York-Pennsylvania League, then moved to the Kinston Indians of the Single A Carolina League in 1997. In 1998, {{he was invited to}} the Indians' spring {{training}} camp, and moved up to the Akron Aeros of the Double A Eastern League, where his defensive plays at shortstop made him a popular player with the <b>fans.</b> McDonald <b>split</b> 1999 between Akron and the Buffalo Bisons of the Triple A International League and was also called up to the major leagues for a short stint. McDonald also appeared in a number of games for the Indians in 2000 and 2001, spending the remainder of each season in Buffalo.|$|R
