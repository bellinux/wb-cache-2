5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E

A flood of victims soon began {{to arrive at the}} city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E

The next landing occurred in 1948 and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism. The island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty in 1961. Since 1987, there has been an automated meteorological station on the island. Three amateur radio DX-peditions have visited the island and there are sporadic landings by tourists.|$|E

25|$|I {{was at the}} Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982 {{when this}} unknown Canberra teenage fullback was playing in what was {{regarded}} {{as something of a}} trial, a curtain raiser to a Test against a New Zealand Under 21 side, though rarely <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> from such a trial graduate immediately to much else. People were wandering into the ground and those who were there gave little attention to what was happening on the paddock.

500|$|The 1960s and 1970s saw {{a further}} {{reassessment}} of Chamberlain as a Cabinet minister. Historians such as A. J. P. Taylor {{pointed out that}} while the 1930s were a decade of misery for some, for most Britons, {{it was a time}} of rising living-standards, with unemployment concentrated in only a few regions of the country. As economists and historians came to question the assumption that the National Government could have spent its way out of unemployment, Chamberlain's tenure as Chancellor was to an extent rehabilitated. American social historian Bentley Gilbert stated that Chamberlain was [...] "the most successful social reformer in the seventeen years between 1922 and 1939... after 1922 no one else is really of any significance." [...] According to Taylor, writing in 1965, Chamberlain did more to improve local government while serving as Health Minister than <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|Watson {{wrote that}} [...] "the chief joy [...] was the {{stealthy}} way the atmospheric story was built up layer by layer".

With the exception of the ending, Billen [...] "loved it". A separate review in The Times, however, praised the twist ending; [...] "this isn't just an inspired set-up performed by a stellar cast – it builds to a macabre and horribly imagined climax." [...] Owen was ambivalent about the ending of [...] "Sardines", saying that it [...] "worked very well in terms of narrative, but perhaps it landed with too much softness". Mark Jones, writing in The Guardian, gave a more mixed review overall, describing [...] "Sardines" [...] as a [...] "slow burner, but a decent introduction to a series".

500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

But he also argued that Patterson had [...] "nowhere near the knowledge or facilities to do so—nor for that matter, <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> else ... When I talked {{about some of the}} more technical details of biomechanics, he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still trying hard to pay attention. Yet he must have known all these details to create a hoax. For instance, he could see the anterior position of the front of the shin, but how that related to foot leverage was quite beyond him." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Marcel Janco, {{the events}} were an {{opportunity}} to discuss his own assimilation into Romanian society: {{in one of his}} conferences, he defined himself as [...] "an artist who is a Jew", rather than [...] "a Jewish artist". He later confessed his dismay at the attacks targeting him: [...] "nowhere, never, in Romania or elsewhere in Europe, during peacetime or the cruel years of , <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> ask me whether I was a Jew or... a kike. [...] Hitler's Romanian minions managed to change this climate, to turn Romania into an antisemitic country." [...] The ideological shift, he recalled, destroyed his relationships with the Contimporanul poet Ion Barbu, who reportedly concluded, after admiring a 1936 exhibit: [...] "Too bad you're a kike!" [...] At around that time, pianist and fascist sympathizer Cella Delavrancea also assessed that Janco's contribution to theater was the prime example of [...] "Jewish" [...] and [...] "bastard" [...] art.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, townspeople grazed cattle on the Green, {{although}} it was owned by the College. [...] To protest the townspeople's failure to remove their cattle at night, students regularly would herd the animals into the basement of Dartmouth Hall and hold them hostage. Not until 1836, when the school and some individual citizens funded a fence, <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> have a sure means of keeping cattle off the Green. [...] The removal of the fence in 1893 prompted students to request that a portion of it be left as a [...] "Senior Fence." [...] Underclassmen were prohibited from sitting on it, with consequences that might include being dumped in a water trough or otherwise humiliated. Over Green Key Weekend, the seniors would pass on their rights to the Fence to the junior class. In 2003 the fence was relocated from two parallel sections of fence {{on the east side}} of the Green to its current location at the southwest corner. [...] The administration decided to use the fence in this way in order to prevent students from cutting across the corner of the Green and wearing away the grass. [...] Although the humiliation of undergraduates is no longer enforced, the fence is still held in some regard by the senior class.|$|E

2500|$|The Royal Navy {{had used}} Swordfish torpedo planes, and their low speed {{was part of}} the reason the Taranto attack succeeded. The Imperial Japanese Navy no longer had any similar planes, so they had to develop other methods, both {{hardware}} and delivery technique. They independently developed shallow water torpedo modifications (called [...] "Thunder Fish") during the planning and training for the attack in 1941. Wooden fins were added to the tail and anti-roll [...] "flippers" [...] kept the torpedo upright once in the water. The fins kept the torpedo's nose level in the air and broke off on entering the water. The flatter [...] "flight" [...] trajectory helped keep them from diving so deeply as to encounter bottom mud. (Despite these modifications, some Japanese torpedoes did indeed reach the bottom and several remain unaccounted for.) These simple modifications were not anticipated by the USN, and Admiral Bloch (commander of the Pearl Harbor Naval District) did not push to install torpedo nets or baffles at Pearl. Nor, it seems, <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> else. Practical considerations also were an influence. Due to the shallow anchorage (which continues to require regular dredging), installation of torpedo nets would have severely restricted the mobility of vessels in the harbor.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of second-wave {{feminism}} {{and the civil rights}} movement during the 1960s, the Miss America pageant became the subject of a series of protests that attacked it as sexist, racist, and part of U.S. militarism. The first demonstration took place during the Miss America 1969 pageant held on September 7, 1968 (won by Miss Illinois 1968, Judith Ford), when about 200 members of the group New York Radical Women demonstrated as part of the Miss America protest. In addition, a pamphlet distributed at the protest by Robin Morgan, No More Miss America!, became a source for feminist scholarship. The protest was co-sponsored by Florynce Kennedy's Media Workshop, an activist group she founded in 1966 to protest the media's representation of African Americans, along with the feminist Jeanette Rankin Brigade and the ACLU. Morgan later stated that the Miss America pageant [...] "was chosen as a target for a number of reasons: it has always been a lily-white, racist contest; the winner tours Vietnam, entertaining the troops as a 'Murder Mascot'; the whole gimmick is one commercial shillgame to sell the sponsor's products. Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values—racism, militarism, sexism—all packaged in one ‘ideal symbol,’ a woman." [...] The protesters compared the pageant to a county fair where livestock are judged. They thus crowned a sheep as Miss America and symbolically destroyed a number of feminine products, including false eyelashes, high-heeled shoes, curlers, hairspray, makeup, girdles, corsets, and bras. Burning the contents of a trash can was suggested, but a permit was unobtainable; news media seized on the similarity between draft resisters burning draft cards and women burning their bras. In fact, there was no bra burning, nor <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> remove her bra. The Women's Liberation Front later demonstrated at the Miss America 1971 pageant.|$|E
2500|$|On March 2, 1981, Stern {{began his}} third morning job at WWDC, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought I would come in and do the news...but it wasn't that way...he wanted someone to play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is that going to be a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor <b>did</b> <b>anyone</b> complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E
