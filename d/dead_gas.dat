40|$|There is a {{worldwide}} effort {{to produce a}} soft x-ray source for submicron microlithography to manufacture future generation large scale integrated microchips. The gas puff plasma discharge has been suggested as a viable alternative for low volume facilities which require relatively low throughputs with a single aligner station. The repetition rate for such systems {{is limited by the}} large gas flow into the vacuum system with the standard electromechanical puff valve. A unique puff arrangement is being developed which will limit the <b>dead</b> <b>gas</b> flow and, in principle, will allow for the development of high repetition rate systems. In this arrangement, the gas flows continuously from a low-pressure plenum through an annular aperture into the Z-pinch electrode gap. A discharge through a single turn solenoid coil mounted {{on the outside of the}} plenum inductively heats the gas, temporarily increasing the mass flow to produce a low mass (< 1 3 Ì†bcg), preionized liner which is imploded by a Z-pinch current discharge. (Multiturn coils have also been used. However, all the experiments reported in this paper used a single turn configuration.) Experiments were carried out with a variety of low-energy (< 2. 5 kJ) drivers including capacitor banks, peaking capacitors, and dc charged paper/castor oil Blumleins. Radiation measurements in the ultrasoft and soft x-ray regions were made using x-ray diodes, p-i-n diodes, and a time integrated pinhole camera. A slug model coupled to a capacitor bank or Blumlein circuit solver is used to estimate the liner dynamics as well as the load current and voltage. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The novel {{concept of}} reverse flow {{operation}} with reactor side feeding is studied for selective oxidation of NH 3 to produce either N 2, N 2 O, or NO. During normal reverse flow operation, where the feeds are alternately introduced from {{either end of}} the reactor, the conversion is always lower when compared to steady state, once-through operation at the same residence time. The novel concept of reverse flow operation with reactor side feeding is therefore proposed to avoid the decrease of conversion. The production rate of the desired product can be kept at a high level, which may even exceed the production of normal reverse flow operation and steady state, once-through operation. The reactor behavior was simulated for three regimes (quasi steady state, dynamic, and relaxed steady state) with varying feed positions. The development of spatiotemporal patterns inside the reactor with side feeding shows completely different behavior compared to normal reverse flow operation and steady state, once-through operation, leading to the possibility of conversion and selectivity manipulations. In addition, the proposed concept also indicates better conversion for the dynamic and relaxed steady-state regimes. The influence of shifting the feed positions to the reactor center is most pronounced if the switching time is shorter. This concept also provides an opportunity to prevent the <b>dead</b> <b>gas</b> volume {{in the center of the}} reactor if suitable feed positions can be applied. The catalyst effectiveness in this novel concept is therefore much better than during normal reverse flow operation and steady state, once-through operation, particularly in the relaxed steady-state regime...|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} viscosity values is imperative for an optimal production and transport design of hydrocarbon fluids. Based on this requirement, cost efficient and reliable empirical correlation models are highly profitable. While {{there are numerous}} correlation models from literature, a consistent correlation model is still needed, as most models are inadequate to predict an accurate oil viscosity using unbiased data. This study aims to develop new and improved empirical viscosity correlations through available field measurements on the NCS. The performance of the proposed models is then studied through a comparative analysis with published correlations from literature. Three new correlations are developed for <b>dead,</b> <b>gas</b> saturated and undersaturated oils. The models are based on available field data from the NCS, where all PVT reports systematically were quality assured and controlled. A high-quality database {{is the single most}} important success criterion to develop an accurate and recognized prediction model. Two different correlation models are developed in this study using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN). The first technique is a computational optimization algorithm that improves a function with respect to a specified objective function, while the latter is an artificial neural network model that utilizes different radial basis functions as activation functions. The optimization algorithm was used to re-calculate the coefficients of established viscosity correlations, while maintaining the functional pattern. The results show that the modified correlations are more in agreement with the test data for all three oil types, compared to the established correlations and RBFN, using the defined parameters from literature. The new correlations provide a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 15. 08 %, 17. 41 % and 3. 35 %, for dead, saturated and undersaturated oil viscosity, respectively. However, the Kriging method proves higher accuracy than the modified saturated correlation, when including the saturated density as input parameter. The RBFN demonstrates a secondary estimation performance compared to the modified correlations; nevertheless, the algorithm is considered to present a satisfactory low percentage error in dead and undersaturated oils, where the empirical response is superior to all discussed correlations from literature. The results of this study make it reasonable to conclude that the proposed correlation methods are more in-line with the measured viscosity on the NCS, compared to the established correlation models that were analyzed...|$|E

We therefore examined the effects of different-size autologous blood clot embolization on pulmonary arterial pressure-cardiac output relationships (Ppa/Q) and on the distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios (VA/Q) in 18 intact anesthetized and ventilated (inspired fraction of O 2 0. 4) dogs. Multipoint Ppa/Q plots were generated by a manipulation of venous return before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of small (1 mm, n = 6 dogs), medium (5 mm, n = 6 dogs), or large (10 mm, n = 6 dogs) clots to increase Ppa to 50 mmHg. The distribution of VA/Q was determined by the multiple inert gas elimination technique at the same intermediate Q in each of these experimental conditions. All three sizes of emboli resulted in an 82 - 92 % mean angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction and increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts and the slopes of the linear Ppa/Q plots. Gas exchange was altered the most after large clots, which were associated with lower arterial pH, higher physiological and inert <b>gas</b> <b>dead</b> spaces, higher dispersion of ventilation, and also lower mean VA/Q of perfusion distributions. In contrast, inert <b>gas</b> <b>dead</b> space was decreased after small clots.

40|$|The {{interrupter}} technique involves measuring pressure {{changes at}} the airway opening following abrupt interruption of airflow, and relies on rapid equilibration of alveolar and airway opening pressures. Following airway occlusion one generally sees a rapid change in airway opening pressure, Pinit, which reflects the resistive pressure drop across the system, followed by a secondary, slower pressure change, Pdif, which reflects the tissue visco-elastic properties together with any redistribution of gases occurring between lung units at different pressure {{at the time of}} interruption. Physical factors in the measuring equipment, i. e., the time taken for valve closure and the presence of a proximal compliant compartment, can cause errors in the calculation of resistance and elastance using the interrupter technique. A computer model was used {{to determine the effects of}} these factors on the calculation of resistance and elastance in normal infants, premature infants, and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The elastance from 25 ml of <b>dead</b> space <b>gas</b> did not introduce significant errors into the measurements in any group of infants, but the presence of an unsupported upper airway caused errors of up to 245 %.

40|$|We {{point out}} a natural {{mechanism}} for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies (ETGs). It automatically links {{the color of a}} galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an ETG red and <b>dead</b> while <b>gas</b> accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While other quenching mechanisms, such as gas stripping, active galactic nucleus feedback, virial shock heating, and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos, MQ can explain the appearance of red ETGs also in halos less massive than ~ 10 ^ 1 ^ 2 M sun. The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift...|$|R

This lack of a pressure effect was observed for both formation of large droplets from untreated oil and formation of smaller droplets by dispersant injection (1 and 2 % dispersant dosage). This strongly indicates that SSDI effectiveness is not significantly influenced by hydrostatic pressure.

40|$|Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) may {{contribute}} to morbidity and mortality of acute lung injury (ALI). Lung protective ventilation (LPV), that reduces VILI, may involve low tidal volume (Vt). Particularly low Vt is possible if dead space ventilation is reduced e. g. by aspiration of <b>dead</b> space <b>gas</b> (ASPIDS). ASPIDS implies that gas rich in CO 2 during expiration is aspirated through a separate channel from the tracheal tube and replaced by fresh gas injected in the inspiratory line. The elastic pressure volume (Pel/V) curve of the respiratory system is recommended as a guideline to set the ventilator so as to reduce VILI. The Vt should be confined to the linear segment of the Pel/V curve, to avoid lung collapse below this zone, and hyperinflation above it. However, the understanding of physiological phenomena behind the Pel/V curve is limited. The objectives were to increase our comprehension of the Pel/V curve, to enhance its potential clinical usefulness, and to develop and test ASPIDS, in an approach aiming at LPV. A computer controlled Servo Ventilator 900 C allowed accurate recording of the Pel/V curve {{and control of the}} ASPIDS system. ASPIDS allowed isocapnic ventilation of pigs and humans with low Vt, and higher PEEP levels in ALI patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The delay between {{changes in}} end-expired {{sevoflurane}} concentrations and bispectral index (BIS) may {{be characterized by}} a 'rate constant' (ke 0). A smaller ke 0 reflects a longer delay. Values for ke 0 vary substantially among studies. The question arises how ke 0 depends on experimental conditions, including ventilation and apparatus. METHODS: Increasing and decreasing sevoflurane concentrations were cyclically delivered to our validated model. First, we quantified theoretical ke 0 values for distinct alveolar ventilations, estimating ke 0 from sevoflurane tensions in alveolar space and grey matter. Secondly, we investigated the impact of experimental conditions. To predict BIS, the model was extended with a pharmacodynamic section, including ke 0. Known values, matching theoretical values, were assigned to this ke 0. These were recovered from end-expired concentrations and BIS. Possible determinants of error (difference between assigned and recovered ke 0) were varied, that is fraction of <b>dead</b> space <b>gas</b> in end-expired gas (d), and time delays in measuring BIS (tBIS) and end-expired concentrations (tEE). RESULTS: Theoretical ke 0 s were 0. 7, 0. 53, 0. 35, and 0. 2 min(- 1) for an arterial Pco 2 of 8, 6. 67, 5. 33 (normocapnia), and 4 kPa, respectively. For spontaneous ventilation, ke 0 = 0. 53 min(- 1). Recovered ke 0 s depended on d and Deltat (= tBIS - tEE) and were smaller than assigned values (if Deltat > 0). Errors increased with increasing d and Deltat. For normocapnia, ke 0 was between 0. 32 and 0. 23 min(- 1) (d = 0. 1; any Deltat = 0 - 60 s). For spontaneous ventilation, ke 0 was between 0. 51 and 0. 40 min(- 1) (d = 0 - 0. 1; Deltat = 5 - 20 s).

RESULTS: Pneumoperitoneum reduced EELV (healthy weight, 1195 Â± 405 vs. 1724 Â± 774 ml; obese, 751 Â± 258 vs. 886 Â± 284 ml) and worsened static elastance and dead space in both groups (in all P < 0. 01 vs. zero-end expiratory pressure before pneumoperitoneum) whereas oxygenation was unaffected. PEEP increased EELV (healthy weight, 570 ml, P < 0. 01; obese, 364 ml, P < 0. 01) with no effect on oxygenation. Compared with PEEP alone, EELV and static elastance were further improved after RM in both groups (P < 0. 05), as was oxygenation (P < 0. 01). In all patients, RM-induced change in EELV was 16...|$|R
30|$|Ventilatory {{settings}} and airway pressures were recorded {{directly from the}} ventilator monitoring system. Plateau pressure was measured during an end-inspiratory pause. Dead space was calculated using the Enghoff modification of the Bohr equation [21]: Vd/VtÂ =Â (PaCO 2 Â âˆ’Â PeCO 2)/PaCO 2, being PeCO 2 the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in mixed expired gas. Expired gas was measured by collecting gas for 3 Â min with a Douglas bag (P- 341 â€“ 60; Warren E. Collins Inc., Boston, MA, USA) attached directly to the expiratory port of the ventilator. An automated analyzer (ABL 520; Radiometer A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) {{was used to measure}} expired and arterial <b>gases.</b> <b>Dead</b> space data were expressed as physiological dead space (Vdphys in mL), defined as the sum of instrumental, anatomic and alveolar dead space [22]. Driving pressure (cmH 2 O) was calculated as Pplat-PEEP. Crs (mL/cmH 2 O) was calculated as Vt/[Pplat-(PEEPÂ +Â PEEPi)], and airway resistance (cmH 2 O/L/s) was calculated as (peak airway pressureÂ âˆ’Â plateau pressure)/Flow. Predicted body weight (PBW) was calculated as follows: 50 Â +Â  0.91 (height in cm- 152.4) for men and 45.5 Â +Â  0.91 (height in cm- 152.4) for women [8]. Arterial to end-tidal CO 2 gradient (P(a-et)CO 2) was calculated in each study phase. We used Puritan Bennettâ„¢ 840 (Covidien, Galway, Ireland) and DrÃ¤ger Evita XL (DrÃ¤ger Medical, LÃ¼beck, Germany) ventilators. All the ventilators used have a compressible volume compensation system.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a design study of a novel proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) are presented in this paper. The need for alternative sustainable energy generation is growing as finite fossil fuel resources are gradually depleting. The PEMFC is particularly suited to the automotive and small scale stationary industries however at this stage fails {{to be a viable}} commercial alternative to the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). The PEMFC has great potential but due to large material and manufacturing costs associated with components used in the fuel cell it has failed to make an impact on either of the industries mentioned above. A new design approach that removes the bi polar plate from the PEMFC stack is investigated. The bi polar plate is a multi functional component and also contributes significantly to the cost of the fuel cell stack. A single PEMFC, which features the design changes that can be integrated in the main stack, has been designed, manufactured, assembled and tested to obtain performance characteristics for a range of operating conditions. Two different flow configurations for the reactants i. e. <b>dead</b> end <b>gas</b> flow and through mode flow were tested. Dead end suffered largely from both Ohmic and concentration losses and resulted into poor performance. Testing also identified issues with the single cell design which included gas leakage and insufficient clamping pressure. Changes were made to resolve these problems and together with through flow gas mode 50 % improvement in cell performance was achieved. The new design achieved performance comparable to that with conventional designs reported in literature. The experimental results confirmed that bipolar plate can be removed and it is possible to bring down the costs and weight of the stack drastically It is envisaged that the new design will allow the PEMFC to potentially inject into the current market. However, testing also highlighted the early signs of degradation on the metallic plates inside the cell. Gas starvation, varying load cycles and poor coating methods were believed to be responsible for the observed corrosion. These results contribute further to understanding of the performance, losses and related material degradation within a fuel cell and help modifying the stack design with mitigation strategies implemented to prevent further degradation occurring...|$|R
50|$|When joining two {{materials}} of similar crystalline structure, diffusion bonding is performed by clamping {{the two pieces}} to be welded with their surfaces abutting each other. Prior to welding, these surfaces must be machined to as smooth a finish as economically viable, and kept as free from chemical contaminants or other detritus as possible. Any intervening material between the two metallic surfaces may prevent adequate diffusion of material. Specific tooling is made for each welding application to mate the welder to the workpieces. Once clamped, pressure and heat are applied to the components, usually for many hours. The surfaces are heated either in a furnace, or via electrical resistance. Pressure can be applied using a hydraulic press at temperature; this method allows for exact measurements of load on the parts. In cases where the parts must have no temperature gradient, differential thermal expansion {{can be used to}} apply load. By fixturing parts using a low-expansion metal (i.e. Molybdenum) the parts will supply their own load by expanding more than the fixture metal at temperature. Alternative methods for applying pressure include the use of <b>dead</b> weights, differential <b>gas</b> pressure between the two surfaces, and high-pressure autoclaves. Diffusion bonding must be done in a vacuum or inert gas environment when using metals that have strong oxide layers (i.e. copper). Surface treatment including polishing, etching, and cleaning as well as diffusion pressure and temperature are important factors regarding the process of diffusion bounding.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange after experimental acute pulmonary embolism in 12 intact anesthetized dogs. Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) /cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after autologous blood clot embolization and again 30 min after cyclooxygenase inhibition, either by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, n = 6) or by indomethacin (INDO, n = 6). Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique, at a constant intermediate Q, under each of these experimental conditions. Embolization increased Ppa at all levels of Q studied (p less than 0. 001), increased true shunt (p less than 0. 05), and shifted perfusion (Q) and ventilation (VA) distributions to lower and higher VA/Q (p less than 0. 05), respectively. ASA and INDO further shifted Ppa/Q plots toward higher pressures (p less than 0. 05). Concomitantly, the physiologic dead space increased after INDO (p less than 0. 001), and the proportion of lung units with a high VA/Q increased and the inert <b>gas</b> <b>dead</b> space decreased after both ASA (p less than 0. 05) and INDO (p less than 0. 05). We conclude that, in experimental pulmonary embolism, structurally different cyclooxygenase inhibitors aggravate pulmonary hypertension and deteriorate gas exchange by an altered distribution of VA/Q essentially to lung units with a higher than normal VA/Q. These findings may be explained by changes in the distributions of both VA and of Q as a consequence of cyclooxygenase inhibition-associated increases in both bronchial and vascular tone in embolized lung regions. status: publishe...|$|R
6000|$|So {{again of}} trees in England. Trees here are an order of nobility; and they wear their crowns right kingly. A few years ago, when Miss Sedgwick was in this country, while admiring some splendid trees in a nobleman's park, a lady {{standing}} by said to her encouragingly, [...] "O, well, I suppose your trees in America will be grown up after a while!" [...] Since that time another style of thinking of America has come up, and the remark that I most generally hear made is, [...] "O, I suppose we cannot think of showing you any thing {{in the way of}} trees, coming as you do from America!" [...] Throwing out of account, however, the gigantic growth of our western river bottoms, where I have seen sycamore trunks twenty feet in diameter--leaving out of account, I say, all this mammoth arboria, these English parks have trees as fine and as effective, of their kind, as any of ours; and when I say their trees are an order of nobility, I mean that they pay a reverence to them such as their magnificence deserves. Such elms as adorn the streets of New Haven, or overarch the meadows of Andover, would in England be considered as of a value which no money could represent; no pains, no expense would be spared to preserve their life and health; they would never be shot <b>dead</b> by having <b>gas</b> pipes laid under them, as they have been in some of our New England towns; or suffered to be devoured by canker worms for want of any amount of money spent in their defence.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study by Tsukimoto et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 68 : 2488 - 2493, 1990), CO 2 {{inhalation}} appeared {{to reduce the size of}} the high ventilation-perfusion ratio (VA/Q) mode commonly observed in anesthetized mechanically air-ventilated dogs. In that study, large tidal volumes (VT) were used during CO 2 inhalation to preserve normocapnia. To separate the influences of CO 2 and high VT on the VA/Q distribution in the present study, we examined the effect of inspired CO 2 on the high VA/Q mode using eight mechanically ventilated dogs (4 given CO 2, 4 controls). The VA/Q distribution was measured first with normal VT and then with increased VT. In the CO 2 group at high VT, data were collected before, during, and after CO 2 inhalation. With normal VT, there was no difference in the size of the high VA/Q mode between groups [10. 5 +/- 3. 5 % (SE) of ventilation in the CO 2 group, 11. 8 +/- 5. 2 % in the control group]. Unexpectedly, the size of the high VA/Q mode decreased similarly in both groups over time, independently of the inspired PCO 2, at a rate similar to the fall in cardiac output over time. The reduction in the high VA/Q mode together with a simultaneous increase in alveolar dead space (estimated by the difference between inert <b>gas</b> <b>dead</b> space and Fowler dead space) suggests that poorly perfused high VA/Q areas became unperfused over time. A possible mechanism is that elevated alveolar pressure and decreased cardiac output eliminate blood flow from corner vessels in nondependent high VA/Q regions...|$|R
