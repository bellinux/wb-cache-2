5|$|The Walronds was {{probably}} built in 1605 {{which is the}} date over the hall <b>fireplace.</b> John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over the <b>fireplace.</b> The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys {{and there are two}} wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second <b>fireplace</b> with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the small}} family/chaplain's {{room on the}} third floor, was the servant's room with a corner <b>fireplace</b> and two windows on the {{mezzanine}} floor, accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded <b>fireplace,</b> beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe. There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was born}} on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He was one of six {{children}} born to Julia Lindsey Brown, a schoolteacher, and John Brown, a grocery warehouse worker. He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, {{as well as an}} older sister known as Johnny. Brown's ancestry was African American, Chicksaw, and Choctaw. The family lived in a house without central heating or indoor plumbing so they relied on a <b>fireplace</b> for warmth. As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this <b>fireplace</b> and was severely burned.|$|E

50|$|Masonry and {{prefabricated}} <b>fireplaces</b> can be {{fueled by}} wood, natural gas, biomass and propane fuel sources. Ventless <b>Fireplaces</b> (duct free/room-venting <b>fireplaces)</b> are fueled by either gel, liquid propane, bottled gas or natural gas. In the United States, some states and local counties have laws restricting {{these types of}} <b>fireplaces.</b> They must be properly sized to the area to be heated. There are also air quality control issues due {{to the amount of}} moisture they release into the room air, and oxygen sensor and carbon monoxide sensors are safety essentials. Direct vent <b>fireplaces</b> are fueled by either liquid propane or natural gas. They are completely sealed from the area that is heated, and vent all exhaust gasses to the exterior of the structure.|$|R

5|$|On the house's {{east side}} are three rooms, whose {{original}} presence {{is open to}} debate. The three rooms are interconnected, another common French colonial element. The room adjacent the porch {{was used as the}} Glidden's dining room and is where the large brick <b>fireplace,</b> which replaced the marble one in 1909, is located. The 1909 <b>fireplace</b> is of the American Craftsman style. At the end of the hall, near the kitchen, there is a full bathroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{rooms at}} Wappocomo are located almost entirely aboveground. The house's foundation is constructed of large stone blocks, into which was crafted a large open <b>fireplace</b> that once exhibited a swinging iron chimney crane. The space around this large open <b>fireplace</b> within the mansion's basement formerly {{served as a}} kitchen, {{where most of the}} cooking and food preparation took place. Entry into the home's basement is accessible through a wide and heavy exterior door.|$|E

50|$|Most older <b>fireplaces</b> have a {{relatively}} low efficiency rating. Standard, modern, wood-burning masonry <b>fireplaces</b> though have an efficiency rating of at least 80% (legal minimum requirement for example in Salzburg/Austria). To improve efficiency, <b>fireplaces</b> can also be modified by inserting special heavy fireboxes designed to burn much cleaner and can reach efficiencies as high as 80% in heating the air. These modified <b>fireplaces</b> are often equipped with a large fire window, enabling an efficient heating process in two phases. During the first phase the initial heat is provided through a large glass window while the fire is burning. During this time the structure, built of refractory bricks, absorbs the heat. This heat is then evenly radiated for many hours during the second phase. Masonry <b>fireplaces</b> without a glass fire window only provide heat radiated from its surface. Depending on outside temperatures 1 to 2 daily firings are sufficient to ensure a constant room temperature.|$|R
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large <b>fireplace,</b> however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs <b>fireplace</b> was installed.|$|E
5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the <b>fireplace,</b> which the <b>fireplace</b> was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E
5|$|Lowell is {{considered}} one of the Fireside Poets, a group of writers from New England in the 1840s who all had a substantial national following and whose work was often read aloud by the family <b>fireplace.</b> Besides Lowell, the main figures from this group were Longfellow, Holmes, John Greenleaf Whittier, and William Cullen Bryant.|$|E

5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a <b>fireplace.</b> In the south-west {{corner of the room}} was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor was used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a <b>fireplace,</b> it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double <b>fireplace,</b> {{but there was no}} evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the <b>fireplace.</b> In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E

5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her <b>fireplace</b> moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the <b>fireplace</b> is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the <b>fireplace</b> seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E
