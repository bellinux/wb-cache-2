25|$|Then, {{during a}} storm, the camp catches fire. Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Squirrelflight are trapped. Squirrelflight makes {{it through the}} flames and drags a stick through {{in an attempt to}} save her kits, but needs some help. Ashfur leaps in and drags it all the way through. Just as Lionblaze leaps on, though, Ashfur blocks the way. Squirrelflight begs him to let them through, but Ashfur tells her and the other three that he never forgave her after she left him for Brambleclaw. He said that he will now kill her kits in another attempt to hurt her. Squirrelflight then reveals a crucial secret: that he cannot hurt her that way because they are not her kits. She {{explains}} how she kept the secret from Brambleclaw and the whole of ThunderClan. Ashfur lets them live, but he threatens to tell her secret, and she is shocked that Ashfur would betray <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Knowing this, Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze realize they are not the Three since they are not the kin of Firestar.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{challenge}} in making the film, Alfredson mentioned {{the fact that people}} already would have a perception of the characters and the surroundings from the novel. He especially felt that the depiction of Eli was difficult, but stated that he was [...] "very happy about Lina". On another occasion, he again commented positively on Leandersson's appearance, stating that [...] "e hardly used makeup or anything in post-production to make <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> she is simply damn good. She's also a very special girl, which I think shows in the film." [...] He has frequently commended Leandersson for her intelligence, often comparing her to [...] "an 80-year-old woman, very wise and very quiet." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{roughly the}} next decade Gordon {{controlled}} Jackson with threats, lies, and routine domestic violence. According to Jackson, [...] "When he hit me, the first time I was in shock, I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard." [...] Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, [...] "I think this guy who is with her has brainwashed her and made <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this...</b> He keeps {{her away from the}} family, and now he's brainwashed her so much she keeps herself away from us." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1953 <b>her</b> autobiography, Not <b>Like</b> <b>This,</b> was published.|$|R
6000|$|Deep down {{within him}} Harbinger uttered a {{noiseless}} oath. Something sinister was making <b>her</b> behave <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to him! It was that fellow--that fellow! And suddenly he said: ...|$|R
60|$|CONSTABLE. 'Tempted sooicide, sir; but she hadn't been in {{the water}} 'arf a minute when I got hold of her. [He bends lower.] Can't {{understand}} <b>her</b> collapsin' <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R
60|$|Rochester {{walked by}} her side, puzzled. He {{had never seen}} <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
60|$|He was {{speaking}} very quietly but earnestly. No man had ever spoken to <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before.|$|E
60|$|He {{considered}} the matter {{for a few}} moments before answering. She felt another poignant thrill of recollection. He had looked at <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> just before he had bent his back to the task of saving her brother's life and liberty, looked at <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> the moment before the unsuspected revolver had flashed from the pocket of his dress-coat and had covered the man who had suddenly declared himself their foe. She felt her cheeks burn for a moment. There was something magnetic, curiously troublous about his eyes and his faint smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope Mamselle V.A.V. is well," [...] {{returned}} the Captain, cordially shaking the hand {{the young lady}} had given him, [...] "and that she enjoys herself to <b>her</b> <b>liking</b> in <b>this</b> outlandish country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Heaven above! Why {{did you not}} deep those cursed sugar-tongs out of [...] her sight? How is {{she going}} to get through it if you frighten <b>her</b> [...] <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|He became angry to hear <b>her</b> talk <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> he did {{not know}} why. Somehow, he could not bear it, when she {{attacked}} things. It was as if she were attacking him.|$|R
60|$|A little later, {{running up}} to put her hat on, she {{wondered}} why it was that Hilary always {{made her want to}} comfort him. Stephen never affected <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Feeling {{her whole}} slender body shaken by sobs, he was terribly alarmed. She must have Blank to-morrow. He would insist upon it. He {{could not have}} <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this....</b> There, there! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's got it across,' Bat whispered. 'I've {{never seen}} <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I {{told her to}} light up the star, but I was wrong, and she knew it. She's an artist.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head, but tears dropped upon his hand. He allured <b>her</b> <b>like</b> the sunshine, <b>this</b> lithe young lover.|$|R
60|$|Jacob {{lost his}} head for a moment. It was {{impossible}} to let <b>her</b> drift away <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I couldn't tell <b>her.</b> Knowledge <b>like</b> <b>this</b> was {{too much}} for the {{ordinary}} run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. [...] "Nothing," [...] I gasped. I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|What had he done? What had {{happened}} in these five days to make <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to him? He took her hands and tried to kiss them; but she said quickly: ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Austin was surprised, {{but said}} nothing. Kit had not talked to <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before. He {{was cool and}} very stern. Somehow he looked older and she {{wondered}} about the bruise.|$|E
6000|$|STRAKER. [scrambling up on {{his knees}} most indignantly] Look here: Louisa Straker is my sister, see? Wot {{do you mean by}} gassin about <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Wot she got to do with you? ...|$|E
6000|$|It was (at {{least it}} might have been, always {{excepting}} for that wise resolution) like his dexterous impudence {{to call it a}} Paradise. He only called it a Paradise because he first saw her coming, and so made her out within her hearing to be an angel, Confusion to him! And ah! how beaming she looked, and how glad! How she caressed the dog, and how the dog knew her! How expressive that heightened colour in her face, that fluttered manner, her downcast eyes, her irresolute happiness! When had Clennam seen <b>her</b> look <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Not that there was any reason why he might, could, would, or should have ever seen <b>her</b> look <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> or that he had ever hoped for himself to see <b>her</b> look <b>like</b> this; but still--when had he ever known her do it! ...|$|R
60|$|Arthur was {{standing}} {{with his back to}} me, talking to Isobel. Certainly her welcome was flattering enough. I realized with a sudden gravity that I had not heard <b>her</b> laugh <b>like</b> <b>this</b> since she had been in England. Arthur continued talking in a low, earnest tone.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had never}} heard <b>her</b> speak <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before, and did not {{remember}} that intense feeling {{is the mother of}} eloquence. He gazed {{at her for a moment}} in astonishment; then he dropped his face into his hands again and groaned, making no other answer. After waiting awhile, she went on-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what's her {{position}} to be," [...] I said, [...] "while you're away? Do you think she'd have married you if she'd known {{you were going}} to leave <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> You ought to give up this business.|$|E
6000|$|I said bitterly, “You needn’t {{have worried}} <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> If {{she had not}} lived for another day {{you would have had}} this house and {{everything}} else besides; a bigger bit than even your wolfish throat can swallow, Mademoiselle Therese.” ...|$|E
60|$|EDGAR. [Paying no attention.]--had put {{our feet}} down, the thing {{would have been}} ended long ago, and this poor woman's life wouldn't have been crushed out of <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> For all we can tell {{there may be a}} dozen other {{starving}} women.|$|E
60|$|Then {{his brain}} cleared, {{and he found}} himself {{thinking}} swiftly. He could not let <b>her</b> go <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> He must overtake her. He must stop her. He must speak to her. He must say--he did not know what it was that he would say--anything, so that he spoke to her again.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you, Phoebe. That girl {{ought to}} get married," [...] went on Mr. Dennant, as Phoebe blushingly withdrew. A flush showed queerly on his sallow cheeks. [...] "A shame to keep <b>her</b> tied <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to <b>her</b> father's apron-strings--selfish fellow, that!" [...] He looked up sharply, {{as if he had}} made a {{dangerous}} remark.|$|R
50|$|Sia cannot {{stand to}} see <b>her</b> friend <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and asks to be a {{surrogate}} mother to their child. Dhruv {{is opposed to}} the idea, but Rewa's insistence sways his decision and he agrees. Soon Sia is pregnant and she is overjoyed for herself but more specifically for Rewa. Unfortunately, Sahil disagrees with what Sia did and abruptly breaks off their relationship.|$|R
6000|$|Thomasin {{hesitated a}} moment, and then {{delivered}} the baby into Venn's hands. [...] "Don't squeeze her, Diggory," [...] she said, [...] "or hurt her little arm; {{and keep the}} cloak close over <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> so that the rain may not drop in her face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] he said, [...] "you are not serious. You cannot {{possibly}} be serious. Your stepmother is your guardian, and she {{certainly would not}} allow you {{to run away from}} <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Besides, I have not even a maid-servant. It would be absolutely impossible for you to stay here." ...|$|E
60|$|He bent searching eyes upon Louise. She {{did look}} ill--white, with great dark shadows under her eyes, {{but she seemed}} really beautiful. What a tragic face it was, betrayed now by lack of paint! Pan had never seen <b>her</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> If he had needed it, this would have warmed his heart to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] the Count said, [...] "all very well indeed, but I do not {{understand}} {{how it is that}} a young lady could disappear from <b>her</b> home <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and that <b>her</b> guardian should know nothing about it. Where could she have gone to? You say that she had very little money. Why should she go? Who was unkind to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "that man! If {{she could}} only get rid of him! That {{ought to have been}} done long ago, before he drove <b>her</b> to drink <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Why didn't she, Mrs. Shortman, why didn't she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The cobbler's wife {{felt much}} disgusted at seeing <b>her</b> wares treated <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> but she dared not speak. When the old hag had {{turned over the}} whole basket she muttered, 'Bad stuff, bad stuff; much better fifty years ago--all bad.' ...|$|R
