5|$|A {{shortage}} of transport aircraft {{meant that it}} would take three days to transport the division to Arnhem. The plan called {{for the majority of the}} 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land on day one. The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days. When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> one anti-tank platoon of the Staffords, along with three platoons and sections from the mortar, machine <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> anti-tank platoons of the KOSB. The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons.|$|E
