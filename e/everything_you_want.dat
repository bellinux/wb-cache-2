500|$|After {{finishing}} his GCSEs, where he achieved three A grades, Primus signed a two-year apprenticeship with Charlton. He also received {{an offer from}} West Ham United, who were in a higher division, but he rejected this because he felt his first team opportunities would be greater at Charlton. Primus was playing in various positions until the club's youth team coach, Colin Clarke, decided that he should play as a centre back, [...] "I see you as a centre back, that way you can see <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> in front of you".|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston of The Guardian {{received}} the series positively, writing: [...] "Holby City has <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{from a hospital}} drama: good–looking staff, a bit of love interest, a dishy doc, the odd current issue (no beds, badly–paid nurses) and bits {{where you have to}} look away", deeming it: [...] "Pretty good, really." [...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The National {{praised the}} {{material on the}} original album, particularly the [...] "ubiquity" [...] of [...] "Umbrella", and also complimented [...] "Don't Stop the Music", [...] "Hate That I Love You", and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". He further stated that the release of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded was made to mark {{the first anniversary of}} the album and that [...] "the new tracks are <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> pop to be, and are a testament to the power of the original record and to the new Rihanna." [...] Spence D. of IGN reviewed the new material and wrote that [...] "Disturbia" [...] is built on an infective [...] "bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum..." [...] hook [...] "that sucks you into the detached electronic bounce of the track". He said that [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is perfectly fitted for a [...] "post-break-up days of gloom" [...] and further praised Rihanna's vocals on the song. According to D., [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] is inspired by the works of American musician Prince and wrote that the [...] "Rihanna's presence [...] definitely gives it a nice boost".|$|E

2500|$|Sound of the Underground {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary pop music critics. The Times noted that Sound of the Underground [...] "is packed with <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> from a pop record – attitude, aggression, guitars, disco beats and steals from Phil Spector." [...] Yahoo! Music said that Girls Aloud [...] "have made a seriously fine debut album. OK, so it's not Blonde on Blonde, Innervisions or OK Computer, {{but it may}} well be another Spice." [...] A number of reviews noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. It was said that [...] "Girls Aloud are on the better end of the commercial pop scale." [...] Ian Youngs of BBC News bluntly stated, [...] "Reality pop is not supposed to be this good." [...] BBC Music said [...] "time will tell if they are set to take the mantle as the new Spice Girls or slip rapidly down pops dumper as the new Hear'Say. But their debut album is sure to shut up at least some of their cynics, myself included." ...|$|E
