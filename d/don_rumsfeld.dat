500|$|Clark's {{loyalty to}} the Democratic Party was {{questioned}} by some {{as soon as he}} entered the race. Senator Joe Lieberman called Clark's party choice a matter of [...] "political convenience, not conviction." [...] Republican Governor Bill Owens of Colorado and University of Denver president Marc Holtzman have claimed Clark once said [...] "I would have been a Republican if Karl Rove had returned my phone calls." [...] Clark later claimed he was simply joking, but both Owens and Holtzman said the remark was delivered [...] "very directly" [...] and [...] "wasn't a joke." [...] Katharine Q. Seelye wrote that many believed Clark had chosen to be a Democrat in 2004 only because it was [...] "the only party that did not have a nominee." [...] On May 11, 2001, Clark also delivered a speech to the Pulaski County Republican Party in Arkansas saying he was [...] "very glad we've got the great team in office, men like Colin Powell, <b>Don</b> <b>Rumsfeld,</b> Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Paul O'Neill—people I know very well—our president George W. Bush." [...] U.S. News & World Report ran a story two weeks later claiming Clark had considered a political run as a Republican.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As <b>Don</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish you had, you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..." [...] Views on one, the early-in-show, eight-minute [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] – one of the few new material centerpieces – varied considerably.|$|E
2500|$|Adelman wrote {{a pair of}} {{editorial}} columns {{regarding the}} Iraq War in the Washington Post in February 2002 and April 2003 entitled, respectively, [...] "Cakewalk In Iraq" [...] and [...] "'Cakewalk' Revisited". In the first {{he argued that the}} U.S.-led invasion of Iraq would be a simple matter to accomplish: [...] "I believe that demolishing Hussein's military power and liberating Iraq would be a cakewalk". In the later editorial, published just {{a few weeks after the}} invasion, he claimed his vindication and in particular praised key Bush administration players: [...] "My confidence 14 months ago sprang from having worked for <b>Don</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> three times—knowing he would fashion a most creative and detailed war plan—and from knowing Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz well for many years".|$|E

50|$|Among {{the donors}} to Bush {{in the primary}} against Reese were the widow of General Douglas MacArthur, former CBS {{television}} president Frank Shakespeare, former Ambassador to Great Britain Anne Armstrong, and former and future Secretary of Defense <b>Don</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> as well as automobile executives from Detroit and oil tycoons from across Texas. It was in this campaign too that Bush first met his political operative and long-term advisor, Karl Rove.|$|E
5000|$|... “Let us {{not ignore}} the role of George Shultz, {{the man behind the}} Bush Presidency, the power of Vice President Cheney, and the {{promotion}} of <b>Don</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> as Secretary of Defense. Even leading Republicans know Shultz to be an outright totalitarian, who has used the Bush Presidency to impose a ‘Pinochet Model’ of top-down dictatorship and radical free-market economics upon the United States. Shultz’s promotion of the privatization of war, on the SS model, has been backed,” LaRouche noted, “by Felix Rohatyn.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Reagan {{political}} advisor Lyn Nofziger urged {{the former governor}} to support Reese because of Reese’s political experience and past loyalty to Reagan. Nofziger dispatched Reese a $1,000 check from Reagan’s political action committee, Citizens for the Republic. [...] After Reagan donated to the Reese campaign, Texas gubernatorial candidate Bill Clements and his wife, the former Rita Crocker, visited Reagan at the former governor’s home in Pacific Palisades, California. Clements was a Bush family friend who had served as assistant defense secretary under <b>Don</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> in the Ford administration and had been the finance chairman of the elder Bush’s unsuccessful 1964 U.S. Senate race against the Democrat Ralph Yarborough. Clements urged Reagan to match the $1,000 contribution that Reagan had rendered to Reese by giving equally to the second Bush. Nofziger claimed to have told Clements: “’Mr. Clements, we don't do business that way.' Nothing more was said about it." ...|$|E
