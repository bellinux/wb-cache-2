5|$|In 1879, Karl Benz {{was granted}} the first patent on a {{reliable}} gasoline-powered engine in Germany. In 1885, he produced the first true gasoline automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen. The new invention was quickly refined and gained popularity in Germany and France, and interest {{grew in the}} United Kingdom and the United States. In 1902, Ransom Olds created the production line concept for mass-producing lower-cost automobiles. Henry Ford soon refined the concept so that by 1914, middle-class laborers could afford automobiles built by <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Company.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Company,</b> fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run. There was some initial support to name it after Roy Chapin, the late president of the Hudson Motor Car Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. On April 23, 1946, the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford and president of the <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Company</b> from 1918 until his death in 1943.|$|E

Variety stated that Lionsgate spent around $20 million with its market only, while Los Angeles Times reported a $25 million cost to both produce and market the film. <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Company</b> also sponsored the film by providing a Lincoln Zephyr to chauffeur the cast and creators to and from a screening.|$|E

5|$|Two other {{original}} {{sections of}} I-94's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names. The westernmost {{of these is}} the Willow Run Expressway, named for the Willow Run complex. The plants at Willow Run produced B-24 Liberator bombers for <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Company</b> during World War II. The second, the Detroit Industrial Expressway, continued the route of the Willow Run Expressway eastward into Detroit. Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial plants at Willow Run during the war and were later incorporated into I-94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit–Chicago highway.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves - about 10kg of lithium per car. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Company</b> found sufficient resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread transportation use. The study estimated global reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Adams Township High School, Verville took a {{correspondence}} course in electrical engineering. He moved to Detroit, Michigan {{at the age}} of twenty, and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company, <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Company,</b> and Hudson Motor Car Company. By 1913, Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly. William Edmund Scripps, the editor and owner of The Detroit News, introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913. Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his Spring 1914 flight school. Instead, Verville went to Hammondsport, New York in February 1914, where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was located, and told Curtiss he wanted to work as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop. Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career.|$|E
