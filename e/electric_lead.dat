25|$|Enka {{suggests}} a traditional, idealized, or romanticized aspect of Japanese culture and attitudes. Enka singers, predominantly women, usually perform in a kimono or in evening dress. Male enka performers tend to wear formal dress, {{or in some}} performances, traditional Japanese attire. Nods to traditional Japanese music are common in enka. The melodies of enka are fundamentally Western harmonies, and electronic instruments are used, such as synthesizers and <b>electric</b> <b>lead</b> guitar with plenty of distortion, but its musical instruments also include traditional Japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi and the shamisen.|$|E
500|$|Dylan first {{recorded}} [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] {{a few weeks}} later, on June 9, with Tom Wilson producing, during the Another Side of Bob Dylan session. The take, recorded with Ramblin' Jack Elliott, was cut from the album because Dylan felt the song was special and their performance {{did not do it}} justice. Sometime that month he also recorded a publisher demo of the song at Witmark Music. More than six months passed before Dylan re-recorded the song, again with Wilson in the producer's chair, during the final Bringing It All Back Home session on January 15, 1965, the same day that [...] "Gates of Eden," [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)," [...] and [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] were recorded. It was long thought that the four songs were each recorded in one long take. However, in the biography Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades, Clinton Heylin relates that the song required six attempts, possibly because of difficulties in working out the playoffs between Dylan's acoustic guitar and Bruce Langhorne's <b>electric</b> <b>lead.</b> The final take was selected for the album, which was released on March 22, 1965.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago's West Side pioneered by Magic Sam, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush on Cobra Records. The [...] "West Side sound" [...] had strong rhythmic {{support from a}} rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as perfected by Guy, Freddie King, Magic Slim and Luther Allison was {{dominated}} by amplified <b>electric</b> <b>lead</b> guitar. Expressive guitar solos were a key feature of this music.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not long}} before they found that they had judged wisely; the bottom descended far {{out of the reach of}} their <b>electric</b> <b>lead,</b> and they were enabled to keep a safe {{distance}} below the overhanging ice.|$|E
60|$|Here was a {{condition}} of things which had not been anticipated. The bottom below and the ice above were approaching each other. Of course {{it might have been}} some promontory of the rocks under the sea against which their telltale lead had struck; but there was an instrument on board for taking soundings by means of a lead suspended outside and a wire running through a water-proof hole {{in the bottom of the}} vessel, and when the Dipsey had risen a few fathoms, and was progressing very slowly, this instrument was used at frequent intervals, and it was found that the <b>electric</b> <b>lead</b> had not touched a rock projecting upward, and that the bottom was almost level.|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{that day}} {{and part of the}} next were spent in taking soundings, and very curious and {{surprising}} results were obtained. The <b>electric</b> <b>lead,</b> which rang the instant it touched bottom, showed that the sea immediately over the pole was comparatively shallow, while in every direction from this point the depth increased rapidly. Many interesting experiments were made, which determined the character of the bottom and the varied deposits thereupon, but the most important result of the work of Mr. Gibbs and his associates was the discovery of the formation of the extreme northern portion of the earth. The rock-bed of the sea was found to be of the shape of a flattened cone, regularly sloping off from the polar point.|$|E
