40|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>jet</b> {{polishing}} (FJP) {{is a new}} advanced {{polishing technology}} that finds applications in many industries, especially in the optics industry. With the broad application of various surfaces in optics, the sub-micrometric scale and the nanometric surface roughness accuracy are major challenges. <b>Fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing is a technology developed from abrasive water jet machining. This technology is a water jet cutting technology, which uses high-pressure flow to cut/remove materials. In this thesis, the working principle, and simulations, as well as verification of <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing are thoroughly investigated. The verification of <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing in this thesis includes velocity distribution and material removal derivations. The amount of material removed {{is directly related to}} the impact velocity of a particle with a surface, which helps define its abrasive particle velocity. During polishing, the particles travel in a solution called slurry. Due to the relatively similar velocity of the particles and the slurry, the particles and the slurry are assumed to be traveling at the same rate. In this thesis, three specific examples are investigated through the creation of an advanced model using FLUENT, a computational fluid dynamics software. The model simulates the particle path during the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing process, and this thesis compares the simulation results to prior analytical and experimental results. The results indicate that the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing erosion area at a particular location is axisymmetric when the 2 D cross-section shape is investigated. As the impingement angle of the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> is reduced, the center dead area, where no polishing is observed, approaches zero. vii Additionally, the horizontal component of the velocity vector initially increases then decreases as one moves away from the center stagnation point. Finally, this thesis demonstrates that the erosion depth into the surface that is polished increases when the working pressure of the fluid is increased. This thesis finds that when the distance between the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> and the workpiece is 7 mm, material removal is maximum...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>jet</b> {{polishing}} is an enabling ultra-precision machining technology, {{which has}} not only been widely used for removing machine tool marks {{in order to achieve}} super finished surfaces, but also for controlling the form accuracy in machining freeform surfaces. Due to the complex machining mechanism, it is difficult to model the material removal rate accurately with consideration of a lot of operational parameters in <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing. In this article, the optimal operational parameters and the significance of the important parameters are determined by the Taguchi design of experiments. Hence, a computational fluid dynamics-based analysis is built for the determination of the material removal rate in <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing. In this model, the impact information of the particles with respect to the workpiece is computed by computational fluid dynamics simulation which is then coupled with a local mechanics erosion model so as to predict the detailed distribution of the material removal rate in <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> polishing. To verify the computational fluid dynamics-based erosion model, a series of polishing experiments have been conducted. The experimental results are found to agree well with the predicted form error and the pattern of the material removal rate by the integrated erosion prediction model.

40|$|Abstract. Different {{methods of}} cutting fluid {{application}} are used on turning of a difficult-to-machine steel (SAE EV- 8). A semi-synthetic cutting fluid was applied using a conventional method, minimum quantity of cutting fluid (MQCF), and pulverization. By the minimum quantity method was also applied a lubricant of vegetable oil (MQL). Thereafter, a cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> under high pressure (3. 0 MPa) was singly {{applied in the}} following regions: chip-tool interface; top surface of the chip; and tool-workpiece contact. Two other methods were used: an interflow between conventional application and chip-tool interface jet and, finally, three jets simultaneously applied. In order to carry out these tests, {{it was necessary to}} set up a high pressure system using a piston pump for generating a cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>jet,</b> a Venturi for fluid application (MQCF and MQL), and a nozzle for cutting fluid pulverization. The output variables analyzed included tool life, surface roughness, cutting tool temperature, cutting force, chip form, chip compression rate and machined specimen microstructure. It can be observed that the tool life increases and the cutting force decreases with the application of cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>jet,</b> mainly when it is directed to the chip-tool interface. Excluding the methods involving <b>jet</b> <b>fluid,</b> the conventional method seems to be more efficient than other methods of low pressure...|$|R

A water model and high-speed camera was used to capture the profile of the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet.</b> Four different nozzles were attached one by one to five different tundishes with different bath depths. The result showed that with deeper bath depths the circular cross-section occurred further down from the nozzles orifice. The length to the circular cross-section also depended on the orifice area, a larger area gave a longer distance than a smaller area. It was shown that the length to circular cross-section followed a quadratic function, when the measured values were analyzed based on the Weber number. The profile of the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> was dependent on the material of the nozzle, the geometries of the orifice, the bath depth and the surface tension. ...|$|R
