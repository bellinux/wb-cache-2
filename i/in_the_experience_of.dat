5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} German nationalism, {{stimulated by the}} {{experience}} of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect its roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> Germans in the Napoleonic period. The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to {{a growing sense of}} unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is part of}} the {{limbic system}} which is related to fear cognition and emotional learning. Individuals with social anxiety disorder have been found to have a hypersensitive amygdala; for example in relation to social threat cues (e.g. perceived negative evaluation by another person), angry or hostile faces, and while waiting to give a speech. Recent research has also indicated that another area of the brain, the anterior cingulate cortex, which was already known to be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> physical pain, also appears to be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> 'social pain', for example perceiving group exclusion. A 2007 meta-analysis also found that individuals with social anxiety had hyperactiviation in the amygdala and insula areas which are frequently associated with fear and negative emotional processing.|$|E

40|$|This {{narrative}} {{research study}} explored the socio-cultural context surrounding depression through semi-structured interviews with six South Asian Canadian participants, who self {{identified as having}} <b>experienced</b> depression. <b>The</b> study sought to expand on the knowledge of depression and South Asian Canadians by considering {{the roles of the}} family, the community, and <b>the</b> culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> depression. Thematic analysis of the participant interviews resulted in five major themes: <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> depression, <b>the</b> influence of family, the influence of socio-cultural factors, the psychological impact, and the utilization of coping strategies. The findings of the study suggested that the family, the community, the culture, and gender inequality were influential factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> depression. <b>The</b> results of the research study can also offer relevant knowledge that can assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> efforts to provide culturally sensitive treatment for South Asian Canadians suffering from depression...|$|R

25|$|The {{story of}} the {{rebellion}} continues to be passed on by Gbaya people {{in the form of}} traditional Gbaya folktales, sometimes including songs. It continues to have relevance, with Karnou's prophecies explaining the radical change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> Africans under colonialism, namely regarding the new, politico-economic and Christian religious orders. It is also claimed that Boganda was the reincarnation of Karnou, having visited the epicentre of the rebellion that was Karnou's former residence in the early 1950s. In this way, the story of Karnou serves to reconcile Gbaya myth and tradition with the tumultuous history of Central Africa.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} factor {{to consider is}} the individual differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> pleasurable effects {{brought on by the}} substance or behaviour. It is reasoned that certain individuals may be more sensitive to the pleasurable effects and thus experience them with greater intensity, resulting in addiction. For example, over-responsiveness to substance affects has been found in cocaine addicts – an increased response to methylphenidate in the brain regions associated with emotional reactivity and mood. Thus, strong emotional responses that addicted individuals show in response to substances or behaviours might be results of enhanced sensitivity to their effects.|$|E

25|$|As {{one would}} expect, Metzinger’s concept of {{painting}} was both {{more sophisticated and}} perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally {{the shape of the}} misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, {{and at the same time}} brought out the flatness and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of multiple perspectives and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an n-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’).|$|E
25|$|A modern museum {{called the}} Hall of Fame and Sensation opened in Melbourne in 2003 to {{celebrate}} {{the culture of the}} AFL and to provide a venue for the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The museum, a licensed offshoot of the AFL, was originally touted for the MCG, but the Hall of Fame failed to get support from the Melbourne Cricket Club. The new QV shopping centre on Swanston Street was then chosen as the location. However, controversy followed the appointment of an administrator as the museum began running at a loss. Many blamed high entry prices, which were subsequently reduced, and the museum remains open to the public. In early 2006 the name was changed to AFL World. It features various honour boards and memorabilia as well as a range of innovative interactive displays designed to immerse visitors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> elite Aussie Rules.

500|$|The megalithic {{builders}} {{responsible for}} the Coldrum Stones positioned it {{on the top of}} a small ridge adjacent to the North Downs, and constructed it facing eastward, towards the River Medway. It is located on the edge of a large lynchet scarp, although it is difficult to ascertain what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction, due to a lack of information on how densely forested the vicinity was. If the area was not highly wooded, then 360° views of the surrounding landscape would have been possible. The monument's axis points toward both the North Downs and the Medway Valley, which is similar to the other Medway Megaliths. The archaeologist Sian Killick suggested that the Coldrum Long Barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement, and that this [...] "may have been a key factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> ceremonies and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have defined a link between the tomb builders and the landscape." ...|$|E
500|$|Plato's The Republic was the {{freshman}} year capstone, as [...] "the apex of literary and philosophical achievement in ancient Athenian thought" [...] {{and the book}} that best embodied their civilization. Meiklejohn asked the students to synthesize how the contents of their first year were [...] "interrelated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the individuals and of {{the community as a}} whole". Over the summers, Meiklejohn assigned Middletown studies where students drew conclusions about American society based a view of their hometowns as typical of society. The returning sophomores were expected to exhibit self-regulation as the primary regulator of their understanding, to educate themselves self-sufficiently, and to wean themselves of the college institution. This freedom was taught so as to empower students towards independence while the advisers continued to hold pedagogical power. Henry Adams's The Education of Henry Adams was the sophomore year capstone, chosen for its complexity, self-criticism, and study of modern America's development. Meiklejohn biographer Adam Nelson compared the Ex College curriculum and Adams's autobiography as both lamenting [...] "the tragedy of lost spiritual and intellectual unity" [...] and enabling students to relate [...] "their literary and lived experiences".|$|E
