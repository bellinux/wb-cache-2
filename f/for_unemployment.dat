5|$|After the hurricane, {{the labor}} force diminished and wages {{decreased}} by staggering amounts. In July 2005, 9,592 people applied <b>for</b> <b>unemployment</b> services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs. The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high demand to make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes.|$|E
5|$|During the shutdown, some 19,000 state {{employees}} were laid off. State {{and federal government}} employees in Minnesota lost approximately $65 million in wages {{over the course of}} the shutdown. Because of court rulings, some of the 36,000 {{state employees}} who received layoff notices leading up to the shutdown continued or returned to work during the shutdown. Laid-off employees were immediately eligible <b>for</b> <b>unemployment</b> benefits, and continued to receive health insurance, costing the state millions a week.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{meaning of}} Keynes's {{work has been}} long debated.

Economists and scholars debate whether Keynes intended his advice to be a major policy shift to address a serious problem or a moderately conservative solution to deal with a minor issue.|$|E

5|$|The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces {{found it impossible}} to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility <b>for</b> <b>unemployment</b> relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald {{played an important role in}} shaping the Commission's final recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{crews of}} the government's Department of Social Security (DSS) visited {{locations}} throughout the region, receiving damage claims, requests for monetary aid, and filings <b>for</b> <b>unemployment</b> benefits. The Commonwealth pledged to provide $150million in relief {{over a three-year}} period to the government of Queensland in exchange for deregulation; however, its offer was initially rejected. Planes flew claims adjusters and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance emergency service in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special emergency service employees for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures. Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail. By the end of the day, 2200tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.|$|E
5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible <b>for</b> <b>unemployment</b> benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department of Social Security (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and filings <b>for</b> <b>unemployment</b> benefits. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth of Australia initiated a three-year, $150million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion in the days following the cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to heavy criticism in the days following the storm's landfall, accused of not giving ample warning in advance of Winifred's approach; however, these concerns were later addressed in its report on the cyclone's impact. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|On October1, President George W. Bush {{declared}} Puerto Rico {{major disaster}} area. The declaration allowed federal assistance to reach affected {{communities in the}} United States Commonwealth. Residents who met the requirements to receive federal aid were eligible for funding for temporary housing. People who lost their jobs due to the flooding were eligible <b>for</b> <b>unemployment</b> grants for 26 weeks starting {{the day of the}} disaster declaration. Residents were able to receive up to $200,000 for home damages; up to $40,000 in personal possession losses; and up to $2million for business losses. By October17, more than $5.6million in disaster aid was approved for 20,284 residences. Community Relations teams visited about 7,000 people. Out of the 4,140 small-business loans applications, only 288 were submitted by this time. By October25, the amount of funds nearly doubled, reaching $11million. At this time, more than, 24,500 residents applied for disaster loans. Survey teams checked over 18,000 homes for flood-related damages at this time also. Funding reached $16.5million by November7, with 29,000 people requesting federal assistance. By December5, funding for 37,000 residents reached $23.1million. At this time, the deadline for federal assistance requests was set for January15, 2009. On January2, 2009, funding for small businesses was being provided, with $6million being contributed. Grants for residents also reached $25million. After the flooded rivers crested and receded, bulldozers began clearing mud covered streets.|$|E
