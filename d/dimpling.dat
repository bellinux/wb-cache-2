5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the <b>dimpling</b> on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

40|$|Due to the <b>dimple’s</b> unique {{characteristics}} of comparatively low pressure loss penalty and good heat transfer enhancement performance, <b>dimple</b> provides a very desirable alternative internal cooling technique for gas turbine blades. In the present study, an experimental investigation {{was conducted to}} quantify the flow characteristics over staggered <b>dimple</b> arrays and to examine the vortex structures inside the <b>dimples.</b> In addition to the surface pressure measurements, a high-resolution digital Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system was also utilized to achieve detailed flow field measurements to quantify {{the characteristics of the}} turbulent channel flow over the <b>dimple</b> arrays in terms of the ensemble-averaged velocity, Reynolds shear stress and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) distributions. The experimental measurement results show that the friction factor of the <b>dimpled</b> surface is much higher than that of a flat surface. The measured pressure distribution within a <b>dimple</b> reveals clearly that flow separation and attachment would occur inside each <b>dimple.</b> In comparison with those of a conventional channel flow with flat surface, the channel flow over the <b>dimpled</b> arrays was found to have much stronger Reynolds stress and higher TKE level.
