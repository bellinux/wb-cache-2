5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E
5|$|The <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the home's {{interior}} {{has remained}} {{basically the same}} throughout the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central hallway which ends in an elegant rotunda. However, {{some of the changes}} made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. The parlor was converted into the library and the library was converted into the dining room after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E
5|$|With {{sites such}} as Danebury {{where there is no}} modern {{habitation}} or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the <b>general</b> <b>layout.</b> The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A geophysical survey was performed to establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar were successful in identifying the eastern and northern sections of the ditch encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated around the Old Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43trenches, 14trial trenches, and 17test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch.|$|E
25|$|The most typical {{distinguishing}} features of Azerbaijan's architecture in the 19th century were {{the expansion of}} towns, application of Russian town-planning principles {{and the development of}} the <b>general</b> <b>layouts</b> of Ganja, Shemakha and Baku.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The <b>general</b> <b>layout,</b> too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The {{work on the}} <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of {{the former}} Sovietskaya Street began in 1944, soon after the liberation of Minsk from the Nazi troops.

25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the park, {{designed}} by Charles Faust, included a large lagoon with a jungle plaza, an African fishing village, an aviary {{at the entrance}} of the park and approximately 50,000 plants were {{to be included in the}} landscaping. Although the park was scheduled to open in three years from the time of the groundbreaking, the total development of the park was estimated to take ten years.|$|E
25|$|In <b>general</b> <b>layout,</b> the Shiratsuyu-class vessels closely {{resembled the}} Ariake sub-class, or {{final version of}} the Hatsuharu class, differing only in the more compact bridge design and the shape and {{inclination}} of the funnels. The hull retained the general configuration of the Hatsuharu class with a long forecastle with a pronounced flare to improve sea-keeping at high speeds by adding buoyancy and reducing the spray and water coming over the deck.|$|E
25|$|Prior to excavation, historians {{had thought}} that Tomotley was founded by {{refugees}} from the Cherokee Middle, Lower, or Valley towns when they fled warfare with the Creek and later the English, whose attacks destroyed their towns in the mid-18th century. The goals of the 1976 excavations were {{to shed light on}} this theory by determining the location and structure of Tomotley's councilhouse, analyzing Tomotley's Cherokee dwellings, and establishing the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the village.|$|E
25|$|Early 18th century campuses were {{dominated}} by Greek Revival architecture, which emulated traditional Classical architecture. This inspiration influenced both individual buildings and <b>general</b> <b>layouts,</b> with new emphasis placed on symmetry.

25|$|Dorgon {{established}} the Qing Dynasty {{as a direct}} successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers) and Beijing became China's sole capital. The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of {{the city}} was conserved, it was not {{completely}} identical. Despite the necessity of rapid reconstruction and the lack of financial means, authorities took several measures to improve traffic flow, sanitation and the general aesthetics {{of the city}}. Many streets were made as wide as possible to improve traffic flow. New regulations were put in place, adding to existing ones preventing cellar doors, steps and wares from spilling into the street. Thatched roofs, wooden canopies and upper floors projecting into the street had all been illegal before the fire, but unenforced. Any building that did not conform to regulations was to be demolished.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of Saint Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (a member of the Zagwe Dynasty, who ruled Ethiopia in the late 12th century and early 13th century), the current town of Lalibela was known as Roha. The saintly king was named so, because a swarm of bees {{is said to have}} {{surrounded}} him at his birth, which his mother took as a sign of his future reign as Emperor of Ethiopia. The names of several places in the modern town and the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the rock-cut churches themselves are said to mimic names and patterns observed by Lalibela during the time he spent as a youth in Jerusalem and the Holy Land.|$|E

25|$|The Dornier Seastar is a {{parasol wing}} flying boat, {{powered by a}} pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-112 engines, mounted in a single nacelle over the wings in a {{push-pull}} configuration. In <b>general</b> <b>layout,</b> it strongly resembles both the innovative Dornier Wal all-metal monoplane flying boat of the 1920s, of which over 250 examples were built, and its direct successor, the larger Dornier Flugzeugwerke's Do 18 of the 1930s. Locating both of the engines {{in the center of the}} wing enables the weight of the engines to be more effective in reducing any induced rolling motions; it also protects the engines themselves from water spray, reducing corrosion, and eliminates asymmetric thrust when operating.|$|E
25|$|And third, each {{ship has}} {{a display of}} systems (a Ship Systems Display, or SSD) {{that acts as a}} {{schematic}} diagram of a particular ship in play. Each class in the game has an individualized SSD, and most expansions revolve around providing new classes and 'variants' of ships to the game, with new SSDs. These displays consist of check-off boxes for all the ship's structure and systems (shields in all six directions, systems and hull damage, how much power the engines produce, how many transporters there are, etc. checked off when damaged) in the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the ship, along with general reference information for that ship (tracks to check off use for weapons in limited supply like drones, shuttles, probes, plus weapons fire resolution tables, firing arcs, and miscellaneous ship data).|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} European {{immigrants}} {{settled in the}} cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Urban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, {{and most of the}} larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this <b>general</b> <b>layout,</b> known as a damero, meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed {{at the end of the}} 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street illumination.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} of VLSI layout described by several authors first determines the relative positions of indivisible pieces, called cells, on the chip. Various optimizations are then performed on this initial layout to minimize some cost measure such as chip area or perimeter. If each cell is a rectangle with given dimensions, one optimization {{problem is to}} choose orientations of all the cells to minimize the cost measure. A polynomial time algorithm is given for this optimization problem for layouts of a special type called slicings. However, orientation optimization for more <b>general</b> <b>layouts</b> is shown to be NP-complete (in the strong sense) ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the House {{was largely}} {{untouched}} {{from the previous}} non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House {{there was also a}} fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1695 {{bombardment}} of Brussels by the French troops of King Louis XIV, {{in which a}} large part of the city centre was destroyed, Governor Max Emanuel proposed using the reconstruction to completely change the layout and architectural style of the city. His plan was to transform the medieval city into a city of the new baroque style, modeled on Turin, with a logical street layout, with straight avenues offering long, uninterrupted views flanked by buildings of a uniform size. This plan was opposed by residents and municipal authorities, who wanted a rapid reconstruction, did not have the resources for grandiose proposals, and resented what they considered the imposition of a new, foreign, architectural style. In the actual reconstruction, the <b>general</b> <b>layout</b> of the city was conserved, but it was not identical to that before the cataclysm. Despite the necessity of rapid reconstruction and the lack of financial means, authorities did take several measures to improve traffic flow, sanitation, and the aesthetics of the city. Many streets were made as wide as possible to improve traffic flow.|$|E
