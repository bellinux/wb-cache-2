40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of energy static conversion systems in <b>road</b> <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> vehicles that use fuel cells and energy storage devices. To obtain meaningful results, all the operating points should be considered and the related efficiencies should be weighted with their time duration. For this purpose, it appears useful considering electric vehicle driving standard cycles. Unfortunately, the precise simulation of a power electronic system transient that lasts a few seconds generally requires a much greater computing time, while driving cycles may last several thousand seconds. This would require too much high overall simulation times, if conventional computing systems are considered. To solve this problem, the Average Switching Modeling (AVS) approach has been used for speeding up simulation. Accurate AVS models of dc/dc converters are shown and their behaviours are compared with those related to more detailed converter models...|$|R

40|$|This study uses {{a vehicle}} model {{together}} with detailed traffic {{data of the}} European route 39 in western Norway to estimate how the electricity demand for an <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> system varies with time and location. The aim is {{to better understand the}} impact of an <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> system on the stationary electricity system. The results show that the electricity demand for an E 39 <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> system is comparable to a larger industry, potentially increasing the peak power demand in the regional electricity system with only a few percent. Yet, if all main Norwegian roads are electrified, or if vehicles can also charge their batteries while driving, there will be a significant (> 10 %) addition of electricity demand to the current load. © 2016 WEVA...|$|R

50|$|Ross Auto Engineering was a British {{manufacturer}} of milk floats and other battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> vehicles. The company {{was formed in}} 1949 by Victor Electrics, another {{manufacturer of}} milk floats. In 1955 they took over the production of Helecs battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> vehicles, and also introduced their own models. With the rapid demise of home milk deliveries, production of vehicles ceased in the 1980s, by which time the company had diversified into mobility services, and began trading as Ross Care.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} five {{scenarios}} for fully <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> transport in Sweden are compared, {{looking at the}} total system cost for different combinations of battery systems, vehicle equipment and charging solutions, {{including the use of}} <b>Electric</b> <b>Road</b> Systems (ERS). The main objective of this work is not to provide accurate price estimations, but to help understanding the main cost drivers of transport electrification and to illustrate how the final system cost is influenced by the different parameters considered. The main conclusion obtained is that, despite the substantial initial investments required for the deployment of <b>electric</b> <b>roads,</b> a system featuring only static charging and vehicles with large size batteries results in a higher total system cost. Moreover, due to the much larger number of light duty vehicles in the fleet, the deployment of an ERS system that can be used by both long-haul and light duty vehicles is substantially more advantageous than a solution restricted only to long-haul vehicles...|$|R

60|$|At {{the same}} time that his <b>electric</b> <b>roads</b> were {{building}} out through the hills, the hay-fields were being surveyed and broken up into city squares, with here and there, according to best modern methods, winding boulevards and strips of park. Broad streets, well graded, were made, with sewers and water-pipes ready laid, and macadamized from his own quarries. Cement sidewalks were also laid, so that all the purchaser had to do was to select his lot and architect and start building. The quick service of Daylight's new <b>electric</b> <b>roads</b> into Oakland made this big district immediately accessible, and long before the ferry system was in operation hundreds of residences were going up.|$|R

5000|$|The {{origins of}} using a go-kart sized vehicle for off road use {{undoubtedly}} had many stages of development and claimants whose homemade vehicles were [...] "the first" [...] off road go-karts.
