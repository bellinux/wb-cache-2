40|$|New Zealand?s {{isolation}} {{makes it}} a natural home to many unique species. One {{of them is the}} now cultivated New Zealand <b>green</b> <b>shell</b> <b>mussel</b> (Perna canaliculus) which is sought after by seafood lovers around the world. This mussel is by far the largest seafood export from New Zealand accounting for about 85 % and exported to 78 countries in 2011. This research was conducted to create a variant of an existing value-added product: lactic-fermented comminuted mussel meat. This product has been named Perna. The existing knowledge relates to a spreadable form of Perna, which is currently undergoing commercial evaluation. This work is mainly about developing a gelled form of Perna using hydrocolloids, specifically carrageenans and gelatine. The proposition was that a gelled, sliceable form of Perna would expand its culinary potential. The spreadable form would be used for crackers and breads, while a slice of Perna could be part of an entr?e in domestic cuisine or food service. However, as the project progressed it became clear that unacceptable variations in pH of Perna were affected by the time the mussels were cooked in boiling water prior to comminution and fermentation. Because of the fundamental importance of this variation in terms of odour/flavour, {{the first part of the}} thesis explores the chemistry of how pH could be better controlled. It was found that the buffering capacity of mussel proteins changed with cooking. Although no explanations were obtained at a biochemical level, the empirical outcome was that cooking live mussels between 7 to 10 minutes would predictably result in a desired final pH of around 4. 5 that yields superior organoleptic properties such as pleasant smell, taste and texture. Moving to gelation as a goal, it was found that kappa and iota carrageenans were incapable of forming useful gels in Perna, the former producing excessive syneresis and latter a soft, spongy product. Experiments with gelatine were initially unsuccessful, inadvertently because of the low gelatine concentrations tested. After a more concentrated gelatine colloidal suspension of about 8 % was incorporated into the mussel mince, a useful gel was finally created, although the texture was crumbly. However, this final success is considered an excellent starting point for sliceable product refinement...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the listericidal efficacies of three marinades used in the production of marinated <b>green</b> <b>shell</b> <b>mussels</b> (Perna canaliculus), decimal reduction times (D values) were determined for a mixture of seven strains of Listeria monocytogenes exposed to marinades in the presence and absence of mussels. With an acetic acid (1. 5 %, wt/vol) marinade, calculated D values in the presence and absence of mussels were 77. 3 and 33. 3 h, respectively. Likewise, for an acetic acid (0. 75 %) -lactic acid (0. 75 %) marinade and an acetic acid (1. 5 %) -Glucono Delta-Lactone (0. 2 %) -based marinade, the D values in the presence and absence of mussels were 125. 5 and 26. 9 h and 86. 3 and 19. 3 h, respectively. Various increases in decimal reduction times in the presence of mussels indicated that there was no simple relationship between the listericidal natures of these marinades and the presence of mussels. This result suggests that difficulties may occur in trying to relate acid inhibition studies carried out in model broth systems to "real food" systems...|$|R

In this study, pulverized <b>green</b> <b>mussel</b> <b>shell,</b> without calcination, was utilized as the desulfurizer in the briquette produced from a mixture of low rank coal and palm kernel shell (PKS), also known as bio-briquette. The ratio ofcoal to PKS in the briquette was 90 : 10 (wt/wt). The influence of <b>green</b> <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> contents and combustion temperature were examined to prove the possible use of that materialas a desulfurizer. The ratio of Ca to S (Ca = calcium content in desulfurizer; S = sulfur content in briquette) werefixed at 1 : 1, 1. 25 : 1, 1. 5 : 1, 1. 75 : 1, and 2 : 1 (mole/mole). The burning (or desulfurization) temperature range was 300 - 500 °C; the reaction time was 720 seconds and the air flow rate was 1. 2 L/min. The results showed that <b>green</b> <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> can be introduced as a desulfurizer in coal briquette or bio-briquette combustions.

40|$|Tracking the {{movement}} of migratory freshwater fish is essential to those invested in rebuilding declining fish populations. Using strontium isotopic signatures to match calcified fish tissues to streams where fish spawn is a useful method of tracking migratory fish where physical tracking methods such as radio, acoustic, or external tags, have proven unsuccessful. In this study, we develop tools to practice this method of tracking fish in Lake Roosevelt and its upstream tributaries in Washington State by analyzing the elemental concentrations and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of water samples, and <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples. 	This study evaluates whether <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> act as an appropriate proxy for water chemistry by comparing the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of water samples to the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> sampled from the same, or nearby, locations. We compare concentrations of Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Pb, Sr, and U {{in the water and}} <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples to determine the feasibility of using <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> as a proxy for water chemistry. If it is determined that the concentrations of these elements in <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> reflect that of the surrounding water composition, the elemental composition of <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> can be compared to that of calcified tissues in fish, such as otoliths, to infer the location of the natal stream. 	We report analyses of water and <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples collected from Lake Roosevelt, Sanpoil River, Spokane River, Colville River, Kettle River, Pend Oreille River, Kootenay River, and Columbia River in Washington State. Each of these rivers is a tributary to Lake Roosevelt, and each flows through different geologic units. We hypothesize that the differences in the rock units of each stream’s watershed are reflected in the elemental concentrations and strontium isotopic ratios of water in each stream and in the lake. We also hypothesize that the composition of the <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> will match the composition of the water samples, therefore allowing us to use the <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> as a proxy for local water chemistry. Additionally, we hypothesize that the composition of the <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> will vary by location, and {{that we will be able}} to then infer where a fish is from by matching the composition of the fish in question to the mussels we have analyzed. 	We found that 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for water and mussel hinge samples collected from tributaries east of Lake Roosevelt are significantly higher than the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for samples collected from tributaries west of Lake Roosevelt with averages of 0. 7235 and 0. 7089, respectively. The average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios for water and mussel hinge samples collected within Lake Roosevelt is 0. 7158, which is between the averages for samples collected east and west of the lake. Generally, older rocks are exposed on the east side of the lake, and younger rocks on the west side of the lake, so our 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values support the hypothesis that geologic units are a primary control on water chemistry, and that tributary compositions mix to form an average weighed by flow in Lake Roosevelt. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for water and <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples collected from the same locations have a strong, positive linear correlation, suggesting that <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios reflect the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the ambient water. With these data, we can distinguish between different streams and the lake, but cannot distinguish between samples from within the same stream or within Lake Roosevelt. 	The Sr:Ca and Fe:Ca ratios of water samples show positive correlations with <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> compositions, with R 2 values of 0. 82 and 0. 52, respectively. Ratios of Mg, Ba, Cu, Cd, Pb, and U to Ca showed little or no positive correlation between water and <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples. The elemental concentration data collected for this study do not demonstrate whether a correlation between elemental ratios in water samples and elemental ratios in <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples collected from the same location exists. Positive Sr:Ca and Fe:Ca correlations for water versus <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples indicate that perhaps for some elements, the composition of <b>mussel</b> <b>shells</b> are representative of the composition of ambient water. Using elemental concentration ratios to complement 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic data may enhance our ability to identify correlations between water and <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> samples, and ultimately between <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> and otolith samples. 	The hinge part of a <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> may be used as a proxy for local water composition because the <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> composition reflects that of the local ambient water. The hinge of the mussel has the same composition as the whole <b>mussel</b> <b>shell.</b> 	We measured variation of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in the water among different streams and Lake Roosevelt. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for samples collected in tributaries east of Lake Roosevelt, which erode older rocks, are higher for <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> and water samples than the average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for <b>mussel</b> <b>shell</b> and water samples collected in tributaries west of Lake Roosevelt, which flow through younger rocks...|$|R

Mussels were exposed to three pH levels (8. 1, 7. 7 and 7. 3) and two temperatures (25 °C and 30 °C) for 14 days. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione (GSH), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were measured in gills and digestive glands after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of exposure. All enzymatic activities were significantly impacted by pH, temperature. Enzymatic activities at the high temperature {{were significantly higher than}} those at the low temperature, and the mussels exposed to pH 7. 3 showed significantly higher activities than those under higher pH condition for all enzymes except ACP. There was no interaction between temperature and pH in two third of the measured activities suggesting similar mode of action for both drivers. Interaction was only consistently significant for GPX. PCA revealed positive relationships between the measured biochemical indicators in both gills and digestive glands.
