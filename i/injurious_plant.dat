Lately, research institutions in Botswana (e.g. The Centre for Scientific Research, Indigenous Knowledge and Innovation hosted by the University of Botswana) and the government (primarily through the Ministry of Infrastructure, Science and Technology) have demonstrated keen interest in unearthing and capturing indigenous technical knowledge of rural communities, as well as developing a policy on indigenous knowledge systems.

Excessive Salivation Excessive salivation, characterized by drooling or frothy saliva around the lips, may be caused by a variety of things including chemical irritants fungal toxins, virus and bacterial diseases affecting the mouth, teeth problems, choking caused by esophageal obstruction, and various toxic or <b>injurious</b> <b>plants.</b> Grazing animals that eat sharp grass awns, spiny plants such as the prickly pear cactus (Opuntia spp.) (Fig. 3 - 1 A), or those with burs such as burdock (Arctium minus) (Fig. 3 - 1 B) and cocklebur (Xanthium spp.) (Fig. 3 - 1 C) may injure the oral mucosa. Some common grasses such as foxtail barley (Fig. 3 - 2 A), bristle grass (Fig. 3 - 2 B) and sandbur (Fig. 3 - 2 C) have seeds with sharp awns that can become embedded in the tongue and gums of animals eating them. Initially excessive salivation may be noticed, but in time the grass awns or spines that are imbedded in the mucosae create large ulcers.

30|$|Cacti {{can survive}} heat {{exposure}} from fire even though often less than 50 % of individuals survive in burned areas (Thomas 1991). These succulents might survive fire due {{to some of}} their adaptations to dry, hot environments. Cacti have a thick, water-storing cortex that buffers the phloem and cambium from rapid heating. It {{has been suggested that}} fires toward the end of a dry season are more <b>injurious</b> since <b>plants</b> are most dehydrated then (Humphrey and Everson 1951). The apical meristem of cacti is well protected from heat due to an infolding of the apex and a covering of hairs and spines. Because of this protection, resumption of growth is common after fire, even if phloem and cambium have been killed and plant mortality is only delayed. The apical meristem is more likely to survive in taller (often older) individuals because the apex is raised above flames and because older plants have thicker cortical tissues (Thomas 1991). As cactus stems age, the tubercles and ribs {{at the base of the}} plant may develop a bark-like layer, increasing protection from heating by fire.|$|R

40|$|Of {{the various}} {{environmental}} stresses that a plant can experience, temperature has the widest and most far-reaching effects on legumes. Temperature extremes, both high (heat stress) and low (cold stress), are <b>injurious</b> to <b>plants</b> at {{all stages of}} development, resulting in severe loss of productivity. In response to unfavorable temperatures, plant biomolecules such as stress proteins, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, organic osmolytes and phytohormones come into play, usually, {{as a part of}} the plant defense mechanisms. The accumulation of these molecules, which may be useful as metabolic indicators of stress tolerance, depend on the plant species exposed to the temperature stress, its intensity and duration. Some of these molecules such as osmolytes, non-enzymatic antioxidants and phytohormones may be supplied exogenously to improve temperature stress tolerance. Legumes show varying degrees of sensitivity to high and low-temperature stresses, which reduces their potential performance at various developmental stages. To address the ever-fluctuating temperature extremes that various legumes are being constantly exposed, efforts are being made to develop tolerant plant varieties via conventional breeding methods as well as more recent molecular breeding techniques. In this review, we describe the progress made towards the adverse effects of abnormal temperatures on various growth stages in legumes and propose appropriate strategies to resolve these effects...|$|R

False yam tubers were harvested, processed into smaller pieces and decomposed for six different weeks (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks). Decomposed false yam tubers from the various treatments were mixed with top soil in the ratio 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 2 : 1 (false yam: sand ratio) with soil as control. Maize seed was used as test crop with germination percentage, plant height, number of leaves, plant girth and leaf area index as growth parameters.

60|$|It {{has already}} been shown {{that there is no}} close {{relation}} between the number of seeds produced by flowers when crossed and self-fertilised, {{and the degree to which}} their offspring are aaffected by the two processes. I have also given reasons for believing that the inefficiency of a plant's own pollen is in most cases an incidental result, or has not been specially acquired for the sake of preventing self-fertilisation. On the other hand, there can hardly be a doubt that dichogamy, which prevails according to Hildebrand in the greater number of species (10/23. 'Die Geschlecter Vertheiling' etc. page 32.),--that the heterostyled condition of certain plants,--and that many mechanical structures--have all been acquired so as both to check self-fertilisation and to favour cross-fertilisation. The means for favouring cross-fertilisation must have been acquired before those which prevent self-fertilisation; as it would manifestly be <b>injurious</b> to a <b>plant</b> that its stigma should fail to receive its own pollen, unless it had already become well adapted for receiving pollen from another individual. It should be observed that many plants still possess a high power of self-fertilisation, although their flowers are excellently constructed for cross-fertilisation--for instance, those of many papilionaceous species.|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} soil {{exchange}} capacity occupied by sodium is usually measured as Soluble Sodium Percentage (SSP). As the SSP goes up, more exchangeable sodium is available, and the greater the potential for negative plant and soil impacts. Water consisting of high percentage of sodium may result in stunting of plants and reduces soil permeability (Joshi et al. 2009). In situations where the SSP in irrigation water is greater than 60  %, there may be occurrence of sodium accumulation in soil, which may induce soil deterioration and low water/oxygen permeability. The mean SSP in water samples was 21.41, 22.95 and 32.1  % in Am, VS, and LD valley types, respectively. According to the classification given by Fipps (2003); Wilcox (1955), 70  % of the water samples fall within excellent to good and 30  % within permissible limit, with respect to usefulness for cropping (Table  2). The amount of mineral contents dissolved in water, expressed as its total dissolved solids (TDS), is important for assessing its suitability for use for various uses (Obiefuna and Sheriff 2011). Excessive concentration or short supply of dissolved solids in agricultural water may be <b>injurious</b> to <b>plants.</b> For example, high TDS may reduce plants’ osmotic activities or prevent adequate soil aeration.

Seasonal variation was least in Am 2 valley with TDS being almost constant throughout the year, ranging from 23.68  mg/l in September to 24.66  mg/l in March. Variability was greatest in LD 1 with values ranging from 24.32  mg/l in the month of September to 399.36  mg/l in the month of May. The CV indicates variable concentrations with values ranging from 0.5 to 1.36 across sites. According to the classification given by Robinove et al.

60|$|I have as yet spoken {{as if the}} {{varieties}} {{of the same species}} were invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it is impossible to resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of species. The evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction. Gartner kept, during several years, a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds growing near each other in his garden; and although these plants have separated sexes, they never naturally crossed. He then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one kind with pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced only five grains. Manipulation in this case could not have been <b>injurious,</b> as the <b>plants</b> have separated sexes. No one, I believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves PERFECTLY fertile; so that even Gartner did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct.|$|R

Introduction: Plants like animals {{seem to be}} more subject to disease and parasitic attack when they appear in large numbers than when found singly, and these attacks seem to increase in proportion to the increase in numbers of the plant grown. For many hundreds of years they were considered to be inevitable that they were uncontrollable as far as the hand of man was concerned. But within the last half century, beginning about the time when Paris green was found to successfully combat the Colorado potato beetle (Doryphora decemlineata Say) in America, and a few years later when a mixture of copper sulfate, milk and water was accidentally found in France to prevent downy mildew on the grape, (Peronspora viticola B. & C.), men began to believe that it might be possible, at least in a measure, to control them. Having come to this supposition they at once began experimenting that they might determine with some degree of definiteness to what extent their theory would hold good. As a result of this movement, they not only arrived at the positive conclusion that many of our most <b>injurious</b> insect and <b>plant</b> diseases may be controlled if properly treated, but also many different spraying mixtures were discovered...|$|R

MacMill. ], crownvetch (Coronilla varia L.), showy partridgepea, (Cassia chamaecrista L.), purple prairieclover (Dalea purpurea Vent.), and spiked liatris [Liatris spicata (L.) Willd. ]. Imazethapyr was less injurious than imazapic and also improved establishment of Canada tickclover [Desmodium canadense (L.) DC. ] and roundhead lespedeza (Lespedeza capitata Michx.). In other studies, imazethapyr and imazapic improved the establishment and dry matter yield of mixtures of Illinois bundleflower and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) when herbicides were applied in late-spring and annual grasses were controlled. In experiments with a seeded mixture of native mid-grasses, legumes, and asters, imazethapyr improved sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendulda (Michx.)

At some places in the eastern and southern parts of India, rice crop of short duration {{is followed by the}} rice crop of long duration. Winter rice crop is raised preferably in low-lying areas that remain flooded mainly during the rainy season. Autumn rice is raised in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Summer, autumn and winter rice crops are raised in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Assam and Orissa. Summer rice crop is raised on a small scale and on a small area. However, winter rice crop is actually the leading rice crop accounting for a major portion of the total Hectare under rice in all seasons in the country. Moreover, in the last few years, several steps in order to augment yield per hectare were taken up very seriously at all levels. Wheat is a rabbi crop in this country. India ranks fourth in the production of wheat in the world. Favorable Geographical Condition for Wheat Cultivation: In India, wheat is a winter crop. Wheat requires a moderate cool climate with moderate rain. In India, it is grown in winter. It needs temperature 10 degree C to 15 degree C for its cultivation. It thrives well in an average temperature of 16-degree C. Warm and sunny weather is essential at the time of ripening. Wheat requires a rainfall of 50 cm to 100 cm during the growing season. Too much rain is <b>injurious</b> to the <b>plant.</b> On irrigated lands, a rainfall of 40 cm to 50 cm is sufficient.Light rainfall and cloudiness before the grain ripens increase the productivity. Alluvial level plains are ideal for wheat cultivation. Slightly rolling plains are also suitable. Plains should be well drained so that water cannot stand there. Wheat requires fertile alluvial soil. Clay loamy soils or even black cotton soils are suitable. Soil should retain moisture. A certain amount of lime in the soil is beneficial. Labor factors are not as important in the wheat cultivation {{as in the case of}} rice. However, labor is essential for the cultivation.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of three years' {{research}} on seed production of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Previous work by other researchers has suggested that a protracted flowering period {{is a major factor}} limiting seed production in this legume. The research programme was begun in 1986 with an investigation of the cause(s) of this protracted flowering period. By carefully examining the growth and flowering behaviour of tagged shoots formed at different times of the year, it was identified that the protracted flowering pattern in this plant is caused by the continuous production of shoots with the capacity to flower. The continuous development of new shoots replacing older flowering shoots was the main cause of the long flowering period. Results of the first year's research also showed that seed yield is primarily determined by the number of inflorescences produced. In turn, inflorescence numbers are primarily dependent on the number of shoots available at the time of flowering. It was suggested by the results that manipulation of the number and branching of shoots should be an important management strategy for improving seed production in this plant. The second stage of the study involved a number of hand removal and cutting treatments designed to investigate the possible effects of shoot removal on plant growth and seed production. Hand removal of crown shoots affected branching behaviour in this plant. Removal of young crown shoots at different growth stages resulted in a range of plant structural forms which influenced seed production potential. Cutting treatments, the major effect of which was to remove a section of shoot from the top, showed no obvious beneficial effects on seed yield in birdsfoot trefoil. In the third stage studies were extended to investigate a more practical situation in which plant growth regulating chemicals (paclobutrazol (PP 333), ethofumesate (Nortron) and fatty alcohols (Fatol Super)) were used to manipulate shoot growth and development. Research at this stage involved both widely spaced individual plants and plants grown in a sward to simulate commercially practised situations. Results showed that PP 333 is a promising pre-peak flowering shoot manipulator which acts by promoting branching. Nearly a 40 % increase in seed yield was consistently obtainedin two years' experiments when this chemical were applied during the time from the pre-bud stage to the early flowering stage. Nortron showed its value in sward situations when applied at early plant development stage. However, Nortron was of limited value when it was used as a post-peak flowering shoot manipulator because of its <b>injurious</b> effect on <b>plant</b> growth and flowering. Fatol Super showed some potential as a post-peak flowering shoot manipulator, particularly when applied to spaced plants, but was less effective in sward situations. This reduces its value for use in the narrow row or sward seed production systems currently practiced in New Zealand for birdsfoot trefoil...|$|R

Não são de se esperar, pois, prejuízos à cultura do milho, causados pelo acúmulo de BHC no solo, quando aquela fôr feita em terreno anteriormente ocupado pela cultura algodoeira, desde que nesta a quantidade empregada do inseticida, não tenho sido muito diferente daquela oficialmente recomendada. Corn is {{frequently}} cultivated on soil previously used for cotton. Cotton plantings usually receive heavy applications of BHC for insect control, what {{might lead to}} an accumulation of the insecticide in the soil. An {{attempt was made to}} verify whether varying amounts of BHC added to a sandy soil in Mitscherlich pots would injury corn plants. The amounts added were calculated on an area basis to correspond to those received by the land at the end of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of cotton cultivation when BHC is applied at the yearly rate of 108 kg per hectare. Other types of soil were not used in this experiment because the toxic effects of this insecticide seem to be more serious on sandy soils. Other techniques employed in this work were exactly the same described in a previous paper (1). The experiment was terminated one month after sowing and the weights of the plant tops and roots were determined. The soil from the pots was passed through a sieve after harvesting, returned to the pots and left undisturbed for one year. Corn was then planted a second time on the same soil. In the first planting, dose 1 had no <b>injurious</b> effect on <b>plant</b> growth, but the heavier doses depressed it severely. In the second planting only doses 4 and 5 showed injurious effects, but injury was less severe than that in the first planting. The results seem to indicate that there is practically no risk that residual BHC in the soil from a previous cotton planting that received standard applications of the insecticide will injury corn plants raised on the same land the following year...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{adoption}} of glyphosate-resistant (GR) corn hybrids {{has led to}} the reemergence of volunteer corn as a problematic weed in soybean and corn and has made controlling the initial stand of corn in a replant situation more difficult. Clethodim and glufosinate are often used to control GR corn in corn replant situations and in soybean. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the response of two hybrid corn varieties and their F 2 progeny to clethodim and glufosinate and to evaluate the effect of plant nitrogen (N) concentration on clethodim and glufosinate efficacy. DeKalb 63 - 42 was more tolerant to clethodim than 60 - 18 and 60 - 18 F 2. No {{differences were found between the}} hybrids and their respective F 2 progeny in the response to clethodim or glufosinate. In a second dose-response study assessing the effect of N conditions on herbicide efficacy, both clethodim and glufosinate were less <b>injurious</b> to <b>plants</b> growing in low N than in high N availability. ^ Earlier corn planting dates results in difficult to control GR corn in a replant situation with herbicides labeled for use in corn. In addition, little is known about the effect that a partial initial corn stand has on replanted corn yields. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to evaluate the herbicide options for control of GR corn in a corn replant situation and to determine the effect of replanted corn into various initial corn stands on grain yield. Clethodim (51 g ai ha− 1) applied 6 days prior to replanting, paraquat (700 g ai ha− 1) plus metribuzin (160 g ai ha− 1) applied at replanting, and glufosinate (450 g ai ha− 1) applied at replanting along with a sequential treatment 3 weeks later provided 96 to 100 % control of the initial corn stands and resulted in the highest yield. A second field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence on grain yield of replanted corn into various initial corn stands. Initial corn stands ≤ 40, 000 plants ha− 1, required a replant with initial stand control to maximize grain yield, while initial stands ≥ 60, 000 plants ha− 1 did not require a replant to maximize yield. The percent yield contribution from an initial stand of 20, 000 plants ha− 1 was 20 % greater than the replant stand indicating a competitive advantage even at the lowest initial corn stand. Due to this competitive advantage an initial stand must be removed to maximize corn yield in a replant situation. ^ Volunteer corn (VC) may interfere with hybrid corn for nitrogen (N), reducing grain yield and the interference may be influenced by N management. Field experiments were established to determine the effects that N fertilizer management and VC interference have on hybrid corn growth and grain yield. Treatments consisted of three VC densities, a control (0 plants m− 2), a low density (1 plant m− 2), a high density (4 plants m− 2), and six N fertilizer treatments (0 kg N ha− 1, 67 kg N ha− 1 at planting, 67 kg N ha− 1 at planting + 133 kg N ha− 1 at V 5 corn growth stage, 67 kg N ha− 1 at planting + 133 kg N ha− 1 at V 10 corn growth stage, 200 kg N ha − 1 at V 5 corn growth stage, and 200 kg N ha− 1 at V 10 corn growth stage). When 200 kg N ha− 1 was applied, regardless of application timing, hybrid corn dry weight, hybrid corn N accumulation, and hybrid corn grain yield were reduced by the high VC density. However, when VC grain yield was added to hybrid corn grain yield VC density did not affect total grain yield. When 0 and 67 kg N ha− 1 were applied, neither hybrid dry weight or hybrid N accumulation were affected by either VC density, but hybrid corn grain yield and total grain yield were both reduced by the high VC density. N fertilizer application timing had no effect on hybrid corn dry weight, N accumulation, or grain yield. Late N fertilizer applications (200 kg N ha− 1 at V 10 and 67 kg N ha − 1 at planting + 133 kg N ha− 1 at V 10) resulted in greater VC N accumulation, VC grain yield, and total yield. However, the potential problems associated with VC should result in management practices to reduce the presence of VC in corn. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{symptoms}} of crown infection of corn caused by Diplodia zeae include: a dark straw-brown discoloration of the tissues {{of the crown}} and lower internodes; prevalence of subepidermal pycnidia on the crown and around the aerial adventitious roots; disintegration and shredding of the internal tissue of the crown; intense brown discoloration of the nodal plates, and a dark brown decay of the mesocotyl which results {{in the loss of}} the primary root system. Crown infection occurred on 14 to 52 percent of the field corn in central Iowa in the years from 1930 to 1933. Practically every corn plant grown from Diplodia-infected seed may show crown infection at maturity. Infected seedlings which, by means of timely establishment of adventitious roots, do not die may be parasitized during the remainder of the growing season. The symptoms on plants grown from disease-free seed in Diplodia-infested soil are identical with those derived from infected seed. The pathogene grows through the soil to the mesocotyl where it becomes established in the wounds created by the emerging seminal roots. The crown may be invaded directly from the soil at the point of emergence of an adventitious root but the crown is usually invaded from the decayed mesocotyl. The pathogene progresses up the mesocotyl from this primary lesion and becomes established on the crown. The mycelium spreads internally to a limited extent during the growing season and rapidly involves the entire crown and lower nodes at maturity. Although Diplodia zeae spreads from the mesocotyl upward for several nodes, it is not systemic in the plant. Under field conditions it is generally restricted to the first internode above the roots. Crown infection has been induced by infesting steamed soil with infected crowns and stalks of plants which had over-wintered under field conditions. Diplodia zeae may live in a soil devoid of plant refuse but its development is hampered in mixed culture. The presence of the pathogene in ordinary soil from a corn field has been demonstrated by growing plants from disease-free seed in such soil collected in the spring. Invasion of the crown from infested soil is most severe at high soil moisture contents, but the development of the infected plants is severely reduced at either high or low moisture contents. The dry weight of plants growing at optimum soil moisture content was not reduced by crown infection. The dry weight of roots is reduced more than that of the tops of plants grown in infested soil. The dry weight of the tops, however, is significantly less than that of non-infected plants grown under soil moisture conditions approaching the maximum or minimum for growth. A light infection of a plant growing at low soil moisture may be almost as <b>injurious</b> to the <b>plant</b> as a severe infection where there is an abundant supply of water. The transpiration ratio of infected plants is increased at soil moisture contents favorable to reduction in dry weight. Plants grown from Diplodia-infected seed treated with a mercury dust had a higher percentage of crown infection than similar plants from untreated seed. Treatment of disease-free seed with the same dust decreased the amount of crown infection of plants growing under field conditions. The dust apparently inhibited the fungus without killing it in the seed. Plants protected in this fashion later suffer crown infection. The extent of crown invasion under given conditions depends upon the time of initial infection. Seed treatment of disease-free seed may delay mesocotyl invasion from infested soil and thereby decrease crown infection. Selfed lines of corn have different reactions to crown infection by Diplodia zeae under field conditions and furnish some remarkably resistant lines for genetical studies. Late crown infection is a significant phase of the parasitism of Diplodia zeae on corn. The pathogene may reduce the dry weight of the plant to half that of a normal plant under certain soil moisture conditions. Under the most favorable field conditions there is a reduction in yield...|$|R
