40|$|A more {{rigorous}} and nuanced understanding of land-use change (LUC) {{as a driver}} of emerging <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> (EID) is required. Here we examine post hunter-gatherer LUC as a driver of <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> in one biogeographical region with a compressed and documented history—continental Australia. We do this by examining land-use and native vegetation change (LUCC) associations with <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> emergence identified through a systematic (1973 – 2010) and historical (1788 – 1973) review of <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> literature of humans and animals. We find that 22 % (20) of the systematically reviewed EIDs are associated with LUCC, most frequently where natural landscapes have been removed or replaced with agriculture, plantations, livestock or urban development. Historical clustering of vector-borne, zoonotic and environmental disease emergence also follows major periods of extensive land clearing. These advanced stages of LUCC are accompanied by changes in the distribution and density of hosts and vectors, at varying scales and chronology. This review of <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> emergence in one continent provides valuable insight into the association between accelerated global LUC and concurrent accelerated <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> emergence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} for the Avian Flu (H 5 N 1) virus to become a pandemic disease has mandated an examination of public health surveillance, response and containment strategies for developing countries. We have developed a Multi Agent System Simulation system known as IDESS (<b>Infectious</b> <b>Disease</b> Epidemic Simulation System) that rapidly constructs <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> models from existing data for any geographical region. This approach addresses an important area of <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> outbreak management, as it allows public health professionals to rapidly construct a simulation model for any geographic region and observe how an <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> spreads between communities. Such simulations will facilitate testing of containment strategies for rapid response. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases,</b> and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E

But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir proteome, bacteriophage, or chromatographic profile. Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E
