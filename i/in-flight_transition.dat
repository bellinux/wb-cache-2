40|$|The Pegasus wing-glove flight {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} provide crossflow transition data at high Mach numbers, specifically to help validate stability based predictions for transition onset in a flight environment. This paper provides {{an analysis of the}} flight experiment, with emphasis on computational results for crossflow disturbances and the correlation of disturbance growth factors with <b>in-flight</b> <b>transition</b> locations via the e(sup N) method. Implications of the flight data for attachment line stability are also examined. Analysis of the thermocouple data reveals that transition (from turbulent to laminar flow) was first detected during the ascending flight of the rocket when the free stream Mach number exceeded about 4. Therefore, computations have been performed for flight Mach numbers of 4. 13, 4. 35, 4. 56 and 4. 99. Due to continually decreasing unit Reynolds number at higher altitudes, the entire wing-glove boundary layer became laminar at the highest flight Mach number computed above. In contrast, the boundary layer flow over the inboard tile region remained transitional up to and somewhat beyond the time of laminarization over the instrumented glove region. Linear stability predictions confirmed that the tile boundary layer is indeed more unstable to crossflow disturbances than the much colder stainless steel glove boundary layer. The transition locations based on thermocouple data from both the glove and the tile regions are found to correlate with stationary-crossflow N-factors within the range of 7 to 12. 4 and with traveling mode N-factors between 7. 6 and 14. 1. Data from the thermocouples and hot film sensors indicates that transition from turbulent to laminar flow (i. e., laminarization) at a fixed point over the glove is generally completed within a flight time interval of 3 seconds. However, the times at which transition begins and ends as inferred from the hot film sensors are found to differ by about 2 seconds from the corresponding estimates based on the thermocouple data...|$|E
40|$|The HIFiRE- 1 flight {{experiment}} {{provided a}} valuable database pertaining to boundary layer transition over a 7 -degree half-angle, circular cone model from supersonic to hypersonic Mach numbers, {{and a range}} of Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. This paper reports selected findings from the ongoing computational analysis of the measured <b>in-flight</b> <b>transition</b> behavior. Transition during the ascent phase at nearly zero degree angle of attack is dominated by second mode instabilities except {{in the vicinity of the}} cone meridian where a roughness element was placed midway along the length of the cone. The growth of first mode instabilities is found to be weak at all trajectory points analyzed from the ascent phase. For times less than approximately 18. 5 seconds into the flight, the peak amplification ratio for second mode disturbances is sufficiently small because of the lower Mach numbers at earlier times, so that the transition behavior inferred from the measurements is attributed to an unknown physical mechanism, potentially related to step discontinuities in surface height near the locations of a change in the surface material. Based on the time histories of temperature and/or heat flux at transducer locations within the aft portion of the cone, the onset of transition correlated with a linear N-factor, based on parabolized stability equations, of approximately 13. 5. Due to the large angles of attack during the re-entry phase, crossflow instability may play a significant role in transition. Computations also indicate the presence of pronounced crossflow separation over a significant portion of the trajectory segment that is relevant to transition analysis. The transition behavior during this re-entry segment of HIFiRE- 1 flight shares some common features with the predicted transition front along the elliptic cone shaped HIFiRE- 5 flight article, which was designed to provide hypersonic transition data for a fully 3 D geometric configuration. To compare and contrast the crossflow dominated transition over the HIFiRE- 1 and HIFiRE- 5 configurations, this paper also analyzes boundary layer instabilities over a subscale model of the HIFiRE- 5 flight configuration that was tested in the Mach 6 quiet tunnel facility at Purdue University...|$|E
40|$|Computer graphic {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} the processing of Shuttle Orbiter flight data {{in order to create}} a visual presentation of the extent and movement of the boundary-layer transition front over the orbiter lower surface during entry. Flight-measured surface temperature-time histories define the onset and completion of the boundary-layer transition process at any measurement location. The locus of points which define the spatial position of the boundary-layer transition front on the orbiter planform is plotted at each discrete time for which flight data are available. Displaying these images sequentially in real-time results in an animated simulation of the <b>in-flight</b> boundary-layer <b>transition</b> process...|$|R
50|$|On November 12, 2013, an LRASM {{scored a}} direct hit on a moving naval target on its second flight test. A B-1B bomber {{launched}} the missile, which navigated using planned waypoints that it received <b>in-flight</b> before <b>transitioning</b> to autonomous guidance. It used onboard sensors to select the target, descend in altitude, and successfully impact. On 4 February 2015, the LRASM conducted its third successful flight test, conducted to evaluate low-altitude performance and obstacle avoidance. Dropped from a B-1B, the missile navigated a series of planned waypoints, then detected, tracked, and avoided an object deliberately placed in the flight pattern in the final portion of the flight to demonstrate obstacle-avoidance algorithms.|$|R
40|$|Correlation of <b>in-flight</b> boundary-layer <b>transition</b> {{experiments}} with linear boundary-layer stability theory contributes {{both to the}} validation of the numerical methods {{as well as the}} analysis of the measured transition process. Transition results obtained in a recent flight experiment, in which the extent of laminar flow and the transition process on the wing of a business-jet fitted with an instrumented glove section were determined, are analyzed. The experiment was conducted at freestream Mach numbers from 0. 55 to 0. 82, chord Reynolds numbers from 10 to 20 x 10 to the 6 th, and leading-edge sweep angles 17 deg to 20 deg. The growth of both Tollmien-Schlichting and crossflow instabilities are predicted using the e exp n method for several flight conditions and the calculated n-factors at transition onset are correlated. Comparison of the measured dominant boundary-layer disturbance frequencies and the predicted unstable frequencies shows fair agreement for several of the flight conditions studied...|$|R
40|$|The Hypersonic International Flight Research and Experimentation (HIFiRE) 5 flight {{experiment}} by Air Force Research Laboratories and Australian Defense Science and Technology Organization {{is designed}} to provide <b>in-flight</b> boundary-layer <b>transition</b> data for a canonical 3 D configuration at hypersonic Mach numbers. This paper outlines the progress, to date, on boundary layer stability analysis for the HIFiRE- 5 flight configuration, as well as for selected test conditions from the wind tunnel experiments supporting the flight test. At flow conditions corresponding {{to the end of the}} test window, rather large values of linear amplification factor are predicted for both second mode (N> 40) and crossflow (N> 20) instabilities, strongly supporting the feasibility of first in-flight measurements of natural transition on a fully three-dimensional hypersonic configuration. Additional results highlight the rich mixture of instability mechanisms relevant to a large segment of the flight trajectory, as well as the effects of angle of attack and yaw angle on the predicted transition fronts for ground facility experiments at Mach 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolated}} roughness induced transition {{process in}} hypersonic flow is studied. The {{structure of the}} flow around and downstream of an inducer has been examined. Infra-red measurements as well as oil and sublimation techniques {{have been used for}} characterizing flow structures. A hypersonic isolated roughness induced <b>transition</b> <b>in-flight</b> experiment has been developed based on experiments and numerical computations. This experiment has been developed in the frame of the European EXPERT program, which has been developed to carry multiple flight experiments aimed at improving the understanding of critical aerothermodynamic phenomena. The design of this experiment consists in the choice of the isolated roughness element and the in-flight instrumentation. The choice of the roughness shape and dimensions has been made experimentally in a Mach- 6 facility and are based respectively on aerodynamic considerations and on wind-tunnel validated transition criteria. Thermal computations have been performed for the verification of the roughness design and of the ability of the instrumentation to detect transition...|$|R
40|$|Laminar {{turbulent}} {{transition is}} {{known for a long}} time as a critical phenomenon influencing the thermal load encountered by hypersonic vehicle during their planetary re-entry trajectory. Despite the efforts made by several research laboratories all over the world, the prediction of transition remains inaccurate, leading to oversized thermal protection system and dramatic limitations of hypersonic vehicles performances. One of the reasons explaining the difficulties encountered in predicting transition is the wide variety of parameters playing a role in the phenomenon. Among these parameters, surface roughness is known to play a major role and has been investigated in the present thesis. A wide bibliographic review describing the main parameters affecting transition and their coupling is proposed. The most popular roughness-induced transition predictions correlations are presented, insisting on the lack of physics included in these methods and the difficulties encountered in performing ground hypersonic transition experiments representative of real flight characteristics. This bibliographic review shows the importance of a better understanding of the physical phenomenon and of a wider experimental database, including real flight data, for the development of accurate prediction methods. Based on the above conclusions, a hypersonic experimental test campaign is realized for the characterization of the flow field structure in the vicinity and in the wake of 3 D roughness elements. This fundamental flat plate study is associated with numerical simulations for supporting the interpretation of experimental results and thus a better understanding of transition physics. Finally, a model is proposed in agreement with the wind tunnel observations and the bibliographic survey. The second principal axis of the present study is the development of a hypersonic <b>in-flight</b> roughness-induced <b>transition</b> experiment in the frame of the European EXPERT program. These flight data, together with various wind tunnel measurements are very important for the development of a wide experimental database supporting the elaboration of future transition prediction methods.
