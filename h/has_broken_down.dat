Together, he and Mr. Will drive out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull {{up in front of the}} church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} filmed from 31 August to 1 September 2009 in various {{locations}} in Los Angeles, directed by Bryan Barber. The clip starts with Alexandra {{dressed in a}} one-piece black leather suit, as her car <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> in a bad part of town. It then cuts to Flo Rida who sings the opening lines of the song. Next, Burke performs various dance moves in deserted streets while being followed by several men. The video then shows Alexandra entering a bar in a mirrored silver dress, which {{has been compared to}} Janet Jackson around the janet. era, where she is mobbed by more of these men. She then performs more dance routines, before a fight ensues between the men in the bar over Alexandra and Flo Rida performs his part in the song. During his rap, there are scenes where Alexandra backflips off a bar table, and pushes two men powerfully over a bar and through a door. The video then shows Alexandra dancing with more men in a deserted parking lot.|$|E

25|$|Using {{sunscreen}} {{and avoiding}} UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may {{be tested for}} spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, {{and whether or not}} the overlying skin <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
25|$|The artist <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> {{the picture}} plane into facets, {{presenting}} multiple {{aspects of the}} subject simultaneously. This concept first pronounced by Metzinger in 1910—since considered a founding principle of Cubism—would soon {{find its way into}} the foundations of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; the fact that a complete description of one and the same subject may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. The painting was owned by the poet Joseph Houot (known as Jacques Nayral). It was presumably bought by a Danish collector in 1918. The painting was subsequently sold at auction through art dealer Kai Grunth hos Winkel & Magnussen, auction no. 108, February 19, 1932, lot no. 119. Purchased by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. After his death Woman with Horse was sold by his widow Margrethe Bohr (through Ernest Bohr) to the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen. It is now in the Royal Collection of Paintings and Sculpture at the museum.|$|E

25|$|After Charlie {{suffers a}} stroke, Kat stays {{with him for}} a number of months, until Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) calls Alfie, who is with Kat, asking him to return as Kat's {{relative}} Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) has gone through many troubles involving Michael. Kat returns with Alfie and comforts Jean, who <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down.</b> She confronts Michael about it, but he continues with his lies, saying that Jean has been stealing things. However, Kat is not fooled and says she will rip him apart when she finds out the truth. She continues to harass Michael and his fiancée, Janine (Charlie Brooks), until the police get involved and caution Kat and Jean. Alfie informs Kat that he has taken a loan from Eddie Moon (David Essex) but Kat later learns that Eddie is in financial difficulties and so could not have lent them money. Kat is introduced to Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) who reveals that Roxy and Alfie grew very close while she was away. Kat confronts Roxy who admits she had a crush on Alfie and confesses to giving Alfie the loan. Kat sacks her from her job as a result.|$|E
500|$|While dodging {{detection}} {{from war}} machines in a ruined city, the protagonist enters a {{building with a}} dome on the roof to search for usable supplies. Once inside the dome, he meets Yumemi, who offers to show him a special commemorative projection especially reserved for the 2,500,000th customer, although he {{is in fact the}} 2,497,290th customer. Despite his aggravation with her, he agrees to attend her show. However, the projector device, [...] "Miss Jena", <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> and is in need of repair. After he repairs it, Yumemi starts the show, presenting a projection of the starry sky, something that cannot be seen from the surface because of the polluted skies. The power goes out {{in the midst of the}} show, but Yumemi proceeds through the rest of the event with no visuals at the request of the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the American black duck and the mallard were formerly separated by habitat preference, with the American black duck's dark plumage giving it a selective advantage in shaded forest pools in eastern North America, and the mallard's lighter plumage giving it an advantage in the brighter, more open prairie and plains lakes. According to this view, recent deforestation {{in the east and}} tree planting on the plains <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> this habitat separation, leading to the high levels of hybridization now observed. However, rates of past hybridization are unknown in this and most other avian hybrid zones, and it is merely presumed {{in the case of the}} American black duck that past hybridization rates were lower than those seen today. Also, many avian hybrid zones are known to be stable and longstanding despite the occurrence of extensive interbreeding. The American black duck and the local mallard are now very hard to distinguish by means of microsatellite comparisons, even if many specimens are sampled. Contrary to this study's claims, the question of whether the American haplotype is an original mallard lineage is far from resolved. Their statement, [...] "Northern black ducks are now no more distinct from mallards than their southern conspecifics" [...] only holds true in regard to the molecular markers tested. As birds indistinguishable according to the set of microsatellite markers still can look different, there are other genetic differences that were simply not tested in the study.|$|E

500|$|Quatermass (John Mills), {{now living}} in {{retirement}} in Scotland, travels to London {{in search of his}} granddaughter, Hettie Carlson (Rebecca Saire), who has gone missing. He is shocked by the scale of the urban collapse that has struck the city – law and order <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> and marauding gangs terrorise the litter-strewn, decaying streets. Appearing as a guest on a television programme covering the [...] "Hands in Space" [...] project, a joint space mission between the United States and Russia, Quatermass is horrified when the two spacecraft are destroyed by some unknown force. Astronomer Joe Kapp (Simon MacCorkindale), another guest on the programme, invites Quatermass to join him at his home in the country where he has constructed a radio telescope. At the radio telescope, Kapp's colleagues report that they detected a powerful signal at the exact time of the incident in space. Quatermass is intrigued by the behaviour of a group of hippie-like youngsters known as the Planet People, who are travelling to various neolithic sites from where they believe they will be transported to a better life on another planet. Quatermass suspects Hettie has joined them. Along with Kapp's wife, Claire (Barbara Kellerman), Quatermass and Kapp follow a group of Planet People to a stone circle of megaliths, Ringstone Round. As they watch, the Planet People assembled inside the circle are bathed in a bright light and disappear, leaving only a residue of white dust.|$|E

It is a bleak future where law and order <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> in at least some parts of the city, and social {{interaction}} is limited by the automation of many shops and services. Composer Jerome has been estranged from his wife Corinna (a bank manager) for four years. Their 13-year-old daughter, Geain (pronounced Jane) lives with her mother.

2500|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{is considered}} to be an auto-immune and neurodegenerative disorder in which the immune system attacks the myelin that protects and electrically insulates the neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Normally, a person's nervous system would be inaccessible to the white blood cells due to the blood–brain barrier. However, magnetic resonance imaging has shown that when a person is undergoing an MS [...] "attack," [...] the blood–brain barrier <b>has</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> in a section of the brain or spinal cord, allowing white blood cells called T lymphocytes to cross over and attack the myelin. It has sometimes been suggested that, rather than being a disease of the immune system, MS is a disease of the blood–brain barrier. The weakening of the blood–brain barrier may be a result of a disturbance in the endothelial cells {{on the inside of the}} blood vessel, due to which the production of the protein P-glycoprotein is not working well.|$|E
