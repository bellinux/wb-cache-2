5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> opening {{profiles in}} transparent polymer test specimens were determined. The load required to separate crack faces was measured along the crack profile at various positions through the specimens thickness.

The <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> opening load was correlated with <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> retardation behavior caused by peak overloads, and the results {{discussed in terms of}} three dimensional aspects of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> closure mechanism for <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> retardation...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the small}} time scale method, the {{influence}} of grain boundary on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth of 7050 -T 7451 has been investigated. The interaction between <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> and grain boundary was investigated by in situ SEM testing. Results showed that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth will be retarded by grain boundary when the angle between <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> and grain boundary is greater than 90 degrees. Mechanism analysis showed that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> tip {{would not be able}} to open until the loading reached the 55 % of maximum load, and the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> had been closed completely before the loading was not reduced to the minimum value, which led to the crack growth retardation. When the 7050 -T 7451 aluminum alloy suffered from fatigue loading with constant amplitude, a behavior of unstable <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth could be observed often, and results indicated that the bridge linked mechanism led to the behavior. The grain boundary was prone to fracture during fatigue loading, and it became the best path for the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> tip would be connected with fractured grain boundary eventually, which led to the fast crack growth in different loading stage...|$|R
25|$|The {{airworthiness}} {{design requirements}} {{applicable to the}} Vickers Viscount and other safe-life transport category aeroplanes did not require retirement lives to be determined taking account of an unpredictable gross defect of the kind inflicted on the wing spar of VH-RMQ by insertion of the flared bush.

This was found to offer too little strength and was replaced with one fixed to the fuselage behind the seat {{as part of a}} 1987 Airworthiness Directive (AD). In spite of being designed specifically to avoid fatigue issues, the series has been subject to a number of ADs due to <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking,</b> both in the main wing and the elevator.|$|E
25|$|A pair of roof-mounted Turbomeca Turmo {{turboshaft}} engines {{power the}} Puma's four-blade main rotor. The helicopter's rotors are driven {{at a speed}} of roughly 265 rpm via a five reduction stage transmission. The design of the transmission featured several unique and uncommon innovations for the time, such as single-part manufacturing of the rotor shaft and the anti-vibration measures integrated into the main gearbox and main rotor blades. The Puma also featured an automatic blade inspection system, which guarded against and alerted crews to <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> in the rotor blades. There are two hydraulic systems on board, these operate entirely independent of one another, one system powers only the aircraft's flight controls while the other serves the autopilot, undercarriage, rotor brake, and the flight controls.|$|E
40|$|Stress {{intensity}} factor range, Delta K, {{has been shown}} to correlate well with <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate, da/dN. A number of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth theories have been developed for such correlations. Often, conjectory theories of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth are constructed from experimental data. On the other hand, <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth theories can also be derived rigorously with deductive logic. Four such deductive theories are reviewed: (1) that for the growth of a small crack in a very wide homogeneous plate, (2) the theory of similitude for the correlation of da/dN with Delta K, (3) a theory of crack growth in homogeneous materials in small-scale yielding, and (4) the unzipping theory of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth. This paper synthesizes these four theories into a logic framework useful for <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth analysis. The deductive theories and the conjectory theories complement each other in the advances of the understanding of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth. The applications of logic framework to formulating an overview of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth behavior and to defining the complex issues of the growth of small cracks and crack growth in composites are illustrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{controlled}} overaging on <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation (Stage II) in 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy was experimentally investigated. Overaging {{was performed by}} subjecting the material from initial T 3 state to appropriate aging conditions. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth experiments were conducted to assess the influence of artificial aging on <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth resistance. The experimental results showed that overaging enhances the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation behavior at intermediate Δ? values compared to the T 3 state and <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth resistance was found to increase with the magnitude of overaging temperature. The reduction of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate in the overaged alloy compared to T 3 material was associated with crack closure phenomena caused by cyclic plasticity and modification of strain hardening characteristics at the crack path...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{evaluation}} of specimen thickness effect of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth {{life by the}} simulation of probabilistic <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth is presented. In this paper, the material resistance to <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth is treated as a spatial stochastic process, which varies randomly on the crack surface. Using the previous experimental data, the non-Gaussian (eventually Weibull, in this report) random fields simulation method is applied. This method is useful to estimate the probability distribution of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth life and the variability due to specimen thickness by simulating material resistance to <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth along a crack path...|$|R

This level of loss {{focused attention on}} the safety aspects of {{bulk carriers}}, {{and a great deal}} was learned.

500|$|It {{was learned}} {{that if the}} {{forklift}} were incorrectly positioned the engine/pylon assembly would not be stable as it was being handled, causing it to rock like a see-saw and jam the pylon against the wing's attachment points. The forklift operator was guided only by hand and voice signals, {{as he or she}} could not directly see the juncture between pylon and wing. [...] Positioning had to be extremely accurate or structural damage could result. Compounding the problem, maintenance work on N110AA did not go smoothly. The mechanics started to disconnect the engine and pylon, but there was a shift change halfway through the job. When work was resumed, the pylon was jammed on the wing and the forklift had to be re-positioned, resulting in unseen structural damage to the wing's pylon attachment points. The structural damage was not enough to cause an immediate failure. However, <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> developed, and worsened with each takeoff and landing cycle during the eight weeks that followed the maintenance on N110AA. [...] Finally, the damaged rear pylon mount reached its breaking point and failed. Due to the absence of this attachment, the engine, at full takeoff power, swung itself and the pylon upward on the latter's still-attached forward mount. The structure surrounding the forward pylon mount failed from the resulting stresses, and the engine/pylon assembly broke free of the wing.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 December 2010, the ATSB {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} report which contained a key finding of a manufacturing flaw: An area of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> was found within a stub pipe that feeds oil to the engine HP/IP bearing structure. Bearing lubricating oil leaked from the crack, causing the subsequent engine fire and failure of the IPT disc. The fatigue fracture {{was a result of}} the misalignment of the stub pipe during the counter-boring process. That inaccurate alignment resulted in one side of the same stub pipe becoming too thin to resist fatigue fracturing. This [...] "could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue crack initiation and growth, oil leakage and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire," [...] according to the agency.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> {{growth in}} fiber {{composites}} occurs by such complex modes as to frustrate efforts at developing comprehensive theories and models.

40|$|Abstract. The multi-pass welding generates {{residual}} stress which may change <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate and impair {{the lifetime of}} nuclear welded structures. In this paper, we performed fatigue test with notched specimens and evaluate the effect of {{residual stress}} on <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate of welds. In order to identify the magnitude of residual stress, the residual stress was measured by HDM (hole drilling method) and residual stress analysis was performed by using FEM (finite element method). In order to review the effect of residual stress on <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth analysis was also performed to determine the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth curves by using FEM and ASME B&PV Code, Sec.

2500|$|On 31 December 1968 a Vickers Viscount {{aircraft}} {{departed from}} Perth, Western Australia {{for a flight}} of 724 nautical miles (1341km) to Port Hedland. [...] The aircraft crashed 28 nautical miles (52km) short of its destination {{with the loss of}} all twenty-six people on board. More than half of the right wing, from outboard of the inner engine to the wingtip, including the outer engine and its propeller, broke away {{from the rest of the}} aircraft in flight and struck the ground a significant distance from the main wreckage. Investigation by the Australian Department of Civil Aviation and British Aircraft Corporation concluded that a mysterious action during maintenance led to extensive <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> in the right wing spar.

2500|$|On August 13, 1994, C-130A N135FF, c/n 3148, {{delivered}} as USAF 56-0540, in December 1957, {{call sign}} Tanker 82, crashed near Pearblossom, California while fighting {{a fire in}} the San Gabriel Mountains. Eyewitnesses reported seeing an explosion followed by the separation of the right wing at the wing attach point. Due to the extremely rugged terrain, the NTSB recovered {{only a small portion of}} the wreckage, and its preliminary conclusion that an explosion caused by a fuel leak led to the wing separation was based largely on eyewitness statements. A subsequent independent investigation in 1997 led by Douglas Herlihy, a former NTSB investigator, reexamined the site and the wreckage, and found no evidence of an explosion, but rather found evidence of structural failure due to fatigue stress. The NTSB subsequently reexamined its findings, and found evidence of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> [...] "consistent with overstress separation", and ultimately revised their findings. The initial eyewitness reports of an explosion are not inconsistent with a fatigue-caused wing separation. Similar eyewitness reports were given in the 2002 crash, and an analysis of a video of that crash showed the initiation of a fireball 0.9 seconds after the wing separated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking,</b> {{also called}} {{crocodile}} cracking or alligator cracking, {{is a common}} type of distress in asphalt pavement. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> is characterized by interconnecting or interlaced cracking in the asphalt layer resembling the hide of a crocodile. Cell sizes can vary in size up to 11.80 in across, but are typically less than 5.90 in across. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> is generally a loading failure, but numerous factors can contribute to it. It is often a sign of sub-base failure, poor drainage, or repeated over-loadings. It is important to prevent <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking,</b> and repair as soon as possible, as advanced cases can be very costly to repair {{and can lead to}} formation of potholes or premature pavement failure.|$|E

5000|$|Preventing <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> can be {{as simple}} as {{preventing}} the common causes.

50|$|A good {{strategy}} to prevent overloading, {{which is a}} main cause of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking,</b> {{is to increase the}} depth of the asphalt layer. According to certain researchers, pavements that exceed a certain minimum strength or thickness can hypothetically handle infinitely many loads without showing structural defects, including <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking.</b> These pavements are called perpetual pavements or long-term performance pavements (LTPP).|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} overaging {{process is}} proposed to increase region II <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation resistance of 2024 -T 3 aluminium alloy. Overaging {{was achieved by}} subjecting the material from the initial T 3 state to heat treatment at specific aging temperatures resulting in substantial reduction in hardness. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth tests were subsequently performed in the intermediate region to assess the influence of aging treatment on <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation rate. The experimental results showed that overaging at high temperatures enhances the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth resistance of the material with regard to initial T 3 state. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rates were found to decrease with increasing overaging temperature.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In case {{of marine}} structures, <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> may {{initiate}} and propagate due to repeated wave exciting pressure. Propagation of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> causes not only instantaneous fracture but also loss of serviceability {{such as the}} oil and/or water tightness of a compartment. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> could be detected by periodic inspections, but it is sometimes {{difficult to find a}} crack due to bad accessibility or visibility. In order to manage the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation, it is desirable to develop design method that renders cracks detectable and non-hazardous even though they may initiate. Such a design concept is studied by analyses and experiments in the present paper. A simulation system is also used as a tool to obtain the paths and growth-behavior of a <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack.</b> This system may also be used to determine the timing of repair of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> found during in-service inspection...|$|R

The engineering significance of mode I-mode II <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth is considered in view of the present results. A <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth equation for handling mode I-mode II <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rates from existing mode I data is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Stripping or {{raveling}} {{is another}} possible cause of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking.</b> Stripping occurs when poor adhesion between asphalt and aggregate allows the aggregate {{at the surface}} to dislodge. If left uncorrected, this reduces {{the thickness of the}} pavement, reducing the affected portion's ability to carry its designed loading. This can cause <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> to develop rapidly, as overloading will happen with loads of less magnitude or frequency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> is an asphalt {{pavement}} distress most often instigated by {{failure of the}} surface due to traffic loading. However, <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> can be greatly influenced by environmental and other effects while traffic loading remains the direct cause. Frequently, overloading happens because the base or subbase inadequately support the surface layer and subsequently cannot handle loads that it would normally endure. There are many ways that the subbase or base can be weakened.|$|E
50|$|Also, the {{fuselage}} failure initiated {{in the lap}} joint along S-10L; the failure mechanism {{was a result of}} multiple site <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> of the skin adjacent to rivet holes along the lap joint upper rivet row and tear strap disbond which negated the fail-safe characteristics of {{the fuselage}}. Finally, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> initiated from the knife edge associated with the countersunk lap joint rivet holes; the knife edge concentrated stresses that were transferred through the rivets because of lap joint disbonding.|$|E
