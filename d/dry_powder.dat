5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal shavings, {{titanium}} metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> agents must be used instead.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with {{air and water}} and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires. Some Class D <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{new type}} of {{multipurpose}} <b>dry</b> <b>powders</b> (MP <b>dry</b> <b>powders)</b> with melamine phosphate as extinguishing component was prepared by using the ball-milling method. The main physical properties of MP <b>dry</b> <b>powders</b> were tested, and the extinguishing experiments including wood crib fire tests and pool fire tests were conducted to study the extinguishing properties of MP <b>dry</b> <b>powders</b> comparing with commercial ordinary ammonium phosphate <b>dry</b> <b>powders.</b> The thermal decomposition properties of melamine phosphate were studied through thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The {{results show that the}} bulk density of MP <b>dry</b> <b>powders</b> is lower than the required value, and the other main physical properties accord with the demands of Chinese Standards. MP <b>dry</b> <b>powders</b> have higher extinguishing effectiveness on wood crib fire tests and pool fire tests than that of commercial ordinary ammonium phosphate <b>dry</b> <b>powders.</b> Finally, the extinguishing mechanisms were discussed on the base of thermal decomposition properties of melamine phosphate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{anti-inflammatory}} and antiallodynic {{effects of}} spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> starting from leaves, stems, roots, {{the mixture of}} leaves and stems, {{as well as the}} whole plant aqueous solutions of Phyllanthus niruri L., Phyllanthaceae, were assessed. Gallic acid, used as chemical marker, was quantified by HPLC in the spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders.</b> Carrageenan-induced inflammatory and allodynic responses in the mouse paw were used as pharmacological models. Quantitative and qualitative differences among chemical composition of different herb parts were observed. The oral administration of leaves or leaves plus stems spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced allodynic effect (42 ± 5 and 54 ± 3 %, respectively). Additionally, the spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> of leaves significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema (35 ± 6 %). The spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> of roots, stems, or the mixture of leaves, stems and roots (100 mg/kg, p. o.) did not exhibit antiallodynic or antioedematogenic effect in the same model. In conclusion, differences in the chemical composition of spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> from P. niruri are reflected in their in vivo pharmacological actions. Despite of a direct relationship of anti-inflammatory and antiallodynic effects with the gallic acid content had been observed, especially in the spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> of leaves, the use of spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> of leaves plus stems showed to be more effective, suggesting a synergic effect between their constituents...|$|R

Methods: The sCT-CS-NPs were prepared by the ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking polyion. Inhalable <b>dry</b> <b>powders</b> were obtained by co-spray drying aqueous dispersion of sCT-CS-NPs and mannitol. sCT-CS-NPs co-spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> were characterized with respect to morphology, particle size, powder density, aerodynamic diameter, protein integrity, in vitro release of sCT, and aerosolization. The plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration of sCT-CS-NPs spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> to the rats was also determined. Results: sCT-CS-NPs were able to be incorporated into mannitol forming inhalable microparticles by the spray drying process. The sCT-CS-NPs/mannitol ratios and spray drying process affected the properties of the microparticles obtained. The conformation of the secondary structures of sCTs was affected by both mannitol content and spray dry inlet temperature. The sCT-CS-NPs were recovered after reconstitution of spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> in an aqueous medium. The sCT release profile from spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> was similar to that from sCT-CS-NPs. In vitro inhalation parameters measured by the Andersen cascade impactor indicated sCT-CS-NPs spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> having promising aerodynamic properties for deposition in the deep lung. Determination of the plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration to rats revealed that the inhalable sCT-CS NPs spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> provided higher protein absorption compared to native sCT powders. Conclusion: The sCT-CS-NPs with mannitol based spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> were prepared to have appropriate aerodynamic properties for pulmonary delivery. The developed system was able to deliver sCT via a pulmonary route into the systemic circulation.

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> fire extinguishers (Class D type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E
40|$|Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, is a herbal specie {{widely used}} in folk {{medicine}} {{in the south of}} Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. The technological characteristics of an Achyrocline satureioides spray <b>dried</b> extract <b>powder,</b> produced in semi-industrial scale, as well as the feasibility of the granules are reported in the present work. The spray <b>dried</b> <b>powder</b> was characterized as a fine powder consisting of small spherical particles with rough and porous surface. The Hausner's factor, Carr's index, and densification index of the spray <b>dried</b> <b>powder</b> were, respectively, 1, 23, 18, 9 %, and 27, 2 mL, characterizing it as a poor flow and low density powder. The preparation of granules from this spray <b>dried</b> <b>powder,</b> through <b>dry</b> disaggregation method, yielded irregularly shaped granules, with a rough surface, but with better flow and compactability characteristics. These granules presented a Hausner's factor, a Carr's index, and a densification index of, respectively, 1, 09, 8, 16 %, and 12, 33 mL. The LC assay of the main polyphenols, quercetin, luteolin, and 3 -O-methylquercetin revealed that the granulation process did not changed the quantitative and qualitative profile of these constituents originally present in the spray <b>dried</b> <b>powder.</b> The comparative evaluation of the physical stability of both the spray <b>dried</b> <b>powder</b> and the granules, under relative humidity conditions of 65 % and 99 %, showed an expressive reduction in the humidity sorption on the granules as compared to the spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{two types}} of {{biodegradable}} polycation (PAsp(DET) homopolymer and PEG-PAsp(DET) copolymer) were applied as vectors for inhalable <b>dry</b> gene <b>powders</b> prepared by spray freeze drying (SFD). The prepared <b>dry</b> gene <b>powders</b> had spherical and porous structures with a 5 ~ 10 -μm diameter, {{and the integrity of}} plasmid DNA could be maintained during powder production.

The spray <b>dried</b> <b>powders</b> showed a low {{water absorption capacity}} (0. 43 ± 0. 02 g/g) compared to freeze (0. 48 ± 0. 02 g/g) and vacuum-dried (0. 47 ± 0. 01 g/g) LPI powders. Spray and freeze-dried powders displayed better gelation ability and higher gel strength, compared to vacuum-dried powder. Both spray and freeze-dried gels showed typical viscoelastic gel characteristics, with G 0 dominating over G 0 0 and very low loss tangent. The holding time required for gelation of vacuum <b>dried</b> <b>powder</b> at 90 C was significantly longer, compared to spray and freeze <b>dried</b> <b>powders.</b> Hence, <b>drying</b> methods used for preparation of lentil protein isolate powders can affect physicochemical and associated functional properties...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of fire extinguishers: stored-{{pressure}} and cartridge-operated. In stored pressure units, the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself. Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used. With dry chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used; water and foam extinguishers typically use air. Stored pressure fire extinguishers {{are the most common}} type. Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent. This type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive higher-than-average use. They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time. Unlike stored pressure types, these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature (-60 rated) models. Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> types in the U.S. and in water, wetting agent, foam, dry chemical (classes ABC and B.C.), and <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> (class D) types {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Ternary {{eutectic}} chloride (T.E.C.) <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> is a <b>dry</b> <b>powder</b> {{invented in}} 1959 by Lawrence H Cope, a research metallurgist {{working for the}} UK Atomic Energy Authority, and licensed to John Kerr Co. of England. It consists of a mixture of three powdered salts: sodium, potassium and barium chloride. T.E.C. forms an oxygen-excluding layer of molten salt on the metal's surface. Along with Met-L-X (sodium chloride), T.E.C {{has been reported to}} be one of the most effective agents (along with Met-L-X {sodium chloride}) for use on sodium, potassium, and NaK fires, and is used specifically on atomic metals like uranium and plutonium as it will not contaminate the valuable metal unlike other agents. T.E.C. is quite toxic, due to the barium chloride content, and for this reason is no longer used in the UK, and was never used in the US aside from radioactive material handling glove boxes, where its toxicity was not an issue due their confined nature. T.E.C. is still widely used in India, despite toxicity, while the West uses chiefly sodium chloride, graphite, and copper types of powder and considers T.E.C. obsolete.|$|E
