However, this theory has attracted strong criticism, including from members of the original Big Ear research team, as a more detailed analysis shows the cited comets were not in the beam at the correct time. Furthermore, comets are not radio-bright at these frequencies, and there is no explanation for why a comet would be observed in one beam but not in the other.|$|E

EGSY8p7's distance from Earth was determined by measuring the redshift of Lyman-alpha emissions. EGSY8p7 is the most distant known detection of hydrogen's Lyman-alpha emissions. The distance of this detection was surprising, because neutral hydrogen (atomic hydrogen) clouds filling the early universe should have absorbed these emissions, even by some <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cloud</b> sources closer to Earth, according to the standard cosmological model. A possible explanation for the detection would be that reionization progressed in a [...] "patchy" [...] manner, rather than homogeneously throughout the universe, creating patches where the EGSY8p7 hydrogen Lyman-alpha emissions could travel to Earth, because there were no neutral hydrogen clouds to absorb the emissions.|$|E

Therefore, by observing planetary <b>hydrogen</b> <b>clouds</b> and related ENA-coronae around transiting terrestrial exoplanets in UV (Lyman-α attenuation) we will learn more on how the early Solar System planetary atmospheres have evolved. Because transiting Earth-size exoplanets and their <b>hydrogen</b> <b>clouds</b> are too small relative {{to the size of}} Sun-like G-stars to detect them, Lammer et al.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce green house gases, {{hydrogen}} fueled vehicles {{are expected to be}} commercialized in the near future. Hydrogen is nontoxic, but it is flammable. A relatively low ignition energy can ignite a hydrogen-air mixture when the concentration of hydrogen is within a flammable range.

In this study, we focus on the distribution of the lower flammability limit (LFL) of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cloud</b> when hydrogen is released from a fuel cell vehicle. CFD techniques, using FLUENT, are applied to the simulation of hydrogen dispersion from a parked vehicle’s tailpipe.

40|$|The Voyager flyby {{observations}} {{revealed that}} a very broad doughnut shaped distribution of the hydrogen atoms existed in the Saturnian magnetosphere. Recent Cassini observations confirmed the local-time asymmetry but also showed the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cloud</b> density increases with decreasing distance to Saturn. The origin of the atomic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cloud</b> has been debated ever since. Therefore, we have carried out a global investigation of the atomic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cloud</b> taking into account all possible sources: 1) the Saturnian atmosphere, 2) the H 2 atmosphere of main rings, 3) Enceladus H 2 O and OH torus, 4) Titan H 2 torus and 5) the atomic hydrogen directly escaping from Titan. We show that the H ejection velocity and angle distribution are modified by collisions of the hot H, produced by electron-impact dissociation of H 2, with the ambient atmospheric H 2 and H. This in turn affects the morphology of the escaping hydrogen as does the morphology of the ionospheric electron distribution. That Saturn atmosphere is an important source {{is suggested by the}} fact that the H cloud peaks well below the ring plane, a feature that, so far, we can not reproduce by the dissociation of the ring H 2 atmosphere or other proposed sources. Our simulations show that H directly escaping from Titan is a major contribution in the outer magnetosphere. The morphology of Titan H torus, shaped by the solar radiation pressure and the Saturnian oblateness, can account for the local time asymmetry near Titan orbit. Dissociation of H 2 O and OH in the Enceladus torus contributes inside ~ 5 RS, but dissociation of Titan H 2 torus does not due to the significant energy released. The total number of H observed by Cassini inside 5 RS: our modeling results suggest ~ 20 % from dissociation in the Enceladus torus, ~ 10 % from dissociation of ring H 2 atmosphere, and ~ 50 % from Titan H torus implying that ~ 20 % comes from the Saturnian atmosphere.
