5|$|Caterpillars undergo ecdysis {{and have}} a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new cuticle is soft and allows the {{increase}} in size and development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last ecdysis, the old cuticle splits and curls up into a small ball at the posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval <b>exuvia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and {{ejaculate}} on to it, {{and then}} store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which {{are larger than}} those of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded <b>exuvia</b> hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the <b>exuvia,</b> arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E

40|$|Extracts of the <b>exuviae</b> (cast skins) of nymphal bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) were {{analyzed}} for volatile compounds that {{might contribute to}} arrestment of adult bed bugs. Four volatile aldehydes, (E) - 2 -hexenal, 4 -oxo-(E) - 2 -hexenal, (E) - 2 -octenal, and 4 -oxo-(E) - 2 -octenal were consistently detected in the headspace of freshly shed <b>exuviae</b> regardless of the developmental stages from which the <b>exuviae</b> were obtained. Quantification of the aldehydes in the solvent extracts of homogenized fresh, 45 - or 99 -d aged 5 th instar <b>exuviae</b> indicated that the aldehydes {{are present in the}} <b>exuviae</b> and dissipate over time, through evaporation or degradation. Microscopic observation of the fifth instar <b>exuviae</b> indicated that the dorsal abdominal glands on the <b>exuviae</b> maintained their pocket-like structures with gland reservoirs, within which the aldehydes might be retained. Two-choice olfactometer studies with the volatiles from <b>exuviae</b> or a synthetic blend mimicking the volatiles indicated that adult bed bugs tend to settle close to sources of the aldehydes. Our results imply that the presence and accumulation of bed bug <b>exuviae</b> and the aldehydes volatilizing from the <b>exuviae</b> might mediate bed bugs' interaction with their microhabitats...|$|R
40|$|Collections of {{floating}} chironomid pupal <b>exuviae</b> {{are used to}} monitor water quality and assess ecological conditions. Factors controlling <b>exuviae</b> sinking rates are not well known, although they should {{have an effect on}} conclusions that can be drawn from collections. The current study was conducted to determine the rate of sinking under controlled laboratory conditions using water from three streams with different nutrient levels. Sinking rates ranged from less than a day to seven days, depending on microbial activity, nutrient concentrations, temperature and turbulence. Results also varied by genus, with pupal <b>exuviae</b> of Chironomus riparius, Diamesa nivoriunda, Orthocladius (Euorthocladius) thienemanni and Eukiefferiella sp. used in experiments. Four species of bacteria and eight genera of fungi colonized and metabolized <b>exuviae,</b> with bacteria dominant early and fungi dominant later in the decomposition process. Decomposition was faster in lightly chitinized abdominal conjunctive areas, which resulted in <b>exuviae</b> breaking apart and sinking. Examination of untreated, dewaxed and dewaxed-deproteinized <b>exuviae</b> indicated that untreated <b>exuviae</b> sank faster. Waxes appeared important for colonization and initial microbial metabolization was delayed when waxes were removed. Results confirm the importance of biological degradation of <b>exuviae</b> in determining floatation times. We predict that streams and other waterbodies with high dissolved nutrients will result in rapidly sinking <b>exuviae,</b> while <b>exuviae</b> in low nutrient waterbodies will float longer.

5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal <b>exuvia</b> (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E

500|$|The narrow {{spindle-shaped}} {{eggs are}} laid {{in a series}} of slits cut by the mother's ovipositor in branches or twigs, usually of eucalypts. On average about twelve eggs are laid in each slit, for a total of several hundred. These cuts can cause significant damage to the bark of tender trees. [...] The eggs all hatch around 70 days later—usually within a day or two of one another—but take longer in cold or dry conditions. The larvae then fall to the ground and burrow into the soil. Though the timing of the double drummer's life cycle is unknown, nymphs of cicadas in general then spend from four to six years underground. Unusual for Australian cicadas, double drummers emerge during the daytime. Emerging en masse generally, nymphs are covered in mud. This mud remains on their exuviae, which emerging cicadas leave at the bases or in burnt out hollows of eucalypts. Within a forest, successive broods may emerge in different locations each year. The cicada's body and wings desiccate and harden once free of the <b>exuvia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{next two}} larval stages, termed second nauplius and metanauplius, {{still do not}} eat but are nourished by the {{remaining}} yolk. After three weeks, the young krill has finished the ascent. They can appear in enormous numbers counting 2 per litre in [...] water depth. Growing larger, additional larval stages follow (second and third calyptopis, first to sixth furcilia). They are characterised by increasing development of the additional legs, the compound eyes and the setae (bristles). At , the juvenile krill resembles the habitus of the adults. Krill reach maturity after two to three years. Like all crustaceans, krill must moult in order to grow. Approximately every 13 to 20 days, krill shed their chitinous exoskeleton and leave it behind as <b>exuvia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans, form large swarms, {{sometimes}} reaching {{densities of}} 10,000–60,000 individual animals per cubic metre. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators {{that would like}} to pick out single individuals. The largest swarms are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm was observed to cover an area of 450 square kilometers (175 square miles) of ocean, to a depth of 200 meters (650 feet) and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. Krill typically follow a diurnal vertical migration. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface. Until recently it has been assumed that they spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. It has been found that the deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators. Dense swarms may elicit a feeding frenzy among fish, birds and mammal predators, especially near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantaneously, leaving the <b>exuvia</b> behind as a decoy. [...] In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi presented {{what appears to be a}} successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: [...] " [...] (i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, and (iii) random diffusion." ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Animals {{can gain}} {{protection}} against predators and parasites by living in groups. The encounter-dilution effect provides protection when {{the probability of}} detection of a group does not increase in proportion to group size (i. e. encounter effect), so that predators do not offset the encounter effect by attacking more {{members of the group}} (i. e. dilution effect). In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism by which prey insects could gain by producing decoys that act as multiple targets for predators or parasitoids if these decoys are recognised as preys or hosts and negatively affect the patch foraging strategy of these predators and parasitoids. Such a decoy mechanism could be present in aphid colonies in which aphid <b>exuviae</b> are recognised and attacked by Aphidiine wasps. RESULTS: We conducted a behavioural study to evaluate the effect of <b>exuviae</b> on parasitoid patch residence time and egg allocation in experimental aphid patches with or without <b>exuviae.</b> We showed that <b>exuviae</b> are recognised and attacked at the same level as aphids when both are present in the patch. While parasitism rate was not significantly lower in patches with <b>exuviae</b> when the parasitoid left the patch, the time wasted by parasitoids to handle <b>exuviae</b> did influence the patch residence time. As a consequence, the attack rate on the live aphids was lower in patches that contain <b>exuviae.</b> CONCLUSION: Aphids had more time available to flee and thus each individual might gain protection against parasitoids by leaving their <b>exuviae</b> near and within the colony. These results demonstrate that the encounter-dilution effect provided by living in a group can be enhanced by extra-materials that act as decoy for natural enemies...|$|R
