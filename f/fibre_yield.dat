It is particularly beneficial because of its resistance to root-knot nematodes and is also a soil improving crop via nitrogen fixation. The Sunnhemp Research Station of Uttar Pradesh further researched Crotalaria juncea’s genotypic impact on <b>fibre</b> <b>yield.</b> Four different genotypes of Crotalaria juncea were observed for three years to determine which genotype would yield in a high <b>fibre</b> <b>yield.</b> Important data that was collected across the plant genotypes include height (cm), basal diameter (mm), green biomass weight (q/ha), fibre weight (q/ha), and stick weight (q/ha). Out of the four genotypes, namely SUIN-029, SUIN-080, SUIN-037, and SUIN-043, SUIN-029 was superior in resulting in a high <b>fibre</b> <b>yield.</b> [...] This genotype can even be used as a template for future breeding.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out with 33 Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) genotypes of diverse origin to obtain {{information}} on genetic variability, heritability and correlation between <b>fibre</b> <b>yield</b> and various yield attributes. A substantial variability was observed among the genotypes for all 8 characters studied. The character dry stick weight per plant exhibited the highest phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variation (20. 30, 14. 11) followed by dry <b>fibre</b> <b>yield</b> per plant (18. 06, 12. 05) and green weight per plant (17. 25, 11. 41). Heritability ranged from 98. 36 for days to 50 % flowering to 15. 97 % for node number per plant. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance was observed for days to 50 % flowering and green weight per plant suggesting the dominant role of additive gene effects in the expression of these two characters. Correlation studies revealed that <b>fibre</b> <b>yield</b> was positively and significantly correlated with all the characters studied except node number per plant and days to 50 % flowering.

Leaf spread increased up to 40 days and declined thereafter. Leaf number per plant, length and breadth of leaf increased {{with the increase in}} age of the plants. Total dry matter production per plant increased rapidly up to 30 days in both the cultivars. At the time of first harvest at 20 days after emergence (DAE), the leaf dry weight became double (2. 37 g) as compared to that of the stem (1. 31 g). Stem dry weight increased rapidly during the period of 20 to 30 days and thereafter the stem maintained higher dry weight till the senescence of the plant. The RGR, NAR and LAR were relatively higher at the early stage of growth and then began to decrease sharply with the increase in age of the plants in both the cultivars. Both RGR and NAR increased a little at 50 to 60 DAE. There were significant positive correlations between early growth attributes viz., plant height, leaf number per plant, length and breadth of leaf and LAI, and <b>fibre</b> <b>yield.</b> It is concluded that there is an ample scope of increasing <b>fibre</b> <b>yield</b> through vigourous vegetative growth at early stage. ...|$|E

A Study {{was conducted in}} 2005 at Shirvan in Northern Khorasan province, Iran, {{to determine the effects}} of three plant populations (30, 90 and 150 plant per m 2) and three rates of nitrogen application (50, 150 and 250 kg N per ha) on final stand, stalk height, basal stalk diameter, total stalk yield as well as fibre content from stalk and <b>fibre</b> <b>yield</b> in male and female plants. A split plot experimental with three replications was used. The result indicated that due to enhanced competition for light at higher population on density and N 2 level plant mortality was higher than other treatment Morphological characteristics were highly correlated with plant sexual, plant population and nitrogen fertilizer. Highest stem, leaf and inflorescence yield were obtained at 250 plant m- 2 when 150 kg N ha- 1 was used. Lowest plant density did not show self-thinning but reduced above ground dry matter. Shoot dry matter increased with increasing plant density and nitrogen supply. Apparently, fibre content was greater at medium density and lowest nitrogen fertilizer, however, <b>fibre</b> <b>yield</b> was greatest at highest plant population and nitrogen fertilizer. In terms of <b>fibre</b> <b>yield,</b> approximate 31. 7 % of the fibre was located in the bottom parts, 22. 4 % in the middle and only 9. 9 % in the top part of the stem.

In order to evaluate the impact of genetic improvement on this decline, we conducted field experiments in two locations with 10 widely grown cotton cultivars released in Cameroon between 1950 and 2009.

The {{hybrid of}} liquid {{crystalline}} polymer (LCP) fibres and glass fibres (GF) provide {{a combination of}} modulus and toughness to semi-crystalline linear-low-density-polyethylene (LLDPE). LCP and GF fibres reinforced composites were studied using two-body abrasion tesr under different applied loads. Two sets of fibre reinforced LLDPE, 10 and 20 vol%, were investigated. The contents of LCP and glass fibres were varied as 25, 50, 75 and 100 vol % of overall volume of fibres in LLDPE. The effect of replacing glass fibre with LCP fibre on wear is reported.

The rapid advancement of the technology for making industry products contributes consumer the ease of making a suitable choice and own desirable tastes. Researchers have expanded their expertise in the product design by applying the usage of raw materials like bamboo fibre which is stronger as well as can be utilized in generating high end quality sustainable industrial products. Thereby, this article gives critical review of the most recent developments of bamboo fibre based reinforced composites and the summary of main results presented in literature, focusing on the processing methodology and ultimate properties of bamboo fibres with polymeric matrices and applications in well designed economical products...|$|R
40|$|A novel, all-fibre {{geometry}} {{for achieving}} predominantly single-ended laser {{operation of a}} fibre laser {{without the use of}} high reflectivity dielectric coatings or in-fibre Bragg gratings is described. This approach has been applied to a simple cladding-pumped Yb-doped silica fibre laser pumped by a high-power diode source at ~ 976 nm. In preliminary experiments the <b>fibre</b> laser <b>yielded</b> 29 W of output at 1080 nm for 48 W of launched pump power. At pump powers over 25 W the slope efficiency with respect to absorbed pump power was 78 %. The prospects for further improvement in performance and higher output power are considered...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to form {{uncompressed}} thermobonded 3 D wool nonwoven shell structures in one continuous process, and to study the controlling factors that govern this process. Lack of bonding between wool fibres and between wool and thermoplastic fibres was attributed to the wool fibre's low surface energy because of the lipids on the outer surface of wool fibres (epicuticle). To overcome this problem, three different surface treatments were investigated; chlorination, Hercosett and plasma. The purpose of these treatments was to raise the surface energy of wool fibres by bond scission and the introduction of new functional polar groups and ablation of the outer lipid layer or membrane. For thermobonding with wool fibres, low melting nylon fibres were chosen because of their high polarity and chemical compatibility with wool fibres. SEM, BSM and ESEM imaging techniques as well as tensile strength testing for single fibres, pair bonded samples and 3 D nonwoven shells were used to assess the samples. Results have shown {{that it is possible to}} thermobond wool and nylon fibres as 3 D shell structures, given that wool fibres are treated appropriately and the bonding temperature is controlled properly. Moreover, it has been found that, for pair bonded samples, the wrapping angle and the bonding angle have significant effects on the tensile strength and number of bonding points. Hercosett treated wool <b>fibres</b> <b>yielded</b> the strongest bonds with nylon fibres followed by plasma, chlorinated and untreated fibres.
