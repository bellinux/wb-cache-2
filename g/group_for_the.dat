5|$|A {{shortage}} of aircraft {{played a role}} in transporting the task force to France, which had to be divided into two large groups and a small glider <b>group</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British. On D-Day the first large group would be transported to France by 394 aircraft and eighty gliders. A second group of 325 aircraft and 270 gliders would arrive in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E
5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a <b>group</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> night. The moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the lighter}} group 12 {{elements}} often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments {{were conducted in}} 2015 to attempt to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide, CnSe. Reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide were observed, with ΔHadsCn(t-Se) > 48kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury. This was unexpected as {{the stability of the}} group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe, while it increases down the <b>group</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group 14 selenides from GeSe to PbSe.|$|E

They quickly became friends. Richters and his team began following him around for several months, filming Sutton at home with his family and at several fundraisers. In the summer of 2013 Sutton went on holiday to Ibiza (his last travel) with his close friends. Richters equipped him with several GoPro cameras. The documentary is in development, as of 2016, and will be made into a feature-length film.|$|E
5|$|Josephson spent a {{postdoctoral}} {{year in the}} United States (1965–1966) {{as research}} {{assistant professor at the}} University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. After returning to Cambridge, he was made assistant {{director of research at the}} Cavendish Laboratory in 1967, where he remained a member of the Theory of Condensed Matter group, a theoretical physics <b>group,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of his career. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1970, and the same year was awarded a National Science Foundation fellowship by Cornell University, where he spent one year. In 1972 he became a reader in physics at Cambridge and in 1974 a full professor, a position he held until he retired in 2007.|$|E

Shortly thereafter he returned to live in Britain again for some time following the death in 1981 of his wife Elizabeth McRae, to whom he had been married since 1944. His main reason for {{going back to the}} UK was to attempt, unsuccessfully, to produce a drama series about the Bloomsbury <b>Group</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new Channel 4 network.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{numbers at}} Redland were further boosted by a {{marketing}} campaign by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership {{to attract more}} people, especially students, to use the station. The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed a support <b>group</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> station, and improved the provision of timetabling information {{through the use of}} simplified departure timetable posters. In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous details such as mobile phones, sunglasses and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award.|$|E

On 19 January 2013, Rahul Gandhi {{was appointed}} the vice-president of the Indian National Congress at the Jaipur Declaration of Congress. The resolution to make Rahul the vice-president was moved by A. K. Antony and was unanimously adopted by the Congress Working Committee. Rahul had earlier been the party's general secretary, the chief of Indian Youth Congress, and National Students Union of India. The party decided not to announce a prime ministerial candidate. The members of the party's pre-poll alliance committee were M. Veerappa Moily, A. K. Antony, Jitender Singh, and Suresh Pachauri. Ambika Soni, Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Manish Tewari formed the party's publicity <b>group</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elections.|$|E
5|$|Richard H. Shultz {{received}} his PhD {{in political science}} from Miami University in 1976, and during the period 1977–1978 did post-doctoral work at the University of Michigan. Shultz became part of The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University as international politics professor in 1983, and rose to become director of the International Security Studies Program (ISSP). Shultz was the only non-government member of the Special Operations Policy Advisory <b>Group</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States Department of Defense. After the publication of Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy, Shultz authored another book on Soviet war tactics: The Soviet Union and Revolutionary Warfare.|$|E
