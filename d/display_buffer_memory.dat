The buffer is modeled as a discrete memoryless channel, which introduces spatially independent and uniform bit errors on the binary representation of the stored values. This leads to a strong performance degradation if a conventional Turbo decoding algorithm is employed.

We propose a memory minimization technique that separates global <b>memory</b> <b>buffers</b> from local pointer buffers: the global buffers store live data samples and the local buffers store the pointers to the global buffer entries. The proposed algorithm reduces 67 % memory for a JPEG encoder, 40 % for an H. 263 encoder compared with unshared versions, and 22 % compared with the previous sharing algorithm for the H. 263 encoder. Through extensive buffer sharing optimization, we believe that automatic software synthesis from dataflow program graphs achieves the comparable code quality with the manually optimized code in terms of memory requirement.|$|R
