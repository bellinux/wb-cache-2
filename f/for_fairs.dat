Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his reform program required spending, and the legislature could find few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies <b>for</b> <b>fairs</b> were cut.|$|E
25|$|The wakes were {{originally}} religious festivals that commemorated church dedications. Particularly {{important was the}} Rushcart festival associated with Rogationtide. During the Industrial Revolution {{the tradition of the}} wakes was adapted into a regular summer break in the mill towns of Lancashire, where each locality would nominate a wakes week during which the cotton mills would all close at the same time. Stalybridge Wakes occurs in the third week of July. Wakes Week became the focus <b>for</b> <b>fairs,</b> and eventually for holidays where the mill workers would go to the seaside, eventually on the newly developing railways.|$|E

As such, its scope is wider than the nearly homonymous official bodies like the Office of Fair Trading of the United Kingdom and of the states of Australia, which are almost exclusively focused on competition matters, a task undertaken more specifically in Malta by units within the frame of the Office through the Consumer and Competition Division; the Office <b>for</b> <b>Fair</b> Competition and the Commission <b>for</b> <b>Fair</b> Trading.

500|$|Piedmont Park is {{an urban}} park in Atlanta, Georgia, located about [...] {{northeast}} of Downtown, between the Midtown and Virginia Highland neighborhoods. Originally {{the land was}} owned by Dr. Benjamin Walker, who used it as his out-of-town gentleman's farm and residence. He sold the land in 1887 to the Gentlemen's Driving Club (later renamed the Piedmont Driving Club), who wanted to establish an exclusive club and racing ground for horse enthusiasts. The Driving Club entered {{an agreement with the}} Piedmont Exposition Company, headed by prominent Atlantan Charles A. Collier, to use the land <b>for</b> <b>fairs</b> and expositions and later gave the park its name.|$|E
500|$|The {{fishing village}} of Brighthelmston, on the English Channel coast, was {{built around the}} point at which the Wellesbourne, a winterbourne flowing off the South Downs, entered the sea. [...] It formed a north–south valley along which the road and railway line to London were built. The road to London diverged from the road to Lewes, which also {{followed}} a valley northeastwards, at an area of marshy, intermittently flooded ground called The Level. [...] By the 18th century, when the village started developing into the fashionable resort of Brighton, this had become a popular site <b>for</b> <b>fairs,</b> sports and general recreation. In 1791, the northernmost part became the Prince of Wales Ground, a cricket ground which hosted early first-class matches and served as the home of Brighton Cricket Club, one of the principal founders of Sussex County Cricket Club 50 years later.|$|E
2500|$|The almshouses {{originally}} [...] "stood in open country" [...] opposite {{one corner}} of The Level, a large area of common land used <b>for</b> <b>fairs</b> and recreational activities. [...] An 1807 watercolour shows the six original houses surrounded by a low stone wall with fields on all sides. [...] Hilly Laine (the site of the future Hanover and Elm Grove residential areas) rises behind the buildings. [...] They were Brighton's first Gothic Revival non-ecclesiastical buildings, and the same style was adopted in 1859 when they were added to. [...] Three were built {{on each side of}} the original block, which were then renumbered between 4 and 9. [...] The new houses were built in memory of Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol, who died in 1859, and were paid for by Vicar of Brighton Henry Michell Wagner and his sister Mary. [...] They were intended for [...] "six poor maidens".|$|E

2500|$|Broadhalfpenny Down {{continued}} in regular use by Hambledon/Hampshire teams until 1781. At {{the end of}} that season, the Hambledon Club moved to Windmill Down, which is closer to the village. According to John Nyren, Windmill was [...] "one of the finest places for playing on I ever saw". A key difference was that Windmill was under the club's control as they rented it from a farmer at ten guineas a year, whereas Broadhalfpenny was common land in use as sheep pasture, <b>for</b> <b>fairs</b> and other gatherings. It could be said that Broadhalfpenny belonged to the community and Windmill to the club, whose members may not have been happy about the [...] "raucous, boisterous crowds that gathered (on the Down)". The move was done {{at the behest of the}} Duke of Dorset, chief among club members, and David Underdown saw it as the first step in a process which removed professional cricket from a truly rural setting and ultimately concentrated it in an urban environment, for it was Dorset's successors George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and Colonel Charles Lennox who were the key players in the establishment of the White Conduit Club in Islington and subsequently Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.|$|E
