30|$|Thin polymer {{films of}} {{polystyrene}} and poly(α-methylstyrene) were prepared via blade coating from tetrahydrofuran solutions. Concentrations of 50 – 100  mg/ml of the polymers {{were used in}} order to produce films of 1 – 3  μm thickness. The dye concentration was adjusted accordingly to achieve a 4 % ratio in respect to the polymer, polystyrene respectively poly(α-methylstyrene). Polyimide films were produced via spin coating from cyclopentanone solutions. A concentration of 4.2  mg/ml of the polymer (saturation limit) was applied and a high amount of dye was added (36 % in respect to the polymer) to ensure sufficient absorption at the laser wavelength for the smaller thicknesses of the polyimide films. The triazene polymer was spin coated from a solvent mixture of chlorobenzene and cyclohexanone. A <b>dye</b> <b>polymer</b> ratio of 10 % was used. In this case, thicker films than for the polyimide could be prepared. However, in comparison to the polystyrene and the poly(α-methylstyrene), the films are significantly thinner. Thicker spin coated films of about 1  μm typically suffer in quality. Therefore a lower thickness was chosen and the <b>dye</b> <b>polymer</b> ratio was increased in order to maintain sufficient laser light absorption. All polymer films were prepared on standard glass slides.|$|E
40|$|H-aggregates of the cyanine dye Cy 5 {{are formed}} during {{covalent}} linkage to the cationic macromolecule Poly(allylamine) (PAH). The nonfluorescent H-aggregates strongly restrict {{the usage of}} the dye for analytical purposes and prevent a quantitative determination of the labeled macromolecules. The behavior of the H-aggregates has been studied by investigation of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the <b>dye</b> <b>polymer</b> in dependence on solvent, label degree and additional sulfonate groups. H-aggregate formation is caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of the Cy 5 molecules on the polymer chain. The H-aggregates can be destroyed by conformational changes of the PAH induced by interactions with polyanions or in organic solvents. It {{has been found that}} the polymer labeling process in high content of organic solvents can prevent the formation of H-aggregates.

40|$|The {{influence}} of an applied electric field on reversible photodegradation of disperse orange 11 (DO 11) doped into PMMA is measured using digital imaging and conductivity measurements. Correlations between optical imaging, which measures photodegradation and recovery, and photoconductivity enables an association {{to be made}} between the damaged fragments and their contribution to current, thus establishing that damaged fragments are charged species, or polarizable. Hence, the decay and recovery process should be controllable with the applications of an electric field. Indeed, {{we find that the}} <b>dye</b> <b>polymer</b> system is highly sensitive to an applied electric field, which drastically affects the decay and recovery dynamics. We demonstrate accelerated recovery when one field polarity is applied during burning, and the opposite polarity is applied during recovery. This work suggests that the damage threshold can be increased through electric field conditioning; and, the results are qualitatively consistent with the domain model of Ramini[3, 4]. The observed behavior will provide useful input into better understanding the nature of the domains in the domain model, making it possible to design more robust materials using common polymers and molecular dopants.

40|$|A new {{preparation}} method of <b>polymer</b> <b>dyes</b> {{was developed to}} improve both the grafting degree of the azo dyes onto O-carboxymethyl chitosan (OMCS) and the water solubility of prepared <b>polymer</b> <b>dyes.</b> Firstly, the coupling compound of two azo edible colorants, sunset yellow (SY) and allura red (AR), was grafted onto OMCS, and then coupled with their diazonium salt. The chemical structure of prepared <b>polymer</b> <b>dyes</b> was determined by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and 1 H-NMR, and {{the results showed that}} the two azo dyes were successfully grafted onto OMCS.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} a new technique called MR plastination arthrography to study both intra- and extra-articular anatomy. Materials and methods: In six human cadaveric lower legs MR arthrography was performed in either a one-step or two-step procedure. In the former a mixture of diluted Gadolinium and <b>dyed</b> <b>polymer</b> was injected. In the latter the <b>dyed</b> <b>polymer</b> was injected after arthrography wih diluted Gadolinium. Three-millimeter slices of these legs, obtained in a plane identical to that of the MR images, were plastinated according to the E 12 technique of von Hagens. The plastination slices were subsequently compared with the MR images. Results: The one-step procedure resulted in an inhomogeneous arthrogram. The two-step procedure resulted in a good correlation between the high-resolution MR images and plastination slices, as expressed by a good comparison of anatomic detail of the small syndesmotic recess.

The aim {{of the study was}} to develop polymer composite layer with damage indication ability. Visualization of damaged place is provided by colour changing in the place of definite load. Colour changing mechanism is provided by chemical reaction between encapsulated leuco dye and particles of dye developer. After definite load shell of a capsule bursts and chemical reaction is possible. So damage visibility is provided like a 9 ̆ 3 bruise 9 ̆ 4 in the human body. As a result of work the following issues have been solved. Layer of glass fabric epoxy composite with visualization capability provided by mixture of components (microcapsules of leuco <b>dye,</b> <b>polymer</b> adhesive, and particles of dye developer) was worked out. The optimal ratio of mixture components was found. Specimens with different component concentrations were tested by quasi-static compression tests. An intensity of the colored response was estimated by digital image analysis. As a result components ratio was found as 6 / 3 / 2. Composite with damage indication ability was manufactured via the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding process. The method of sensitivity control of damage indication layer with protective coating was developed. Relation of threshold level of the impact visualization vs. coating thickness was estimated by series of quasi-static experiments and further processing of the data (compilation and analysis of quasi-static compression tests data, digital image analysis data with parameters of specimens).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} examples {{for applying}} encoded combinatorial chemistry to trace molecular interactions between two-armed receptors and peptidic substrates {{that could have}} not been predicted by conventional means. Starting from these selective non-covalent interactions, applications, like supramolecular self-assembly, were investigated in organic and aqueous media. In the first part the synthesis of macrocyclic diketopiperazine receptors and their binding properties towards peptides is described. Combinatorial on-bead studies showed that both macrocyclization of the receptor and choice of the linker-type lead to {{significant changes in the}} binding properties compared to their flexible open-chain parent diketopiperazine receptors. Macrocyclization rigidifies the receptor and should induce a higher preorganisation. Thus, the conformations of the macrocyclic receptors were expected to differ from the open-chain diketopiperazine receptor prototype. Binding studies revealed that macrocyclization led not only to lower binding selectivities but also lower affinities toward peptidic guest compared to the open-chain parent receptors. Thus, the flexibility of the open-chain receptor allows the arms to better adjust to a peptidic guest and can be beneficial for selective and higher binding. The second part describes {{the development of a new}} class of two-armed receptors consisting of a rigid carbazole backbone and peptidic side-chains which allow for structural as well as functional variations. Compared to the diketopiperazine template, a third functionality is present and allows for attachment of a <b>dye,</b> <b>polymer</b> chain or resin, at the opposite site of the recognition modules. Combinatorial binding studies and solid phase binding assays showed that these carbazole receptors interact with certain tripeptides, in organic solvents, with sequence selectivities and binding affinities that are comparable to those of diketopiperazine receptors. These two-armed receptors have been the basis for the design of receptor libraries to identify selective receptors for interesting peptidic and nonpeptidic substrates. In the third part, selective non-covalent interactions between a diketopiperazine receptor and peptide-PEG conjugates were used to induce the assembly of vesicles in aqueous solution. The vesicles were analysed by a combination of light scattering, electron transmission and atomic force microscopy as well as surface pressure measurements. Vesicle formation was found to be independent of the ratio of receptor to ligand and relies upon selective receptor-peptide interactions. Other peptide-PEG conjugates did not assemble into vesicular structures when mixed with the receptor...|$|E
40|$|Dyed {{natural rubber}} (NR) and styrene {{butadiene}} rubber (SBR), designed for outdoor applications, were exposed to an accelerated artificial aging in xenon light. The aging results in {{the deterioration of the}} exposed surface material properties. The ability of <b>dyed</b> <b>polymers</b> to withstand prolonged sunlight exposure without fading or undergoing any physical deterioration is largely determined not only by the photochemical characteristics of the absorbing dyestuff itself but also by the polymer structure and fillers. Results obtained by laser mass spectrometry, UV-visible spectroscopy, and environmental scanning electron microscopy indicate that dyed filled NR and SBR samples behave differently during the photo-oxidation. The fading of the <b>dyed</b> <b>polymers</b> was found to be promoted in the NR sample. This can be correlated with LDI-FTICRMS results, which show the absence of [M-H]− orange pigment pseudomolecular ion and also its fragment ions after aging. This is confirmed by both EDX and UV/Vis spectroscopy. EDX analysis indicates a concentration of chlorine atoms, which can be considered as a marker of orange pigment or its degradation products, only at the surface of SBR flooring after aging. Reactivity of radicals formed during flooring aging has been studied and seems to greatly affect the behavior of such organic pigments...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} present thesis is the {{development}} of a technique for simultaneous measurement of temperature and velocity fields in liquids based on the luminescence of particles. This technique is intended to be used for the experimental investigation of transient phase change phenomena like nucleate boiling that takes place on a small spatial scale. For that reason, the main requirement for the developed technique is the ability for temporally and spatially highly resolving measurements. Existing methods either do not offer such high resolution or do not facilitate simultaneous temperature and velocity measurements. Two different approaches for particle-based temperature measurements are presented, one using microcapsules with a temperature-sensitive dye solution in the core and the other using particles fabricated from <b>dyed</b> <b>polymers.</b> The developed microcapsules have a fluorescence characteristic that enables the implementation of a 2 -colour-LIF procedure. Fluorescence is excited using a laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and the resulting signals (temperature-sensitive signal and reference signal) are detected by two separate high-speed cameras with appropriate filters. While the brightness of the particles in the images of both cameras serves as temperature indicator, velocity information is extracted from subsequent images of a single camera by means of the PIV method. The applicability of this technique for highly resolved measurements is shown for light-sheet and volume illumination. Therefore, experimental results from a stationary flow driven by natural convection and a flow through a capillary tube driven by a pressure difference are compared to the respective numerical solution of these flows. Moreover, the technique is characterized with regard to accuracy and possible sources of error. The <b>dyed</b> <b>polymers</b> on the contrary, are only investigated with regard to their general applicability for temperature measurements. Laser induced fluorescence with dyes dissolved in acetone is used to measure the temperature field around a growing vapour bubble and the suitability of optical methods for this future application is analyzed...|$|R
