5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E
25|$|The {{average rate}} of {{accretion}} onto Sgr A* is unusually small for a black hole of its mass and is only detectable because it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Earth. It was thought that the passage of G2 in 2013 might offer astronomers the chance to learn much more about how material accretes onto supermassive black holes. Several astronomical facilities observed this closest approach, with observations confirmed with Chandra, XMM, EVLA, INTEGRAL, Swift, Fermi and requested at VLT and Keck.|$|E

It's not clear if they reference the same Bjarmaland as was mentioned in the Voyage of Ohthere, however. The name of the Bjarmian god Jómali <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> word god in most Finnic languages that Bjarmians where likely a Finnic group. In fact, languages belonging to other language group have never been suggested within serious research.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} between the A Ring and the F Ring has been named the Roche Division {{in honor of the}} French physicist Édouard Roche. The Roche Division {{should not be confused with}} the Roche limit which is the distance at which a large object <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a planet (such as Saturn) that the planet's tidal forces will pull it apart. Lying at the outer edge of the main ring system, the Roche Division is in fact close to Saturn's Roche limit, which is why the rings have been unable to accrete into a moon.|$|E

25|$|Proteus is {{the second}} largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 {{kilometres}} in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes because it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Neptune that it is lost {{in the glare of}} reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark—its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2μm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.|$|E
25|$|Though {{he always}} hoped {{to return to}} his beloved Welgelegen, Henry died childless in London in 1811, leaving a capital of 12 million guilders, an art collection, and several large properties. He was a generous uncle to his many nieces and nephews in London, Heemstede, and Pennsylvania. On his death, his {{accumulated}} wealth was split between the children of his cousin Jan (who inherited Deepdene), the children of his cousin Maria (who inherited Hope Lodge), and the children of his sister Harriet (who inherited villa Welgelegen). Before his death, he commissioned a family portrait with his sister Harriet and the family of his adopted son John Williams Hope and Harriet's daughter Ann. The painting, by Benjamin West, shows a model of Welgelegen that sits above a mahogany chest, probably designed by Thomas Hope. The painting currently hangs in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. A fitting place, since it is built itself in the neo-classical style and <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> where Harriet and Henry were born, in Braintree.|$|E
25|$|Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig) {{is a day}} {{away from}} his fourteenth birthday. As the Stanton {{children}} walk home, Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), the local mistress of the Manor, and her Butler Merriman Lyon (Ian McShane) invite the siblings to a Christmas party. Later, two farmers, Dawson (James Cosmo) and Old George (Jim Piddock), whom Will does not know, arrive at his house with a large Christmas tree ordered by the family. The farmers know Will’s name, wish him a happy birthday, and predict a storm despite the relatively clear sky. Will’s birthday <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Christmas that everyone in his large family ignores it except for his little sister Gwen (Emma Lockhart), who gives him his only birthday present (a Casio G-Shock Mudman wristwatch). The family has moved from the United States to a small English village {{and one of his}} brothers has arrived home for the holidays and displaces Will to the attic. For a Christmas present, Will buys Gwen an enigmatic stone pendant at the local mall. Two suspicious security guards accuse him of shoplifting and take him to their office. Alarmingly, as they question Will under the room's flickering lights, the guards metamorphose into rooks. They attack Will, but he manages to escape, accidentally using his powers for the first time. Will begins to experience more odd incidents and receives a strange and Celtic-looking belt from his oldest brother, Stephen (Jordan J. Dale).|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to be good news to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> you growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} several vocal {{tracks for}} a possible new Simon & Garfunkel album, Simon decided to adopt it as his own solo album. Garfunkel refused to learn the songs {{in the studio and}} would not give up his longstanding cannabis and cigarette habits despite Simon's requests. An official spokesperson remarked, [...] "Paul simply felt the material he wrote <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> his own life {{that it had to be}} his own record. Art was hoping to be on the album, but I'm sure there will be other projects that they will work on together. They are still friends." [...] The material was later released on Simon's 1983 effort Hearts and Bones. Another rift opened between the duo when the lengthy recording of Simon's 1986 album Graceland prevented Garfunkel from working with Roy Halee on a Christmas album. In 1990, the duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Garfunkel thanked his partner, calling him [...] "the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me," [...] to which Simon responded, [...] "Arthur and I agree about almost nothing. But it's true, I have enriched his life quite a bit." [...] After three songs, the duo left without speaking. In August 1991 Simon staged his own concert in Central Park, which was released a few months later. Art Garfunkel had offered to lend his friend a hand in creating another park reunion in which Simon declined, leading the concert as a solo act.|$|E

[...] In some cases, only part of the church has been conserved, as with St Mary, West Walton, where the detached tower is conserved but its church continues in use. [...] All Saints Church, Newton Green has been divided at the chancel, which continues to be used for worship although the rest of the church is maintained by the Trust.
