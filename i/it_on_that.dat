She usually gave her birthday as 23 October 1844, and celebrated <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day. However, the reconstituted birth certificate she presented in 1914 gave the date as 25 October. Other sources give the date 22 October, or either 22 or 23 October.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have long}} disputed whether members of Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, even though Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin all later wrote {{that they had}} signed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day. Most historians have {{concluded}} that the Declaration was signed nearly a month after its adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1866, Moore {{learned of}} the gold discoveries at Big Bend {{and put in a}} tender for the {{contract}} to run steamer service from Savona on Kamloops Lake to Seymour City (Seymour Arm) on Shuswap Lake, but his rival, Captain Irving, won the contract. Moore decided to purchase another barge and ran <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> route with his eldest son, John. The Big Bend Gold Rush ended shortly afterwards, and Moore purchased land in Kamloops and his family, with their omnipresent goats, joined him there, ironically making part of the trip on Captain Irving's sternwheeler, Onward.|$|E

25|$|In {{face of an}} {{increasing}} debt and shrinking audiences that had fallen under 10 and even 5% of share in recent years, RTVV announced in 2012 a plan to shed 70% of its labour. The plan was nullified on 5 November 2013 by the National Court after trade unions appealed against <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> <b>that</b> same day, the President de la Generalitat Alberto Fabra announced RTVV would be closed, claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable. On 27 November, the legislative assembly passed the dissolution of RTVV and employees organized {{to take control of}} the broadcast, starting a campaign against the PP. Nou TV's last broadcast ended abruptly when Spanish police pulled the plug at 12:19 on 29 November 2013.|$|E
25|$|In U.S. Army Air Forces use, the Norden bombsight was {{attached}} to its autopilot base, which was in turn connected with the aircraft's autopilot. The Honeywell C-1 autopilot {{could be used as}} an autopilot by the flight crew during the journey to the target area through a control panel in the cockpit, but was more commonly used under direct command of the bombardier. The Norden's box-like autopilot unit sat behind and below the sight and attached to it at a single rotating pivot. After control of the aircraft was passed to the bombardier during the bomb run, he would first rotate the entire Norden so the vertical line in the sight passed through the target. From that point on, the autopilot would attempt to guide the bomber so it followed the course of the bombsight, and pointed the heading to zero out the drift rate, fed to it through a coupling. As the aircraft turned onto the correct angle, a belt and pulley system rotated the sight back to match the changing heading. The autopilot was another reason for the Norden's accuracy, as it ensured the aircraft quickly followed the correct course and kept <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> course much more accurately than the pilots could.|$|E

500|$|The {{simulator}} problems proved extremely annoying to Grissom. On January 22, 1967, {{before returning}} to the Cape to conduct the January 27 plugs-out test, Grissom took a lemon off a tree in his back yard. When his wife Betty asked him what he planned to do with it, he replied, [...] "I'm going to hang <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> spacecraft." [...] He actually hung the lemon on the simulator, not the spacecraft.|$|E
500|$|... "Only a Northern Song" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{rock band}} the Beatles from their 1969 album Yellow Submarine. Written by George Harrison, it was {{recorded}} mainly in February 1967 during the sessions for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band but the Beatles chose not to include <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> album. Instead, {{it was one of}} the four new songs that the band provided for the 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine, to meet their contractual obligations to United Artists.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's {{book was}} only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he {{received}} a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked {{that he had been}} [...] "forestalled", Darwin sent <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace, and although Wallace had not asked for publication, Darwin suggested he would send it to any journal that Wallace chose. His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of scarlet fever, and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the Linnean Society on 1 July of On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Dunst {{starred in}} the comedy Bring It On as Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad. The film {{generated}} mostly positive reviews, with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her [...] "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon noted that [...] "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice complimented Dunst, stating that her performance was [...] "as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in Dick" [...] and commenting that [...] " [...] provides the only major element of Bring <b>It</b> <b>On</b> <b>that</b> plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness [...] "to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable {{as it takes to}} get through a slapdash film." ...|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E
500|$|Also {{returning}} to the series are Neve McIntosh as Madame Vastra, Dan Starkey as Strax and Catrin Stewart as Jenny. All three previously appeared in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the prequels. They returned due to the popularity of Vastra and Jenny; Moffat considered a spin-off featuring them, {{though he did not}} have the time to do it. Instead, he decided to bring them back in the main series. Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions, as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, which was written by Moffat and as an alternative Ninth Doctor in the animated story Scream of the Shalka which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005. Smith commented that Grant was [...] "born to be a Who villain. He pitches <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> perfect level and tone". Grant's appearance in Doctor Who was teased by the BBC via Twitter, announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012. Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script, and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme. The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian McKellen. The two children Clara is governess to, Digby and Francesca, were played by real-life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie Darcey-Alden.|$|E

On 25 June the Duke of Wellington persuaded the House of Lords to pass <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> <b>that</b> same night Peel's Irish Coercion Bill was defeated in the Commons by 292 to 219 by [...] "a combination of Whigs, Radicals, and Tory protectionists". Following this, on 29 June 1846, Peel resigned as prime minister.|$|E
2500|$|News of the franchise's future {{has emerged}} {{multiple}} times since the game's release. PC Gamer accidentally released an image in its 2006 holiday issue where Gears of War {{can be seen}} in a Games for Windows display, which led to suspicion that Gears of War would be released for the PC; however, the image was later stated to be a mock-up. Possible leaked pictures were released on February 13, 2007, leading to more suspicion of Gears on the PC. In an interview with Xbox fan site TeamXbox, Mark Rein stated that the game would eventually come to the PC; Epic was not currently ready to release <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> format, but the upcoming release of Unreal Tournament 3 was [...] "helping (Epic) get optimization on the PC".|$|E
