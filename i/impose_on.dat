5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by the consent of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to <b>impose</b> <b>on</b> Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|On 17 and 18 June, Tonogal and Lieutenant Colonel Aganović, {{gendarmerie}} commander {{for eastern}} Herzegovina, made {{an attempt to}} calm the situation by visiting villages east of the Gacko–Avtovac road to re-establish peace in the area. They received a written message from four villages {{that they did not}} acknowledge the NDH authorities, and wanted the message to be passed on to the Italians. The residents of the villages of Jasenik and Lipnik were willing to talk and return to work, but they asked that the gendarmerie not visit their villages, as this would tempt the Montenegrins to attack. Aganović assessed that while this was probably true, their request was insincere. The gendarmerie commander in Bileća believed that the reason for the rebellion was that the local Serbs were wedded to the idea of Greater Serbia, and did not accept that their villages were part of the NDH. This approach essentially meant that local Serbs wanted the NDH authorities to leave them alone and not <b>impose</b> <b>on</b> their lives. According to the historian Davor Marijan, this was a poor choice that gave the Ustaše an excuse to take radical action.|$|E
5|$|Production of Star Wars: Dark Forces {{began in}} September 1993, with Daron Stinnett as project leader and Justin Chin as lead writer. The {{developers}} wanted {{to adapt the}} first-person shooter format to include strategy and puzzles, which at the time, had never been done. Dark Forces thus features numerous logic puzzles {{and parts of the}} game requires a strategic method to progress, often involving manipulation of the environment. This style of gameplay has remained constant in all Jedi Knight games. Another aspect that has remained the same since Dark Forces is the use of John Williams' soundtrack from the Star Wars films. In Dark Forces the music was implemented using iMuse, software that alters the music depending on what is happening at any given moment in the game. Lucasarts developed the Jedi game engine to power Dark Forces, adding features to the first-person shooter genre that were uncommon at the time, such as multi-level floors and free look, as well as athletic abilities such as running, jumping, ducking and swimming. Original plans for the game had Luke Skywalker as the main character, but due to the limitations this would <b>impose</b> <b>on</b> the story, the developers designed a new character, Kyle Katarn.|$|E

25|$|On June 29, 1948, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held, in a 2-to-1 {{decision}} {{written by}} Judge Thomas Walter Swan, that Section 9(h) did not impermissibly <b>impose</b> <b>on</b> union members' First Amendment rights. Attorney Victor Rabinowitz appealed {{the case to}} the Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on November 8, 1949. Although the Court was due to hear oral argument on January 13, 1949, it delayed this in order to take on another case (United Steelworkers of America v. National Labor Relations Board) with almost identical issues. Argument was rescheduled for February 28, 1949, but did not occur until October 11 so that both cases could be heard together.|$|E
25|$|The CFP franc {{was created}} in December 1945, {{together}} with the CFA franc, used in Africa. The reason {{for the creation of}} these francs was the weakness of the French franc immediately after the Second World War. When France ratified the Bretton Woods Agreement in December 1945, the French franc was devalued in order to set a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. New currencies were created in the French colonies to spare them the strong devaluation of December 1945. René Pleven, the French minister of finance, was quoted saying: “In a show of her generosity and selflessness, metropolitan France, wishing not to <b>impose</b> <b>on</b> her far-away daughters the consequences of her own poverty, is setting different exchange rates for their currency.” The CFA franc and the other colonial currencies were set at a fixed exchange rate with the French franc. However, the CFP franc was set at a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar, which {{played a major role in}} the economy of the French Pacific territories on account of World War II. That situation ended in September 1949 when the CFP franc was given a fixed exchange rate with the French franc.|$|E
25|$|Records {{during this}} period are scanty, but both sides of Anselm's {{immediate}} family {{appear to have been}} dispossessed by these decisions in favour of their extended relations. His father Gundulph or Gundulf was a Lombard noble, probably one of Adelaide's Arduinici uncles or cousins; his mother Ermenberga was almost certainly the granddaughter of Conrad the Peaceful, related both to the Anselmid bishops of Aosta and to the heirs of HenryII who had been passed over in favour of Conrad. The marriage was thus probably arranged for political reasons but was incapable of resisting Conrad's decrees after his successful annexation of Burgundy on 1 August 1034. (Bishop Burchard subsequently revolted against imperial control but was defeated; he was ultimately translated to Lyons.) Ermenberga appears to have been the wealthier of the two. Gundulph moved to his wife's town, where she held a palace, likely near the cathedral, along with a villa in the valley. Anselm's father is sometimes described as having a harsh and violent temper but contemporary accounts merely portray him as having been overgenerous or careless with his wealth; Anselm's patient and devoutly religious mother, meanwhile, made up for her husband's fault with her own prudent management of the family estates. In later life, there are records of three relations who visited Bec: Folceraldus, Haimo, and Rainaldus. The first repeatedly attempted to <b>impose</b> <b>on</b> Anselm's success but was rebuffed owing to his ties to another monastery; the latter two Anselm attempted in vain to persuade to join his community.|$|E

25|$|The 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, {{and local}} chiefs sought to gain European {{protection}} from their enemies by granting settlers what they probably considered {{was only a}} right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured legal ownership of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could <b>impose</b> <b>on</b> tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In {{the early years of}} the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months’ labour a year at this time. Before 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needed much labour for a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners’ interpretations of them. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year for thangata and Hut tax, much of this in the growing season leaving tenants with little time to grow food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to stay. In this situation thangata came to mean forced labour.|$|E
