5|$|The church {{furniture}} (pews, pulpit, reading {{desk and}} chancel rail) {{is from the}} 19th century; all the items are all decorated with trefoil holes. A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded some plain silver-plated items (chalice, paten, <b>flagon</b> and alms dish) without inscriptions or dates.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and <b>flagon</b> of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E

5|$|At the {{succession}} of King Henry I, the new king imprisoned Ranulf in the Tower of London on 15 August 1100 on charges of embezzlement. His custodian, William de Mandeville, allowed the bishop to escape on 3 February 1101. Flambard {{was not only the}} first inmate of the prison, but also the first person to escape from it. A popular legend represents the bishop as descending from the window of his cell by a rope which friends had smuggled to him in a <b>flagon</b> of wine. Ranulf gave the wine to his guards, and after they were drunk and asleep, climbed down the rope to escape. His friends had arranged a ship to transport Ranulf, some of the bishop's treasure, and the bishop's elderly mother to Normandy. He took refuge across the English Channel with Henry's brother Robert Curthose, where {{he became one of the}} duke's principal advisors. King Henry dispossessed Ranulf of his lands at Whitsun in 1101, and the new Archbishop of York Gerard deposed him from his bishopric. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm arranged for Flambard's trial in a papal court for simony, and a papal decree was issued against Ranulf.|$|E
5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The <b>Flagon</b> (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} prior to the incident, chief Mona Rudao held a traditional wedding banquet for his son Daho Mona, during which animals were slaughtered and wine was prepared and drunk. A Japanese police officer named Katsuhiko Yoshimura was on patrol in the area, and was offered a cup of wine by Daho Mona as a symbolic gesture. The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona's hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to take hold of the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Chief Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a <b>flagon</b> of wine at the officer's house, but was rejected. The simmering resentment among the Seediq in Musha was finally pushed to the limit.|$|E
500|$|A {{survey of}} church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 {{recorded}} three silver items: a plain chalice dated 1887–88, a paten dated 1803–04, and a <b>flagon</b> inscribed [...] "Bodedern 1809". The author noted that church records from 1776 to 1831 included mention of another silver chalice, dated 1574, with other references to a <b>flagon</b> and a paten made from pewter, {{but these were}} no longer to be found.|$|E

500|$|A {{survey of}} church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 {{recorded}} an Elizabethan silver chalice from about 1575, just over [...] tall, and a plain silver paten {{and a silver}} <b>flagon</b> both dated 1904–05. The mark [...] "IL" [...] within a shield on the chalice probably refers to John Lynglay, an Elizabethan goldsmith from Chester; {{it was one of}} four chalices in the diocese to be marked in this way. The survey also noted that the church no longer had the pewter <b>flagon</b> and dish recorded in the church terriers between 1788 and 1821.|$|E
500|$|Other pieces {{include the}} altar dish and <b>flagon</b> made in 1691 for the royal chapel at the Tower of London.

500|$|A {{survey of}} church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 {{recorded}} an engraved chalice dated 1842 and a paten dated 1776–77; both {{are made from}} silver and are decorated with foliage. A silver <b>flagon</b> bears an inscription to denote that it was given by William Bulkeley Hughes when the new church was consecrated in 1856. The survey also noted a <b>flagon</b> from about 1700 and a dish, both made of pewter, but said that an 18th-century silver chalice had been lost some time after 1811.

500|$|The font is at {{the rear}} of the nave on the north side. [...] It is {{octagonal}} on the outside, with a circular bowl inside.

[...] The author commented that the nearby church of St Cadwaladr, Llangadwaladr had an [...] "exactly similar dish" [...] from the same donor. He also noted that church records from 1793, 1801 and 1808 showed that a silver chalice belonging to the church had been lost, as had a pewter paten and <b>flagon.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937 also noted the early 18th-century communion rails, a plain oak communion table dated 1731, and a wooden font cover dated 1714. Other memorials, {{including}} parts of an early 14th-century inscribed slab, were also recorded. Three items of church silver {{were included in the}} survey: a cup (dated 1610–1611), a paten (1719) and a <b>flagon</b> (1743). [...] Externally, an 18th-century brass sundial on a slate pedestal was noted, as was a weathered decorated stone on the lychgate, thought to be from the 10th century.

[...] The plaque, which was previously in the old church, bears three shields, one with the coat of arms of Williams, another with Marcelie Lloyd's arms, and the middle one with the two coats of arms combined. [...] Below the shields, husband and wife are shown with their children (Anne, William and Griffith) kneeling in prayer on cushions. [...] The survey also noted a plain silver cup, dated 1711–1712. Other items of communion plate (an inscribed silver chalice, a plain silver paten and a plain silver <b>flagon)</b> were donated by Gwyn Gertrude Hughes in 1866. The church furniture (including the octagonal wooden pulpit and the choir stalls) dates from the 19th century, although the octagonal font was reused from the old church.|$|E
