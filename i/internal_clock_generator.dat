50|$|The MOS Technology 6512, 6513, 6514, and 6515 each rely on an {{external}} clock, {{instead of using}} an <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> like the 650x (e.g. 6502).

50|$|With Sandy Bridge, Intel has {{tied the}} speed of every bus (USB, SATA, PCI, PCI-E, CPU cores, Uncore, memory etc.) to a single <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> issuing the basic 100 MHz Base Clock (BClk). With CPUs being {{multiplier}} locked, {{the only way to}} overclock is to increase the BClk, which can be raised by only 5-7% without other hardware components failing. As a work around, Intel made available K/X-series processors, which feature unlocked multipliers; with a multiplier cap of 57 for Sandy Bridge. For the Sandy Bridge E platform, there is alternative method known as the BClk ratio overclock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An ultra {{low-power}} {{digital signal}} processor (DSP) is proposed for the digital hearing aid.

5000|$|In Fig3, {{the circuit}} shows how data {{transition}} technique can {{be beneficial for}} power saving. The XNOR logical function is performed on the input of the D Flip-Flop and the output Q. When Q and D are equal, output of the logical XNOR will be zero thereby gating the <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> and generating no <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> Referring to Fig3, {{we can see that}} the circuit can be broken down into 3 parts, namely data-transition look ahead, pulse <b>generator,</b> <b>clock</b> <b>generator.</b> The pulse generator output is given into the <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> which is used to clock the D flip Flop. Based on the input and output signals, if {{there is a need to}} change the state of the D flop then the clock is allowed to switch to cause a transition else the clock is not allowed to transition. When the clock is not to make a transition, some time has been already spent in computing the logic and data from the D input may make it through the first stage of the D flop and some power is consumed. this power consumption is still less than what an ordinary flop would have consumed with a clock transition and no change in output. As it can be noticed the pulse generator is still generating pulse at every external clock edge. This too can be controlled and a technique that controls this part of the circuit is Clock On Demand.|$|R
40|$|With {{shrinking}} {{technologies and}} higher clock rates comes {{the possibility to}} transform multi chip implementations to a single System on Chip (SoC). Implementing clock distribution and limiting the power consumption becomes increasingly troublesome with increased clock rate and chip area. Therefore, designing large Systems on Chip makes it necessary to search for new implementation methods. In this thesis, problems related to clock distribution and power consumption on a digital SoC are addressed. Five papers are presented that focus on implementation issues for SoC with multiple clock regions and multiple supply voltages. Paper I presents a low power, high frequency, small area digitally controlled on-chip <b>clock</b> <b>generator.</b> The <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> is designed and fabricated using a 350 nm technology and delivers up to 1. 15 GHz at 3. 3 V supply voltage. At 1. 0 V supply voltage, it delivers up to 92 MHz while consuming 0. 16 mW. Paper II presents a fully integrated <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> with behavior similar to a PLL. A free-running ring oscillator is used as <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> and the output clock is generated using two counters. The <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> is described in synthesizable VHDL-code and can therefore easily be implemented from standard cells found in any commercial CMOS standard cell library. Paper III presents a fully integrated digitally controlled PLL used as a clock multiplying circuit. The PLL has no off-chip components and it is made from standard cells found in most digital standard cell libraries. In paper IV, a hardware solution for assigning two supply voltages to a design divided into blocks is presented. The two supply voltages are optimized using an on-chip controller. The on-chip controller assigns one out of two supply voltages to each block. This defines a solution suitable for reconfigurable designs. Paper V presents a low-complexity method to simplify communication between modules using uncorrelated clocks. A description in synthesizable VHDL-code including local <b>clock</b> <b>generators</b> makes the method portable between technologies...|$|R
