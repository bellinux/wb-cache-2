5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} of Night {{came at a}} <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for the genre of memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir and memory.|$|E
5|$|Japan's small {{agricultural}} sector, however, is {{also highly}} subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America.

5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film {{tells the story of a}} woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Asch was shy when {{he moved}} to the United States and did not speak English fluently. He went to the {{neighborhood}} public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade. As a result of the language barrier, Asch had a very <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> understanding in class. He learned English by reading Charles Dickens. Asch later attended Townsend Harris High School, a very selective high school attached to the City College of New York. After high school, he attended the City College of New York, majoring in both literature and science. He became interested in psychology towards the end of his undergraduate career after reading the work of William James and a few philosophers. In 1928, when he was 21 years old, he received his Bachelor of Science.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a <b>difficult</b> <b>time.</b> Staff were leaving in droves, living {{conditions}} were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Japan brought {{as many as}} 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor. About 5,000–8,000 Koreans {{were killed}} in Hiroshima and another 1,500–2,000 died in Nagasaki. For many years, Korean {{survivors}} had a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation {{which resulted in the}} denial of the free health benefits to them. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s were a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> financially, {{with less}} foreign work coming through; though they headed the {{consortium}} that built the Mosul Dam in Iraq from 1981-84. There was domestic growth, {{highlighted by the}} architecturally radical Messe Torhaus in Frankfurt, completed in 1984. It was later involved {{in the construction of}} the Messeturm in the same city; once completed in 1991 it was Europe's tallest building. In the mid-1990s, Hochtief was involved in yet another major skyscraper development in Frankfurt, the Commerzbank Tower, which overtook the Messeturm to become Europe's tallest building, losing the record to Triumph-Palace in Moscow in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and had a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> getting through the real-life censors. They had issues {{with the size of}} the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E

5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did {{not sit well with}} Daltrey, and a recording session of R covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.|$|E
5|$|Their father, Richard, {{often took}} Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions {{to make more}} money for the family. They offered their discoveries for sale to {{tourists}} on a table outside their home. This was a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for England's poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.|$|E

5|$|Zoroastrians had <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> {{during the}} Safavid period and faced {{repeated}} persecution and forced conversion. Safavid kings sought to compel {{them to accept}} Shia Islam, Sunnis too were forced to convert to Shia or were killed. Zoroastrians were also branded as impure, {{in addition to being}} infidels. As earlier in the century, so this period also witnessed sporadic campaigns for the conversion of Armenians and Zoroastrians, focusing blame for economic and other ills on these and other minorities whose involvement in the spice export, for example, was well known.|$|E
5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
