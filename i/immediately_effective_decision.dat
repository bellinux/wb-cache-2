40|$|Software {{development}} projects have enormously extended over the boundaries set {{by a single}} company, or country. As the communication media available becomes more sophisticated and cost effective, advanced technologies have forced the software development trend towards so called “virtual” nature. This similar trend {{can be seen in}} most of software development companies in Sri Lanka. In such environments collaborations at the project level involve a network of virtual team members actively participated in common activities. This has created new challenges for <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making in virtual project teams, as existing processes are often ill adapted for facilitating collaborative work. Even though many researchers have studied various aspects of these problems, questions regarding <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making remain under investigated. Therefore this study tried to understand the impact of <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making on virtual software development project success. In achieving the first objective as finding out the determining factors of <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making in virtual software {{development projects}}, factors such as team autonomy, management of socio emotional factors, and effective communication were found most critical after reviewing the existing literature on virtual project decision making. A conceptual model was developed in order to test the relationships which arrived in the hypothesis. Then an exploratory study using a quantitative approach was conducted. It involved an online survey which was sent to 200 project management representatives of large, medium and small virtual software development companies in Sri Lanka. Second and third objectives of the study were finding out the nature of relationships between determining factors and <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making and relationship between project success and <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making respectively which was supported with detailed statistical data analysis. The results clearly indicated that success of virtual project teams is strongly related with the effectiveness of project decisions. Moreover, it has highlighted {{the fact that there are}} positive relationships with all determining factors and the <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making. Among them team autonomy has the strongest correlation with the <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> making. It indicated that if the project team was given more independence, the decisions made on the project endeavors will be more effective. Therefore, study was concluded that decision making determining factors which tested in the model were important to manage a virtual project successfully. The outcome of the study will contribute to a better understanding of the issues involved, and provide valuable insights for present and future project managers who manage virtual software development projects. Finally, recommendations were suggested to improve decision making effectiveness in virtual software development projects in Sri Lanka...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} of wind energy has grown. It is starting to play {{a large role in}} generating renewable, clean energy around the world. In New Zealand, there is increasing recognition and awareness of global warming and the pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, as well as the increased difficulty of obtaining oil from foreign sources, and the fluctuating price of non-renewable energy products. This makes wind energy a very attractive alternative to keep New Zealand clean and green. There are many issues involved in wind farm development. These issues can be grouped into two categories - economic issues and environmental issues. Wind farm developers often use site selection process to minimise the impact of these issues. This thesis aims to develop GIS based models that provide <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> support tool for evaluating, at a regional scale, potential wind farm locations. This thesis firstly identifies common issues involved in wind farm development. Then, by reviewing previous research on wind farm site selection, methods and models used by academic and corporate sector to solve issues are listed. Criteria for an <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> support tool are also discussed. In this case, an <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> support tool needs to be flexible, easy to implement and easy to use. More specifically, an <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> support tool needs to provide users the ability to identify areas that are suitable for wind farm development based on different criteria. Having established the structure and criteria for a wind farm analysis model, a GIS based tool was implemented using AML code using a Boolean logic model approach. This method uses binary maps for the final analysis. There are a total of 3645 output maps produced based on different combination of criteria. These maps can be used to conduct sensitivity analysis. This research concludes that an effective GIS analysis tool can be developed for provide <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> support for evaluating wind farm sites...|$|R

40|$|Designing <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> {{support systems}} for complex {{logistics}} planning is necessarily challenging to accomplish. Only now, {{with the advent}} of the Air Expeditionary Force concept of operations and impending advancements in logistics database capabilities, is an <b>effective</b> desktop <b>decision</b> support system for production level supervisors a feasible reality. Several factors including knowledge about resources and requirements, uncertainty, work domain task constraints, and database capabilities influence the decision making process of the logistics professional. To develop <b>effective</b> <b>decision</b> support systems, this research proposed a methodology that incorporates image theoretical constructs, work domain analysis, decision analysis, and knowledge-based heuristical modeling to capture and transform expert mental frameworks into computer-based support systems for supporting daily decision making. Specifically, this research includes knowledge-based model development and implementation. The model development was based on two components. First, it was based on field study observations and interviews with real-world logisticians at two air bases.
