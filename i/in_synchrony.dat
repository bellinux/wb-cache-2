25|$|Neural {{synchronization}} can be modulated by task constraints, such as attention, and {{is thought}} {{to play a role}} in feature binding, neuronal communication, and motor coordination. Neuronal oscillations became a hot topic in neuroscience in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by Gray, Singer and others appeared to support the neural binding hypothesis. According to this idea, synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object. For example, when a person looks at a tree, visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate <b>in</b> <b>synchrony</b> to form a single representation of the tree. This phenomenon is best seen in local field potentials which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons, but has also been shown in EEG and MEG recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping.|$|E

We utilized a new satellite-based data set of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) canopy biomass to examine population <b>synchrony</b> <b>in</b> southern California kelp forests on spatial scales ranging from 50 m to 300 km and temporal scales ranging from 1 to 11 years. We examined the relationship between synchrony and distance for adult kelp populations, kelp recruits, sea urchin abundance (a major grazer of kelp), and environmental variables known to influence kelp population dynamics. Population <b>synchrony</b> <b>in</b> giant kelp decreased with distance between populations: an initial rapid exponential decrease between 50 m and 1. 3 km was followed by a second, large-scale decrease between distances of 1. 3 km and 172 km. The 50 -m to 1. 3 -km spatial scale corresponded to the scales of <b>synchrony</b> <b>in</b> the abundance of sea urchins and young kelp recruits, suggesting that local drivers of predation and recruitment influence small-scale <b>synchrony</b> <b>in</b> kelp populations. The spatial correlation patterns of environmental variables, particularly wave height, were similar to the synchrony–distance relationship of kelp populations from 1. 3 km to 172 km, suggesting that regional environmental variability, i. e., the Moran effect, was the dominant process affecting synchrony at larger spatial scales. This two-step pattern in the relationship between kelp biomass synchrony and distance was apparent in each of the 11 years of our study.

25|$|The {{development}} of schooling behavior was probably {{associated with an}} increased quality of perception, predatory lifestyle and size sorting mechanisms to avoid cannibalism. In filter-feeding ancestors, before vision and the OLS had developed, the risk of predation would have been limited and mainly due to invertebrate predators, hence, at that time, safety in numbers was probably not a major incentive for gathering together in shoals or schools. The {{development of}} the OLS, and vision, would have permitted detection of potential prey. This could have led to an increased potential for cannibalism within the shoal. On the other hand, increased quality of perception would also give small individuals a chance to escape or to never join a shoal with larger fish. It has been shown that small fish avoid joining a group with larger fish, although big fish do not avoid joining small conspecifics. This sorting mechanism based on increased quality of perception could have resulted in homogeneity of size of fish in shoals, which would increase the capacity for moving <b>in</b> <b>synchrony.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pursuit {{predation}} {{revolves around}} a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move {{to find new}} foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships {{can be used as}} support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations <b>in</b> <b>synchrony,</b> which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also metapopulation persistence.|$|E

Contrary to expectation, the number and quality (as measured by mass) of fledglings produced in reversed broods was the same as that for unmanipulated broods, as were recapture rates of juveniles and offspring recruitment to subsequent breeding populations. Thus, the results do not support the individual-optimization hypothesis as an explanation of intrapopulation variation in brood hatching intervals in this House Wren population. In this and other studies we have not been able to detect any advantage associated with producing either synchronous or asynchronous broods.

500|$|Mu waves, {{also known}} as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or {{sensorimotor}} rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, {{in the part of}} the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [...] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing <b>in</b> <b>synchrony.</b> The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics.

Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire <b>in</b> <b>synchrony</b> with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an [...] "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.|$|E

How synchronous activity in cortico-hippocampal circuits is progressively modified with repeated drug exposure, however, remains to be characterized. Drugs of abuse induce both short-term and long-term adaptations in cortical and hippocampal circuits and these changes are likely important {{for the expression of}} the altered behavioral and neurobiological phenotype associated with addiction. The present study explores how the initial (up to one hour) pharmacological response to D-Amphetamine (AMPH) is altered with repeated injections in the rat. The methods employed herein allow for the progressive changes in synchronized dynamics with repeated intermittent AMPH exposure to be characterized over short time scales (minutes). Specifically, we examined the temporal variations of phase-locking strength in delta and theta bands within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and between PFC and hippocampus (HC) shortly after drug injection. After the first injection of AMPH synchrony increased within the PFC in the delta band, which was followed, by an increase <b>in</b> theta <b>synchrony</b> between the PFC and HC several minutes later. This relationship switched after repeated AMPH injections, where increases <b>in</b> theta <b>synchrony</b> between the PFC and HC preceded increases <b>in</b> delta <b>synchrony</b> <b>in</b> the PFC. The time-course of increases in synchronous activity were negatively correlated between the PFC delta and the PFC-HC theta.
