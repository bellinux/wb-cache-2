40|$|Introduction. The main {{indication}} for knee arthrodesis in tumor {{surgery is}} a tumor that requires an extensive resection {{in which the}} joint surface cannot be preserved. We report a patient that had knee <b>desarthrodesis</b> 41 years after giant cell tumor resection followed by a knee arthrodesis. This is the longest reported follow-up after <b>desarthrodesis</b> and conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA), almost ten years. Case Report. A 71 -year-old man with a distal femoral giant cell tumor had undergone a resection of the distal femur and knee arthrodesis using Kuntscher nail in 1962. In July 2003 he experienced gradually increasing pain of his left knee. We performed a <b>desarthrodesis</b> and conversion to TKA in 2005. The postoperative period passed uneventfully as his pain and gait improved, with gradually increasing range of motion (ROM) and no infection. He now walks independently, with no brace or contractures. Conclusion. <b>Desarthrodesis</b> of the knee joint and conversion to TKA are a difficult surgical choice with a high complication risk. However, our patient’s life style has improved, he has no pain, and he can ascend and descend stairs more easily. The surgeon {{has to be very}} meticulous in selecting a patient for knee arthrodesis and counseling them to realize that their expectations may not be achievable...|$|E

30|$|The {{outcomes}} of knee arthrodesis are mixed. By salvaging the limb, knee arthrodesis can enable patients to ambulate {{without the use}} of assistive devices. This outcome facilitates mobility, and allows patients to maintain independence. However, the disadvantages of knee arthrodesis are notable—walking with an arthrodesis is more physically demanding than normal gait, and an immobilized knee can make activities of daily living such as sitting and tying ones shoes difficult. These chronic disadvantages have pressed some patients to elect for <b>desarthrodesis,</b> or reversal of a previous fusion, in spite of its high complication rate (Kuchinad et al. 2014; Ruggieri et al. 2010; Cho et al. 2008; Clemens et al. 2005; Kernkamp et al. 2016; Jauregui et al. 2016). In cases where radical revision surgery to save knee function is inadvisable or unethical, patients may even prefer to have the affected limb amputated rather than fused (Capozzi et al. 2009).|$|E
