40|$|Abstract: There {{are several}} methods for image {{encryption}} using chaotic function. In recent year, several new image encryption variation of chaotic method has been developed. This paper presents a new 2 -D chaos based lossless image encryption method. This method is user key based encryption and decryption. Presented method {{is based on}} series of confusion and diffusion processes guided by user key. This method generates large key space which results bruit force attack. <b>In</b> <b>spites</b> of this, proposed algorithm is simple enough to consume fewer amounts of computations resulting fast processing. Statistical analysis of this method has been performed and result shows that proposed method is secure enough and is suitable for image encryption...|$|R

The standard replicator dynamic predicts that evolutionarily stable strategies are payo#-maximizing equilibria of the underlying game, and hence rules out the evolution of spiteful behavior. We propose a modified replicator dynamic, where selection is based on local outcomes, rather than on the population "state", as in standard models. We show that under this new model spite can evolve readily. The new dynamic suggests conditions under which <b>spite</b> <b>in</b> animals might be found...|$|R

While both men bickered and bantered all the while, they formed a friendship or camaraderie of sorts, even drinking a toast when he was imprisoned by the JLA. Still, T.O.
