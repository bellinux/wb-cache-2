40|$|AbstractBreast calcifications, {{defined as}} calcium {{deposits}} within breast tissue, can arise from {{a vast number}} of aetiologies. Diffuse or scattered distribution is typically seen in benign entities. Approximately 95 % of all Ductal carcinoma-in-situ, which represents 25 – 30 % of all reported breast cancers are diagnosed because of mammographically detected microcalcifications. In this investigation dedicated to breast calcifications, we assessed at the micrometer scale their chemical nature through last generation micro-Fourier transform Infrared microspectroscopy and their structural characteristics through last generation field emission scanning electron microscopy. Several striking results have been obtained. Heavily mineralized deposits seem {{to be the result of}} the agglomeration of micrometer scale spherules and for the first time, we show that micrometer scale spherules display very different internal structure. Moreover, while Ca phosphate apatite and calcium oxalate dihydrate are the two chemical phases usually reported, we underline the presence of a third chemical phase namely amorphous carbonated calcium phosphate. In the case of duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the chemical composition as well as the carbonate level are very inhomogeneous even <b>inside</b> <b>micrometer</b> scale breast calcifications. Moreover, for some samples related to DCIS, special features at the micrometer scale seem to be related to this pathology because they were not found for the other pathologies...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{modification}} of the tube etching process for the fabrication of fiber probes for near-field optical microscopy. It increases the taper angle of the probe {{by a factor of}} two. The novelty is that the fiber is immersed in hydrofluoric acid and chemically etched in an upside-down geometry. The tip formation occurs <b>inside</b> the <b>micrometer</b> tube cavity formed by the polymeric jacket. By applying this approach, called reverse tube etching, to multimode fibers with 200 / 250 mu m core/cladding diameter, we have fabricated tapered regions featuring high surface smoothness and average cone angles of similar to 30 degrees. A simple model based on the crucial role of the gravity in removing the etching products, explains the tip formation process. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The capillaries have a width of a single cell in diameter to aid in the fast and easy diffusion of gases, sugars and nutrients to surrounding tissues. Capillaries have no smooth muscle surrounding them and have a diameter less than that of red blood cells; a red blood cell is typically 7 micrometers outside diameter, capillaries typically 5 <b>micrometers</b> <b>inside</b> diameter. The red blood cells must distort in order to pass through the capillaries.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{identifying}} the reactive zones inside limestone used in monuments exposed to fog. The location of these zones {{and the depth}} of the water penetration front is of primary relevance to evaluate the transport of aggressive species and the influence of environmental conditions on alteration mechanisms and kinetics of limestone exposed to the atmosphere. We report here the results of weathering experiments conducted in a deuterium-enriched environment and the characterization of reactive zones analyzed by NanoSIMS. It was determined that water penetrated several hundred <b>micrometers</b> <b>inside</b> the limestone and that only the first micrometers were significantly altered...|$|R
40|$|X-ray nanobeams {{are unique}} {{nondestructive}} probes that allow direct {{measurements of the}} nanoscale strain distribution and composition <b>inside</b> the <b>micrometer</b> thick layered structures that are found in most electronic device architectures. However, the method is usually extremely time-consuming, and as a result, data sets are often constrained to a few or even single objects. Here we demonstrate that by special design of a nanofocused X-ray beam diffraction experiment we can (in a single 2 D scan with no sample rotation) measure the individual strain and composition profiles of many structures {{in an array of}} upright standing nanowires. We make use of the observation that in the generic nanowire device configuration, which is found in high-speed transistors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes, each wire exhibits very small degrees of random tilts and twists toward the substrate. Although the tilt and twist are very small, they give a new contrast mechanism between different wires. In the present case, we image complex nanowires for nanoLED fabrication and compare to theoretical simulations, demonstrating that this fast method is suitable for real nanostructured devices...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe “molecular stencil patterning” {{technique}} {{has been used}} to optimize at high coverage the distribution of aminopropylsilyl tethers (APS) grafted into the nanochannels of a mesostructured MCM- 41 type porous silica. To probe this distribution, the APS functions are first derivatized via a Schiff reaction with a 5 -substituted 1, 10 -phenanthroline possessing an aldehyde side arm, and second, reacted with europium(III) ions used as a analytical marker. The integrity of the porous structure has been checked using XRD and N 2 adsorption−desorption profiles, whereas the molecular nature of the grafted Eu complex was characterized using 13 C NMR, FT-IR, reflectance UV−visible, and luminescence spectroscopies. EDX-TEM measurements at the 1. 5 × 1. 5 nm resolution scale reveal a rather homogeneous distribution of Eu and, therefore, of APS tethers for several <b>micrometers</b> <b>inside</b> the fibers...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method to}} produce optical waveguides is {{demonstrated}} for lithium niobate (LiNbO 3). It {{is based on}} electronic excitation damage by swift ions, i. e., with energies at approximately 1 MeV/amu or above. The new technique uses high-energy medium-mass ions, such as Cl, with electronic stopping powers above the threshold value for amorphization (5 - 6 keV/nm), reaching the maximum value a few <b>micrometers</b> <b>inside</b> the crystal. At the ultralow fluence regime (1012 - 1013 cm- 2) an effective nanostructured medium is obtained that behaves as an optical waveguide where light propagates transversally to the amorphous nanotracks created by every single impact. The method implies a reduction of 4 orders of magnitude with respect to He implantation. The optical waveguides present reasonable losses (∼ 10 dB/cm) and significant second-harmonic generation (SHG) and electro-optic (EO) responses (> 50 % bulk) for the lowest fluences. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

40|$|Eukaryotic DNA {{is wrapped}} around histone {{proteins}} to form nucleosomes, the fundamental repeati ng unit of chromatin. DNA packaging into chromatin both solves and creates problems. It allows the centimeters, or even meters, of DNA that constitute a eukaryotic genome to fit <b>inside</b> a <b>micrometer</b> - scale cell nucleus. Nucleosomes also block {{access to the}} D NA, necessitating complex rearrangements to allow for transcription, replication, recombination, or repair, while also providing a way to regulate these processes. ATP - dependent chromatin remodelers slide, assemble, disassemble, and alter nucleosomes to en able and regulate DNA - dependent processes. In parallel, topoisomerases relieve the tangles, torsional stress, and supercoils generated when DNA is exposed and unwound. Topoisomerases also enable efficient nucleosome remodeling. In this thesis, we use genom ewide and single - locus techniques to study the interplay between DNA topoisomerases, Snf 2 family chromati n remodelers, and transcription in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We find that topoisomerase activity is essential for transcription elon gation and for proper chromatin structure at genes, which in turn are required for efficient transcription initiation and termination. This is partially mediated by cooperation with chromatin remodelers. We also find that the fission yeast Chd 1 subfamily r emodelers maintain correct gene body nucleosome positioning, which inhibits cryptic transcription initiation. Finally, we show that the Fun 30 subfamily chromatin remodeler Fft 2 is involved in centromere function and heterochromatic silencing, as well as th e full transcription of highly transcribed genes. Fft 2 and its paralog Fft 3 also regulate the transcriptional response to stress. As {{a part of this}} function, Fft 2 and Fft 3 repress retrotransposons by a novel mechanism, in which they enforce the use of an a lternative transcription start site...|$|R
40|$|As {{discussed}} in {{the first chapter of}} this book, there are many different methods to measure a part using optical technology. Chapter 2 discussed the use of machine vision to measure macroscopic features such as length and position, which was extended to the use of interferometry as a linear measurement tool in chapter 3, and laser or other trackers to find the relation of key points on large parts in chapter 4. This chapter looks at measuring large parts to optical tolerances in the sub-micron range using interferometry, ranging, and optical tools {{discussed in}} the previous chapters. The purpose of this chapter is not to discuss specific metrology tools (such as interferometers or gauges), but to describe a systems engineering approach to testing large parts. Issues such as material warpage and temperature drifts that may be insignificant when measuring a part to micron levels under a microscope, as will be discussed in later chapters, can prove to be very important when making the same measurement over a larger part. In this chapter, we will define a set of guiding principles for successfully overcoming these challenges and illustrate the application of these principles with real world examples. While these examples are drawn from specific large optical testing applications, they inform the problems associated with testing any large part to optical tolerances. Manufacturing today relies on micrometer level part performance. Fields such as energy and transportation are demanding higher tolerances to provide increased efficiencies and fuel savings. By looking at how the optics industry approaches sub-micrometer metrology, one can {{gain a better understanding of}} the metrology challenges for any larger part specified to micrometer tolerances. Testing large parts, whether optical components or precision structures, to optical tolerances is just like testing small parts, only harder. Identical with what one does for small parts, a metrologist tests large parts and optics in particular to quantify their mechanical properties (such as dimensions, mass, etc); their optical prescription or design (i. e. radius of curvature, conic constant, vertex location, size); and their full part shape. And, just as with small parts, a metrologist accomplishes these tests using distance measuring instruments such as tape measures, <b>inside</b> <b>micrometers,</b> coordinate measuring machines, distance measuring interferometers; angle measuring instruments such as theodolites, autocollimators; and surface measuring instruments including interferometers, stylus profilers, interference microscopes, photogrammetric cameras, or other tools. However, while the methodology may be similar, it is more difficult to test a large object for the simple reason that most metrologists do not have the necessary intuition. The skills used to test small parts or optics in a laboratory do not extrapolate to testing large parts in an industrial setting any more than a backyard gardener might successfully operate a farm. But first, what is a large part? A simple definition might be the part's size or diameter. For optics and diffuse surface parts alike, the driving constraint is ability to illuminate the part's surface. For reflective convex mirrors, large is typically anything greater than 1 meter. But, for refractive optics, flats or convex mirrors, large is typically greater than 0. 5 meter. While a size definition is simple, it may be less than universal. A more nuanced definition might be that a large part is any component which cannot be easily tested in a standard laboratory environment, on a standard vibration isolated table using standard laboratory infrastructure. A micro-switch or a precision lens might be easily measured to nanometer levels under a microscope in a lab, but a power turbine spline or a larger telescope mirror will not fit under that microscope and may not even fit on the table...|$|R
40|$|The {{root canal}} system of a tooth {{is a complex}} {{geometrical}} entity, consisting {{not only of the}} main root canal, but also of accessory and lateral canals. Bacteria can reside up to hundreds of <b>micrometers</b> <b>inside</b> those channels and may be difficult to reach for the antimicrobial agents with which root canals are irrigated during a root canal treatment. A combined numerical and experimental study was performed to assess the penetration rate of a root canal irrigant into the lateral canals and tubules, considering both diffusion and convection. The numerical model was validated experimentally using a fluorescent dye. Convection was studied separately using a Computational Fluid Dynamics model, validated with Particle Imaging Velocimetry experiments. Both diffusion and convection were found to be slow on the timescale of an irrigation procedure. The contribution of convection was limited to two canal diameters from the canal entrance, making diffusion the main irrigant transport mechanism. More than 10 min of fresh irrigant delivery was required to obtain an 86 % concentration of the irrigant {{at the far end of}} a tubule, in the ideal case of a straight tubule without reaction taking place. Diffusion was even slower when the concentration at the lateral canal entrance was not kept constant, as in the case of a single delivery, which suggests that frequent irrigant replenishment and/or irrigant activation during a root canal treatment are beneficial. Alternative methods should be considered to improve irrigant penetration into lateral canals and tubules...|$|R
40|$|Electroplaques {{dissected}} {{from the}} electric organ of Electrophorus electricus are labeled by tritiated alpha 1 -isotoxin from Naja nigricollis, a highly selective reagent of the cholinergic (nicotinic) receptor site. Preincubation {{of the cell}} with an excess of unlabeled alpha-toxin and with a covalent affinity reagent or labeling {{in the presence of}} 10 (- 4) M decamethonium reduces the binding of [3 H]alpha- toxin by at least 75 %. Absolute surface densities of alpha-toxin sites are estimated by high-resolution autoradiography on the basis of silver grain distribution and taking into account the complex geopmetry of the cell surface. Binding of [3 H]alpha-toxin on the noninnervated face does not differ from background. Labeled sites are observed on the innervated membrane both between the synapses and under the nerve terminals but the density of sites is approx. 100 times higher {{at the level of the}} synapses than in between. Analysis of the distance of silver grains from the innervated membrane shows a symmetrical distribution centered on the postsynaptic plasma membrane under the nerve terminal. In extrasynaptic areas, the barycenter of the distribution lies approximately 0. 5 <b>micrometer</b> <b>inside</b> the cell, indicating that alpha-toxin sites are present on the membrane of microinvaginations, or caveolae, abundant in the extrajunctional areas. An absolute density of 49, 600 +/- 16, 000 sites/micrometer 2 of postsynaptic membrane is calculated; it is in the range of that found at the crest of the folds at the neuromuscular junction and expected from a close packing of receptor molecules. Electric organs were denervated for periods up to 142 days. Nerve transmission fails after 2 days, and within a week all the nerve terminals disappear and are subsequently replaced by Schwann cell processes, whereas the morphology of the electroplaque remains unaffected. The denervated electroplaque develops some of the electrophysiological changes found with denervated muscles (increases of membrane resting resistance, decrease of electrical excitability) but does not become hypersensitive to cholinergic agonists. Autoradiography of electroplaques dissected from denervated electric organs reveals, after labeling with [3 H]alpha- toxin, patches of silver grains with a surface density close to that found in the normal electroplaque. The density of alpha-toxin binding sites in extrasynaptic areas remains close to that observed on innervated cells, confirming that denervation does not cause an increase in the number of cholinergic receptor sites. The patches have the same distribution, shape,and dimensions as in subneural areas of the normal electroplaque, and remnants of nerve terminal or Schwann cells are often found at the level of the patches. They most likely correspond to subsynaptic areas which persist with the same density of [3 H]alpha-toxin sites up to 52 days after denervation. In the adult synapse, therefore, the receptor protein exhibits little if any tendency for lateral diffusion...|$|R
