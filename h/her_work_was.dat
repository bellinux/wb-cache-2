5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} about 1990 or 1992 {{as part of}} {{the contemporary}} Indigenous art movement that had begun at Papunya in the 1970s. By 1998 <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> being collected by both private and public institutions, such as Charles Sturt University, and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Her career received a significant boost when <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue; her painting was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy Watson, who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Musée du quai Branly. Petrick's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong, {{as well as at the}} Australian embassy in Washington in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Nipper has a {{painting}} in the Kentucky Horse Park, a museum of and tribute to horses located in Lexington, Kentucky. Five of her paintings, depicting World Champion Quarter Horses {{are also in the}} American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in Texas. While most of <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> sold in the United States, some of her paintings are in England and South America.|$|E
50|$|About fifty of <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>are</b> known today. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{held in the}} National Gallery of Art.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> deeply Christian, {{and because}} of that has not been taken very seriously by {{literary}} critics. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> considered more pastoral than literary. She said herself, with some self-mockery: [...] "I write meditations in rhyme". Recurring themes in <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>are</b> suffering, death and Christian comfort.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>work</b> often <b>are</b> {{about current}} events (both Philippine and international), tennis, movies, music, cats, books, technology, and her {{personal}} life. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> has <b>been</b> {{the subject of}} academic study. The main ingredient to <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> often fun cynicism and irony.|$|R
5|$|Susie Bootja Bootja's {{painting}} career {{followed the}} establishment of Warlayirti Artists, an Indigenous art centre at Balgo. One of the area's strongest artists, <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> characterised by an expressive style, and has been acquired by major Australian galleries, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales and National Gallery of Victoria. She died in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Wellcome Foundation allowed Olga some {{rooms at}} St John's Lodge in London's Regent's Park, where the University College London's Institute of Archaeology had {{recently}} been established. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> almost immediately put on hold due to the outbreak of World War II, as Olga was co-opted to the BBC Arabic radio station due to her association with the Middle East. Around the same time, she also became an air raid warden.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> all but forgotten {{for a long period}} of time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>were</b> shown posthumously in Paris at the Louvre and Salon d'Automne, where Norcross was {{the first}} American {{to have had a}} retrospective. <b>Her</b> <b>works</b> <b>were</b> also shown the {{following}} year at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>works</b> <b>are</b> {{included}} in collections {{such as the}} Corning Museum of Glass, the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art and the Chrysler Museum of Art. Papers relating to <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>are</b> held at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|R

5|$|Makinti Napanangka began {{painting}} Contemporary Indigenous Australian art at Kintore in the mid-1990s, {{encouraged by}} a community art project. Interest {{in her work}} developed quickly, and she is now represented in most significant Australian public art galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia. A finalist in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award, Makinti won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2008. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> shown in the major indigenous art exhibition Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius, at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, {{a volume}} of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. Within a decade of its completion, Genji was {{distributed}} throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to {{recognize the importance of}} her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.|$|E
5|$|She {{graduated}} from the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education, now the University of New South Wales College of Fine Arts, in 1980. Winning a New South Wales Travelling Art Scholarship in 1983, she then completed a master's degree at Chelsea School of Art in 1984. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> influenced by Richard Deacon, Antony Gormley and Martin Puryear under whom she studied while in England. Upon returning from the United Kingdom, she immediately met with further success, when in 1984 she won a Moet & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship. In 1988 she was granted a period as artist-in-residence {{in the city of}} Brest on the coast of Brittany, where she studied Celtic metalworking techniques.|$|E
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} {{published by}} the Stubovi Kulture Publishing House, Belgrade. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> has <b>been</b> translated into English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Bulgarian, Korean and Hungarian.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>works</b> <b>are</b> {{in various}} museums and private {{collections}} and follow two main themes: female figures and cityscapes. <b>Her</b> figurative <b>works</b> <b>are</b> considered <b>her</b> best <b>work,</b> exhibiting a distinctive technique.|$|R
50|$|France Jodoin (born 1961) is a Canadian {{contemporary}} artist {{known for}} her maritime scenes. Painted in a semi-abstract style, <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> a modern interpretation of European Romanticism. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> found in Quebec museums, and in galleries in Canada, France and the United States.|$|R
5|$|The {{involvement}} of Lance Reddick and Ashly Burch was revealed in January 2017. Burch voiced Aloy, whose likeness was portrayed by Hannah Hoekstra and motion capture {{was performed by}} Amanda Piery in London. Following an auditioning process in 2014, Burch {{was called in to}} do the E3 2015 trailer and worked on the game for two years, providing facial motion capture as well. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> done in Los Angeles, with the Dutch developer brought in via Skype. Reddick voiced Sylens and also provided his likeness to the character.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several posthumous solo {{exhibitions}} of Rix Nicholas's works: in 1971 at the Joseph Brown Gallery in Melbourne (established by artist Joseph Brown, donor of the Joseph Brown Collection), followed by a travelling exhibition in 1978, displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of Ballarat and Macquarie Galleries. In the 1990s there were exhibitions at Ian Potter Museum of Art in Melbourne and the Caspian Gallery in Sydney. In 2013 an exhibition of <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> held at Canberra's National Portrait Gallery. The National Gallery of Australia in 2014 chose The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains as the painting it would seek to acquire through its Members Acquisition Fund appeal.|$|E
5|$|Coffin's {{attempts}} to find business in the Midwest were thwarted by the well-established presence there of several notable landscape architects in Chicago {{but she was not}} short of commissions despite this failure. Her success was recognized by her being elected a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1918, and by the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after East Coast landscape architects. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> widely featured in popular magazines and professional journals, at Coffin's own instigation as part of an overt marketing strategy. She sought to reach the wealthy and powerful women who made up an important part of the readership of publications such as the Garden Club of America's Bulletin. Coffin commissioned some of America's leading landscape photographers to take photographs of her creations and promoted her work through slide lectures. Her marketing was highly successful and led to a steady stream of commissions.|$|E
50|$|The {{themes that}} Anh covers in <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>are</b> about family, life, friendship, love, and coming of age, about which she writes {{in a simple}} style. <b>Her</b> <b>works</b> <b>are</b> read by {{different}} generations of readers due to the relatable characters written in her stories.|$|R
50|$|Steinkamp has {{exhibited}} <b>her</b> <b>work</b> internationally {{in a variety}} of venues and contexts, but <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> still difficult to categorize. She is often described as a video artist although <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> not photo or video-based; her recent inclusion in the California Video exhibition at the Getty Museum suggests that her connection to the genre is unlikely to change. Interestingly, the media art world has never embraced Steinkamp as one of their own, since <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> not technically interactive and she uses the computer not as a tool to comment on technology, but rather one to create imagery.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> held {{in private}} {{collections}} internationally.|$|R
5|$|Linda Syddick {{was one of}} many Western Desert {{women who}} took up {{painting}} in the early 1990s, {{as part of a broader}} contemporary Indigenous Australian art movement. She began painting some time prior to 1991, when <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> first exhibited in Alice Springs. Her work includes a distinctive fusion of Christian and Aboriginal traditional themes and motifs. She has been a finalist in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards on at least four occasions, and in the Blake Prize (a religious art competition) at least three times. Her works are held by numerous galleries including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia. Linda Syddick was the subject of a portrait painted by Robert Hannaford, which was a 1992 finalist in Australia's premiere portrait competition, the Archibald Prize.|$|E
5|$|Most of Australia's public {{collections}} {{hold one}} or more works by Makinti, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. She participated in some major group exhibitions, such as Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and Colour Power at the National Gallery of Victoria, as well as having had {{a small number of}} solo exhibitions at private galleries, including the gallery of influential art dealer Gabrielle Pizzi. The National Portrait Gallery in Canberra has in its collection a photographic portrait of Kumentje, by Malaysian-born Australian artist Hari Ho. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> selected for inclusion in the 2012 Sydney Biennale.|$|E
5|$|Nipper was {{inducted}} into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame, as well as being inducted into the Tennessee Agriculture Hall of Fame. She was listed in Who's Who by the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association and was given an award for her paintings by the Walking Horse Trainers' Association. In the 1980s, she was selected to paint a horse-themed plate that was given to American president Ronald Reagan who also owned a Nipper painting on canvas. In 1982, <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> displayed in the Fine Arts Pavilion at the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2012, Nipper painted an ornament that decorated the Christmas tree at the Governor of Tennessee's mansion. Nipper was also commissioned to paint pictures for Zsa Zsa Gabor and Shania Twain.|$|E

5|$|She was {{acutely aware}} of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of <b>her</b> <b>work,</b> <b>was</b> presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The game's sound team {{consisted}} of ten people: five handling general sound design, and five handling music composition. Hajime Wakai acted as the game's sound director and lead composer, {{with the other}} composers being Shiho Fujii, Mahito Yokota, and Takeshi Hama. Longtime series composer Koji Kondo had a supervisory role, only composing a single piece by himself: the music accompanying the prologue video describing the mythical origins of Demise and Hylia. He also helped in arranging the other composer's pieces, using an electric piano and a Mac computer. Fujii {{was responsible for the}} music focused on environments, dungeons, boss battles: among <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> the music for Skyloft. She used art and environmental assets so that her compositions would fit in with their environments. A first for the Zelda series, the music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments. It was the first time Nintendo EAD had used a live orchestra. Any previous orchestral elements in Twilight Princess, which amounted only to one track, were handled by their Tokyo division. Due to his experience, the department's musical lead Yokota was brought on to help orchestrate the score. Aonuma initially did not think of using an orchestra, and was still sure the score would remain synthesized even after Wakai asked him about it. An orchestra was finally chosen after Miyamoto insisted upon it, a decision which surprised the entire team.|$|E
25|$|She was {{a member}} of the Dresden Academy of Art; <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> {{exhibited}} there five times during the years 1800–1813.|$|E
