The aim is to analyze the effects of environmental taxation and government spending on environmental protection as an environmental policy instruments on greenhouse gas emissions and <b>gross</b> inland <b>energy</b> consumption in the EU 15. The empirical study is performed using a VAR approach with the application of aggregated data of EU 15 over the period 1995 to 2012. The results provide the evidence that the reactions of greenhouse gas emission and <b>gross</b> inland <b>energy</b> consumption to the shocks of environmental policy instruments are strong, mainly in the short term and decay to zero after about 8 years. Further, the reactions of the environmental policy instruments to the shocks of greenhouse gas emission and <b>gross</b> inland <b>energy</b> consumption are also strong in the short term, however with the deferred effects. In addition, the results show that government spending on environmental protection together with <b>gross</b> inland <b>energy</b> consumption has stronger effect on greenhouse gas emissions than environmental taxes in EU 15 over the examined period.

5000|$|Renewable energy {{consumption}} more than quadrupled from 48 PJ in 1990 to 203 PJ in 2015. Whilst renewable {{energy consumption}} was rising between 1990 and 2013 <b>gross</b> <b>energy</b> consumption actually fell by 7%. Most {{of the fall}} {{can be attributed to}} a great increase in combined power and heat generation (CHP) and the growth in wind power.

Thus the growth of these two sources (10% during the period) has displaced fossil fuels by more than a one-to-one ratio. The use of Biofuels in local CHP plants has further displaced fossil fuel consumption. The figures in the table above show that whilst the reduction in fossil fuel use has been most pronounced in coal use, there has also been a significant reduction in oil and natural gas usage since 2000.
