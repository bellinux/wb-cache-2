With railguns, a constant acceleration is provided along {{the entire length of}} the device, greatly increasing the muzzle velocity. There is also a significant advantage in not having to carry explosive propellant, and even the projectile internal charges may be eliminated due to the high velocity - the projectile becomes a strictly <b>kinetic</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E

Seven months after the first battle, the [...] "Hoof" [...] (as the Achuultani term their immense <b>kinetic</b> <b>weapon)</b> is about to impact Earth, piercing through the weakened defenders [...] "like a bullet through butter".

If it were released without force it would orbit the Earth {{in the same manner}} as the platform itself. In order for a rod to fall straight toward the center of Earth it would need to be launched away from the station with a tangential velocity equal in magnitude and opposite in direction from the orbiting station. This velocity would be in the range of approximately 7-8 km/s for satellites in low earth orbit, however, the actual velocity change needed to merely deorbit within half an orbit would be much less. Likely a few hundred m/s For a low-orbiting satellite, if even that much.|$|E

The evaluation methods for critical velocity of high-velocity and hypervelocity impact were summarized. The crater shape, crater scaling laws and empirical formulae, and simplified analysis models of crater parameters for spherical projectiles impact on semi-infinite targets were reviewed, so were the long rod penetration state differentiation, penetration depth calculation models for the semifluid, and deformed long rod projectiles.

50|$|A {{projectile}} {{that does}} not contain an explosive charge or {{any other kind of}} charge is termed a kinetic projectile, <b>kinetic</b> energy <b>weapon,</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy warhead, kinetic warhead or kinetic penetrator. Typical <b>kinetic</b> energy <b>weapons</b> are blunt projectiles such as rocks and round shots, pointed ones such as arrows, and somewhat pointed ones such as bullets. Among projectiles that do not contain explosives are those launched from railguns, coilguns, and mass drivers, as well as kinetic energy penetrators. All of these weapons work by attaining a high muzzle velocity, or initial velocity, generally up to (hypervelocity), and collide with their targets, converting their kinetic energy into destructive shock waves and heat. Other types of <b>kinetic</b> <b>weapons</b> are accelerated over time by a rocket engine, or by gravity. In either case, it is the kinetic energy of the projectile that destroys its target.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{development of a}} speed-of-light hard-kill weapon system for military applications represents a significant advancement in technology over present conventional <b>kinetic</b> <b>weapon</b> systems. Over the past two decades, the US Navy has successfully developed a megawatt-class chemical laser; however, under some maritime environments, the high power beam propagation was unable to delivery sufficient energy to kill a modern anti-ship missile (ASM) due to significant atmospheric absorption and the resulting thermal blooming process. A critical problem to resolve for the shipboard high-energy laser weapon systems {{is to develop a}} shipboard-compatible megawatt-class laser weapon at a wavelength where the atmospheric absorption is smallest. The megawatt-class Free Electron Laser (EEL) has significant advantages over conventional weapon systems and other chemical high-energy laser systems. Infinite magazine, rapid response, and wavelength tunability make the EEL a suitable and desirable shipboard weapon system. This thesis divides into four chapters. Chapters I and II introduce the EEL and background theory of the EEL. Chapter III explores the analysis of the LANL Regenerative MW EEL Amplifier design and optimizes its efficiency. Lastly, chapter IV summarizes the feasibility of achieving the desired efficiency[URL] United States Nav...|$|E

50|$|Recognizing a lack {{of experts}} in {{employing}} ISR weapons systems, in Feb 2010 the RAF introduced an additional QWI course for aircrew of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms (such as Reaper, Rivet Joint, E-3 Sentry and Sentinel) and Intelligence Officers.

50|$|Some <b>kinetic</b> <b>weapons</b> for {{targeting}} {{objects in}} spaceflight are anti-satellite weapons and anti-ballistic missiles. Since {{in order to}} reach an object in orbit it is necessary to attain an extremely high velocity, their released kinetic energy alone is enough to destroy their target; explosives are not necessary. For example: the energy of TNT is 4.6 MJ/kg, and the energy of a kinetic kill vehicle with a closing speed of 10 km/s is of 50 MJ/kg. This saves costly weight and there is no detonation to be precisely timed. This method, however, requires direct contact with the target, which requires a more accurate trajectory. Some hit-to-kill warheads are additionally equipped with an explosive directional warhead to enhance the kill probability (e.g. Israeli Arrow missile or U.S. Patriot PAC-3).|$|R

Building upon the work of the Tallinn Manual on the Application of International Law to Cyber Warfare, it places particular emphasis on the application of the principle of proportionality and the duty to take precautions in conducting an attack in relation to attacks carried out in the cyber domain. In doing so, a preliminary examination is made of the likelihood of cyber warfare actually taking place and the scenarios which seem most likely for this to occur. It then goes on to examine how the aforementioned principle of proportionality would apply in relation to attacks whereby physical effects resulted and to attacks which simply had the effect of destroying or degrading digital data. It concludes by finding that while many cyber-attacks would not qualify as attacks under IHL, some would and that the law is applicable by analogy {{in much the same way}} it applies to conventional attacks by <b>kinetic</b> <b>weapons...</b>|$|R
