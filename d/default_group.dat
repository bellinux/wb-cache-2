40|$|Abstract. Real estate industry, whose {{volatility}} {{will bring}} about the fluctuations of other related industries, is a basic industry highly associated with the national economy. With the development of real estate market in recent years, the non-rational growth of real estate credit of the commercial banks in China has increased the risk of real estate credit. The paper assesses the credit risk of listed real estate companies based on logistic regression model. The results show that on the whole the logistic regression model can predict accurately. The results of principal component analysis suggest that a company’s capability to make profits is an important basis {{for the evaluation of}} credit risk. In addition, the assessment results of logistic regression model demonstrates that the prediction is asymmetric because the model makes a high predictive accuracy for credit non-default group, while a low predictive accuracy for credit <b>default</b> <b>group...</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{employ a}} difference-in-difference, gravity-equation {{approach}} to quantifying the trade impact of hightechnology export controls that {{are motivated by}} national security. We estimate the effect of controls on high-tech export performance of the United States, of its traditional rival (peer) exporters, and of emerging exporters. Using an 11 -year panel of seven high-tech sectors from 1994 through 2004, {{we find that the}} United States under-exports to “high-threat” importers. We find, more surprisingly, that the United States over-exports to “medium-threat ” importers and to a large “trusted ” group of importers, both relative to a norm (<b>default</b> <b>group)</b> of importers. We find that traditional peer exporters under-export to the trusted group of importers, and along with emerging exporters, under-export to most medium-threat importers. These findings, robust in a comparable dataset ending in 2011, suggest high substitutability between export suppliers and export markets for high-tech products. The same peer exporters over-export to high-threat importers, suggesting their less stringent enforcement of multilateral export controls and also undermining to a certain extent, the security objective of the very strictest of these controls. Overall, importers deemed security threats import only half of their high-tech potential from the 10 exporters on which we focus. Our study underlines the importance of current American efforts to reform the export control regime to make it more target-effective...|$|E

This study assesses {{the influence of the}} independent auditor's going-concern evaluation by examining default following the release of the auditor's report. We use a proprietary sample maintained by the Portuguese Central Bank on 12, 199 audit reports relating to approximately 2000 firms that are liable by law to have their accounts audited on an annual basis. Empirical estimation of a logit model controlling for accounting cash- flow-related and nonaccounting variables shows that the likelihood of default for firms that received going concern opinion is 2. 792 times that of firms that received a clean opinion. Likelihood ratio tests for omitted variable also confirm the incremental predictive ability of going-concern opinion over and above accounting and nonaccounting variables for the estimation and hold-out samples. In the nondefaulting <b>group,</b> the average <b>default</b> rate is 6. 05 %, in the <b>defaulting</b> <b>group</b> it is 17. 78 %. The default rate for firms in the nondefaulting group that received a going-concern opinion is 9. 92 % and for firms that received a clean opinion it is 5. 96 %.

40|$|Empirical {{research}} on the impact and determinants of group lending is by now substantial. However, very {{little is known about}} the possible role of collateral to mitigate incentive problems in group lending. This is because microcredit programs have normally been implemented in rural areas of developing countries. Indeed, the reason for this choice is lack of credit access since agents with collateral are very rare. Also, to the extent that rural communities have tight-knit hierarchical structures information about borrowers is accessible and the enforcement of sanctions via social networks makes collateral superfluous for default mitigation. Yet, in an urban setting in which information is more atomized and social sanctions are not as powerful, collateral may have an important role in group lending. First, we illustrate in a model the role of collateral to mitigate <b>group</b> <b>default.</b> Second, we use data from a group lending program implemented in 2001 in Cotonou, the largest city in Benin with more than one million inhabitants. We empirically explore the risk profile of individual borrowers and resulting group heterogeneity to identify the role of personal contributions to investment projects. Our evidence suggests that while diversification within groups facilitates risk pooling, it also increases expected bailout or <b>group</b> <b>default</b> costs for low risk borrowers. Collateral helps offset and alleviate potential negative spillovers from <b>group</b> <b>default</b> induced by membership of borrowers with risky projects. The presence of borrowers with collateral facilitates access to credit for group members without collateral, who in turn provide insurance against <b>group</b> <b>default.</b> We find joint liability to be a mechanism for risk sharing in a setting where poor households lack resources for collateral and insurance markets are missing. group lending, mutual cosigners, collateral, risk sharing, strategic...|$|R
