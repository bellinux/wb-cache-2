Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> fealty.
