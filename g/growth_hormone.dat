5|$|<b>Growth</b> <b>hormone</b> {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E

50|$|Other {{hormones that}} prevent the {{stimulation}} of lipogenesis in adipose cells are <b>growth</b> <b>hormones</b> (GH). <b>Growth</b> <b>hormones</b> result in {{loss of fat}} but stimulates muscle gain. One proposed mechanism for how the hormone works is that <b>growth</b> <b>hormones</b> affects insulin signaling thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity and in turn down regulating fatty acid synthase expression. Another proposed mechanism suggests that <b>growth</b> <b>hormones</b> may phosphorylate with STAT5A and STAT5B, transcription factors that {{are a part of}} the Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription (STAT) family.|$|R
50|$|Somatomedins are produced, {{predominantly}} by the liver, when <b>growth</b> <b>hormones</b> act {{on target}} tissue.

5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E

5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> and vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. <b>Growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by <b>growth</b> <b>hormone.</b> Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E

5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 {{percent of people who}} have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as <b>growth</b> <b>hormone,</b> luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
5|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{posted on}} its website an article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Helms who was alleged to have obtained HGH. WWE has since made a statement on this situation, mentioning that the allegations preceded the Talent Wellness program WWE launched in April 2006. On August 30, 2007, an article by Sports Illustrated named Helms and nine other wrestlers to be given <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> not in compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness program. He was said to have received testosterone, HGH and nandrolone between November 2003 and February 2007.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
30|$|In general, <b>growth</b> <b>hormones</b> (GHs) {{modulate}} glucose uptake in insulin-dependent tissues (e.g., muscle, adipocytes).

Low levels of plasma lipid were suggested to promote insulin sensitivity and signaling of PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR [5, 7, 39, 40, 79, 193, 201 – 207]. Furthermore, longevity {{seems to be}} associated with altered activities of membrane-enzyme complex PI 3 k-AKT-mTOR pathways.|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Henry {{suffered}} from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy, {{which is caused}} by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome. According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result of traumatic brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity. This analysis identifies <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency (GHD) as the source for his increased adiposity but also significant behavioural changes noted in his later years, including his multiple marriages.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in central Argentina, Messi was {{diagnosed}} with a <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.|$|E
