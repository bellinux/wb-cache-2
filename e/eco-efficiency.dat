50|$|In their reports, large {{companies}} commonly place primary emphasis on <b>eco-efficiency,</b> {{referring to the}} reduction of resource and energy use and waste production per unit of product or service. A complete picture which accounts for all inputs, outputs and wastes of the organisation, must not necessarily emerge. Whilst companies can often demonstrate great success in <b>eco-efficiency,</b> their ecological footprint, that is an estimate of total environmental impact, may move independently following changes in output.|$|E
50|$|Decommodification {{has been}} {{identified}} as a strategy for sustainable consumption that acts one level up on the institutional context of consumption in Western societies as compared to strategies such as <b>eco-efficiency</b> and eco-sufficiency. Thus, while the <b>eco-efficiency</b> strategy targets the product and the eco-sufficiency strategy targets the person (the consumer as decision-maker), the decommodification strategy targets the institutional context in which consumption takes place. It aims to decrease the influence of commodities and to limit the effect of commercialisation.|$|E

5000|$|Although <b>eco-efficiency</b> is {{a rather}} new method, the idea is not. In the early 1970s Paul R. Ehrlich and John Holdren {{developed}} the lettering formula I = PAT to describe the impact of human activity on the environment. Furthermore, the concept of <b>eco-efficiency</b> was first described by McIntyre and Thornton in 1978, but it wasn’t until 1992, when the term was formally coined and widely publicized by Stephan Schmidheiny in ‘’Changing Course’’. Schmidheiny set out “to change the perception of industry as {{being part of the}} problem of environmental degradation to the reality of its becoming part—a key part—of the solution for sustainability and global development.” The major drivers in the early phase of eco-efficiency’s development were the “forward-looking managers and thinkers in 3M and Dow.” It was their involvement which catapulted <b>eco-efficiency</b> from a brilliant idea to a workable concept. The results of the WBCSD’s work creating the “linkage between environmental performance and the bottom line was published in 1997 in its report Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value.” ...|$|E
50|$|To {{get an idea}} of the <b>eco-efficiency</b> of Flemish {{agriculture}} {{we compare}} pressure indicators to an economic indicator. In the period 2007-2012 the final production remains more or less stable, while the environmental indicators evolve. As to the emission of very fine particles, the phosphorus fertilizer use and the pressure by chemical pesticides, the <b>eco-efficiency</b> improves thanks to the manure policy, rising fertilizer prices and the switch to natural gas in horticulture. In contrast, the increasing livestock from 2008 and the increasing number of cogeneration plants (combined heat and power) in greenhouses are the main reasons that there is no decrease in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and potential acidifying emissions.|$|E
50|$|Householders {{and sewage}} {{treatment}} plants can both make {{the water supply}} networks more efficient and sustainable. Major improvements in <b>eco-efficiency</b> are gained through systematic separation of rainfall and wastewater. Membrane technology {{can be used for}} recycling wastewater.|$|E
50|$|Cooper (2005) {{proposed}} a theoretical model {{to illustrate the}} significance of product life span in a progress towards sustainable consumption.

50|$|The Materials Parsimony rule {{deals with}} {{constraining}} {{the number of}} types of materials used in product design and manufacturing. This {{is not to be}} confused with the sustainable business strategy of <b>eco-efficiency</b> which seeks to reduce the amount of materials used in production.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eco-efficiency</b> - {{doing more}} with less - {{is at the core}} of the {{business}} case for sustainable development. Combining environmental and economic operational excellence to deliver goods and services with lower external impacts and higher quality-of-life benefits is a key sustainable development strategy for business.|$|E
5000|$|The {{view that}} {{improvements}} in <b>eco-efficiency</b> are sufficient for achieving sustainability {{has been challenged}} by Huesemann and Huesemann, who demonstrate using extensive historical evidence that increases in technological efficiency have not reduced overall resource use and pollution. Moreover, with “cradle-to-cradle”, growth is conducive to sustainability per se.This broader concept is called ‘’Sustainable Production and Consumption’’ (SPC). “This concept involves changes in production and consumption patterns that lead to sustainable use of natural resources;” [...] business has taken {{a key role in}} accelerating the use of this concept because businesses both consume and produce. <b>Eco-efficiency</b> is routinely a concept used because it combines performance along two of the three axes of sustainable development, making it easier for academics and leading thinkers to tease out the associated social issues.|$|E
5000|$|AUO {{has shown}} {{considerable}} {{regard for the}} protection of the environment and was the first to have introduced the energy management platform.

50|$|The {{life span}} of {{household}} goods is significant for sustainable consumption. Longer product life spans can contribute to <b>eco-efficiency</b> and sufficiency, thus slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable level of consumption. Cooper (2005) proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.|$|E
50|$|Recently, {{there has}} also been use of <b>eco-efficiency</b> in more {{non-traditional}} ways, such as a use in banks to integrate environmental criteria into their credit-approval process; looking at “eco-integrated economic risks of a customer.” And is also being implemented as marketing advantages where, “eco-efficient choices are always preferred,” especially in service sectors such as tourism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{usage of the}} term [...] "eco-innovation" [...] is to refer to {{innovative}} products and processes that reduce environmental impacts. This is often {{used in conjunction with}} <b>eco-efficiency</b> and eco-design. Leaders in many industries have been developing innovative technologies in order to work towards sustainability. However, these are not always practical, or enforced by policy and legislation.|$|E
5000|$|Several authors {{assert that}} product service systems will improve <b>eco-efficiency</b> {{by what is}} termed [...] "factor 4", i.e. an {{improvement}} {{by a factor of}} 4 times or more, by enabling new and radical ways of transforming what they call the [...] "product-service mix" [...] that satisfy consumer demands while also improving the effects upon the environment.|$|E
5000|$|Step change {{solutions}} contain “as {{a series}} of waves or types of innovation that can deliver increasing levels of <b>eco-efficiency</b> until a sustainable global economy can be established”. Each wave is I shown as an S-curve in this model and these S-curves {{are similar to the}} conventional product life cycles depicted in conventional models. It shows that over time the <b>eco-efficiency</b> or environmental benefits of products actually decreases over time. Thus moving along in time, the new curves and their very radical new approaches over ride the ones of the older curves. The model follows four steps of sustainable design innovation and change. Following are the four steps: Product improvement: Changes made to an existing product that improve pollution prevention and other environmental impacts of the product. For example, and improvement on fuel efficiency, less use of water, or lowering the amount of pesticides used to grow food.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, <b>eco-efficiency</b> {{is also a}} {{very useful}} tool because it can adapt and flex to be fit {{different}} sizes of companies, while also maintaining relevance with the larger scale of government and national policies. For example, larger national players such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2002), European Commission (EU 2005), European Environment Agency (EEA) and the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) have all recognized that <b>eco-efficiency</b> is a practical approach that businesses should adopt in setting and achieving their environmental performance objectives. It has be proven to heighten market values for firms, serve as an effective management tool for governments, benefit civil society, and increase quality of life. “It does this by changing industrial processes, creating new products and changing and influencing markets with new ideas and with new rules.” More people aim to get more value for their money in the market, while also enjoying a better environment.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, as {{countries}} and regions {{around the world}} began to develop, it slowly became evident that industrialization and economic growth come {{hand in hand with}} environmental degradation. <b>Eco-Efficiency</b> has been proposed as one of the main tools to promote a transformation from unsustainable development to one of sustainable development. It is based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste and pollution. “It is measured as the ratio between the (added) value of what has been produced (e.g. GDP) and the (added) environment impacts of the product or service (e.g. S02 emissions).” The term was coined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in its 1992 publication “Changing Course,” and at the 1992 Earth Summit, <b>eco-efficiency</b> was endorsed as a new business concept and means for companies to implement Agenda 21 in the private sector. Ergo the term has become synonymous with a management philosophy geared towards sustainability, combining ecological and economic efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|According to the WBCSD definition, <b>eco-efficiency</b> is {{achieved}} through {{the delivery of}} [...] "competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity throughout the entire life-cycle to a level at least {{in line with the}} Earth's estimated carrying capacity." [...] It works by implementing 4 main types of ratios.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>eco-efficiency</b> and socio-efficiency are {{concerned}} primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise {{both natural and}} social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts point out the business case alone will {{not be sufficient to}} realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{involvement}} in the Rio Summit, Schmidheiny authored the book Change of Course: Global Business Prospects for Development and the Environment, published by MIT Press in 1992. His book offers an extensive analysis of how businesses can make sustainable development their focus, his book has been translated into fifteen languages. He also contributed to Financing Change: The Financial Community, <b>Eco-efficiency,</b> and Sustainable Development [...] also published by MIT Press.|$|E
5000|$|Its origins {{date back}} to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of 1992, when Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss {{business}} entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). He created a forum called [...] "Business Council for Sustainable Development", which went on to become Changing Course, a book that coined the concept of <b>eco-efficiency.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Eco-efficiency</b> was {{initially}} coined by the World Business Council on Sustainable Development to describe methods of decreasing waste while increasing productivity. William McDonough’s design firm, MBDC, takes that {{a step further}} to reflect cradle-to-cradle thinking of waste equaling food. Under this model, eco-effectiveness refers to “industrial systems that emulate the healthy abundance of nature” so that the waste of the production process and the product itself can be the raw materials of a new product or service.|$|E
50|$|Factor 10 {{requires}} {{the creation of}} new technologies, policies, and manufacturing processes along with sociocultural change to create a global economy that is sustainable {{for a long period of}} time. The long-term goal of Factor 10, many governments and firms aspiring toward shortIterm relief have difficulty achieving the massive reductions proposed by factor 10. <b>Eco-efficiency,</b> environmental purchasing design for environment, policies and environmental taxes have already been used by business and governments implementing the Factor 10 theory.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{thin film}} {{photovoltaic}} module systems to-date have been non-solar tracking, because module output was {{too low to}} offset tracker capital and operating costs. But relatively inexpensive single-axis tracking systems can add 25% output per installed watt. In addition, depending on the Tracker Energy Gain, the overall <b>eco-efficiency</b> of the PV system can be enhanced by lowering both system costs and environmental impacts. This is climate-dependent. Tracking also produces a smoother output plateau around midday, better matching afternoon peaks.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, eco-industrial parks exist {{across the}} country and have enjoyed some success. The best known example is Burnside Park, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. With support from Dalhousie University’s <b>Eco-Efficiency</b> Centre, the more than 1,500 {{businesses}} have been improving their environmental performance and developing profitable partnerships. Subsequently, two greenfield industrial developments have been started in Alberta: TaigaNova Eco-Industrial Park is {{in the heart of the}} Athabasca oil sands, while Innovista Eco-Industrial Park is a gateway to the Rocky Mountains ~300km west of Edmonton.|$|E
