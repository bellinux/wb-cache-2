5|$|In 1861, the New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer. That year, the {{railroad}} constructed a <b>freight</b> <b>depot</b> and steamboat wharf (likely {{also used for}} passenger trains) along Water Street. The depot burned on May 8, 1864, but was rebuilt on the same site.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was built}} with freight {{provision}} from the beginning. It has spurs leading {{to and from}} the freight terminal at Dollands Moor (Folkestone) and the <b>freight</b> <b>depot</b> at Barking (Ripple Lane), north of the River Thames. Long passing loops to hold freight trains while passenger trains overtake them were built at Lenham Heath and Singlewell.|$|E
5|$|Wachusett {{station was}} located south of Princeton Road (MA 31) in the Crockerville section of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, {{about half a}} mile east of the new station. A freight wreck at the station in July 1905 killed two men. Service to Wachusett station lasted until 1960, when all {{passenger}} service west of Fitchburg was terminated by the Boston & Maine Railroad. The derelict <b>freight</b> <b>depot,</b> located just south of the station, was demolished in 2005 or 2006.|$|E
50|$|Palmer {{would also}} {{construct}} large buildings along these streets and lease {{the space to}} Class 1 railroads as <b>freight</b> <b>depots.</b> A <b>freight</b> customer could ship or take delivery of their items with the West Shore, Erie or Central Railroad of New Jersey among others at these <b>freight</b> <b>depots.</b> Customers would now {{have a choice of}} carrier to transport their goods.|$|R
50|$|London Rail also {{influences}} rail <b>freight</b> and <b>freight</b> <b>depots</b> in Greater London. In August 2007, London Rail published its 'Rail Freight Strategy' report.|$|R

5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the <b>freight</b> <b>depot,</b> and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{traffic on}} the GCR was never heavy {{because it was the}} last main line to be built and had {{difficulty}} competing against longer-established rivals (especially the Midland Railway from its terminal at St Pancras) for the lucrative intercity passenger business. Low passenger traffic meant Marylebone was the quietest and most pleasant of London's termini. The GCR was unhappy about having to use part of the Metropolitan Railway's route to reach Marylebone, and opened a new line to High Wycombe on 2 April 1906. The additional suburban services generated traffic for the station, which had previously been so empty on occasion that the staff outnumbered passengers. While passenger traffic remained relatively sparse, the line was heavily used for freight, especially coal; in 1914, 67% of traffic was goods-related. Trains ran from the north and East Midlands to the <b>freight</b> <b>depot</b> adjoining the station, which was marginally the largest in London.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Lebanon, {{the line}} ascended a small gully and then headed north-northeasterly across the {{highlands}} to Dodds. The never-used grade from Dodds to Waynesville descended into the Little Miami River valley via Newman Run before turning north and ending at the latter village. Portions of the right-of-way and stone abutments for several never-built bridges remain {{on what is}} now farmland. The line as completed turned north at Dodds, and required several cuts and fills to traverse the rolling terrain. At Hempstead, just north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The original route continued north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (now the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 extension was built parallel to the ex-D, and ended at the Panhandle Route (now the Creekside Trail to the east) at Clement. Part of this line is still operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and to the south the right-of-way is being used for {{an extension of the}} Iron Horse Trail. The other branch headed northwesterly into downtown Dayton, steadily descending as it passed south of the University of Dayton and alongside the Great Miami River. The main passenger and freight depots were at Washington Street, which the CL passed over on the first such grade separation in Dayton. The first <b>freight</b> <b>depot</b> opened with the line in 1912, and was replaced in 1930 by a larger structure, itself torn down in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Originally a farming community, {{the town}} was served by the L&N Railroad which {{provided}} passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>depots.</b> The town derives {{its name from the}} book of the same name, authored by Augusta Evans Wilson.|$|R
5000|$|The {{train is}} {{explicitly}} exempted from regulations covering [...] "Working of Passenger Trains Over Non-Passenger Lines", allowing {{the train to}} operate between EWS <b>freight</b> <b>depots</b> without additional documentation requirements. [...] The train does not carry passengers per-se—all those on-board are regarded as either staff or invited guests.|$|R
50|$|Buildings {{are also}} {{often used in}} a garden railway, though they too must be {{constructed}} to withstand the weather. Train stations and <b>freight</b> <b>depots</b> are popular, some even building whole towns trackside. The loco shed is a common place to store a locomotive (or the whole train) when not in use.|$|R
5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade the DL built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A <b>freight</b> <b>depot</b> was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E

50|$|The {{town was}} {{famous in the}} 1850s for its rich placer ores, which were {{replaced}} by lode mining. After the gold ran out, the town continued to operate as an important stagecoach and <b>freighting</b> <b>depot,</b> serving the southern mines until {{after the turn of}} the 20th century. The county's first Justice Court was established here, complete with a Justice of the Peace.|$|R

25|$|Building No.1, {{also known}} as the Santa Fe Office Building, was {{constructed}} as the main building at 1114 Commerce Street and opened in late 1924. It contained 20 floors of offices and included a restaurant and drug store, and was the most elaborately decorated building of the complex. The structure featured several setbacks and ornamental arches designed in the Mission Revival style topped by a barrel vaulted roof. The office building provided some of the most desirable office space in Dallas in the 1925-42 period, housing many national corporations and representatives of insurance companies. The rear of the building connected to a 10-story warehouse wing fronting Jackson Street and served as the terminus of the <b>freight</b> <b>depot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around 1850, {{a station}} stop was {{established}} on land donated by Joseph Mallinson, a carriage painter who owned {{much of the}} land in the area. Mallinson donated the land to encourage the railroad to establish a station at the location. This depot was named Allendale after the surveyor of the Paterson and Ramapo Railroad. While a community began to grow around it, the depot itself fell into disrepair by 1857 and the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad abandoned service. Two years later, the depot was described as being abandoned and left for ruin. Mallinson restored the building and service returned. He built a <b>freight</b> <b>depot</b> and by 1860, the railroad had built a new depot of gravel.|$|E
50|$|The {{coming of}} the {{railroad}} in 1898 opened up the area for the shipment of goods to market {{and development of the}} tourist trade. By 1899, trains went as far as Toboggan Canyon, where passengers were transferred to stagecoaches for the final miles to Cloudcroft. <b>Freight</b> <b>depots</b> and Wells Fargo offices were built in both High Rolls and Mountain Park. The railroad operated on a regular basis until World War II. It finally ceased operation in 1948.|$|R
50|$|Flood {{damage was}} so great because the rivers in Oregon were the main routes of travel. The river front was the {{building}} site of mills, <b>freight</b> <b>depots,</b> and storehouses for grain and other foodstuffs. Business houses and many residences were near the landings. Farm buildings were mostly on sites convenient to the rivers, along with supplies of feed for livestock. Loss of so much wheat flour and demand from the new Idaho gold fields caused a spike in its price from $7 to $12 per barrel.|$|R
500|$|Four provincial {{highways}} (3, 4, 5, and 25) {{run through}} or terminate in Lethbridge.
