5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Introduced in 1995, the single-seat Aventura has repositionable main landing <b>gear,</b> <b>down</b> for runways and up for {{landing on}} water. The {{steerable}} tail wheel is retractable {{in concert with}} the repositioning of the main gear. There is no water rudder. The wing is an aluminium frame covered with pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. The hull is constructed from fibreglass and the wingtip floats are polyethylene. The remainder of the structure is anodized aluminium tubing, bolted together. Controls are conventional three-axis, with full span ailerons and no flaps. The company claims that the fast-build kit can be constructed in 90 hours.|$|E
25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite {{the fact that even}} Hollywood began to <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E

25|$|Video of the {{crashing}} aircraft {{shows it}} rolling to starboard and simultaneously diving to the ground. Both port engines are producing {{significant amounts of}} smoke. The smoke produced from the port engines appears to be normal engine exhaust, which highlights the absence of exhaust from the starboard pair of engines. If two of the engines on the aircraft were not operational, {{a significant amount of}} asymmetric thrust would be generated, which is capable of causing an aircraft to roll unless properly corrected for. The video also clearly shows the aircraft otherwise configured for landing, with extended flaps and landing <b>gear</b> <b>down.</b> A failure of both engines on one wing for this aircraft type may exceed the rudder authority of the aircraft to counter the asymmetric thrust.|$|E

500|$|Lockheed and the Army held a 13-minute {{demonstration}} [...] "first flight" [...] for {{the public}} at the Van Nuys Airport on 12 December 1967. During the flight, the Cheyenne demonstrated {{some of the new}} capabilities brought about by the thrusting propeller; the helicopter could slow down or accelerate without pitching the nose up or down, as well as being able to pitch the nose down or up at a hover, without causing the aircraft to accelerate forwards or backwards. The Cheyenne demonstrated a stationary hover in a 30-knot (35mph, 56km/h) crosswind, {{and at the end of}} the flight landed on its two forward landing gear, [...] "bowed" [...] to the audience and then gently set the tail landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> as it taxied to parking.

Seconds later, at 8:58a.m. CST, the plane struck the roof of McDonnell Building 101 on the northeast side of the airport. [...] It lost its right wing and landing gear on impact, then cartwheeled and crashed in a parking lot beyond the building which was in use as a construction staging area. See was thrown clear of the cockpit and was found in the parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat with the parachute partially open.

40|$|Discussed {{here are}} {{computations}} of drag or negative traction of <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> supporting propellers in the downward vertical glide of a helicopter. By means of Frounde's Theory, the maximum {{value of the}} drag of a windmill is calculated.

The author notes that if we are to adopt large propellers, we must have recourse to a different method of construction, resulting in large dimension propellers much lighter than those made of wood. In discussing insufficient drag, the author notes that the question of the drag of <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> supporting propellers can only be decided by experiment...|$|R

60|$|The Homeric poems, whether {{composed}} in one age or throughout five centuries, are thus entirely uniform in allotting bronze as the material {{for all sorts}} of warlike <b>gear,</b> <b>down</b> to the solitary battle-axe mentioned; and iron as the usual metal for heavy tools, knives, carpenters' axes, adzes, and agricultural implements, with the rare exceptions which we have cited in the case of bronze knives and axes. Either this distinction--iron for tools and implements; bronze for armour, swords, and spears--prevailed throughout the period of the Homeric poets or poet; or the poets invented such a stage of culture; or poets, some centuries later, deliberately kept bronze for weapons only, while introducing iron for implements. In that case they were showing archaeological conscientiousness in following the presumed earlier poets of the bronze age, the age of the Mycenaean graves.|$|E
