5|$|Captain Archibald <b>Haddock</b> (Capitaine <b>Haddock</b> in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, <b>Haddock</b> is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis <b>Haddock</b> (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain <b>Haddock</b> lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E
5|$|Tintin {{sets out}} to locate the spies, telling <b>Haddock</b> to follow from the base, as he {{suspects}} a mole is on the inside. Wolff follows <b>Haddock</b> out of suspicion. When Tintin spots the paratroopers, he is shot before {{he is able to}} do anything. Simultaneously, the base experiences a power outage, and confusion ensues, with neither <b>Haddock</b> nor Wolff capable of explaining clearly what happened.|$|E
5|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Hergé {{learned that there}} had actually been an Admiral <b>Haddock</b> who {{had served in the}} British Royal Navy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: Sir Richard <b>Haddock</b> (1629–1715). Richard <b>Haddock</b> {{was in charge of the}} Royal James, the flagship of the Earl of Sandwich during the Battle of Solebay of 1672, the first naval battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. During the fighting, the Royal James was set alight and <b>Haddock</b> escaped but had to be rescued from the sea, following which his bravery was recognised by the British monarch, King Charles II. He subsequently took command of another ship, the Royal Charles, before becoming a naval administrator in later life. Admiral Haddock's grandfather, also named Richard, commanded the ship of the line HMS Unicorn during the reign of King Charles I.|$|E
500|$|He also {{discussed}} <b>Haddock's</b> {{position in the}} story, noting that {{the scene at the}} theatre in which a bull's head mask falls onto <b>Haddock's</b> head reflects [...] "one of Hergé's most constant themes: the union of human and animal". He further added the opinion that <b>Haddock's</b> transformation from seaman to country gentleman was not believable.|$|R
5000|$|In his psychoanalytical {{study of}} the Adventures of Tintin, the {{academic}} Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed that The Seven Crystal Balls-Prisoners of the Sun arc reflects a confrontation between civilisations, and between the sacred and the secular.He also discussed <b>Haddock's</b> position in the story, noting that {{the scene at the}} theatre in which a bull's head mask falls onto <b>Haddock's</b> head reflects [...] "one of Hergé's most constant themes: the union of human and animal". He further added the opinion that <b>Haddock's</b> transformation from seaman to country gentleman was not believable.He suggested that the appearance of Yamila and Castafiore {{at the start of the}} story injected [...] "a feminine element" [...] into the story, which represented an attempt to [...] "round out <b>Haddock's</b> family", which was dominated by the male figures of Tintin, Calculus, and Snowy. He further argued that Calculus' kidnapping represented a [...] "rite of passage" [...] that would allow him to join Tintin and <b>Haddock's</b> family.|$|R

5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, <b>Haddock,</b> and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains {{consciousness}} and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is recognised as the dog from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, <b>Haddock</b> and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at the Horn of the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and <b>Haddock</b> travel on to the Horn of the Yak.|$|E
5|$|During a thunderstorm, {{glass and}} {{porcelain}} items at Marlinspike Hall shatter inexplicably. Insurance salesman Jolyon Wagg {{arrives at the}} house, annoying Captain <b>Haddock.</b> Gunshots are heard in the Hall's grounds, and Tintin and <b>Haddock</b> discover a wounded man with a foreign accent who soon disappears. The next morning, Professor Calculus leaves for Geneva to attend a conference on nuclear physics. Tintin and <b>Haddock</b> use the opportunity to investigate Calculus' laboratory, there discovering that his experiments {{were responsible for the}} glass-shattering of the previous night. While exploring, they are attacked by a stranger, who then escapes; fearing that Calculus is in danger, Tintin, <b>Haddock,</b> and Snowy head for Geneva. In Geneva, they learn that Calculus has gone to Nyon to meet Professor Topolino, an expert in ultrasonics. The group travel there in a taxi, but their car is attacked by two men in another car, who force the taxi into Lake Geneva. Surviving the attack, Tintin, <b>Haddock</b> and Snowy continue to Nyon, where they find Topolino bound and gagged in his cellar. As Tintin questions the professor, the house blows up, but they all survive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Haddock</b> {{has been}} trying to get the local stonemason to fix a broken step at Marlinspike, but he is never available. Milanese opera diva Bianca Castafiore invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. <b>Haddock,</b> who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes bed rest. Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Castafiore {{presents}} <b>Haddock</b> with a pet parrot and fusses over him, to his great discomfort.|$|E

5|$|Tintin {{and his dog}} Snowy {{visit their}} friends Captain <b>Haddock</b> and Professor Calculus at Marlinspike Hall. There, they learn that Bianca Castafiore, her maid Irma, pianist Igor Wagner and the detectives Thomson and Thompson have been imprisoned in San Theodoros for {{allegedly}} attempting to overthrow the military government of General Tapioca. Tapioca's government have further alleged that the plot was masterminded by Tintin, <b>Haddock,</b> and Calculus themselves. Tapioca invites the trio to visit San Theodores, promising them safe passage, but Tintin deems {{it to be a}} trap, leaving <b>Haddock</b> and Calculus to go alone. Once there, the Captain and Professor are taken to a rural villa, where they are closely monitored by the security services.|$|E
5|$|Another {{individual}} {{known as}} Captain <b>Haddock</b> {{had lived in}} this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the Anne and Christopher. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at Málaga to purchase goods that could be taken back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, <b>Haddock</b> was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where {{he was ordered to}} forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.|$|E

5|$|Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain <b>Haddock,</b> and Calculus' {{assistant}} Frank Wolff are aboard {{an atomic}} rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth {{bound for the}} Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away onboard, putting a strain on the oxygen supply. The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the problem. They then suffered a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in Land of Black Gold (1950)), resulting in their hair growing rapidly in multiple colours. Calculus subsequently administers a cure. <b>Haddock,</b> who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becoming a satellite of the asteroid Adonis (at which point, Professor Calculus humorously says he will tell Earth that Adonis has a new satellite {{by the name of}} <b>Haddock)</b> but Tintin is able to rescue him.|$|E
5|$|The Emir welcomes Tintin and <b>Haddock,</b> {{revealing}} {{that there is}} an ongoing slave trade through Khemed that is operated by the international businessman the Marquis di Gorgonzola, who falsely offers transport to African Muslims on the pilgrimage to Mecca and then sells them into slavery. Tintin, <b>Haddock</b> and Snowy leave for the Red Sea coast and board a sambuk for Mecca; they are attacked by fighter planes before Tintin shoots one down and rescues its mercenary Estonian pilot, Piotr Skut. The four are picked up by di Gorgonzola's yacht, the Scheherazade, but are soon offloaded onto the SS Ramona, a tramp steamer. Di Gorgonzola turns out to be another of Tintin's old adversaries, Roberto Rastapopoulos. The Ramona is one of Rastapopoulos' slave trading ships, and when a fire breaks out aboard it during the night, the ship's commander Allan and his crew flee, leaving Tintin, <b>Haddock,</b> Snowy and Skut aboard along with a consignment of African slaves.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and <b>Haddock</b> {{meet the}} detectives Thomson and Thompson, who {{reveal that the}} wounded man at Marlinspike was Syldavian. Tintin surmises that Calculus had invented an {{ultrasonic}} device capable of {{being used as a}} weapon of mass destruction, which both Syldavian and Bordurian intelligence agents are now seeking to obtain. Discovering that Bordurian spies have kidnapped Calculus and are holding him hostage in their Rolle embassy, Tintin and <b>Haddock</b> seek to rescue him, but during the attempt he is captured by Syldavian agents, who are able to escape by plane to their home country. The next morning, Tintin and <b>Haddock</b> learn that Bordurian fighter aircraft forced down the Syldavian plane and captured Calculus, who is now being held in Borduria. They travel to Borduria's capital, Szohôd, intent on rescuing him.|$|E
