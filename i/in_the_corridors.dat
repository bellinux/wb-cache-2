5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{was carried out in}} Bardia National Park and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bardia-Katarniaghat (Khata) <b>corridor,</b> which is one of five {{priority}} areas identified by Terai Arc Landscape Program (TAL) for habitat restoration due to heavy degradation of forest. The study was conducted from 15 th October to 26 th November 2011. The main objectives of the study were to compare the composition and abundance of tiger prey in both study areas and to draw inference on tiger habitat quality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> <b>The</b> line-plot pellet count technique of Wegge (1976) was adopted to assess the composition and abundance of tiger prey. Habitat compositions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park and <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> were determined on the basis of proportional length of different habitats along transects. Land use changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> from 1997 to 2011 were found out by the help of GIS using a topographic map and a Google Earth image. Corridors are connections between separate areas of similar habitat (Bolen & Willam 1995) and geographical extensions, continental or maritime, whose function is to connect areas and facilitate the movement of plants and animals and provide natural conditions that guarantee their conservation (Rivera et al. 2002). The study found out that the abundance of major tiger prey species like chital (Axis axis) and hog deer (A. porcinus) was extremely low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Khata <b>corridor</b> compared to <b>the</b> south-western part of the park. The less abundant swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli) was restricted to phanta <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, but was absent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> Other preferred prey species, such as sambar deer (C. unicolor) was rare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, but absent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> Similarly, nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and barking deer (Muntiacus muntjac) were scarce in both study areas. Livestock pellet groups were recorded only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> with <b>the</b> highest abundance after wild boar. Relatively small areas of important prey habitats like phanta and tallgrass floodplain ((p â‰¤ 0. 05) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, and their poor quality was the main reason for the low density of chief tiger prey species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> Habitat assessment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Khata <b>corridor</b> showed that <b>the</b> forest area remained unchanged and there was an insignificant increase in other land types from 1997 to 2011. The study indicated that the effect of past anthropogenic activities, current excessive livestock pressure and infestation of the alien plant Lantana camara were important factors affecting <b>the</b> habitat quality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> This suggested that tiger habitat quality was not satisfactory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the</b> higher density of wild boar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> may fulfill <b>the</b> feeding requirements of the tiger and can help its transboundary dispersal in some extent. On the other hand, the tiger population may increase with the restoration of habitats, which in turn may increase tiger human conflicts due to the small habitat area. All these issues should be addressed to restore <b>the</b> tiger habitat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Khata <b>corridor</b> and facilitate its smooth dispersal through it...|$|R

About [...] south from Xuande Gate, the Bian River intercepted the Imperial Boulevard, which crossed it over the stone Zhou Bridge, balustraded and flat-decked.

500|$|A boom in new {{construction}} after 1926 created stiff competition for older buildings like the Monadnock. Occupancy declined from 87percent in 1929 to 55percent in 1937 {{and the building}} began to lose money. In 1938, building manager Graham Aldis (Owen's nephew) announced what the Chicago Daily Tribune called [...] "the city's largest and most novel modernization job" [...] in a move toward halting the destruction of Chicago's aging skyscrapers. Rejecting the term [...] "modernization", Aldis called his plan [...] "progressive styling", which he believed would revolutionize the way building maintenance was done to preserve {{millions of dollars worth}} of buildings that would otherwise be destroyed. [...] "There is no reason why", he said, [...] "any well-designed office building need be torn down because of obsolescence." [...] Skidmore & Owings, who had pioneered functional design, were retained to lead a $125,000 program ($ in [...] dollars) to restyle the main entrance, remodel the lobby and ground floor shops, modernize all the public spaces, and progressively modernize office suites as demand required. The modernization included covering the mosaic floors with rubber tile and terrazzo, enclosing the elevators and ornamental stairways, and replacing the marble and oak finishes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> and offices with modern materials. By the end of 1938, 35 new tenants had signed leases and 11 existing tenants had leased additional space in the building.|$|E
