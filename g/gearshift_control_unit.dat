40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{integrated}} powertrain <b>control</b> for <b>gearshifts</b> on twin clutch transmissions is developed. First, a detailed model of an automotive powertrain featuring a twin clutch transmission is developed in Matlab/Simulink®. This model includes detailed friction {{models for the}} twin clutch that enable {{an investigation into the}} effects of different friction materials on the performance of the gearshift controller. The transmission model also includes detailed models of the synchronisers and thus allows a simulation of synchroniser-to-synchroniser shifts. A simplified phenomenological model, derived from a more complex non-linear model, is employed to model the hydraulic actuation of clutches and synchroniser. The thesis finds that the dependency of the friction coefficient on the sliding speed has an important influence on the gearshift quality and the performance of gearshift controller, while the absolute level of the friction coefficient is less important. Based on this powertrain model the key problems of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions were identified and a control that overcomes these problems was developed. The first stage was to devise a <b>gearshift</b> <b>control</b> algorithm that handles single clutch-to-clutch shifts without a oneway (freewheeler-, overrunning-) clutch. This basic <b>gearshift</b> <b>control</b> algorithm featured a control of clutch slip for the engine torque transfer and a control of engine speed through engine torque manipulation (plus clutch pressure manipulation for downshifts). In a second stage, an optional transmission output torque control was developed that could be integrated in the basic control. The thesis shows that these control strategies are superior, in terms of shift quality, to conventional <b>gearshift</b> <b>controls</b> as used on planetary-type transmissions and are also robust against variations in the powertrain parameters (including friction coefficient) and sensor noise. The control strategies developed for single clutch-to-clutch shifts were extended to handle double and other multiple gearshifts that take place in the same transmission half. The thesis also investigates the other main part of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions, the gear pre-selection. The thesis shows that, on power-on gearshifts, the torque reactions at the transmission output due to the gear pre-selection with conventional hydraulically actuated synchronisers can be effectively compensated for by a simple manipulation of engine torque.

40|$|WO 200275824 A UPAB: 20030111 NOVELTY - To {{produce an}} adaptronic micro system, {{one or more}} piezo {{electric}} fiber transducers (2) are embedded in a polymer matrix (1), {{with one or more}} <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (3) to <b>control</b> and/or carry signals. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> more strongly at the matrix. When the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are given an intermediate hardening. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can also be light waveguides. The transducers are piezo electric, magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems. ADVANTAGE - The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix, for the production of prepreg modules...|$|R
