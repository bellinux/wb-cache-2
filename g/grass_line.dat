5000|$|The <b>grass</b> <b>line,</b> {{where the}} dirt of the infield {{ends and the}} grass of the outfield begins, has no special {{significance}} {{to the rules of}} the game, but it can influence the outcome of a game. Dirt running paths between the bases (and, at one time and still in some parks, between the pitcher and the catcher) have existed {{since the beginning of the}} game, although they were not mentioned in the rule books until around 1950, and their specifications are flexible. In addition to providing a running path, the grass lines act as a visual aid so that players, umpires and fans may better judge distance from the center of the diamond. Occasionally the ball may take a tricky bounce off the dirt area or the edge between the dirt and the grass. Multiple World Series championships (including 1924, 1960 and 1986) have been decided or heavily influenced by erratic hops of ground balls.|$|E
50|$|Lake Wauburg {{is located}} {{just south of}} Paynes Prairie in central Alachua County, Florida, United States. The lake is in the Ocala Uplift District, {{situated}} between the forested highlands of the Fairfield Hills area and the surrounding dissolution valleys of the Alachua Prairies. Lake Wauburg is irregular in shape, covering 1.6 km2 with about 5 km of shoreline. The fertile green water supports shad and a deep <b>grass</b> <b>line</b> is good to hold fish. It had a maximum depth of 3m and offers excellent Black Crappie and Bass fishing. The lake is adjoined to the east by Sawgrass Pond. A marshy area to the northwest is separated from the lake by a topographic high. The {{north end of the}} Lake is owned by the University of Florida and is operated as a recreation facility for students and faculty. The southern edge is boarded by Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, which allows public access to the lake and a boat launch. Outboard motors are prohibited on the lake but trolling motors and paddle boats are permitted.|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIVegetated {{buffer strips}} (BS) {{can help prevent}} {{nitrogen}} (N) losses from fields by subsurface lateral flow, thus protecting water resources. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if narrow BS would effectively remove dissolved inorganic N from subsurface lateral flow. Nitrate-N (NO 3 -N) and ammonia-N (NH 3 -N) concentrations in subsurface lateral flow were measured at 1 m depth in a BS system consisting of five treatments: G: strip of grass (Fescue arundinacea); GS: strip of grass and line of native shrubs (Fuchsia magellanica); GST 1 : strip of <b>grass,</b> <b>line</b> of shrubs and line of native trees 1 (Luma chequen); GST 2 : strip of <b>grass,</b> <b>line</b> of shrubs and line of native trees 2 (Drimys winteri); and C: bare soil as control. Water samples for the NO 3 -N and NH 3 -N measurements were collected between June 2012 and August 2014 in observation wells located at the inlet (input) and outlet (output) of each treatment. The analyses showed that vegetated BS had NO 3 -N removal efficiency ranging from 33 to 67 % (mean 52 %), with the G treatment showing the best performance in reducing NO 3 -N concentrations in subsurface lateral flow. The BS treatments were not effective in reducing NH 3 -N concentrations. The results suggested that N uptake by grass is the main process associated with the NO 3 -N retention capacity of vegetated BS.

50|$|Breeding {{has been}} {{recorded}} between February and September. The yellow-browed sparrow builds a cup nest of dried <b>grass</b> <b>lined</b> with fine plant material.

50|$|They {{are very}} shy damselflies always keeping to {{the shade of}} {{overhanging}} trees or settling on <b>grasses</b> <b>lining</b> the banks. Females keep solely to shrubs adjoining the river, except when ovipositing. The broad black apices to the wings of this insect will distinguish it from all others in the same genus.|$|R
50|$|This species breeds in the {{far north}} of Eurasia and North America. It nests on Arctic tundra and islands, laying 2-3 olive-brown eggs in <b>grass</b> <b>lined</b> depressions. Like other skuas, it will fly {{at the head of}} a human or other {{intruder}} approaching its nest. Although it cannot inflict serious damage, the experience is frightening and painful.|$|R
50|$|They nest {{either on}} the ground or low in bushes, seldom more than 1.5 m above the ground. The female builds the nest over a period of about five days. It is bulky and sturdily made of leaves, strips of bark, twigs, forb stalks, and <b>grasses,</b> <b>lined</b> with pine needles, {{shredded}} bark, grass, and sometimes hair.|$|R
50|$|The nest is {{a ball of}} <b>grass</b> <b>lined</b> with {{feathers}} and tussac root fibres. It is built {{on or near the}} ground among tussac or in a rock crevice. The eggs are pinkish with small reddish spots, three or four are laid in a clutch. The eggs are laid from early October to December and two broods are probably raised during the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season lasts from September to December and two broods are often raised. The cup-shaped nest {{is made of}} <b>grass,</b> <b>lined</b> with feathers and placed under rocks, grass clumps or buildings or in {{a hole in the}} ground. One to three eggs are laid. These are white, sometimes with a few red spots. They are incubated for two weeks and the young birds fledge after another two weeks.|$|R
50|$|The female snipe makes {{a shallow}} hole in moist soil, and then weaves a <b>grass</b> <b>lining</b> {{to build a}} nest up to 7 inches across and 3 inches deep. A normal clutch size is 2-4 eggs, with an {{incubation}} period of 18-20 days. A snipe's eggs are typically an earthy brown colour with occasional blots of brown, black, or purple. Snipe chicks will usually leave the nest upon {{the first day of}} hatching.|$|R

50|$|This pewee {{is found}} {{at the edges of}} forests and {{cultivated}} areas with tall trees. The nest is a small open saucer of fibre and <b>grasses,</b> <b>lined</b> with <b>grass</b> and decorated with lichen on its exterior. It is placed in a tree fork or on a branch. The female builds the nest and incubates the typical clutch of two creamy-white eggs, which are marked with red-brown spots at the larger end, for 15-16 days to hatching.|$|R
50|$|Comb ducks nest {{mainly in}} tree holes, also in tall <b>grass.</b> They <b>line</b> their nests with reeds, grass, or feathers, but not down.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} between May and January, peaking in September and October. The nest is usually {{built in a}} recess in a tree trunk or behind a loose slab of bark, but is {{sometimes}} in a tangle of creepers, the sheath of a palm frond, banana bunch or an abandoned farm implement. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs and dry <b>grasses,</b> <b>lined</b> with fine rootlets. Up to four eggs are laid and incubation lasts about two weeks with the young fledging and leaving the nest in fifteen to twenty days.|$|R

50|$|The Sharpe's longclaw is a monogamous and solitary breeder that defends a territory. The {{breeding}} season is {{during or after}} the rains, from March to June, September to October and in December.

The nest is a well-made cup of dried <b>grass</b> <b>lined</b> with roots and placed near {{the ground at the}} base of a grass tussock or under a shrub or plant. Between two and three eggs are laid.|$|R
