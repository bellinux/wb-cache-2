However, most publications have focused on the initial stages of deformation where the latter is uniform. The current study was focused on the last stages of fracture, the necking, and crack propagation.

40|$|<b>Deformation</b> <b>Banding</b> (DB) in {{cold rolled}} mild steel has been {{experimentally}} established by microstructure investigation and mis-orientation analysis using EBSP. Clearly this <b>deformation</b> <b>banding</b> mode {{must be included}} in modelling the deformation texture, {{and this has been}} attempted. The cause of <b>deformation</b> <b>banding</b> in all DB models is the reduction of the total work for plastic deformation through a relaxation of the deformation constraints. In the first DB model, all grains are assumed to band from the first deformation step. Such an unrealistic assumption has been eliminated in the new model by the introduction of a banding criterion which states that deformation will occur only if the energy for normal slip involved in the DB model is less than that for the RC model. The computer grains firstly deform according to conventional RC model before the DB criterion is satisfied and then deform according to DB model after the criterion is met at a specific step. If the ratio of critical resolved shear stresses for { 110 } and { 112 } slip planes is set at unity, the model overpopulates { 111 }〈 110 〉 component, but when the ratio is set at 0. 85 : 1. 0, the resulting ODF is closer to the measured textures. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been reported that in cold rolled copper, cube oriented volumes are frequently formed in long thin bands next to bands having orientations related to the cube orientation by a 30 - 40 rotation about a (111) common pole.

In this paper the formation of this special microstructural arrangement is studied by a generalised <b>deformation</b> <b>banding</b> model which involves the cooperation of two types of <b>deformation</b> <b>banding.</b> The model also predicts that the cube volumes have lower energy contents than both their immediate and bulk average surroundings.

40|$|<b>Deformation</b> <b>bands</b> are strain {{localisation}} features {{common in}} highly porous clastic sedimentary bodies.

40|$|<b>Deformation</b> <b>bands</b> are narrow tabular zones that {{accommodates}} strain {{through the}} reorganization of grains by shearing and/or volumetric deformation in porous and granular rocks. <b>Deformation</b> <b>bands</b> in porous sandstones are widely documented, fewer studies are done on <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> in porous carbonate rocks. There are even fewer published examples of <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> in porous chalk. Inspired by this fact, the current study {{presents the results of}} detailed thin-section and SEM analyses of <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> present within carbonate rocks from the Upper Maastrichtian to Danian chalk from the Oseberg Field area, northern North Sea. The studied <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> are hosted in chalks from the Hardråde/Jorsalfare Formation in the Oseberg fault block in association with stylolites, located 2200 to 2300 m below the sea level. The <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> found in the chalk are very thin with a μm-scale thickness, i. e. much thinner than mm- to cm-thick <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> typically found in porous sandstones and carbonate grainstones. Two types of <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> have been described and classified in the chalk by structural analysis and microscopic investigations: (1) bed-parallel compaction bands (CBs) and (2) bedding-oblique solution-compactive shear bands (SCSBs). For the structural analysis of the <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> in the studied cores, methods include recording the frequency of deformation structures (the amount of deformation structures bisecting the scanline per 0. 2 m) along scanlines and the orientations of the different deformation structures that bisect the scanline. The microstructural characterization of the <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> involved thin-section analysis by means of the optical microscope and SEM. The porosity measurements of the <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> and the host rock were performed by the ImageJ software. Both <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> and extension fractures seem to be present in the chalk as what has been referred to a hairline fractures" or healed fractures". Due to the difficulty of distinguishing the two different deformation structures at the macroscopic scale, it has been concluded that microscopic analysis is necessary to distinguish between the two. In this work, the <b>deformation</b> <b>bands</b> are suggested to have been formed due to burial and differential compaction, where the maximum stress axis (σ 1) was oriented perpendicular to the bedding. Differential compaction could have occurred due to lateral variation in the thickness to the fault basin filled sediments comprising of the syn-rift sediments of Jurassic and the post-rift sediments of Cretaceous overlain by Cenozoic sediments. Evident by the top Cretaceous sediments shaping out as an open anticline, the differential compaction would have applied even more strain to the bedding than burial compaction alone. The deformation band features where not easy to observe in SEM-images. Their narrowness, with an apparent thickness of about 30 - 220 μm, {{could be one of the}} reasons why these features easily have been overlooked in many chalk reservoirs.

The effects of temperature and concentration on poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) block copolymer properties in aqueous solutions were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The temperature-dependent changes of some bands were used to denote the critical micellization temperatures (cmt). It was deduced that the appearance of the symmetric <b>deformation</b> <b>band</b> of anhydrous methyl groups in the spectra of aqueous Pluronic F 127 solutions at temperature below the cmt means the existence of a hydrophobic microenvironment. The appearance of the symmetric <b>deformation</b> <b>band</b> of hydrated methyl groups at temperature above the transition region indicates that the micellar core must contain a certain amount of water. The proportion of anhydrous methyl groups was increased during the micellization process with the decrease of the proportion of hydrated methyl groups. The cmt values of Pluronic F 127 in aqueous solutions were decreased with an increase of concentration. In the meantime, the water content in the micellar core was also decreased. The effect of gelation on the spectral behavior of Pluronic F 127 in aqueous solutions is too weak to be observed by the FTIR technique.

40|$|It {{is shown}} by a crystallographic etching {{technique}} applicable to copper that <b>deformation</b> <b>banding</b> is an important deformation mode in f. c. c. metals and alloys. In a cold rolled coarse grain copper, <b>deformation</b> <b>banding</b> forms in a three dimensional manner dividing the grain on average into over 600 regions of different orientations. The influence of this important, but long ignored deformation mode, is studied by incorporating it into the Taylor model. The predicted textures from the new model are better than those from other existing models in mainly two respects. Firstly, the DB model predicts the co-existence {{of the three major}} f. c. c. rolling texture components, namely { 123 }〈 634 〉 or S component, > 112 >〈 111 〉 or C and > 110 >〈 112 〉 or {f}B{/f}. The existing models are deficient in that they predict either C and S or B, but not their co-existence. The second point is that textures predicted by the existing models are always too sharp compared to the experimental textures. The DB model predicts texture peaks with larger spread and hence more realistic texture sharpness. Another feature of the model is that only two independent slip systems, instead of five, are required to accomodate the imposed shape change, which agrees with experimental observation. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nano-scale Au/Cu multilayers were {{investigated}} by nano/microindentation. It {{was found that}} the hardness of the multilayers increases with decreasing individual layer thickness (λ), and shear <b>band</b> <b>deformation</b> can occur more easily in the multilayer with small λ. For comparison, the same experiments were also performed on Cr/Cu multilayers with the same layer structure. The results show that the Cr/Cu multilayer can be more effective in resisting shear <b>band</b> <b>deformation</b> than the Au/Cu multilayer. Finally, the λ dependence of shear <b>band</b> <b>deformation</b> and the difference between plastic deformation behaviors of the two multilayers were analyzed based on dislocation plasticity...|$|R
