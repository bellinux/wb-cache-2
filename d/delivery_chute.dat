Meanwhile, a truck full of coal {{has come to the}} house to make a delivery, but Jerry grabs a rope and ties it to the <b>delivery</b> <b>chute.</b> Jerry pulls the <b>delivery</b> <b>chute</b> up to the living room such that the entire shipment of coal literally barges into the house (Jerry is not seen again afterwards), pushing Tom towards the front door and then knocking Mammy down the moment she opens it. As soon as she digs her head out from the coal, she begins threatening to throttle Tom, despite the utter impossibility of Tom being responsible for this new mess. Just then, Tom emerges in blackface.|$|E

The work aims at the {{optimization}} of {{the output}} feed rate of a Stationary Hook Hopper Feeder {{so that the}} best possible set of parameters affecting it can be selected to get the desired output. For this purpose the effect of various parameters on the feeder output is studied. To facilitate the study and detailed analysis, a statistical model is constructed {{which is used to}} predict and optimize the performance of the system. Efficient feed rate optimization determines the input variable settings to adjust the feed rate of the feeder according to the consumption of the parts in the next phase of production. The Stationary Hook Hopper Feeder, whose performance is to be studied, consists of a rotating circular plate and a guiding hook fixed at the centre and running up to the periphery of the plate. As the plate rotates, the parts follow the trajectory of the hook, orient themselves and then eventually are delivered through the <b>delivery</b> <b>chute,</b> tangentially to the plate. The factors influencing the feeder’s performance include the speed of rotation of the disc, the population of the parts in the hopper and the size of parts to be fed. A series of experiments is performed on the three process parameters to investigate their effect on the feed rate. To study the interaction among the factors a full 23 factorial experiment approach has been adopted using the two basic principles of experimental design- replication and randomization. The process model was formulated based on Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Minitab ® statistical package. The outcome is represented graphically and in the form of empirical model which defines the performance characteristics of the Stationary Hook Hopper Feeder...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of more stringent environmental and occupational {{health and safety}} regulations have instigated efforts {{to reduce the amount of}} dust generated during loading of ships with dusty bulk materials. An initial study was undertaken to investigate possible methods to reduce dust emissions from wheat loading operations at the Port of Newcastle. Details of this study are contained in an industrial report by Krull [I] and articles by Wheeler et al. [2, 31. In summary, a number of alternative loading chute configurations and <b>delivery</b> <b>chute</b> profiles were examined in a pilot-scale test facility, which showed that it was not beneficial to decelerate the product stream in an effort to keep the relative velocity of the air stream over the grain below the minimum pickup velocity. Instead, it was found that concentrating the product stream and keeping the product velocity high was more beneficial in reducing dust emissions. Experimental results showed a 50 % dust reduction was possible and was subsequently achieved at the grain loading terminal. Further studies have since been conducted for Finders Ports in Port Adelaide, Australia to examine if the same approach could be used for loading ilmenite onto ships. Experimental results conducted in the pilot-scale test facility using the same chute configuration as used for wheat indicate a potential dust reduction of approximately 80 %. For both the investigated ship loading operations, similar constraints on the implementation of dust reducing methods were imposed as follows: Required modifications to the ship loaders must be undertaken in a short period of time and if possible not involve any significant structural work to the ship loader. Ability to retrofit to the existing booms of the ship loaders. Existing filling levels of ships were to be maintained and the ship loader must be able to load grain underneath the decking on the ship's cargo hold. Due to strict export quality requirements no additives, including water, were to be used as dust suppression agents...|$|E
