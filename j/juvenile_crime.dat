The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce <b>juvenile</b> <b>crime.</b> In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the change of reports of <b>juvenile</b> <b>crimes</b> in newspaper. <b>Juvenile</b> <b>crimes</b> were treated as social {{problems}} from latter half of the 1990 s to the middle of the 2000 s. However, it cannot be said that there was change in quality and quantity in them. On the other hand, the number of reports of <b>juvenile</b> <b>crimes</b> increased, though the qualitative change of the report was not fully discussed. The changes in the treatment of <b>juvenile</b> <b>crimes</b> are as follows. First, the reports of <b>juvenile</b> <b>crimes</b> by mass media became extensive. Since latter half of the 1990 s, reports on <b>juvenile</b> <b>crimes</b> in newspaper increased, which raised social uneasiness. Second, it came to be considered that "ordinary children" caused crimes. Third, the problem of mind became the focus of attention. And fourth, the difference between adults and children became unclear. This paper discusses the points which were not fully discussed in previous research: 1) how juvenile offenders were described before social uneasiness grew 2) the change of the description of juvenile offenders' mental states 3) the change of the image of juveniles After the investigation, it was found that from 1950 to 1970 juveniles were considered as being easily affected and liable to change. Different expressions were used for them: juvenile offenders were called "huryou", and violent incidents. "kenka". What made them commit crimes were "mental illness" which was curable. but recently it is called "kokoro no yami (darkness of mind) " which is beyond comprehension. Moreover, the binary opposition, adults who should be punished and children who should be protected, is no longer seen, and the attitude that responsibility should be made clear by punishment is predominant...|$|R

5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in <b>juvenile</b> <b>crime</b> statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E

He established a pilot program for a drug court under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, {{in an effort to}} reduce court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's <b>juvenile</b> <b>crime</b> unit. In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, and it was fully established the following year.

In the late 1960s <b>juvenile</b> <b>crime</b> increased in South Central L.A. as new youth gangs formed after older gangs such as the Slausons and the Gladiators disbanded and their members joined the Black Power Movement, most notably {{as part of the}} Black Panther Party. Initially Williams despised the predatory street gangs in South Central. Because of his viciousness and willingness to fight older youths, many of whom belonged to small-time street gangs, Williams earned the respect of many neighborhood thugs on the West Side who were leaders of their own small-time cliques.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{about crime}} {{at the station}} {{initially}} appeared justified. The first reported crime at Anacostia station occurred on February 5, 1992, just six weeks after the station opened. A man was accosted by three teenagers at about 9:25 P.M. at the station, kidnapped at gunpoint, and forced to strip naked. The youths took clothing, a watch, and $7 from him, and were caught by police while trying to flee {{the scene of the}} crime. In its first year of operation, Anacostia tied with the Capitol Heights station for the most auto thefts (17), and accounted for 11.3 percent of all auto thefts at Metrorail stations. By 2005, large crowds of {{middle and high school students}} began congregating at the station, brawling and robbing Metro riders and creating a public safety issue. In November 2005, Metro and the District of Columbia Public Schools entered into an agreement to bus students from Anacostia High School directly to the station rather than have them walk or take Metrobus to the station. Metro Transit Police officers, some accompanied by dogs, began patrolling Anacostia station along with six other Metro stations, to increase awareness of police presences in the stations and deter crime. The police presence did not appear to help: Between 2002 and 2006, arrests of juveniles on Metro increased to 295 from 156, and warnings increased 40 percent. Nearly half the arrests occurred at just five stations: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place-Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue.
