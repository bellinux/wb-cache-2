25|$|Treadmill {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body weight supported treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the treadmill settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and <b>knee</b> <b>joints)</b> and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E

2500|$|To become flippers, {{the limbs}} had changed considerably. The limbs were very large, each {{about as long}} as the trunk. The forelimbs and hindlimbs {{strongly}} resembled each other. The humerus in the upper arm, and the thighbone in the upper leg, had become large flat bones, expanded at their outer ends. The elbow joints and the <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> were no longer functional: the lower arm and the lower leg could not flex in relation to the upper limb elements, but formed a flat continuation of them. All outer bones had become flat supporting elements of the flippers, tightly connected to each other and hardly able to rotate, flex, extend or spread. This was true of the ulna, radius, metacarpals and fingers, as well of the tibia, fibula, metatarsals and toes. Furthermore, in order to elongate the flippers, the number of phalanges had increased, up to eighteen in a row, a phenomenon called hyperphalangy. The flippers were not perfectly flat, but had a lightly convexly curved top profile, like an airfoil, to be able to [...] "fly" [...] through the water.|$|E
2500|$|As {{reptiles}} {{in general}} are oviparous, {{until the end of}} the twentieth century it had been seen as possible that smaller plesiosaurs may have crawled up on a beach to lay eggs, like modern turtles. Their strong limbs and a flat underside seemed to have made this feasible. This method was, for example, defended by Halstead. However, as those limbs no longer had functional elbow or <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> and the underside by its very flatness would have generated a lot of friction, already in the nineteenth century it was hypothesised that plesiosaurs had been viviparous. Besides, it was hard to conceive how the largest species, as big as whales, could have survived a beaching. Fossil finds of ichthyosaur embryos showed that at least one group of marine reptiles had born live young. The first to claim that similar embryos had been found with plesiosaurs was Harry Govier Seeley, who reported in 1887 to have acquired a nodule with four to eight tiny skeletons. In 1896, he described this discovery in more detail. If authentic, the embryos of plesiosaurs would have been very small like those of ichthyosaurs. However, in 1982 Richard Anthony Thulborn showed that Seeley had been deceived by a [...] "doctored" [...] fossil of a nest of crayfish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{data have}} {{suggested}} {{a relationship between}} acute arthritic pain and acid sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC 3) on primary afferent fibers innervating joints. The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the role of ASIC 3 in a rat model of osteoarthritis (OA) which is considered a degenerative rather than an inflammatory disease. Methods We induced OA via intra-articular mono-iodoacetate (MIA) injection, and evaluated pain-related behaviors including weight bearing measured with an incapacitance tester and paw withdrawal threshold in a von Frey hair test, histology of affected <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> and immunohistochemistry of <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> afferents. We also assessed the effect of ASIC 3 selective peptide blocker (APETx 2) on pain behavior, disease progression, and ASIC 3 expression in <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> afferents. Results OA rats showed not only weight-bearing pain but also mechanical hyperalgesia outside the <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> (secondary hyperalgesia). ASIC 3 expression in <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> afferents was significantly upregulated approximately twofold at Day 14. Continuous intra-articular injections of APETx 2 inhibited weight distribution asymmetry and secondary hyperalgesia by attenuating ASIC 3 upregulation in <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> afferents. Histology of ipsilateral <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> showed APETx 2 worked chondroprotectively if administered in the early, but not late phase. Conclusions Local ASIC 3 immunoreactive nerve is strongly associated with weight-bearing pain and secondary hyperalgesia in MIA-induced OA model. APETx 2 inhibited ASIC 3 upregulation in <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> afferents regardless of the time-point of administration. Furthermore, early administration of APETx 2 prevented cartilage damage.
