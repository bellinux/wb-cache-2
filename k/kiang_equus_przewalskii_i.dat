30|$|Our investigations, {{as well as}} others, {{indicate}} that livestock exclude wild herbivores such as argali from the best pastures and perhaps also reduce {{the total amount of}} available forage (Bhatnagar et al. 2006 a; Namgail et al. 2007 a). On the contrary, Rupshu pastoralists increasingly complain of wild herbivores such as <b>kiangs</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>kiang)</b> and marmots (Marmota himalayana) as the main competitors for pasture resources (e.g. Bhatnagar et al. 2006 b). The permanent use of water sources near the settlements creates novel conflicts with the local and sensitive wildlife, as water sources are scarce in the overall plateau and the breeding of migratory birds primarily occurs in these restricted habitats.|$|R

40|$|Abstract An {{emerging}} {{conflict with}} Trans-Himalayan pastoral communities in Ladakh’s Changthang Plateau threatens the conservation {{prospects of the}} <b>kiang</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>kiang)</b> in India. It is locally believed that Changthang’s rangelands are overstocked with kiang, resulting in forage competition with livestock.

50|$|The wild {{progenitor}} of {{the domestic}} horse is now extinct. The Przewalski's horse, <b>Equus</b> ferus <b>przewalskii,</b> is a wholly separate subspecies with a different number of chromosomes than domesticated horses (E. f. caballus), {{and has never been}} successfully domesticated.|$|R
50|$|This {{degree of}} {{chromosomal}} similarity is {{roughly equivalent to}} that found in equines. Interfertility of horses and donkeys is common, although sterility of the offspring (mules) is nearly universal (with only around 60 exceptions recorded in equine history). Similar complexities and prevalent sterility pertain to horse-zebra hybrids, or zorses, whose chromosomal disparity is very wide, with horses typically having 32 chromosome pairs and zebras between 16 and 23 depending on species. In a direct parallel to the chimp-human case, the Przewalski's Horse (<b>Equus</b> <b>przewalskii)</b> with 33 chromosome pairs, and the domestic horse (E. caballus) with 32 pairs, {{have been found to}} be interfertile, and produce semi-fertile offspring: male hybrids can breed with female domestic horses.|$|R

Computerized simulation modeling, using two endangered species models, the Eld's deer (Cervus eldi thamin) and Pr-zewalski's horse (<b>Equus</b> <b>przewalskii)</b> clearly demonstrated the value of certain sperm storage and use strategies for maintaining genetic diversity in captive populations.

40|$|The Tibetan gazelle Procapra picticaudata is on {{the verge}} of {{extinction}} in India with only c. 100 individuals remaining in the Hanle Valley of eastern Ladakh and Sikkim. Conservation planning and initiation of a recovery programme are hindered by lack of ecological information on the species and we therefore assessed the biotic and abiotic correlates of its occurrence in the Hanle Valley. Ecological attributes of areas selected by gazelles were compared with those of adjoining areas without gazelles. Resource selection functions revealed that gazelles use relatively flat areas (6 - 15 °) disproportionately during both summer and winter, and preferred south-facing slopes and avoided north-facing slopes during winter. Measurements of plant production using exclosures showed that herbivores removed up to 47 % of the forage biomass from areas without gazelles, whereas only 29 % was removed from areas with gazelles. Although areas selected by gazelles were only marginally more productive than areas not selected, the proportional representation of forbs in plant biomass was significantly higher in the former. Spatial co-occurrence patterns examined using null models revealed a significant negative relationship between distribution of gazelles and goats and sheep, and a significant positive relationship between gazelles and wild <b>kiang</b> <b>Equus</b> <b>kiang</b> and domestic yak Bos grunniens. Future in situ recovery programmes for the Tibetan gazelle in Ladakh need to focus on securing livestock-free, forb-dominated areas, with participation from the local pastoral community...|$|R
40|$|Between the 5 th and 10 th of March 2001 we {{completed}} a 450 km route by car in Northern Sikkim. During the trip {{along the southern}} slopes of the Himalayas and Sikkim Plateau we didn’t see a single kiang. According to the local people and military personnel in Sikkim, kiangs are known only in the outer limits of the Sikkim Plateau, where wild animals have a possibility to migrate free over the Chinese-Indian border. In winter only small groups of kiang incidentally come to the Sikkim Plateau from South Tibet. But in May more of them come there and stay approximately until October-November, especially {{in the eastern part}} of the plateau near the lakes. The Sikkim Plateau is a breeding territory for kiangs, which spend winters in South Tibet. Local people and military personnel do not hunt or catch kiang on the Sikkim Plateau. Kiang migrations over the Chinese-Indian border are dependent on the movements of the nomadic yak herders of Sikkim, who spend winter on the plateau and go to the southern slopes of the Himalayas in spring. Nowhere in other parts of the great range of this species do kiangs breed at such an altitude (5, 100 - 5, 500 m above sea level). We suggest that this may be due to the small size of the southern <b>kiang</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>kiang</b> polyodon).

The IL 26 gene is located between two other well-known cytokines genes of this family encoding interferon-gamma (IFNG) and IL 22 in an evolutionary conserved gene cluster. In contrast to humans and most other mammals, mice lack a functional Il 26 gene. We analyzed the genome sequences of other vertebrates for the presence or absence of functional IL 26 orthologs and found that the IL 26 gene has also become inactivated in several equid species. We detected a one-base pair frameshift deletion in exon 2 of the IL 26 gene in the domestic horse (Equus caballus), Przewalski horse (<b>Equus</b> <b>przewalskii)</b> and donkey (<b>Equus</b> asinus). The remnant IL 26 gene in the horse is still transcribed and gives rise to at least five alternative transcripts. None of these transcripts share a conserved open reading frame with the human IL 26 gene. A comparative analysis across diverse vertebrates revealed that the IL 26 gene has also independently been inactivated in a few other mammals, including the African elephant and the European hedgehog.

40|$|In China, {{the first}} Przewalski’s horse (<b>Equus</b> <b>przewalskii)</b> group was {{released}} in Kalamaili Ungulate Protected Area in Xinjiang, in August 2001. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate reproduction and development of released Przewalski’s horses in Xinjiang, China from 2002 to 2006. Twenty-four descendants were naturally born, average reproduction rate was 38. 7 %, and average survival rate of foals was 69. 1 % in this interim. Frequent alternation of the leading stallion and infertility in female horses due to environmental factors were main causes for the low reproduction rate. The infant mortality rate of released Przewalski’s horses was 25. 0 %, and 83. 3 % of death in infants was due to the leading stallion infanticide. The released Przewalski’s horses exhibited seasonal breeding, 70. 8 % of infants were born in May and June. The fertility rates were 8. 3 % in April and 37. 5 % in May, which were lower compared to those of the captive Przewalski’s horse groups (18. 3 % and 44. 3 %, respectively). Furthermore, the fertility rate in June was 33. 3 % and higher than the captive groups (18. 3 %). These findings showed that the breeding peak of the released Przewalski’s horse groups was later than the captive groups, and suggested that the altered survival environment and food supplies were the main reasons contributing to the delayed breeding peak...|$|R
