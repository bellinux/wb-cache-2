Among estimated sources of variance in metric values the inter-surveyor differences had the lowest effect and slightly stronger were the influences of temporal variation (years and seasons) and shading. The impact of habitat modification was the most important factor.

Comparison of real-time and control samples showed an excellent agreement, with no evidence of fibre-optic probe fouling. EEMs of different character were identified using self-organizing maps, which demonstrated seven clusters of fluorescence EEMs which related to the intensity of fluorescence and relative intensities of peak T- 1 and T- 2 vs. peak C and peak A fluorescence. Fluorescence intensity of peaks A and C were observed to increase with rainfall, and a diesel pollution event was detected through an increase in T- 2 fluorescence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However the toxic effects of contaminants are commonly measured by means of organism-level responses. Linking such effects measures with ecological models is a promising way to apprehend population-level impacts. In this way, population models are currently increasingly used in predictive risk assessment procedures, but their use in environmental diagnostic framework remains limited due to their lack of ecological realism. The present study with the crustacean amphipod Gammarus fossarum, a sentinel species in <b>freshwater</b> <b>monitoring,</b> combines a dual field and laboratory experimental approach with a population modelling framework. In this way, we developed an ecologically-relevant periodic matrix population model for Gammarus.

40|$|Large scale <b>freshwater</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{networks}} can passively capture {{sound for}} species detection or classification. The {{sheer volume of}} acoustic recordings in such systems requires in-network classification. Most of the recent work on bioacoustic in-network classification targets narrowband or shortdurations signals, which renders it unsuitable for classifying species that emit broadband short-duration signals. This paper proposes a method for broadband sound based classification for large scale aquatic monitoring networks. The method {{is based on the}} extraction of a small set of spectral and temporal features. We collect empirical fish sounds, using the case study of the spotted tilapia (Tilapia mariae) which is an invasive freshwater fish species in Australia, and extract spectral and temporal features with our method. We then evaluate the classification accuracy and precision of these features for detecting tilapia sounds against the performance of existing narrowband sound features. The results show that using logistic regression with our limited feature set yields the best performance. Surprisingly, performance slightly improves when we downsample the signal from 44. 1 to 16 kHz, indicating that our method is well-suited for classification on embedded devices. We quantify the computational benefits of our approach for enabling broader longterm in-situ species tracking in underwater environments...|$|E

This study aimed to use a large nation-wide database to develop a multimetric index (the Korean Benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biological Integrity—KB-IBI) applicable to the biological assessment of Korean streams. Reference and impaired conditions were determined based on watershed, chemical and physical criteria. Eight of an initial 34 candidate metrics were selected using a stepwise procedure that evaluated metric variability, redundancy, sensitivity and responsiveness to environmental gradients. The selected metrics were number of taxa, percent Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) individuals, percent of a dominant taxon, percent taxa abundance without Chironomidae, Shannon’s diversity index, percent gatherer individuals, ratio of filterers and scrapers, and the Korean saprobic index.

Two of these articial substrates appeared to sample too narrow a range of taxa, which was conrmed by two-way ANOVA tests and diversity and evenness indices. Samples taken by the remaining articial substrate, composed of six plastic plant stems xed on a 15 × 15 cm square tile, were representative of the species assemblage found in the stormwa-ter retention ponds. The use of an articial substrate as a standardised method for long term invertebrate monitoring in ponds holds much potential.

The trends of mercury serve as a mirror of the industrial changes in Eastern Germany. A comparison with other sample specimens further emphasizes its usefulness in biomagnification studies.

Furthermore the mussel's biometric parameters highlight various water body specific developments, which in turn illustrate the different developments of its living conditions in the large German river systems. In the meantime, the severely lacking sample availability at many sampling sites partially underscores these changes. Reduced nutrient availability, predatory pressure, and competition by the invasive quagga mussel, D. rostriformis, are being discussed as possible causes.

The project is performed {{under the auspices of the}} Northwest Power and Conservation Council's Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program. The goal of the 2007 - 2009 Tidal <b>Freshwater</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Study is to answer the following questions: In what types of habitats within the tidal freshwater area of the lower Columbia River and estuary (LCRE; Figure 1) are yearling and subyearling salmonids found, when are they present, and under what environmental conditions? 1 And, what is the ecological importance 2 of shallow (0 - 5 m) tidal freshwater habitats to the recovery of Upper Columbia River spring Chinook salmon and steelhead and Snake River fall Chinook salmon? Research in 2007 focused mainly on the first question, with fish stock identification data providing some indication of Chinook salmon presence at the variety of habitat types sampled. The objectives and sub-objectives for the 2007 study were as follows: (1) Habitat and Fish Community Characteristics-Provide basic data on habitat and fish community characteristics for yearling and subyearling salmonids at selected sites in the tidal freshwater reach in the vicinity of the Sandy River delta. (1 a) Characterize vegetation assemblage percent cover, conventional water quality, substrate composition, and beach slope at each of six sampling sites in various tidal freshwater habitat types. (1 b) Determine fish community characteristics, including species composition, abundance, and temporal and spatial distributions. (1 c) Estimate the stock of origin for the yearling and subyearling Chinook salmon captured at the sampling sites using genetic analysis. (1 d) Statistically assess the relationship between salmonid abundance and habitat parameters, including ancillary variables such as temperature and river stage. (2) Acoustic Telemetry Monitoring-Assess feasibility of applying Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) technology to determine migration characteristics from upriver of Bonneville Dam through the study area (vicinity of the Sandy River delta/Washougal River confluence).

Here we identify priorities for freshwater biodiversity assessment for 2020 and 2030, based on the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) framework. We identify 22 priority activities for 2020 under three of the EBV classes (species populations, community composition, and ecosystem structure), which include: a globally systematic approach to collecting and assessing species data, collating existing and new data within global platforms, coordinated effort towards mapping wetland extent at high spatial resolution, linking in-situ data to modelling across regions, and mobilising citizen science for the collection and verification of data. Accomplishing these will allow the state of global biodiversity to be assessed according to a Red List Index with expanded geographic and taxonomic cover, an improved freshwater Living Planet Index with a greater number and phylogenetic range of species, measures of alpha and beta diversity, and globally-consistent estimates of wetland extent.
