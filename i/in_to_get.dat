Then by July 2009 he was a top 10 class of 2011 prospect by Scout.com and top 25 by PrepStar and had interest from Duke, Wake Forest, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Baylor, Memphis and Kansas. Late in Miller's 2009–10 junior season, he began receiving significant support from the 2010 ESPN HS Mr. Basketball USA voters who moved him into 11th place. At the time, he was competing for Quality Education Academy in Winston-Salem. He led the school to the National Christian Schools Athletic Association title. Following the season he was named a second-team ESPNHIGHSCHOOL.com All-American forward and announced his transfer to Westchester Country Day School of High Point where his close friend Deuce Bello played.

2500|$|Crocodiles possess some {{advanced}} cognitive abilities. They {{can observe}} and use patterns of prey behaviour, {{such as when}} prey come to the river to drink {{at the same time}} each day. Vladimir Dinets of the University of Tennessee, observed that crocodiles use twigs as bait for birds looking for nesting material. They place sticks on their snouts and partly submerge themselves. [...] When the birds swooped <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the sticks, the crocodiles then catch the birds. Crocodiles only do this in spring nesting seasons of the birds, when there is high demand for sticks to be used for building nests. Vladimir also discovered other similar observations from various scientists, some dating back to the 19th century. Aside from using sticks, crocodiles are also capable of cooperative hunting. Large numbers of crocodiles swim in circles to trap fish and take turns snatching them. In hunting larger prey, crocodiles swarm in, with one holding the prey down as the others rip it apart.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Cibernético {{formed a}} new group called La Secta Cibernetica that {{included}} his friends Charly Manson and Chessman and through Chessman's membership the Black Family was also invited to join this new super group.

When Cibernético suffered a severe knee injury Muerta Cibernetica took over the group and kicked Cibernético out. Chessman teamed up with Tiffany to win the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship on September 16, 2003 from Chessman's former tag team partner Electroshock and Lady Apache. The team held the Mixed titles until Gran Apache and Faby Apache defeated them for the titles on August 1, 2004 after which Chessman stopped teaming with Tiffany. Muerta Cibernetica, like Cibernético two years later, was himself unmasked by La Parka at Triplemania XIV.

2500|$|Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of The Kooks all met as {{students}} at the BRIT School in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM (where they met Rafferty who was from Brighton) in 2002. The inspiration to form a band came to Pritchard as he and Garred were out shopping for clothes one day in Primark as a joke. Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together just on a whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm {{going to give you a}} gig'", said Garred. However, the band was unable to make the performance as they were finishing off their demo at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, {{although}} they led {{the table before}} {{the final round of}} matches, Lancashire were again runners-up in the County Championship. After being knocked out of the Twenty20 competition in the group states and performing poorly in the other one-day competitions early in the season, supporters started to become discontented with the captain and coach. Sussex ended up winning the title as Lancashire lost their final match of the competition against Surrey. Chris Adams, the Sussex captain, said [...] "you played well, you had a hard season, there's no shame in your performance and you nearly did it". After the match against Surrey, Chilton was in tears and said [...] "I'm extremely proud of what our guys have achieved though. As captain I'm privileged to have seen the efforts they have put <b>in.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> close to our target was a phenomenal effort but the lads are just broken. Our players have risen to an almighty challenge and to come so close is an enormous effort". After three years as captain, Mark Chilton stepped down in October 2007 and was replaced by Stuart Law who is the most successful captain in Australian domestic cricket. However his captaincy lasted for just one season, and Lancashire again failed to claim any silverware. At {{the end of the season}} Law and veteran player Cork were released, with Chapple replacing Law as captain. In December 2008, Watkinson's job as cricket manager was changed to that of director of cricket– a job which would focus solely on aspects of cricket, rather than the traditional all-encompassing job of general team management. The move was explained by the club chairman as an effort to modernise. In February 2009, it was announced that Peter Moores– who had been sacked as England coach the previous month– would be Lancashire's new coach and had a three-year contract. In 2011 Chapple and Moores took Lancashire to their first outright first-class county championship title since 1934, {{although they}} had shared the title with Surrey in 1950. Despite being reigning champions in 2012, Lancashire had a poor season and were relegated to the Second Division. In 2013 they bounced straight back to Division 1 by winning the second division championship with a game to spare. They were once again relegated to Division 2 on the last day of the 2014 season after failing to win a tightly fought game against Middlesex. Ashley Giles (formerly of Warwickshire and England) was appointed as Director of Cricket and Head Coach after Mike Watkinson stepped down from the role in October 2014.|$|E
