40|$|To {{determine}} the fluid dynamical coefficients for plane netting, the following studies {{were carried out}} in the water circulating tank of Faculty of Fiseries, Kagoshima University and in the towing tank of Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University. As a rule coefficients for fluid dynamical resistance of netting depend on the projective areas, and therefore it becomes necessary to {{determine the}} experimental equations for the areas towards verious attack angles. In these studies, the minimum unit of the netting fabric is termed as a "Netting element". At the <b>elementary</b> <b>fabric</b> a horizontal cutting is made at the respective intermediate points of the four knotted legs. The shape of a netting element is to be shown in the form "X". The netting used in these studies are "Weaver's knot netting" and the "twisted knotless netting" which are most familier in the Japanese fisheries. Basing on the two sets of tank-experiments made on the two kinds of the netting, the following results were obtained : 1) In the case of towing tank experiments the normal force coefficient and the tangential force coefficient are proved to be independent of the Reynolds number with in the range from 6 × 10 ^ 2 to 3 × 10 ^ 3; {{and in the case of}} the circulating tank experiments they are proved to be so with the range from 8 × 10 ^ 2 to 3 × 10 ^ 3. 2) The edge effect of the netting is not depending on mesh numbers when the value of 2 ij/(i+j) is larger than 6. 0. In this case, "i" is the mesh numbers counted to the twinewise direction and "j" is the counted to the normal direction, on the netting piece used. ･･･[the rest omitted...|$|E
