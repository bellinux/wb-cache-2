The claim is made that by exploring the cultural impact of intelligence analysis, {{it is possible to}} identify patriarchal dispositions within police culture and the emergence of a gender order in policing that subordinates <b>femininity,</b> <b>youth</b> and other masculinities that run counter to police culture's form of hegemonic masculinity. This gender order is interwoven with processes of infantilisation that inhibit the integration of intelligence analysts into police intelligence work. This article concludes by discussing the prospects for cultural change in policing from the inter-related perspectives of both social theory and professional practice...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} {{stressors}} experienced by Swedish adolescent girls and young women, specifically understood {{in relation to}} social context and gender theory. Interviews were conducted with 40 young Swedish women, aged 16 - 25 years, who had sought help at a youth health centre for stress problems. Using qualitative content analysis we identified three clusters of stressors: "the stressors of modernity", "the stressors of gendered orders", and "the stressors of youth". The results revealed that multiple and intersecting discourse-shaped stressors and demands connected to essential life spheres contribute not only to experiences of distress but also to feelings of constraint. Gendered individualism and healthism proved to be essential in understanding the young women's experienced stress. Failing social support from adults, gendered demands and responsibility taking were also illuminated. This calls for a broad contextualized and gender-sensitive approach to young women's stress and health problems.

40|$|Gender {{non-conforming}} {{and sexual}} minority youth are overrepresented in the homeless youth population and are frequently discriminated against in shelters and youth serving organizations. This paper provides a contextual {{understanding of the}} ways that institutional and governmental policies and standards often perpetuate the social exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 2 -Spirit (LGBTQ 2 <b>S)</b> <b>youth,</b> by further oppression and marginalization. Factors, including institutional erasure, homophobic and transphobic violence, and discrimination that is rarely dealt with, addressed, or even noticed by shelter workers, make it especially difficult for LGBTQ 2 <b>S</b> <b>youth</b> experiencing homelessness to access support services, resulting in a situation where they feel safer on the streets than in shelters and housing programs. This paper draws on data from a qualitative Critical Action Research study that investigated the experiences of a group of LGBTQ 2 <b>S</b> homeless <b>youth</b> and the perspectives of staff in shelters through one-on-one interviews in Toronto, Canada. One of the main recommendations of the study included the need for governmental policy to address LGBTQ 2 <b>S</b> <b>youth</b> homelessness. A case study is shared to illustrate how the Government of Alberta has put this recommendation into practice by prioritizing LGBTQ 2 <b>S</b> <b>youth</b> homelessness in their provincial plan to end youth homelessness. The case study draws on informal and formal data, including group activities, questions, and surveys that were collected during a symposium on LGBTQ 2 <b>S</b> <b>youth</b> homelessness.

40|$|CONTEXT: To date, {{there has}} not been clear {{evidence}} regarding interventions that are effective in addressing the specific needs of homeless youth. A systematic and comprehensive international review on effective interventions for homeless youth is presented. This study seeks to provide an accurate and complete picture of effective interventions for homeless youth by collecting, summarizing, categorizing, and evaluating quantitative studies (i. e., those that have assessed treatment outcomes). EVIDENCE ACQUISTION: The following databases were searched in 2008 : PsycINFO, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were searched from 1985 through 2008 using specific key words: interventions and programs, with homeless <b>youth</b> (<b>s),</b> homeless adolescents, street <b>youth</b> (<b>s),</b> runaways and throwaways. In addition, references of key articles were searched by hand. Eleven studies met pre-established inclusion criteria. To determine study quality, a set of operational parameters was formulated to rate each study as either good, fair, or poor. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: There is no compelling evidence that specific interventions are effective for homeless youth, owing to moderate study quality and the small number of intervention studies. Conclusions that can be drawn from the studies are limited by the heterogeneity of interventions, participants, methods, and outcome measures. Many interventions focused on reduction of substance abuse, whereas other important outcomes, such as quality of life, have received little attention. No study received a quality rating of good, and four studies were rated as fair. Most convincing, but still marginal, were results of interventions based on cognitive-behavioral approaches, which revealed some positive results on psychological measures. CONCLUSIONS: More methodologically sound {{research is needed to determine}} what specific interventions are beneficial for subgroups of homeless youth. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Chapters {{one and two}} offer a {{theoretical}} and historical survey of masculinities in early modern Spain, covering the following topics: Reasons for studying masculinities. Theoretical explanations {{for the construction of}} gender difference. Historical developments of masculinities. Tension between beliefs in gender as social construct and as natural essence in the early modern period. Construction of masculinity against <b>femininity,</b> <b>youth</b> and homosexuality, with examples of how official and unofficial rules and discourse punished deviance. Gender and sexuality {{in the context of the}} Golden Age popular theatre. Chapter three begins the study of Calderón's work, with theories of the male gaze applied to Darlo todo y no dar nada, looking at how the text manipulates identification with the male characters on stage and presents a female heroine who resists the male gaze that attempts to establish her as a sexual object. Chapter four examines relations between the individual male and the group, using concepts of the nation and the imperial gaze. In Amar después de la muerte, the text is seen to subvert traditional ways in which the Spanish male had looked at the Morisco male and female. Chapter five investigates the association between religion and gender, in particular the connections between female sexuality and the Garden of Eden. El mágico prodigioso is seen to reverse conventional expectations. Chapter six studies violence to women, particularly rape, and how male collusion in such violence is dramatised in No hay cosa como callar. Chapter seven explores the representation of masculine insecurity in El médico de su honra using object relations theories. The play is seen as an extreme example of the violence and objectification of women discussed in earlier chapters. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The purpose of this article is to examine the research conducted on the cardiovascular endurance and body composition levels of U. <b>S.</b> <b>youth.</b> Research studies noting the activity patterns of youth outside and during physical education are presented. The frequency and duration of physical education requirements are also reviewed. The effects of these patterns and requirements on cardiovascular endurance and body composition are presented. Results. U. <b>S.</b> <b>youth</b> do not engage in physical activity, within or outside physical education, sufficient to develop cardiovascular endurance. Our youth are, therefore, at risk of developing a myriad of diseases associated with sedentary lifestyles. Conclusions.

The study is divided into two major parts: the first part is an analysis of focus group discussions conducted among 33 youth participants ranging between 15 - 24 years of age; the second part analyses television advertisements of two corporate brands (Tide Detergent Products and Globe Telecoms) which focus on Filipino youths in their advertisements.
