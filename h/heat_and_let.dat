Generally, the hot cereal {{is made with}} a 4:1 water to cereal ratio, which can be adjusted to personal consistency preferences (for example, using 3:1 to later add milk to taste). To make 4 servings combine 4 cups of water, 1 cup of Red River Cereal and 1/4 t. salt (optional). Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.

The corn is usually boiled with it. It {{is also used}} for cooking nopales and other vegetables as it retains their bright green color, to soften dried beans, and as a meat tenderizer, similar to sodium bicarbonate. It {{can be used as}} a leavening agent. To prepare, boil a solid tequestuite stone and the shells of ten tomatillos in a cup of water. Once the stone has been dissolved and the water has boiled remove from <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> stand. When it is cold it is strained and added to the masa. Another recipe indicates the same procedure, but using 15 grams of tequesquite, 15 tomatillo shells and 1/4 L water.

40|$|Hospitals {{have high}} energy consumptions, more than offices, {{dwellings}} and schools {{and they have}} been strongly increasing for twenty years. Improvement of their energy efficiency seems to be desirable to save resources and to reduce pollution, above all because of their public exemplarity.

Many experiences of buildings that exploit natural sources for ventilation, cooling, <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> lighting <b>let</b> bioclimatic strategies to be applicable to sanitary structures, particularly suitable because of their continuing activity, that need constant energy supply.
