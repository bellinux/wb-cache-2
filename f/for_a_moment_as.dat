25|$|The {{transport}} finally {{heads out}} of the darkness and onto the bridge which spans the pit. The transport stalls <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> another oncoming jeep can be seen across the pit, but it turns {{out of the}} way before reaching the bridge. The transport then accelerates across the bridge which sways and jostles under its weight. The massive stone effigy shoots beams from its eye at the bridge, attempting to destroy it. The transport safely makes it across and makes a right turn.|$|E
25|$|Another time Saint Anthony was {{travelling}} in the desert, {{he found}} a plate of silver coins in his path. He pondered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> to why a plate of silver coins would {{be out in the}} desert where no one else travels, and realised the Devil must have laid it out there to tempt him. Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the Devil had laid there to deceive him, but he ignored them and continued on his way.|$|E
25|$|Peter is {{reunited with}} his sisters, who {{immediately}} notice Edmund's absence. They find him clinging to the last threads of life with a wounded Ginarrbrik preparing to slay him. Susan shoots and kills Ginarrbrik as he raises his axe for the kill, saving Edmund. Lucy attempts to use her cordial to cure Edmund, but seems to fail <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> Edmund seemingly dies the moment she pours a drop into his mouth. However, he revives a moment later cured of his injuries. Lucy rushes to heal the wounded soldiers while Aslan revives those who were petrified.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, all is dark. The transport's {{headlights}} flicker back on, illuminating walls swarming {{with thousands}} of beetles. Hissing sounds are heard, and riders are blasted with puffs of air. The transport heads {{out of the darkness}} and onto the bridge which spans the pit. The transport stalls <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> another oncoming transport can be seen about to cross the bridge, which turns away just before reaching it. The transport then accelerates across the bridge which sways and jostles under its weight. The massive stone face of Mara shoots beams from its eye, attempting to destroy the bridge. The transport makes it safely across then turns sharply to the right.|$|E
25|$|The next match saw El Hijo del Perro Aguayo {{challenge}} El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. The champion {{was accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by Cibernético, while the challenger was accompanied by his stablemates Héctor Garza and Taya Valkyrie. Towards {{the end of the}} bloody brawl, Aguayo went for the illegal Martinete, which would lead to an automatic disqualification, but was stopped by Garza, leading to an argument between the two stablemates. Garza then attempted to hit El Mesías with a steel chair, but accidentally hit Aguayo instead. As Aguayo began bleeding heavily, the match was stopped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> a doctor entered the ring to check on the cut on his head; Aguayo, however, kept avoiding the doctor, not wanting the match to be ended. El Mesías then speared his challenger through a table for the win and to retain the AAA Mega Championship. Afterwards, Cibernético immediately climbed to the ring and jumped on top of the bloody Aguayo, mocking him, while El Mesías received his title belt. Cibernético then went out of the ring and pushed Hall of Famer Perro Aguayo, who was seated in the front row, before being pulled away by an irate El Mesías as Los Perros del Mal members Halloween, Psicosis and Teddy Hart came ringside to check on the condition of the challenger. Garza attempted to do the same, but was pulled away from Aguayo by Halloween, Psicosis and Hart, who blamed him for the loss. Eventually Los Perros del Mal helped their leader backstage, with Garza following behind.|$|E
500|$|During the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Jealous" [...] live {{during a}} medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. She performed the song {{dressed in a}} bodysuit and was backed by a clip. In {{a review of the}} performance, Nadeska Alexis felt that the singer managed to emphasize [...] "the weight of... lyrics" [...] while performing the song. Writing for Fuse, Hilary Hughes concluded that the rendition of the song was [...] "enough to halt all conversation, silence all phones and pause the internet <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>as</b> she got real right off the bat".|$|E

500|$|A {{hotel manager}} called Moon {{in his room}} {{and asked him to}} lower the volume on his {{cassette}} recorder because it made [...] "too much noise." [...] In response the drummer asked him up to his room, excused himself to go to the bathroom, put a lit stick of dynamite in the toilet and shut the bathroom door. Upon returning, he asked the manager to stay <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>as</b> he wanted to explain something. Following the explosion, Moon turned the recorder back on and said, [...] "That, dear boy, was noise. This is the 'Oo." ...|$|E
500|$|Fortunately for the Macdonald government, {{economic}} conditions improved during the 1930s. In March 1937, Macdonald announced that after 14years of running operating deficits, the Nova Scotia government had recorded a surplus with another forecast {{for the next}} year. The pro-Liberal Halifax Chronicle gleefully described {{the scene in the}} legislature: [...] "the House sat <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>as</b> if not comprehending the good news, then rocked with acclaim, at least the Government side of the House did, though the opposition, stilled and stunned-like, sat like figures carved in stone". Macdonald promised the government would spend another $7.5million on its popular road paving program overseen by A. S. MacMillan, the veteran Minister of Highways. MacMillan, also Chairman of the Nova Scotia Power Commission, had been extending electrical service into rural areas. He now introduced a rural electrification bill designed to subsidize the cost of providing electricity.|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the VIN from an axle {{of the truck}} used in the explosion and {{the remnants of the}} license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [...] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen (formerly of the band Junior Senior), and {{produced}} with Paul Blair (a.k.a. DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay, while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York. The electropop song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line [...] "It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M" [...] on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass. As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, [...] "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way", which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being [...] "meant {{to be heard in}} a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting." [...] After the chorus she chants the line [...] "Don't be a drag, Just be a queen" [...] a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse. After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song [...] "There But For the Grace of God Go I" [...] by Machine. The music fades out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> Gaga sings a cappella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Born This Way" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga's voice spans the tonal nodes of F3 to C5. [...] "Born This Way" [...] follows a chord progression of F5–F–E–B–F in the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|Tag {{opens with}} a {{sequence}} of shots of a modern metropolis, bustling with cars and pedestrian traffic. An unidentified person approaches {{a man on the}} street and places their hand on his shoulder, then flees before their target can turn around. The man looks exasperated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>as</b> he realises that he has just been tagged as [...] "It" [...] in a city-wide game of Tag. People begin to scatter in all directions away from him. He runs down the street to a bus, which promptly shuts its door on him and pulls away. People lock themselves into their cars as he approaches, while others duck into nearby buildings; one hides himself in the opposite side of a revolving door to avoid being tagged. Crowds empty off the streets, while others huddle in lines behind the partial cover given by wastebins, scattering when they are spotted.|$|E
