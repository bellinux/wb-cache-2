5|$|A {{few months}} later, Singaperumal is {{transferred}} and a corrupt officer (Vinu Chakravarthy) takes his place. The current DGP releases Teja and together, they urge <b>Gemini</b> {{to work for}} them and repay for the losses they incurred but <b>Gemini</b> refuses. To force him to return to his old ways, Teja persuades Isaac to conspire against <b>Gemini.</b> With Isaac's help, Teja plots and kills Kai. <b>Gemini</b> is infuriated and confronts Teja to settle the issue. During the fight, <b>Gemini</b> beats up Teja and swaps their clothes, leaving Teja bound and gagged. The new DGP arrives and shoots <b>Gemini</b> dead; he later realises that he had actually shot Teja who was in Gemini's clothes. While the DGP grieves over Teja's death, he receives news that he has been transferred to the Sewage Control Board.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gemini</b> meets {{and falls}} in love with Manisha (Kiran Rathod), a free-spirited college girl. To pursue her, he joins an evening class at her college and she {{falls in love}} with him, unaware of his true identity. Two {{businessmen}} approach <b>Gemini</b> to evict traders from a market so that a shopping complex can be built in its place. As the market is in his control, <b>Gemini</b> refuses the offer and the businessmen hire Teja to execute the job. Feigning an altercation with <b>Gemini,</b> his sidekick Kai (Thennavan) joins Teja's gang, acts as the inside man and foils the plan. Teja becomes enraged at being outsmarted by <b>Gemini.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since <b>Gemini</b> {{was arrested}} at the college, Manisha discovers his {{identity}} and resents him. To regain her attention, <b>Gemini</b> reforms his ways. Though his gang initially disapprove of it, they relent. As <b>Gemini</b> and his gang regret their actions, Annamma reveals her true identity and forgives them. Singaperumal helps <b>Gemini</b> {{to get back into}} college and reunite with Manisha. Teja returns to his gang and continues his illegal activities. He pesters <b>Gemini</b> to help him in his business. <b>Gemini</b> informs Singaperumal of Teja's activities; Teja is caught smuggling narcotics, is prosecuted and serves a term in prison.|$|E
50|$|His cognomen, <b>Geminus</b> brings {{attention}} to his (presumed) twin brother Titus Veturius <b>Geminus</b> Cicurinus who was consul in 494 BC.|$|R
50|$|<b>Geminus</b> {{was the son}} of Gaius Servilius <b>Geminus,</b> a Roman magistrate. He was {{a member}} of gens Servilia, a patrician family.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the crash}} {{did not affect}} space flight {{operations}} and the spacecraft itself was undamaged—it was shipped to NASA {{two days after the}} crash—the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the <b>Gemini</b> 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent <b>Gemini</b> and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for <b>Gemini</b> 9, re-designated <b>Gemini</b> 9A. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for <b>Gemini</b> 10, became the back-up crew for <b>Gemini</b> 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for <b>Gemini</b> 12. Without experience during the <b>Gemini</b> mission, Buzz Aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{applications}} were considered for the <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigated}} sending a <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, {{the second stage of}} a Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would have been used to launch the upper stage, whilst the <b>Gemini</b> would launch on the Titan II, as it had in the <b>Gemini</b> program.|$|E

50|$|The son of Publius Servilius <b>Geminus,</b> Gnaeus <b>Geminus</b> {{was elected}} as consul in early 217 BC. By March of that year, <b>Geminus</b> began {{directing}} military operations against the Carthaginian General Hannibal Barca around Ariminum. Following {{the death of}} the consul Gaius Flaminius Nepos at the Battle of Lake Trasimene (Trasimeno) in April (as well as the rise to power of dictator Fabius Maximus the following month), <b>Geminus</b> assumed command of the Roman fleet overseeing coastal defense and battles against Sardinia, Corsica and the North African coast.|$|R
5|$|Advanced <b>Gemini</b> is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the <b>Gemini</b> program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. <b>Gemini</b> was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|Cernan {{was also}} a backup Pilot for the <b>Gemini</b> 12 mission.|$|E
5|$|He {{traveled}} {{into space}} three times: as Pilot of <b>Gemini</b> 9A in June 1966, as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 10 in May 1969, and as Commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, the final Apollo lunar landing. Cernan {{was also a}} backup crew member for the <b>Gemini</b> 12, Apollo 7 and Apollo 14 space missions.|$|E
50|$|Gaius Servilius <b>Geminus</b> (Caius Servilius <b>Geminus)</b> was a Roman statesman {{who served}} as Consul in 203 BC, Dictator in 202 BC, and Pontifex Maximus from 183 BC to 180 BC.|$|R
50|$|Candalides <b>geminus,</b> the <b>Geminus</b> blue, is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} of the Lycaenidae family. It was described by Edwards and Kerr in 1978. It is found in Australia (the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales).|$|R
50|$|<b>Geminus</b> {{was elected}} consul, {{alongside}} Gnaeus Servilius Caepio, in 203 BC, and obtained Etruria as a province. From there {{he went to}} Cisalpine Gaul where his father {{of the same name}} was held as a prisoner of war since 218 BC. In 202 BC <b>Geminus</b> was named Dictator by Marcus Servilius Pulex <b>Geminus</b> to hold elections. He was the last person to hold that position until Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 82 or 81 BC. In 201 BC he served as one of Decemviri responsible for the distribution of land among veterans who fought with Scipio the Elder. In 183 BC <b>Geminus</b> was elected Pontifex Maximus, replacing Publius Licinius Crassus Dives.|$|R
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project <b>Gemini</b> mission, <b>Gemini</b> 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the <b>Gemini,</b> made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the <b>Gemini</b> 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for <b>Gemini</b> 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for <b>Gemini</b> 12. Without the <b>Gemini</b> experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Lunney worked backup on <b>Gemini</b> 3, {{taking charge}} of the newly {{established}} Mission Control Center in Houston, {{at a time when}} flights were still controlled from Cape Canaveral in Florida. On <b>Gemini</b> 4, he again was working backup, this time in Florida, supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston. After spending some time on unmanned testing for the Apollo program, he returned to work as a flight director on <b>Gemini</b> 9, 10, 11 and 12.|$|E
50|$|Two {{years after}} the 1543 publication, Thomas <b>Geminus</b> (the {{pseudonym}} of Thomas Lambrit) printed another abridgment: the Compendiosi totius Anatomiae delineatio. An English translation of this work would appear in 1553 and 1559. <b>Geminus</b> took many of the illustrations from the Fabrica, but unlike the original, printed them on separate sheets. This {{is caused by the}} fact that <b>Geminus</b> decided to use copper intaglio plates rather than woodcuts as in the original. <b>Geminus</b> was an engraver and may have done the illustrations. Because of this, the relation between text and images is less clear and many images are gathered on a single sheet without any relation.|$|R
50|$|Marcus Servilius Pulex <b>Geminus</b> was a Roman statesman {{who served}} as Consul in 202 BC. In 167 BC, during the dispute whether to grant a triumph to Lucius Aemilius Paullus, <b>Geminus</b> {{addressed}} the people in favor of Paullus.|$|R

5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the <b>Gemini</b> B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the <b>Gemini</b> 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. <b>Gemini</b> B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
5|$|Several {{missions}} were {{proposed to}} demonstrate methods of landing the <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft on land. The spacecraft {{had originally been}} designed to land using a paraglider {{and a set of}} skis or wheels, however this was abandoned in favor of splashdowns under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing. As the proposed Big <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft would have landed this way, McDonnell Aircraft asked NASA to consider flying standard <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft with the paraglider in order to test the system before it would be required operationally.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo {{astronaut}}s {{were chosen}} from the Project Mercury and <b>Gemini</b> veterans, plus from two later astronaut groups. All missions were commanded by <b>Gemini</b> or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) {{through the first}} two landings on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12, included at least two (sometimes three) <b>Gemini</b> veterans. Dr. Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training {{of all of the}} Apollo landing crews.|$|E
50|$|Cicurinus {{seems to}} have been the name of two {{different}} family branches within the Veturia gens. They were respectively named Crassus Cicurinus and <b>Geminus</b> Cicurinus. Titus Veturius was probably the twin brother of Gaius Veturius <b>Geminus</b> Cicurinus who was consul in 499 BC.|$|R
50|$|In 1860 Gustav Flor {{described}} a bug {{he found in}} Estonia and named it Capsus <b>geminus.</b> When Fieber established the genus Tytthus in 1864, he named two species to the genus, Zetterstedt's Capus pygmaeus and Flor's Capus <b>geminus.</b> Capus <b>geminus</b> thus became Tytthus <b>geminus,</b> by which name it was known as {{for well over a}} hundred years. In 1906 Kirkaldy named then Tytthus <b>geminus</b> as the type species for the genus. But, as Henry and Wheeler discovered in 1988, the name Capsus <b>geminus</b> was not available in 1860, because Thomas Say had already used it 1832 for another species entirely. So, after researching the various previous nomenclaturial acts regarding the bug, they discovered that the next available name was one used by Harry H. Knight in 1931 to describe the same bug {{as if it were a}} new species, but placing it in the genus Cyrtorhinus Fieber, 1858 as Reuter had made Tytthus a junior synonym of Cyrtorhinus. Knight's name, Cyrtorhinus pubescens was the oldest junior synonym. In 1992, Wheeler and Henry published a treatise reviewing the Miridae family occurring in the Holarctic, and formally corrected the nomenclaturial error in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, with the result that the type species was henceforth called Tytthus pubescens (Knight, 1931).|$|R

5|$|The <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft, {{which was}} built by McDonnell Aircraft, {{was derived from the}} earlier Mercury spacecraft, but {{modified}} to accommodate two astronauts. It was also equipped with a larger equipment module, allowing it to support longer missions, and maneuver in orbit. It was launched by the Titan II rocket flying from Launch Complex 19 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. In total, twelve missions were launched, ten of which were manned. Following two unmanned test flights, the first manned flight, <b>Gemini</b> 3, was launched on 23 March 1965. The program concluded on 15 November 1966, with the successful recovery of <b>Gemini</b> 12.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{intended}} to use the <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System and later the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL). These stations would have been launched by Titan IIIM rockets, with a <b>Gemini</b> spacecraft atop, {{eliminating the need for}} rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications were made to the <b>Gemini</b> capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the heat shield to allow access to the space station.|$|E
5|$|The last {{assignment}} for Armstrong in the <b>Gemini</b> program was as the back-up Command Pilot for <b>Gemini</b> 11, announced {{two days after}} the landing of <b>Gemini</b> 8. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and was more in a teaching role for the rookie backup Pilot, William Anders. The launch was on September 12, 1966, with Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as CAPCOM.|$|E
50|$|Fufius <b>Geminus</b> {{was either}} the son or nephew of the Fufius <b>Geminus</b> who was {{governor}} of Pannonia in 35 BC. He was appointed consul suffectus in 2 BC (around September), replacing the Princeps Augustus. He was the co-author of the Lex Fufia Caninia, which restricted the manumission of slaves.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Cneius Servilius <b>Geminus</b> and Caius Flaminius {{had been elected}} consuls. Flaminius succeeded Sempronius {{in command of the}} Roman army at Arretium, while <b>Geminus</b> took the command of that at Rimini. Between these consuls, as was usually the case in Rome, a bitter jealousy existed. <b>Geminus</b> was the nominee of the aristocratic party, while Flaminius was the idol of the populace, and, as has often been the case in war, this rivalry between two generals possessing equal authority wrought great evil to the armies they commanded.|$|R
