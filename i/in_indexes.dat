60|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{deliberate}} and systematic imitation of Macaulay's style, often by clever men who might well have trusted to their own resources. Its most conspicuous vices are very easy to imitate, but it is impossible for any one who is less familiar with literature than Macaulay was, to reproduce his style effectively, for the reason that it is before all else the style of great literary knowledge. Nor is that all. Macaulay's knowledge was not only very wide; it was both thoroughly accurate and instantly ready. For this stream of apt illustrations he was indebted to his extraordinary memory, and his rapid eye for contrasts and analogies. They come to the end of his pen as he writes; they are not laboriously hunted out <b>in</b> <b>indexes,</b> and then added by way of afterthought and extraneous interpolation. Hence quotations and references that in a writer even of equal knowledge, but with his wits less promptly about him, would seem mechanical and awkward, find their place in a page of Macaulay as if by a delightful process of complete assimilation and spontaneous fusion.|$|E

This status ensures that these municipalities more money from the state to promote regional tourism and beyond that the city acquired the right to add the title [...] "Estancia Hidromineral" [...] to its name, term by which is designated by both the municipal expedient as the official state references. Poá's economy is mainly service-focused, since the installation of polluting industries has been banned since 1970, the year it became a spa town. Territory wise, {{is one of}} the smallest municipalities in the state of São Paulo (only bigger than Aguas de São Pedro and São Caetano do Sul). Verticalization in the city center is discouraged in order to preserve the small-town atmosphere of the city, with narrow streets and the preservation of several old buildings.The council is not the richest in the region, but still outperforms its neighbors in several social indicators, thus signaling that the economic growth of Poá is more equal and sustainable than in other cities, and that its population has better quality of life due to public facilities (schools, parks and health units). <b>In</b> <b>indexes</b> like the Human Development Index (HDI), the child development index (RDI) and the index of development of basic education (IDEB), Poá surpasses all municipalities. In 2007 it was considered one of the safest cities of São Paulo, specifically the 5th, behind only São Caetano do Sul, Barueri, Caieiras and Mogi das Cruzes.|$|E
40|$|Implications {{of market}} {{frictions}} {{in the context}} of serial correlations <b>in</b> <b>indexes</b> on the Central and Eastern European (CEE) stock markets have been analysed. Market frictions, such as non-trading effects, bid/ask spreads, other transaction costs, etc., may be detected by direct measurement, or by indirect identification. Direct measurement of frictions is difficult as intraday trading data are unavailable in the case of most of the emerging CEE stock markets. Indirect identification may be conducted by detecting some empirical phenomena. One of them is evidence of serial correlations <b>in</b> <b>indexes,</b> the so-called the Fisher effect. We explore the problem of serial correlations <b>in</b> <b>indexes</b> on the eight CEE stock markets using data samples from each CEE market separately, as well as a "common trading window" approach, which is widely applied in the case of databases with multivariate time series. The evidence is that nonsynchronous trading effect II between markets may substantially disrupt the analysis of index returns on a domestic market. Using a synchronized database, one may erroneously conclude that the Fisher effect does not exist, although it is present. (original abstract...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Passive {{investment}} strategies (i. e., indexing) {{have grown}} substantially {{over the past}} twenty years to over $ 3 trillion in assets, but there is little empirical evidence on the effect of indexers on a firm’s information environment. Owing to the passivity of their investment strategy, indexers likely differ from active institutional investors in their demand for financial information, which could have implications for the supply of financial information in the market. I find that increases <b>in</b> <b>indexed</b> ownership are associated with a reduction in {{the quantity and quality of}} financial information provided by two key suppliers of financial information – analysts and managers. Specifically, I find that increases <b>in</b> <b>indexed</b> ownership are associated with increases in analyst following, but analysts are less accurate in their forecasts. In addition, I find that increases <b>in</b> <b>indexed</b> ownership are associated with management issuing fewer forecasts. These findings stand in contrast to the documented positive association between institutional ownership and the information environment. Overall, my results indicate that, all else equal, increases <b>in</b> <b>indexed</b> ownership are associated with deteriorations in a firm’s information environment, which is a particularly relevant finding given the significant growth <b>in</b> <b>indexing</b> <b>in</b> recent years...|$|R
