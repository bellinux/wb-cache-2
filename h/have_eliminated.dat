5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various projects have been proposed but increasing material and labor costs <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> some. The tallest tower approved for construction in the city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it would have become the tallest building in New Orleans at a height of , but construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for construction in the city. In addition, while not new constructions, many of the older buildings in the central business district are undergoing renovations to condominium, apartment and hotel towers; these projects include the National American Bank Building.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E

5|$|Polio {{vaccines}} are vaccines used {{to prevent}} poliomyelitis (polio). There are two types: one that uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection (IPV), and one that uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio. The two vaccines <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> polio {{from most of the}} world, and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 37 in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The virgin forests cooled {{the land}} and streams, and centuries of {{accumulated}} organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the creeks and runs so that they flowed more evenly year-round. Pine Creek and its tributaries were home to large numbers of fish, including trout, but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> the shad and eels once found here by blocking their migrations. Habitat for land animals was destroyed by the clearcutting of forests, {{but there was also}} a great deal of hunting, with bounties paid for large predators.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as {{representative}} from San Augustine, Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic's president. Margaret disliked campaign events and, giving up her privacy, frequently staying home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes. Yet, when she rose to the occasion, such as the extended post-election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in Washington County and Houston City, the public adored her, and she became an impressive political asset. She rode in a local presidential parade, but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in Austin. When the couple appeared at several events in Nacogdoches, his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol, and he continued to assure {{her that he was}} giving it up completely. He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife, and would eventually claim to <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> his profanity altogether.|$|E

5|$|The horses, {{especially}} young foals and juveniles, provide a major food {{source in the}} southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena, along with gemsbok and springbok. However, the availability of other food {{appears to have a}} significant influence on predation rates among the horses. Leopards and black-backed jackals also predate young horses, although this is more rare. The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse, as they cause dehydration, malnutrition, exhaustion and lameness. Other large plains animals, including the mountain zebra, may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall, but human interference (including fencing off portions of land and hunting) <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area. The endangered Hartmann's mountain zebra does exist in the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park, but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse.|$|E
5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{attained}} {{their greatest}} diversity during the Miocene, such as with baleen whales with over 20 recognized genera {{in comparison to}} only six extant genera. Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a super-predator such as megalodon. However, {{by the end of}} the Miocene, many species of mysticetes had gone extinct; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey. Furthermore, after the closure of the Central American Seaway, tropical whales decreased in diversity and abundance. The extinction of megalodon correlates with the decline of many small mysticete lineages, and it is possible that it was quite dependent on them as a food source. Additionally, a marine megafauna extinction during the Pliocene was discovered to <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> 36% of all large marine species including 55% of marine mammals, 35% of seabirds, 9% of sharks, and 43% of sea turtles, likely aiding in its extinction; megalodon may have been too large to sustain itself on the declining tropical food supply. The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of megalodon to the polar regions, depriving it of its food source of large whales which had migrated there.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could <b>have</b> <b>eliminated</b> the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E
