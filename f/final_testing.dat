5|$|In February 1996, Molyneux {{decided to}} focus on the project full-time. According to Carter, the creatures were made from bitmaps, and there was around 90 {{megabytes}} of graphics data on screen as of April 1996. In July 1996, Alex Peters joined the project and ported the game to Windows 95. Dungeon Keeper was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1996, and was scheduled for release in December. It became evident that the deadline would be missed, and release was pushed back to March 1997. The <b>final</b> <b>testing</b> began in April 1997, and Dungeon Keeper was signed off in June. Dungeon Keeper was released by Electronic Arts in June 1997 for Windows 95 and MS-DOS. Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions were in development and due for release in 1997, but cancelled. An internet version was in development, and would have supported up to 250 players.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{the museum}} pushed back the {{expected}} completion date by 18 months, {{due in part to}} issues with the boiler restoration. By January 2009, with further problems encountered including misaligned frames and a cracked right hand cylinder, as well as due to rising metal prices, the museum launched the SOS (Save Our Scotsman) appeal, seeking to raise a further £250,000, hoping to complete the work by 2010. In May 2011, the locomotive was unveiled on the museum's turntable, finished in wartime black LNER livery; following <b>final</b> <b>testing</b> it was planned to finish it in LNER apple green and have it running excursions by the summer. In June 2011, cracks were discovered in the horn blocks, which led to further testing which discovered numerous latent cracks throughout the frame assembly, leading to the replacement of the main stretcher bar, horn ties and middle cylinder motion bracket, all of which were deemed beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|During <b>final</b> <b>testing,</b> {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{learning}} {{studies have}} shown that if the period of time devoted to studying information (e. g., casa-house) includes at least 1 test (casa-?), performance on a <b>final</b> <b>test</b> is improved—a finding known as the testing effect. In most of these studies, however, the <b>final</b> <b>test</b> is identical to the initial <b>test.</b> If the <b>final</b> <b>test</b> requires a novel demonstration of learning (i. e., transfer), prior studies suggest that a greater degree of transfer reduces the size of the testing effect. The authors tested this conjecture. In 2 experiments, 4 th- or 5 th-grade students learned to assign regions or cities to map locations and returned 1 day later for 2 kinds of <b>final</b> <b>tests.</b> One <b>final</b> <b>test</b> required exactly the same task seen during the learning session, and the other <b>final</b> <b>test</b> consisted of novel, more challenging questions. In both experiments, testing effects were found for both kinds of <b>final</b> <b>tests,</b> and the testing effect was no smaller, and actually slightly larger, for the <b>final</b> <b>test</b> requiring transfer...|$|R

40|$|Retrieval {{practice}} enhances long-term retention {{more than}} restudying; a phenomenon called the testing effect. The fuzzy trace explanation predicts that a testing effect will already emerge {{after a short}} interval when participants are solely provided with semantic cues in the <b>final</b> <b>test.</b> In the present study, we assessed this explanation by gradually reducing the surface features overlap between cues in the learning phase and the <b>final</b> recognition <b>test.</b> In all five experiments, participants in the control/word condition received as <b>final</b> <b>test</b> cues the same words as in the learning phase. The experimental <b>final</b> <b>test</b> cues consisted of scrambled words, words in a new context, scrambled words in a new context (Experiment 1), synonyms (Experiment 2), or images (Experiments 3, 4 a, 4 b). A short-term testing effect was only observed for the image <b>final</b> <b>test</b> cues. These results do not provide {{strong support for the}} fuzzy trace explanation of the testing effect...|$|R

25|$|At first, {{bird strike}} testing by {{manufacturers}} involved firing a bird carcass from a gas cannon and sabot system into the tested unit. The carcass was soon replaced with suitable density blocks, often gelatin, to ease testing. Current testing is mainly conducted with computer simulation, although <b>final</b> <b>testing</b> usually involves some physical experiments (see birdstrike simulator).|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of March 1940, Queen Elizabeth was ready for her secret voyage. The Cunard colours were painted over with battleship grey, and {{on the morning of}} 3 March, the QE quietly left her moorings in the Clyde and proceeded out of the river to sailed further down the coast, where she was met by the King's Messenger, who presented sealed orders directly to the captain. While waiting for the Messenger, the ship was refuelled; adjustments to the ship's compass and some <b>final</b> <b>testing</b> of equipment were also carried out before she sailed to her secret destination.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} Fischer and Born, 2009, {{previous}} knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be significant predictors of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks {{that would have to}} be replicated at a later time. The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and <b>final</b> <b>testing</b> for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.|$|E
25|$|Considered to be {{a mental}} {{workspace}} enabling temporary storage and retrieval of information, working memory {{is crucial to}} problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity {{is a measure of}} the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as chunking. Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and <b>final</b> <b>testing.</b> The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5–6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved fluid intelligence.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out the relationship between prior learning and performance of <b>final</b> <b>test</b> on dental material science. A sample of 70 respondents was randomly selected from students in the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia, Jakarta. The data were taken through objective (for entry learning) and essay tests. The relation among prior learning and <b>final</b> <b>test</b> on dental material science was analysed by partial correlation and multiple regression techniques. The resulting findings are as follows: there was a positive correlation between student’s prior learning and performance of <b>final</b> <b>test</b> (r = 0. 533). This study also revealed that the mean score of students’ ability on prior learning and <b>final</b> <b>test</b> were higher than their theoretical mean score.

60|$|First, {{the great}} {{justification}} {{of this game}} is that it truly, when well played, determines who is the best man;--who is the highest bred, the most self-denying, the most fearless, the coolest of nerve, the swiftest of eye and hand. You cannot test these qualities wholly, {{unless there is a}} clear possibility of the struggle's ending in death. It is only in the fronting of that condition that the full trial of the man, soul and body, comes out. You may go to your game of wickets, or of hurdles, or of cards, and any knavery that is in you may stay unchallenged all the while. But if the play may be ended at any moment by a lance-thrust, a man will probably make up his accounts a little before he enters it. Whatever is rotten and evil in him will weaken his hand more in holding a sword hilt, than in balancing a billiard cue; and on the whole, the habit of living lightly hearted, in daily presence of death, always has had, and must have, a tendency both to the making and testing of honest men. But for the <b>final</b> <b>testing,</b> observe, you must make the issue of battle strictly dependent on fineness of frame, and firmness of hand. You must not make it the question, which of the combatants has the longest gun, or which has got behind the biggest tree, or which has the wind in his face, or which has gunpowder made by the best chemist, or iron smelted with the best coal, or the angriest mob at his back. Decide your battle, whether of nations, or individuals, on those terms;--and you have only multiplied confusion, and added slaughter to iniquity. But decide your battle by pure trial which has the strongest arm, and steadiest heart,--and you have gone far to decide a great many matters besides, and to decide them rightly.|$|E
