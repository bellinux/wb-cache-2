50|$|In {{the context}} of {{defamation}} law, an <b>innuendo</b> <b>meaning</b> is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|The song's {{first and}} second verses feature Chef listing the {{ingredients}} for his [...] "chocolate salty balls", an <b>innuendo</b> <b>meaning</b> testicles. However, {{there is no mention}} of salt in the recipe. He also urges people to [...] "suck on them" [...] during the chorus. After listing the ingredients, he sings the lines, [...] "Say, everybody, have you seen my balls/they're big and salty and brown/if you ever need a quick pick-me-up/just stick my balls in your mouth", starting the chorus.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{the matter}} complained must contain a {{defamatory}} meaning. This {{is capable of}} entailing more than one meaning and can include; an article, advertisement or report communicated via an electronic or hard-written document, a gesture or oral utterance. The matter in question may bear a direct or <b>innuendo</b> <b>meaning.</b> The latter ought to be satisfied by virtue of an objective test. Simply put, what a witness perceived to be true is irrelevant. Instead, liability only extends to defamatory imputations which a reasonable person might draw. Liability will not extend where a defamatory imputation was drawn unreasonably.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers have {{compared}} [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] {{to the work}} of The Beatles. Allen Metz, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, described the composition of the song as [...] "pastel-pretty, [...] richly orchestrated". He felt that the song would have fit better on The Beatles' 1969 soundtrack album, Yellow Submarine. The Beatles influence was also noted by Stephen Holden from The New York Times, who labeled [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] a [...] "stylish swatch of late Beatles-style psychedelia". Joey Levy from Spin characterized [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "amazing", describing his reaction to the song as [...] "Wow! This is neat!" [...] He added that the song sounded like Prince singing for The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Kevin Phinney from the Austin American-Statesman compared the song to the solo work that Beatles' member John Lennon did later in his career. Phinney wondered how Madonna was able to come up with the song, since most of the tracks from Like a Prayer are full of <b>innuendo</b> and double <b>meanings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|His {{appearances}} on several early episodes of COPS conducting drug stings led to him hosting World's Wildest Police Videos. Bunnell attained a cult following {{due to his}} over-the-top commentary style. Bunnell hosted the show, which originally ran from 1998 to 2001 and again since 2012, describing situations featured on the program as they developed and offering personal opinions about the criminals and the police that pursued them using cliches', <b>innuendos</b> and double <b>meanings</b> such as [...] "This man decided to rob a bank. Now he'll learn crime doesn't pay". Bunnell's hosting of World's Wildest Police Videos led to him hosting a similar show, Train Wrecks, {{as well as many}} other police related specials, such as World's Scariest Police Stings and World's Craziest Police Chases. He also appeared on America's Most Wanted. Bunnell lends his voice to the Sony PlayStation game World's Scariest Police Chases, warning, [...] "Due to the graphic nature of this game, player discretion is advised," [...] similar to the warning {{at the beginning of the}} counterpart television program. He has also had minor acting roles in Ghost World and Bad Santa, both directed by Terry Zwigoff. In [...] "Quagmire's Baby" [...] and [...] "Something, Something, Something, Dark Side", both 2009 episodes of Family Guy, Bunnell provided the voice of himself during gags that referenced World's Wildest Police Videos. In 2010, Bunnell appeared on commercials for the Adult Swim Block Party.|$|R
5000|$|... "Do It" [...] {{was also}} written by Gomez, Armato, James, and Jost; {{production}} was handled by Rock Mafia, Dubkiller, and Thomas Armato Sturges. The song is much lighter than [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants", being an upbeat song {{that has been}} described as [...] "sexy" [...] by critics. [...] "Do It" [...] features sexual <b>innuendos</b> and hidden <b>meanings,</b> and sees Gomez singing about her desire to [...] "do it every single day". The song leaked online days prior to the release of the album, and garnered media attention for its themes. Gomez compared the song to releases from Lily Allen, and described [...] "Do It" [...] as a [...] "cute little catchy song and I thought it'd be a great little bonus track for the album." [...] "My Dilemma 2.0" [...] is a previously unreleased remix to a song taken from Selena Gomez & the Scene's album When the Sun Goes Down (2011). The Rock Mafia produced remix was set to be released as the fourth and final single from the album, featuring a guest rap from Flo Rida; the single's release was cancelled for unknown reasons, and the release of the remix was scrapped. The version featured on For You has omitted the rap verse, and is credited solely to Selena Gomez & the Scene. [...] "Forget Forever", taken from Stars Dance (2013), is also featured in remixed form. The fifth and final new release is [...] "MÃ¡s", the Spanish language version of a song taken from the Selena Gomez & the Scene album Kiss & Tell (2009). The song was reportedly recorded for Gomez's first Spanish spoken album, which went unreleased.|$|R
5000|$|The {{judge said}} that there were two {{different}} kinds of meaning recognised in law: [...] "a natural and ordinary meaning" [...] and [...] "an innuendo meaning." [...] Citing Jones v Skelton, Mr Justice Tugendhat explained that a natural and ordinary meaning may be either the literal meaning or a meaning [...] "that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge." [...] An <b>innuendo</b> <b>meaning,</b> he said, [...] "is a meaning which can be implied from the words complained of, but only if the reader also knows other facts (which are not general knowledge). These are generally called extrinsic facts." [...] The judge decided that any reasonable reader would understand both meanings of Bercow's tweet and interpret the [...] "innocent face" [...] as insincere and ironical: [...] "There is no sensible reason for including those words in the tweet {{if they are to be}} taken as meaning that the defendant simply wants to know the answer to a factual question." [...] The judge decided that the Tweet meant [...] "in its natural and ordinary defamatory meaning, that the Claimant was a paedophile who was guilty of sexually abusing boys living in care." [...] With regard to the innuendo of the tweet Mr Justice Tugendhat found that the Tweet carried a meaning [...] "to the same effect" [...] and found that the tweet was [...] "an allegation of guilt. I see no room on these facts for any less serious meaning." [...] As it had already been accepted by Bercow prior to the hearing that McAlpine was innocent of the allegations her tweet was [...] "seriously defamatory" [...] and indefensible in law.|$|E
