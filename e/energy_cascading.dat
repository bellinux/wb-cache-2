The relationship between information technology and the environment is complex, because of the negative environmental impact of IT production, use, and disposal then, making this effect greener has been termed Green Information Technology, which considers IT's environmental impact primarily as a problem to be mitigated.

40|$|The central {{problem of}} fully {{developed}} turbulence is the <b>energy</b> <b>cascading</b> process. It has revisited all attempts at a full physical understanding or mathematical formulation. The {{main reason for}} this failure {{are related to the}} large hierarchy of scales involved, the highly nonlinear character inherent in the Navier-Stokes equations, and the spatial intermittency of the dynamically active regions. Richardson has described the interplay between large and small scales and the phenomena so described are known as the Richardson cascade. This local interplay also forms the basis of a theory by Kolmogorov. In this letter, we use the explicit map method to analyze the nonlinear dynamical behavior for cascade in isotropic turbulence. This deductive scale analysis is shown to provide the first visual evidence of the celebrated Richardson cascade, and reveals in particular its multiscale character.

A {{deeper understanding of the}} linear and nonlinear evolution and the coupling of the gradient-drift and Farley-Buneman instabilities is achieved by studying the effect of different combinations of the density-gradient scale-lengths (Ln) and cross-field (E?B) drifts on the plasma turbulence. Mechanisms and channels of energy transfer are illucidated for these multiscale instabilities. Energy for the unified model is examined, including the injected, conservative redistribution (between fields and scales), and ultimate dissipation. Various physical mechanisms involved in the energetics are categorized as sources, sinks, nonlinear transfer, and coupling to show that the system satisfies the fundamental law of energy Oonservation. The physics of the nonlinear transfer terms is studied to identify their roles in producing energy cascades { the transference of energy from the dominant unstable wavenumbers and driving irregularities of different scale-lengths.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{turbulent}} mixing. Various flow problems arising {{in science and technology}} are intimately connected to properties of turbulent transport. Improvements and control of mixing efficiency rely directly on the understanding of turbulence phenomena. From the mathematical point of view, turbulence is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The convective nonlinearity in these equations induces an interaction between a wide range of scales in a flow. In additions, the dissipation term acts mainly on the smallest flow scales, characterized by the fluid viscosity. In the absence of external forces theses two terms fully dictate the dynamics of decaying turbulence. In numerical studies of turbulence dynamics one usually incorporates an external forcing to supply energy to the largest flow scales.
