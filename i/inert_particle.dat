The velocity of the <b>inert</b> <b>particle</b> increases {{in proportion to the}} local time of collisions and decreases according to a constant downward gravitational acceleration. We study fluctuations and strong laws of the motion of the particles.

40|$|A {{reversible}} {{electron transfer}} is studied at a microdisk electrode which is partially blocked by an <b>inert</b> <b>particle</b> at the disk center. The <b>inert</b> <b>particle</b> {{is either a}} cylinder of a sphere. The size of a cylinder located {{at the center of}} the microdisk electrode is determined with the help of a simple electrochemical procedure. Cyclic voltammograms for the reduction of a reversible redox system are recorded as a function of scan rate and compared to simulations. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment was found. Modelling diffusion to a microdisk electrode modified with a sphere or cylinder at its center by numerical simulations gives physical support for the transition in diffusion-layer shape and size, therefore allowing to size not only particles of known shape but also, in principle, to determine their shape and size simultaneously. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|In this paper, {{influence}} of crowding by <b>inert</b> <b>particles</b> on the geminate reaction kinetics is theoretically investigated. Time evolution equations {{for the survival}} probability of a geminate pair are derived from the master equation {{taking into account the}} correlation among all diffusing particles.

When the initial distribution of the <b>inert</b> <b>particles</b> is uniform, the excluded volume interactions slow the decay of the survival probability of a geminate pair in contrast to the acceleration of the decay found for the target problem under the presence of the excluded volume interactions among reactants. We also obtain the escape probability for a non-uniform initial distribution of the <b>inert</b> <b>particles</b> and show that reaction yield is increased when the reaction proceeds {{in the presence of a}} positive density gradient of the <b>inert</b> <b>particles</b> which inhibits the escape of reactants.

In normal subjects, initial emptying of the liver was slower than that of <b>inert</b> <b>particles</b> both for large liver cubes (1 cm) and small cubes (0. 3 cm).

40|$|Identification {{of product}} {{requirements}} and quality, {{together with the}} management of production are key issues in chemical engineering. Quality control of crystalline products {{is part of the}} quality of many industrially manufactured products like paper, paintings, medicines and fertilizers. In most crystallization cases, quality is described with the size, polymorph, shape and purity of the crystal. The chemical composition, hydrodynamics and driving force, together with the operating temperature are in a key position when the properties of a crystalline product are controlled with the crystallization process. This study concentrates on managing the identified properties of a crystalline product with the control of a driving force. The controlling of the driving force can be based on the change of solubility or the change of concentration. Solubility can be changed with temperature, pressure and an antisolvent. The concentration of crystallizing compound, the solute can be changed with the evaporation of the solvent and {{with the addition of a}} reagent. The present study focuses on reagent addition and temperature change as methods of changing the level of the driving force. Three control structures for direct control of supersaturation are built, one for cooling crystallization and two for reactive crystallization. Closed loop feedback control structures are based on the measurement of the solute concentration with attenuated total reflection - Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The details of the reagent feed are analyzed with experimental studies and with results of computational fluid dynamic simulations of the <b>inert</b> <b>particle</b> pulse in the premixer and <b>inert</b> <b>particle</b> injection to the mixing tank. Nucleation in conditions of controlled reactive crystallization is analyzed with Nielsen’s equation of homogeneous nucleation.
