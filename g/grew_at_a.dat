The national gross domestic product (GDP) only <b>grew</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate of 3% due to the storm, compared with 5.1% in 1997, due to damaged infrastructure and lingering effects. In 1999, the economy of Honduras contracted by 1.9%, {{largely due to the}} storm. The Honduran government increased spending by 24.7%,. much of it emergency funds to restore communications and provide relief, which caused economic deficits. This caused inflation to increase from 13.6% to 15.7%. The Honduran government adjusted its economic plan, including privatization of various federal entities. For two years, the government temporarily halted taxes to businesses affected by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade <b>grew</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E

In the early 1970s, the firm leased land on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during gasoline shortages {{in the mid}} to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. Cracker Barrel became a publicly traded company in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. It floated {{more than half a million}} shares, raising $4.6 million. Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel <b>grew</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate of around 20percent per year; by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million.|$|E

5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon <b>grew</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, {{based on a}} neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, {{to make it harder}} for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP <b>grew</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy.|$|E
