40|$|Software {{development}} is a complicated process which is accomplished by the combined effort of the key elements such as people, processes, and technology. Software development firms are on a constant quest to identify the best practices for managing the key elements to improve their software development project outcomes and to deliver successful software projects. This dissertation aims to study key elements that can influence the software development project performance through three distinctive studies. The first essay of this dissertation investigates the impact of people factors on software project outcomes. Specifically, it examines the impact of team characteristics on the software project outcomes of Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level software development projects. Teams and teamwork is {{a critical component of}} software development. Software organizations have long since identified the importance of teams and team building in software development. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of studies on software development team management. Moreover, the role of team characteristics in the software projects that follow the CMM/CMMI practices has been underexplored. The first essay fills the gap by investigating the moderation effects of team characteristics such as team work experience, team turnover (attrition) and team functional heterogeneity on the software development project performance specific to projects that follow the capability maturity process models. The results of the study provide valuable insights into managing the employees such that the software project results in positive outcomes. ^ The second essay of this dissertation investigates the impact of technological factors on effort {{and the quality of the}} software product. Technological factors used in the development process can influence effort estimation process and the quality of the end product. Moreover, the rapid technological advancements in the technologies used, can bring a huge difference in the quality, and the effort estimation of the software product delivered. Through this study, the influence of technical factors on project outcomes is investigated and also the impact of technological advancement in the technologies is analyzed. This study provides insights about the technologies that can improve the project quality and reduce the development effort. ^ The third essay considers software sourcing arrangements such as offshoring, on-shoring, <b>in-housing</b> and outsourcing as strategic organizational innovations and analyzes the co-diffusion effects of software sourcing arrangements between 1) on-shoring and offshoring and 2) <b>in-housing</b> and outsourcing. A review of the existing diffusion, co-diffusion, and software sourcing literature revealed that the co-diffusion studies are lacking to understand, how the adoption of one type of software sourcing adoption can influence the adoption of the other. Through the third essay, this gap is filled by performing co-diffusion analysis to provide insights about the current and future trends in the diffusion process of the software sourcing phenomena. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{consumer}} educators, {{we often}} seek to spur student interest and, ultimately, ignite {{a passion for}} consumer education and advocacy. Issues of current consumer policy frequently provide an excellent platform to achieve these goals. The most compelling issues are usually those {{with the potential to}} affect students ' lives directly. When students get involved in an issue they find to be exciting, alarming, or important, old classroom facts can generate new levels of interest. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline how the current controversy over Bisphenol-A (BPA) can serve as an interesting and compelling example to demonstrate the real world dynamics of consumer advocacy, industry reaction, scientific debate, and policy consequences. Scientific Origins Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an artificial estrogen. When bonded together in a chain of molecules it forms part of an extraordinarily useful plastiC called polycarbonate. BPA contain ing plastics are used as packaging for thousands of consumer products such as microwave dinners, water bottles, hard plastic baby hottles, interior coating for canned food, and <b>in-housing</b> construction products like water pipes and water storage tanks. Early scientific notice of BPA leaching from plastic containers was reported in a 1993 article in the journal of Endocrinology (Krishnan, Stathis, Permuth, Tokes, & Feldman, 1993). These Stanford University scientists were not studying BPA or plastics at all. Rather, they were conducting an experiment to determine whether a particular organism (sacchoromyces cerevisiae) produced estrogens. However, the organism was grown in a culture using distilled water that had been autoc 1 aved in plasti...|$|E
40|$|Teacher {{workplace}} learning (TWPL) is {{an essential}} strategy for increasing opportunities for professional development towards maintaining teacher competencies for high quality teaching. Workplace learning {{is a relatively new}} concept in most developing countries. In Uganda (my country of origin) there are a few private schools where TWPL is a common practice. In most schools, however, teachers rely on distance education and, occasional, formal in-service training usually organized by district officials of government, that take the form of single- loop workshops or short courses external to the schools. In Pakistan (the context for this study) teachers engage more in site-based learning because few institutions offer formal pre-service and in-service teacher education. Individual schools, especially of the private sector, set up structures to offer <b>in-housing</b> training. My experience of learning to teach in compartmentalized structures, marked with cultures of individualism, pointed to a need to understand the conditions that facilitate and inhibit teacher workplace learning at the earliest opportunity. Today, it is essential to change schools into learning communities, where teachers are learners. This study sought to examine the personal and contextual conditions that facilitate and inhibit TWPL, in order to inform the process of introducing learning communities in Uganda. Three cases were studied and are presented here, along with a cross-case analysis. Studying the cases involved three interviews each, observation of their TWPL activities, two interviews with the principal, review of both teacher-made and school documents, and keeping of reflective memos. The major finding was that both personal and contextual conditions are essential in harnessing TWPL. The exemplary and proactive leadership, and ongoing internal and external support, were major contextual conditions in buttressing TWPL. It was also clear that the ‘unique person’ in the teacher has the potential to cross the contextual hurdles and maintain and influence the working cultures, so vital in TWPL. The study has some implications for different stakeholders, given in chapter five. It is hoped that the cases presented here may offer models for the teachers to learn from. Conversely, the cases may also point to issues and undesirable practices to guard against...|$|E

40|$|IT {{outsourcing}} {{transition is}} {{the implementation of}} the new way of operating and it is part of any IT outsourcing relationship. It may follow initial outsourcing of in-house IT, switching outsourcing providers, or <b>in-housing</b> outsourced IT back from the provider. Transition sets the tone for the outsourcing relationship and researchers have suggested that failed transitions are the root cause of unsuccessful outsourcing relationships in majority of the cases. Furthermore, if the transition is planned and executed unsuccessfully, it may even endanger the business continuity of the client. Despite of the significance of the transition in the outsourcing relationship it has received limited academic attention. No research has especially focused on how the different outsourcing settings and the decisions made in the pre-delivery phase of IT outsourcing lifecycle contribute {{to the success of the}} transition. During the pre-delivery phase of the transition with the new IT outsourcing provider, important foundations for the whole outsourcing relationship are laid which often cannot be changed later. This thesis aims to provide a fresh viewpoint to the switching of IT outsourcing providers discussing how different outsourcing settings and external factors affect transition planning and how these decisions affect transition success when client is switching outsourcing providers. Further, this thesis aims to clarify what is high speed switching of outsourcing providers and when this type of transition should be used. To clarify the planning process when the client is switching outsourcing providers, the literature covers information technology outsourcing, different forms of IT outsourcing settings and how they affect the success of the transition. Further, the IT outsourcing lifecycle, project management and IT outsourcing transition management are discussed. To elaborate on the IT outsourcing lifecycle and moreover, the transition planning process, a traditional view of the IT outsourcing lifecycle model is developed from earlier studies. This model is then compared to a suggestive high speed transition model supported by the findings of a single case study. The results of the study indicate that the complexity of the outsourcing setting is not directly related to the success of the transition and that the use of high speed transition model for switching outsourcing providers is beneficial under certain conditions. To succeed with the high speed transition model, it is vital that there is high level of trust between the involved parties, the outsourced activities are not related to the core business of the client and there is no extensive transformation needed between the two settings. Thus, the cost of delaying the start of the transition without a final plan, agreement on the success measures and the service contract is considered as a higher the risk than starting the work without having them finalized. This view links transition management to agile practices and adds to the traditional view of switching IT outsourcing providers where the success measures and the service contract result from thorough planning in the pre-delivery phase that includes lengthy negotiations and extensive due diligence and the transition execution only starts after the contract is well defined and signed...|$|E
