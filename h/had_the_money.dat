5|$|In 1974 most of River Oaks was {{assigned}} to River Oaks Elementary School. Prior to desegregation, it had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. In 1986 the neighborhood component of the school closed. At the time River Oaks had mainly older families. At the time the remaining families who did have children <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> {{to send their children}} to private school and preferred to do so.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E

25|$|When Zarinsky {{was indicted}} in 2000 for the murder, Bette Bernoskie, {{the widow of}} Officer Charles Bernoskie, filed a wrongful-death suit against Zarinsky in civil court. In August 2003, a jury found Zarinsky {{responsible}} for the death and awarded Bette Bernoskie $9,500,000 plus interest. In 2004, $154,000 was seized from Zarinsky's assets, and Bette Bernoskie divided this award among her legal representatives and her six children. In July 2007, a New Jersey Appellate Court reversed the decision and ordered the money returned to Zarinsky, citing his inability to put on a proper defense. Bette Bernoskie no longer <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and the New Jersey Patrolmen's Benevolent Association then organized efforts to repay it. It was their intention that neither Bette Bernoskie nor her children would ever give back the award money.|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1949, the District of Columbia {{began making}} housing {{inspections}} in Marshall Heights, looking for code violations. Inspectors found that 9 out of 10 homes failed {{at least one}} health, housing, or building safety regulation, and they concluded that 8 out of every 10 homes in the neighborhood should be razed or renovated down to the framing studs. In May 1950, city inspectors estimated that 150 of the neighborhood's 500 homes were so unsafe {{that they should be}} razed. Yet, by the end of 1952, the city had condemned just 65 homes. A second inspection wave began in 1957. But by year's end, only 39 homes had been condemned and razed. A total of 348 homes had been cited for housing and building violations by the end of 1958, but city inspectors revealed that just 78 had been repaired and brought up to code. When questioned by the media as to why more homes had not been condemned, the city said condemnations would simply make extremely poor residents homeless, driving them into other slums and worsening the overcrowding there. The inspection program was to have ended in 1959, but the city kept it going because so few Marshall Heights residents <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to make repairs or improvements to their homes. (Of the 348 homes found to be in violation, 81 homes had seen no repair.) With condemnation not an option, the city decided to keep inspecting homes and putting pressure on residents. By 1960, this third wave of inspections found that 302 of 347 inspected homes were in violation of either housing or building codes. Another six homes were condemned after 1957, bringing the total to just 45, so in 1961 city officials sought to condemn another 25 homes. By now, inspections had cited a total of 661 housing units (apartments and homes), even though the housing stock was relatively new (the average age of a home in Marshall Heights that year was 17 years). Inspections were so frequent, and residents so fearful of them, that some homeowners were refusing to admit city inspectors.|$|E

[...] For a further £3,200 (current value £), he acquired Douglas Mawson’s expedition ship Aurora, which was lying in Hobart, Tasmania. This would act as the Ross Sea party's vessel.|$|E

[...] The family was so immersed {{in the middle of the}} crossfire that they often dodged bullets by getting on the floor in their apartment. [...] Zoltán was just passing through toddlerhood at the time of the revolution so he does not remember much of the details, but the family stuffed windows with pillows during the conflict. Prior to the overthrow, the family dealt with the realities of communism, such as having to wait seven years to buy a car even though they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1910, Horace Avory {{became a}} judge. Hastings first found {{out when he}} read the report in the morning newspapers, and was dismayed that he would again have {{to search for a}} tenancy at another {{chambers}}. He instead had the idea that he could take over Avory's chambers himself, allowing him to avoid the trouble of finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Despite Avory's reputation as [...] "cold and hard" [...] he agreed to this idea, and even let Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory's valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland.|$|E
500|$|Fragile Allegiance was {{generally}} well received, achieving average to good scores from reviewers. It was praised for its graphics and icon driven interface which was considered slick and well integrated {{but a little}} confusing at first. Reviewers noted that after figuring out what all the icons did the game was immensely engrossing, with the player always having something to do. The game was criticised for its difficulty, its simplistic combat model, the time spent transporting ore between asteroids, and {{the large amount of}} micromanagement involved when the player's empire got large — although reviewers noted that the latter two could be countered by the [...] "Ore Teleporter blueprint" [...] and Colony Supervisors respectively. There were mixed feelings regarding the replacing of research with the Sci-Tek blueprint system, which meant that any blueprint could be bought in any order provided the player <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to do so.|$|E

[...] Maple Leafs' owner Conn Smythe unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Jackson to save his money for the future, even offering to match his player's savings dollar for dollar. Jackson's habits, particularly his drinking, ultimately {{played a role in}} his trade away from Toronto. Jackson's lifestyle came crashing down following his retirement as a player as he no longer <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to fund his pursuits. He unsuccessfully tried to overcome his alcoholism, lost two marriages to divorce, struggled to hold a job, and it was said that he could be found outside Maple Leaf Gardens trying to sell broken sticks of Maple Leaf players to try to make some money. He emerged as one of hockey's tragic figures.|$|E

When the Dennistouns divorced, Mr. Dennistoun could not pay {{ancillary}} relief. He instead promised that he would provide for his ex-wife in the future when he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Some time after the divorce, Mr. Dennistoun married Almina, Countess of Carnarvon, the widow of Lord Carnarvon, a rich woman thanks {{to the terms of}} her husband's will, who provided for her new husband. After hearing about this, Dorothy Dennistoun demanded the alimony money she had been promised. Lady Carnarvon saw this as blackmail and persuaded her new husband to take his wife to court for what Sir Henry McCardie, who tried the case, called [...] "the most bitterly conducted litigation I have ever known". Marshall-Hall and Birkett both worked on the case representing Lady Carnarvon and Mr. Dennistoun, while Ellis Hume-Williams, {{one of the most respected}} divorce barristers of the day, represented Mrs. Dennistoun.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama admires Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy and was {{impressed}} by Walt Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians, which he remembers for its high-quality animation. Jackie Chan's early movies also had a noticeable influence on his stories, particularly Chan's martial arts comedy film Drunken Master. Toriyama stated he was influenced by animator Toyoo Ashida and the anime television series adaptation of his own Dragon Ball; from which he learned that separating colors instead of blending them makes the art cleaner and coloring illustrations easier. It was Toriyama's sound effects in Mysterious Rain Jack that {{caught the eye of}} Kazuhiko Torishima, who explained that usually they are written in katakana, but Toriyama used the Roman alphabet which he found refreshing. In his opinion, Torishima stated that Toriyama excels in black and white, utilizing black areas, as a result of not having <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to buy screentone when he started drawing manga. Torishima also describes Toriyama as a master of convinience and [...] "sloppy, but in a good way". Within Dragon Ball, destroying specific objects in the environment or the appearance of the Super Saiyan were made in order to have less work in inking and drawing. He draws what he finds interesting and is not mindful of what his readership thinks.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1974, {{with sales}} of D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36 years old. But in January 1975, Kaye {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a heart}} attack. He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna. Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company. Gygax characterized her as [...] "less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner." [...] After Kaye's death, TSR was forced to relocate from Kaye's dining room to Gygax's basement. In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares {{at any time in the}} future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D was still owned by the 3-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies. In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares. These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.|$|E
