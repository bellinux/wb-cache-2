5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green facial mask {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and speaks in a hissing tone.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's {{mutation}} also {{consists of}} animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced, and sharp fang-like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants {{created by the}} Weapon X program, the claws are later revealed to be {{a natural part of}} his body. The claws are not made of keratin, as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> through which the claws move when he extrudes them, and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.|$|E
25|$|That year, Gardner {{moved to}} Borneo, gaining {{employment}} as a rubber planter at the Mawo Estate at Membuket. However, {{he did not}} get on well with the plantation's manager, a racist named R. J. Graham who had wanted to deforest the entire local area. Instead Gardner became friendly with many of the locals, including the Dyak and Dusun people. An amateur anthropologist, Gardner was fascinated by the indigenous way of life, particularly the local forms of weaponry such as the sumpitan. He was intrigued by the tattoos of the Dayaks and pictures of him in later life show large snake or dragon tattoos on <b>his</b> <b>forearms,</b> presumably obtained at this time. Taking a great interest in indigenous religious beliefs, Gardner told his first biographer that he had attended Dusun séances or healing rituals. He was unhappy with the working conditions and the racist attitudes of his colleagues, and when he developed malaria he felt that this was the last straw; he left Borneo and moved to Singapore, in what was then known as the Straits Settlements, part of British Malaya.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the buildup}} to Summerslam 1993 - Tunney ruled that Lex Luger couldn't use <b>his</b> <b>forearm</b> in <b>his</b> match against Yokozuna unless {{he wore a}} {{protective}} pad. The point of contention was a steel plate inside Luger's arm, which opponents claimed was a weapon used to increase the force of <b>his</b> <b>forearm</b> smash finisher; Tunney said the plate was part of Luger's body. At the event, Luger won by countout when he used <b>his</b> <b>forearm</b> to knock Yokozuna out of the ring, and Yokozuna couldn't answer the 10 count. As a result, Yokozuna retained the WWF Heavyweight Title.|$|R

500|$|Reptile's {{appearance}} in [...] used {{an amalgam of}} his three previous designs, intended by character designer Mark Lappin to portray a classic yet fresh feel for the character. The design incorporated the appearance of his body from Mortal Kombat 4, his clothing from the original Mortal Kombat, and the look of his feet, hands, and armor from Deadly Alliance. In addition, black strips of cloth wrapped around <b>his</b> <b>forearms,</b> hands, and head, leaving his eyes and mouth exposed. The design was later reused as his primary outfit in , with his appearance from Deadly Alliance serving as his secondary outfit.|$|E
500|$|Rufus is {{depicted}} as a large, heavily obese blond male. His head is mostly bald, with a long braided ponytail jutting from the top, and a mustache extending {{down the sides of}} his mouth to his chin. His clothing consists of a yellow and black sleeveless jumpsuit with padded shoulders, with the closing straps left open due to his girth and exposing the center of his torso and lower abdominal hair. Black shoes cover his feet, while black fingerless gloves cover his hands and most of <b>his</b> <b>forearms.</b> His secondary outfit is similar, changing the jumpsuit to a dark blue and green version with sleeves and a raised collar, additionally removing the gloves and changing his hairstyle to a double ponytail. Other alternate designs were considered but rejected, amongst which included an Elvis impersonator appearance and martial artist attire. Rufus stands [...] tall, and weighs [...]|$|E

500|$|In a {{controversial}} storyline, Peter becomes convinced that Ben Reilly, the Scarlet Spider (a clone of Peter created by his college professor Miles Warren) {{is the real}} Peter Parker, and that he, Peter, is the clone. Peter gives up the Spider-Man identity to Reilly for a time, until Reilly is killed by the returning Green Goblin and revealed to be the clone after all. In stories published in 2005 and 2006 (such as [...] ""), he develops additional spider-like abilities including biological web-shooters, toxic stingers that extend from <b>his</b> <b>forearms,</b> the ability to stick individuals to his back, enhanced Spider-sense and night vision, and increased strength and speed. Peter later becomes {{a member of the}} New Avengers, and reveals his civilian identity to the world, increasing his already numerous problems. His marriage to Mary Jane and public unmasking are later erased in another controversial storyline [...] "", in a Faustian bargain with the demon Mephisto that results in several other adjustments to the timeline, including the resurrection of Harry Osborn and the return of Spider-Man's traditional tools and powers.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the gold}} {{shipment}} {{arrives in the}} village, accompanied by two skilled warriors, the Geminis. The Lions soon confront the Geminis and their men, and in the ensuing fight, Poison Dagger assassinates the Geminis and the Lions capture the gold. Jack later arrives to investigate the incident and learns that the Geminis were poisoned with mercury-tipped weapons, leading him to the blacksmith. The Lions' theft prompts the governor to send his Jackal troops to recover the shipment or destroy the village. Zen-Yi asks the blacksmith to craft him a new suit of weaponized armor. The Lions suspect that the blacksmith is helping Zen-Yi and have him tortured for information. The blacksmith refuses to talk, and Brass cuts off [...] <b>his</b> <b>forearms.</b> Jack, who had been following the blacksmith, saves him from bleeding to death. While the blacksmith recovers, he tells Jack of his past as an emancipated American slave who accidentally killed a white man who refused to let him go. He fled America by boat and went to China, where monks trained him to use his body's energy to perform superhuman feats. Jack {{with the aid of}} the blacksmith crafts his greatest weapon: a pair of iron forearms that he can animate using this energy.|$|E
2500|$|Indecision {{is known}} for their song [...] "Hallowed be Thy Name". The song {{features}} the lyric [...] "For those I love, I will sacrifice" [...] that fans across the world have turned into a tattoo. Photographer Laura Rauch took {{a photograph of the}} tattoo on the ribs of a 19-year-old US Army Infantryman named Kyle Hockenberry who was being treated in a medevac helicopter following an explosion that cost him both of his legs and one arm. The photo was taken for a military newspaper and went on to win an award from the Society of Professional Journalists. [...] The lyric subsequently gained popularity with members of the armed forces.

2500|$|While in {{use of the}} suit, Shinjiro {{utilizes}} {{a similar}} fighting stance to the original hero and wields a pair of [...] underneath his arms. These blades can be modified when Shinjiro utilizes the original Ultraman's , performed by having <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> form a cross stance, with his left arm in a horizontal position and placed forward while his right arm is in a vertical position and placed backward. In contrast to the original, Shinjiro's variant had the beam released from his left Spacium Blade instead of the right arm.

2500|$|Since Mortal Kombat 3, Sub-Zero {{has had a}} scar {{running down}} from his {{forehead}} and across his right eye as a mark of death. The scar was originally red, and later changed to blue in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance {{as a result of}} Sub-Zero's enhanced powers. In Mortal Kombat: Deception, his scar has faded {{to the point where it}} can no longer be seen. [...] He now wore an armored uniform heavily inspired by Dynastic era Chinese battle armor, though it was often criticized by fans as being too reminiscent of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles villain, the Shredder. [...] However, Sub-Zero's alternate uniform was very reminiscent of Chinese culture, even featuring Sub-Zero without a cowl and a Qing Dynasty-era hairstyle. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, Sub-Zero reverts to his masked costume from Deadly Alliance, retaining the scar, which is not part of his alternate costume (which is the primary one from Deception). Since Deadly Alliance, Sub-Zero is the only character who has shown considerable signs of aging. Concept art from Deadly Alliance depicted him with a graying, receding hairline, and a more pale and gaunt face, while his scar was now blue and <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> frozen over. Although Sub-Zero originally had blue eyes, they turned white after he obtained the Dragon Medallion in the game. Sub-Zero's appearance in Shaolin Monks was one of the most revised ones from the title. Character lead Mark Lappin did almost ten passes on his design; producer Shaun Himmerick noted that [...] "we went through literally 5-6 heads and styles of head costume on him" [...] and commented that Sub-Zero's design in Mortal Kombat was difficult to make although most people called it [...] "simple". In the end, the staff was satisfied with his final look in the game as it reminisces them to his classic outfit.|$|E
2500|$|Cornholio is an {{alter ego}} of Beavis. Though the Cornholio {{character}} {{was developed in}} the episode [...] "The Great Cornholio", Beavis first plays the entity as a passing gag in [...] "Generation in Crisis". Beavis sometimes undergoes a radical personality change, usually after consuming large amounts of sugar and/or caffeine. In [...] "Holy Cornholio", the transformation occurs after Beavis takes many pain pills. He pulls his shirt collar over his head, raises <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> in a 90-degree angle next to his chest, and then begins to yell or scream erratically, producing a stream of gibberish and strange noises, his eyes wide. Cornholio is a normally dormant persona (apparently the name is derived from the word [...] "cornhole"). Cornholio tends to wander aimlessly while reciting [...] "I am the Great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!" [...] in an odd faux-Spanish accent. Sometimes Beavis will momentarily talk normally before resuming the persona of Cornholio. When he stops acting as the Cornholio persona, Beavis usually has no memory of what happened. In the guise of Cornholio, Beavis becomes a successful beat poet. In [...] "Vaya Con Cornholio" [...] he is deported to Mexico after wrongfully being subjected to immigration detention by an agent of the INS. During his detention the agent and his superior attempt {{to make sense of the}} gibberish, going so far as to look up the definition of [...] "bunghole". In that same episode, he claims to be from Lake Titicaca (because of the scatological sound of its name), but when asked where it is, he responds (incorrectly) with [...] "Nicaragua". Nicaragua may be one of the few things Beavis remembers from class lectures. Beavis' teacher Mr. Van Driessen refers to Nicaragua during a lecture on world economic systems in [...] "The Great Cornholio", after which Beavis repeats the word while pacing back and forth in the classroom. Cornholio resurfaces in Bungholio, Lord of the Harvest, which he steals candy from everyone and Butt-Head tails him. He had stood up to Todd Ianuzzi, who demanded he move out of the road. He prepared to beat Beavis up in his Cornholio form with his friends. He later spares Beavis deeming him too insane, in favor of beating up the saner Butt-Head.|$|E

60|$|Slowly and {{cautiously}} he drew himself upward, {{hand over}} hand. Nearer and nearer the roof he came. In a moment his eyes would be above {{the level of}} the floor above.

60|$|Presently {{two points}} of light would begin to shine, then to scintillate, out among the lily pads, and Chigwooltz would come {{stealing}} in, his eyes growing bigger and brighter with wonder.

In the dining-room she had been demure and discreet. Now all pretense of grief had passed away from her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion. He sat forward, his hands clasped and <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> on his knees, with an answering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an instant--but it was just one instant too late--they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view. A hurried word or two passed between them, and then Barker rose and came towards me.|$|E

6000|$|JOHNSON--Yes, sir. [He goes. The door {{is closed}} again. MAT BURKE stumbles {{in around the}} port side of the cabin. He moves slowly, feeling his way uncertainly, keeping hold of the port bulwark {{with his right hand}} to steady himself. He is {{stripped}} to the waist, has on nothing but a pair of dirty dungaree pants. He is a powerful, broad-chested six-footer, his face handsome in a hard, rough, bold, defiant way. He is about thirty, in the full power of his heavy-muscled, immense strength. His dark eyes are bloodshot and wild from sleeplessness. The muscles of his arms and shoulders are lumped in knots and bunches, the veins of <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> stand out like blue cords. He finds his way to the coil of hawser and sits down on it facing the cabin, his back bowed, head in his hands, in an attitude of spent weariness.] ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was not a}} tall man, {{not more}} than five feet seven inches, and it was often {{said that if he}} had had an extra inch of reach {{he would have been a}} match for Jackson or Belcher at their best. His chest was like a barrel, and <b>his</b> <b>forearms</b> were the most {{powerful}} that I have ever seen, with deep groves between the smooth-swelling muscles like a piece of water-worn rock. In spite of his strength, however, he was of a slow, orderly, and kindly disposition, so that there was no man more beloved over the whole country side. His heavy, placid, clean-shaven face could set very sternly, as I have seen upon occasion; but for me and every child in the village there was ever a smile upon his lips and a greeting in his eyes. There was not a beggar upon the country side who did not know that his heart was as soft as his muscles were hard.|$|E
60|$|He {{watched the}} {{youthful}} apparition of himself, day after day, hurrying {{from school to}} the Enquirer alley. He could not walk very fast. He was stiff and lame from the incessant fighting. <b>His</b> <b>forearms</b> were black and blue from wrist to elbow, what of the countless blows he had warded off, and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester. His head and arms and shoulders ached, {{the small of his}} back ached,--he ached all over, and his brain was heavy and dazed. He did not play at school. Nor did he study. Even to sit still all day at his desk, as he did, was a torment. It seemed centuries since he had begun the round of daily fights, and time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite future of daily fights. Why couldn't Cheese-Face be licked? he often thought; that would put him, Martin, out of his misery. It never entered his head to cease fighting, to allow Cheese-Face to whip him.|$|E
