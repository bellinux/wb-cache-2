25|$|Twinning is a {{phenomenon}} somewhere between a crystallographic defect and a <b>grain</b> <b>boundary.</b> Like a <b>grain</b> <b>boundary,</b> a twin boundary has different crystal orientations on its two sides.

25|$|Treating a <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> geometrically as an {{interface}} of {{a single}} crystal cut into two parts, {{one of which is}} rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a <b>grain</b> <b>boundary.</b> The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).|$|E
25|$|First, {{although}} single crystals of YBCO have a {{very high}} critical current density, polycrystals {{have a very}} low critical current density: only a small current can be passed while maintaining superconductivity. This problem is due to crystal grain boundaries in the material. When the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> angle is greater than about 5°, the supercurrent cannot cross the boundary. The <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> problem can be controlled to some extent by preparing thin films via CVD or by texturing the material to align the grain boundaries.|$|E

25|$|The size {{distribution}} of ice crystals changes with depth and approaches the Normal Grain Growth law via competing mechanisms of fragmentation (producing smaller polygonal grains) and <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> diffusion (producing larger, vertically compressed, horizontally expanded grains). Although {{some of the}} peaks for the deeper distributions appear to be slightly greater, the predicted steady state average grain size is 2.9±0.1mm.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{attenuation}} {{results from}} the incoherent scattering of light at internal surfaces and interfaces. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are {{in the form of}} grain boundaries that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that when the size of the scattering center (or <b>grain</b> <b>boundary)</b> is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of transparent ceramic materials.|$|E
25|$|Harper–Dorn creep is a climb-controlled {{dislocation}} mechanism at low {{stresses that}} has been observed in aluminum, lead, and tin systems, in addition to nonmetal systems such as ceramics and ice. It is characterized by two principal phenomena: a linear relationship between the steady-state strain rate and applied stress at a constant temperature, and an independent relationship between the steady-state strain rate and grain size for a provided temperature and applied stress. The latter observation implies that Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by dislocation movement; namely, since creep can occur by vacancy diffusion (Nabarro–Herring creep, Coble creep), <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding, and/or dislocation movement, and since the first two mechanisms are grain-size dependent, Harper–Dorn creep must therefore be dislocation-motion dependent.|$|E
40|$|Turbine disk alloys {{subjected}} to fatigue cycles with dwells at high temperatures and stresses can fail by cracking along <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b> This {{could be due}} to concentrated creep deformation or environmental attack at <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b> It would be important to identify any chemical segregation along <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> to aid understanding of this intergranular failure mode. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the degree of chemical segregation present at the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> of two disk alloys, KM 4 and IN 100.

40|$|After {{more than}} 15 years active research, {{it is now}} clear that in VBCO <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> act as severe weak links, and in order to produce YBCO thin films {{carrying}} high critical currents it is necessary to grow epitaxial films on appropriate substrates. We asked the question whether <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in thallium based superconductors cause the same degradation of properties, by adding to the very limited published data on the properties of <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in Tl-HTS systems. We have measured the properties of a statistically significant number of both 'artificial' <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> on LaAlO 3, LSAT and SrTiO 3 bicrystal substrates and 'natural' <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in films grown on MgO substrates.

2500|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet. A <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> is a single-phase interface, with crystals {{on each side}} of the boundary being identical except in orientation. The term [...] "crystallite boundary" [...] is sometimes, though rarely, used. <b>Grain</b> <b>boundary</b> areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice sites, dislocations, and impurities that have migrated to the lower energy <b>grain</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{material}} dissolves {{slowly in}} mineral acids through <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> attack, and in strong alkalies through {{attack on the}} aluminium nitride grains. The material hydrolyzes slowly in water. Aluminium nitride is resistant to attack from most molten salts, including chlorides and cryolite.|$|E
2500|$|Coble creep is {{a second}} form of {{diffusion}} controlled creep. In Coble creep the atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to elongate the grains along the stress axis. This causes Coble creep to have a stronger grain size dependence than Nabarro–Herring creep, thus, Coble creep will be more important in materials composed of very fine grains. For Coble creep k {{is related to the}} diffusion coefficient of atoms along the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary,</b> Q = Q(grain boundary diffusion), m = 1, and b = 3. Because Q(grain boundary diffusion) < Q(self diffusion), Coble creep occurs at lower temperatures than Nabarro–Herring creep. Coble creep is still temperature dependent, as the temperature increases so does the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> diffusion. However, since the number of nearest neighbors is effectively limited along the interface of the grains, and thermal generation of vacancies along the boundaries is less prevalent, the temperature dependence is not as strong as in Nabarro–Herring creep. It also exhibits the same linear dependence on stress as Nabarro–Herring creep. Generally, the diffusional creep rate should be the sum of Nabarro–Herring creep rate and Coble creep rate. Diffusional creep leads to grain-boundary separation, that is, voids or cracks form between the grains. To heal this, grain-boundary sliding occurs. The diffusional creep rate and the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding rate must be balanced if there are no voids or cracks remain. When grain-boundary sliding couldn't accommodate the incompatibility, [...] grain-boundary voids are generated, which is related to the initiation of creep fracture.|$|E

2500|$|Stainless steel {{can pose}} special {{corrosion}} challenges, since its passivating behavior {{relies on the}} presence of a major alloying component (chromium, at least 11.5%). Because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment, chromium carbides can form in the grain boundaries of stainless alloys. This chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary,</b> making those areas much less resistant to corrosion. This creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby, which leads to [...] "weld decay" [...] (corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones) in highly corrosive environments.

2500|$|Materials {{operating}} in high-performance systems, such as jet engines, often reach extreme temperatures surpassing 1200°C, which causes creep to {{be a serious}} issue. Superalloys based on Co, Ni, and Fe are capable of being engineered to be highly resistant to creep, and have thus arisen as an ideal material in high-temperature environments. As an example, Ni-base alloys modeled after the Ni-Al system, known as γ-γ’ alloys are even resistant to dislocation creep. The γ is the main fcc matrix, while the γ’ is the precipitate-phase of Ni3(Al, Ti), which adds particle strengthening. Solute elements added, e.g., Ta, W, Mo, Fe, Cr, and Co, contribute solid-solution hardening, and are often reacted with carbon to form carbide particles that deposit at grain boundaries, and thus inhibit <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding.|$|E
