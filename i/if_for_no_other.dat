5|$|By 1875, France {{was enjoying}} {{improved}} political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing {{interest in the}} upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide {{it was time to}} seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty Enlightening the World. The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde, the French version of the statue's announced name.|$|E

That is {{the point}} I wish to make. <b>For</b> commercial reasons, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>others,</b> authors ought to think seriously of this matter of goggling their heroes. It is an admitted fact that the reader of a novel likes to put himself in the hero's place--to imagine, while reading, {{that he is the}} hero. What an audience the writer of the first romance to star a spectacled hero will have. All over the country thousands of short-sighted men will polish their glasses and plunge into his pages. It is absurd to go on writing in these days for a normal-sighted public. The growing tenseness of life, with its small print, its newspapers read by artificial light, and its flickering motion pictures, is whittling down the section of the populace which has perfect sight to a mere handful.|$|R
60|$|They knew it well enough, {{though they}} were afraid to {{maintain}} {{the cause of the}} Gobblealls before such an orator as Dan; and nothing worse than these grumblings took place all harvest time, where the whole families were fully employed, the men each taking a portion of the field, while their wives and children aided in the reaping and binding, and earned sums amongst them which would pay the quarter's rent, buy the pig, and provide huge boots <b>for</b> the father, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>others</b> of the family. The farmers provided substantial luncheons and suppers for the toilers in the field; and, when all was over, and the last load carried, amid joyful shouts, there was a great harvest supper at each farm, where songs were sung, dances were danced, and there was often a most unlimited quantity of beer swallowed.|$|R
25|$|Anthony Cordesman, while {{speaking}} of the specific situation in Iraq, makes some points that can be generalized to other nations in turmoil. Cordesman recognizes some value in the groupings in Samuel P.

In the case of Iraq, Cordesman observes that the burden is on the Islamic civilization, not unilaterally the West, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> reason that the civilization to which the problematic nation belongs will have cultural and linguistic context that Western civilization cannot hope to equal.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} urgency for such reform stemmed from the {{intrusion}} of modernism. The cultural stream of interest and invention coming from the Christian Europeans caused many Muslims {{to search for a}} proper and adequate response. Merely to learn the foreign ways risked becoming alienated from one's own people and faith, yet modern science and technology, and perhaps government and social culture also, were becoming an ever-increasing challenge. The desire to reform appeared across the Muslim world, among the Ottomans and among the more remote Iranians and Mughals, as well as the Arabs. <b>If</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> reason than the performance of European armies and fleets, these modern ways were necessary to master. Devout Muslims realized that a proper place must be located in their tradition for this wealth of the new.|$|E

40|$|Shakespeare {{scholarship}} habitually scorns topical readings <b>if</b> perhaps <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> reason, as Leah Marcus {{observed in}} Puzzling Shakespeare, than {{because it is}} also a staple of anti-Stratfordian claims that the Earl of Oxford or some other author wrote Shakespeare's plays. Nevertheless, the late plays are also invariably read as Shakespeare's topical homage to his king and patron, James Stuart. It was taken as given by many critics writing at around the same time, and indeed by Marcus herself, that the division of the kingdoms that confronts King Lear is a commentary on James's own project for union, circa 1606. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to Marcus’ multi-sited strategy, social anthropologists, such as Pederson and Holbraad (2013), {{as well as}} Abélès (2011), have recently offered another strategy, closer to such classical influence. For instance, Pederson and Holbraad (2013 : 2) conceive of comparative ethnography as a more productive approach, allowing for a simple but effective overall finding: “(in) security can be simultaneously enacted within and across multiple temporal logics, whose complex imbrications may be studied ethnographically and compared with other times of security”. In the authors’ view, such an approach is more revealing than the methods normally privileged in IR, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> reason <b>other</b> than that the researcher is not conceptually characterising experiences as insecurities, {{at least not in}} a way that goes beyond what participants express (Pederson and Holbraad 2013 : 8 – 11).|$|R
5000|$|In his {{introduction}} to the 1980 reprinting of Meet the Tiger by Charter Books, Charteris all but disowned the work, stating [...] "I can see so much wrong with it that I am humbly astonished that it got published at all" [...] and dismissing it as an early work by a writer who was less than 21 years of age at the time. In a 1960s edition of Enter the Saint, Charteris {{goes so far as}} to define Enter the Saint as the first Templar book, ignoring Meet the Tiger. Nonetheless Charteris acknowledged that Meet the Tiger was an important work, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> reason <b>other</b> than it launched the long-running series of books that became, effectively, his life's work. Charteris would also refer back to the events of this novel on several later occasions, most notably in the prologue to The Saint in New York.|$|R
500|$|The reissue was {{critically}} well received, although reception {{was mixed}} about the supplemental material. Reviews in AllMusic, Uncut, Q, Rolling Stone, Paste and PopMatters praised the supplemental material, but with reservations. A review written by Scott Plagenhoef for Pitchfork awarded the reissue a perfect score, {{arguing that it}} was worth buying for fans who did not already own the rare material. Plagenhoef said, [...] "That the band {{had nothing to do}} with these is beside the point: this is the final word on these records, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era."

500|$|An {{indefinite}} postponement {{of action}} over Berlin was unacceptable to Khrushchev <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> reason than that East Germany was suffering a continuous [...] "brain drain" [...] as highly educated East Germans fled west through Berlin. While {{the boundary between}} the two German states had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen and United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman J. William Fulbright that East Germany had every right to close its borders, which were not disavowed by the Kennedy Administration, Khrushchev authorized East German leader Walter Ulbricht to begin construction of {{what became known as the}} Berlin Wall, which would surround West Berlin. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states. That treaty would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to German reunification.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> reason than his persistence" [...] {{in the face of}} abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When {{was the last time you}} could say that about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put it all on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked Raynor as the 24th greatest soldier in video games.|$|E
5000|$|The fact some critics, {{especially}} in the West, have considered the Twelfth among the least satisfying musically of Shostakovich's symphonies cannot {{be attributed to a}} creative slump, given that he had recently written the First Cello Concerto and the Eighth String Quartet. Shostakovich had become a Party member in 1960 and may have felt compelled to write a Party line symphony, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> reason <b>other</b> than to protect himself. That the composer would have felt compelled {{to do so in the}} midst of the Khrushchev Thaw could certainly be considered questionable, and the government at this point in his career may have found it more politic to exploit Shostakovich than to harass him. Nevertheless, the fact was that the 1948 Zhdanov decree had been rescinded only in 1958, and there were also still memories of Shostakovich's 1936 denunciation. Nor was the composer totally free to express what he wished, as the political controversy over his Thirteenth Symphony would soon prove. Because of these circumstances, it has been suggested by some critics that the Twelfth represents an unwelcome infiltration of officialdom into Shostakovich's main compositional oeuvre, instead of being limited to patriotic film scores and other commissioned works.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, pray away," [...] {{answered}} Spike, {{his throat}} becoming dry and husky, for, strange to say, the submissive {{quiet of the}} Irish woman, {{so different from the}} struggle he had anticipated with her, rendered him more reluctant to proceed than he had hitherto been in all of that terrible day. As Biddy kneeled {{in the bottom of the}} stern-sheets, Spike looked behind him, for the double purpose of escaping the painful spectacle at his feet, and that of ascertaining how his pursuers came on. The last still gained, though very slowly, and doubts began to come over the captain's mind whether he could escape such enemies at all. He was too deeply committed, however, to recede, and it was most desirable to get rid of poor Biddy, <b>if</b> it were <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> motive than to shut her mouth. Spike even fancied that some idea of what had passed was entertained by those in the cutter. There was evidently a stir in that boat, and two forms that he had no difficulty, now, in recognizing as those of Wallace and Mulford, were standing on the grating in the eyes of the cutter, or forward of the foresail. The former appeared to have a musket in his hand, and the other a glass. The last circumstance admonished him that all that was now done would be done before dangerous witnesses. It was too late to draw back, however, and the captain turned to look for the Irish woman.|$|R
60|$|Hester Prynne's term of {{confinement}} was now at an end. Her prison-door {{was thrown}} open, {{and she came}} forth into the sunshine, which, falling on all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as <b>if</b> meant <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast. Perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from {{the threshold of the}} prison than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described, where she was made the common infamy, at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger. Then, she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the combative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate and insulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet which, therefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years. The very law that condemned her--a giant of stern features but with vigour to support, as well as to annihilate, in his iron arm--had held her up through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy. But now, with this unattended walk from her prison door, began the daily custom; and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneath it. She could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief. Tomorrow would bring its own trial with it; so would the next day, and so would the next: each its own trial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne. The days of the far-off future would toil onward, still with the same burden for her to take up, and bear along with her, but never to fling down; for the accumulating days and added years would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame. Throughout them all, giving up her individuality, she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and embody their images of woman's frailty and sinful passion. Thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet letter flaming on her breast--at her, the child of honourable parents--at her, the mother of a babe that would hereafter be a woman--at her, who had once been innocent--as the figure, the body, the reality of sin. And over her grave, the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument.|$|R
