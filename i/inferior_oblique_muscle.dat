There is a leash of four muscles rising from a spot behind the exit of the optic nerve from the cranium to the upper, under, anterior, and posterior sides of the eyeball. These are the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior recti. Running {{from the front of}} the orbit obliquely to the underside of the eyeball is the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle.</b> Corresponding to it above is a superior oblique. A lachrymal gland lies in the postero-inferior angle of the orbit, and a Handerian gland in the corresponding position in front. In addition to the upper and lower eyelids of the human subject, the rabbit has a third, the nictitating lid, in the anterior corner of the eye.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} number of myogenin-positive {{activated}} satellite cells in the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> and the medial muscles of V-pattern exotropia with <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> overaction, to further explore the possible etiological factors of V-pattern exotropia with <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> overaction. METHODS: The <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> and the medial muscles were cut from V-pattern exotropia patients with <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> overaction during strabismus operation treated as the strabismus group. Cross sections were stained immunohistochemically {{for the presence of}} activated satellite cells, as identified by myogenin immunoreactivity. The <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> and the medial muscles were obtained from the corneal transplant donors(six eyes of six cases), which treated as the control group. RESULTS: The frequency of myogenin-positive satellite cells of the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> was(22. 7 ± 7. 03) % and(4. 2 ± 0. 75) % in the strabismus group and the control group. Significant differences existed in the expression of myogenin in two groups(P P CONCLUSION: It is first report that myogenin-positive satellite cells presents in extraocular muscles of V-pattern exotropia with <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> overaction. The current results suggest that myogenin is one of possible etiological factors of V-pattern exotropia with <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> overaction...|$|R

50|$|The {{suspensory}} ligament of eyeball (or Lockwood's ligament) forms a hammock stretching below the eyeball between the medial and lateral check ligaments and enclosing the inferior rectus and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> of the eye. It is a thickening of Tenon's capsule, the {{dense connective tissue}} capsule surrounding the globe and separating it from orbital fat.|$|R
5000|$|Excyclotorsion {{is a term}} {{applied to}} the outward, {{torsional}} (rotational) movement of the eye, mediated by the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> of the eye. The <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> is innervated by cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve). Excyclotorsion may {{also be used to}} describe the condition or state of the eye when a patient has a cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) palsy. The trochlear nerve supplies the superior oblique muscle, and when this muscle is non-functional (as in trochlear palsy) the eye excyclotorts; i.e. twists/rotates outward. This excyclotorsion may be corrected through surgery using the Harada-Ito procedure.|$|E
50|$|Management of this {{condition}} is surgical and typically involves reducing {{the strength of}} the superior rectus muscle or anterior transposition of the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> of the affected eyes.|$|E
5000|$|... "Overaction" [...] of the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> is a {{commonly}} observed component of childhood strabismus, particularly infantile esotropia and exotropia. Because true hyperinnervation {{is not usually}} present, this phenomenon is better termed [...] "elevation in adduction".|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Lockwood's {{suspensory}} ligament" [...] {{of the eye}} {{is named}} after him. This structure is the thickened area of contact between Tenon's capsule and the sheaths of the inferior rectus and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> This ligament is responsible for maintaining {{the position of the}} eyeball in its normal upward and forward position within the orbit.|$|R
50|$|The {{physiologic}} {{basis of}} the head tilt test was explained by Alfred Bielschowsky and Hofmann in 1935. However, Nagel described it 30 years prior to Bielschowsky when {{he noted that the}} combined action of the superior rectus muscle and the superior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> of one eye and of the inferior rectus and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> in the fellow eye causes incycloduction and excycloduction. The procedure that we now follow was given by Marshall M. Parks.|$|R
50|$|The extraocular muscles {{rotate the}} eyeball around vertical, {{horizontal}} and antero-posterior axes. Extraocular muscles {{other than the}} medial rectus and lateral rectus {{have more than one}} action due to the angle they make with the optical axis of the eye while inserting into the eyeball. The superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> make an angle of 51 degrees with the optical axis.|$|R

50|$|The {{inferior}} oblique {{arises from}} the orbital surface of the maxilla, lateral to the lacrimal groove. Unlike the other extraocular muscles (recti and superior oblique), the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> does not originate from the common tendinous ring (annulus of Zinn).|$|E
50|$|Patients with {{cranial nerve}} IV palsy whose {{complaints}} are not specifically limited to torsional diplopia, but instead also have significant vertical diplopia, {{are not good}} candidates for a Harada-Ito procedure. Instead, a recession of the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle,</b> or another strabismus operation may be indicated.|$|E
50|$|The {{patient is}} asked to follow a target with both eyes as it is moved {{in each of the}} nine {{cardinal}} directions of gaze. The examiner notes the speed, smoothness, range and symmetry of movements and observes for unsteadiness of fixation. These nine fields of gaze test the extraocular muscles: inferior, superior, lateral and medial rectus muscles, as well as the superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hypertropia may {{be either}} {{congenital}} or acquired, and misalignment {{is due to}} imbalance in extraocular muscle function. The superior rectus, <b>inferior</b> rectus, superior <b>oblique,</b> and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> affect the vertical movement of the eyes.

5000|$|Cases of {{congenital}} fourth nerve palsy vary {{in magnitude}} and way {{they affect the}} motion of the superior oblique muscle. Therefore different surgeries are available dependent upon the type of misalignment. Sometimes surgery on more than one eye muscle is required. In some simpler, unilateral cases a single surgery may suffice. In these cases the main problem is that the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> of the same eye acts unopposed by the weakened superior oblique muscle, pulling the eye up. An example of a safe and effective procedure is a disinsertion of the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> to allow it to reattach itself further down the globe of the eye. This acts to 'weaken' its action and allow the eye to move back into a more neutral alignment.|$|E
50|$|The lateral rectus {{originates}} at {{the lateral}} {{part of the}} annulus of Zinn, {{also known as the}} annular tendon or common tendinous ring, and inserts into the temporal side of the eyeball. The annulus of Zinn is a tendinous ring that surrounds the optic nerve and serves as the origin for five of the six extraocular muscles, excluding the <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{inferior}}</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> or obliquus oculi inferior is a thin, narrow muscle placed {{near the}} anterior {{margin of the}} floor of the orbit. The inferior oblique is an extraocular muscle, and is attached to the maxillary bone (origin) and the posterior, inferior, lateral surface of the eye (insertion). The inferior oblique is innervated by the inferior branch of the oculomotor nerve.|$|E
50|$|The fibers of the corticomesencephalic tracts are {{involved}} in the control of the conjugate eye movement. The fibers to the oculomotor (III) nucleus control the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> Fibers to the trochlear (IV) nucleus control the superior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle.</b> Fibers to the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) project to the abducens (VI) nucleus, which controls the movement of the lateral rectus muscle. Also, fibers to the paramedian pontine reticular formation mediates the movements with the oculomotor (III) and trochlear (IV) nerves through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The MLF coordinates the interaction between the oculomotor (III) and the abducens (VI) nuclei, which create bilateral conjugate horizontal eye movements.|$|R
50|$|The extraocular {{muscles are}} {{supplied}} mainly by {{branches of the}} ophthalmic artery. This is done either directly or indirectly, as in the lateral rectus muscle, via the lacrimal artery, a main branch of the ophthalmic artery. Additional branches of the ophthalmic artery include the ciliary arteries, which branch into the anterior ciliary arteries. Each rectus muscle receives blood from two anterior ciliary arteries, except for the lateral rectus muscle, which receives blood from only one. The exact number and arrangement of these cilary arteries may vary. Branches of the infraorbital artery supply the inferior rectus and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|R

In all patients the V-pattern and upshoot in adduction diminished or completely resolved. Excyclotorsion, caused by loss of fusion may be the explanation for the development of V-pattern and upshoot in adduction in cyclic esotropia. Restoration of fusion by surgery on the horizontal muscles may then be enough to eliminate the vertical incommitance...|$|R

50|$|The initial {{clinical}} {{examination of the}} extraoccular eye muscles is done by examining {{the movement of the}} globe of the eye through the six cardinal eye movements. When the eye is turned in (nasally) and horizontally, the function of the medial rectus muscle is being tested. When it is turned out (temporally) and horizontally, the function of the lateral rectus muscle is tested. When turning the eye down and out, the inferior rectus is contracting. Turning the eye up and out relies on the superior rectus.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the subjective and objective cyclodeviational changes following different weakening procedures on superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> Design: Comparative case series Materials and Methods: In a prospective institution based study, 16 cases of A pattern horizontal strabismus having superior oblique overaction were randomized to superior oblique weakening procedures: either silicon expander or translational-recession. Similarly, 20 cases of V pattern horizontal strabismus with <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> overaction were randomized for <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> weakening procedures: either 10 mm Fink&#x 2032;s recession or modified Elliot and Nankin&#x 2032;s anteropositioning. Cyclodeviation was assessed subjectively with the synoptophore and objectively using the fundus photograph before surgery and 3 months postoperatively. Change in cyclodeviation {{was measured by}} subjective and objective methods. The index of surgical effect (ISE) {{was defined as the}} net torsional change postoperatively. Results: The difference between the extorsional change induced by the two superior oblique procedures, silicone expander (- 6 &#x 00 B 0;) and translational recession (- 11. 3 &#x 00 B 0;), was statistically significant (P= 0. 001). Translational recession caused more extorsional change (ISE= 296 &#x 0025;) than silicone expander surgery (ISE= 107 &#x 0025;). The two <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> weakening procedures, Fink&#x 2032;s recession (&#x 002 B; 2. 5 &#x 00 B 0;) and modified Elliot and Nankin&#x 2032;s anteropositioning (&#x 002 B; 4. 7 &#x 00 B 0;) produced equitable amount of intorsional shift with no statistical difference (P= 0. 93).

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we looked}} for the {{presence}} of vertical heterophoria (VH) in 42 dyslexic children (22 males and 20 females) aged 118. 5 ± 12. 9 months who were compared with a control group of 22 nondyslexic children (eleven males and eleven females) aged 112 ± 9. 8 months. Dyslexics presented a low-level (always, 1 prism diopter) VH combined with torsion. This oculomotor feature clearly separates the dyslexic group from the normal readers group. It is independent of the type of dyslexia. The essential feature of this VH is a lability that appears dur-ing specific stimulation of sensory receptors involved in postural regulation. This lability is demonstrated using a vertical Maddox test conducted under very specific conditions in which postural sensors are successively stimulated in a predetermined order. A quantitative variation in this VH may be seen during the Bielchowsky Head Tilt Test, which reveals hypertonia of the lower or upper <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> Vertical orthophoria can be achieved by placing low-power prisms asymmetrically within the direction of action of the superior or <b>inferior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> The selection of power and axis is not only guided by elements of the eye examination but als...|$|R
