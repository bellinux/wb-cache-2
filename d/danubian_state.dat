25|$|With Germany and Italy {{providing}} the buffer with France, the Austrian Habsburgs had maintained what {{was crucial to}} their security and interests. Together with the recent Balkan conquests, Charles VI now ruled an extensive Habsburg empire. Austria had confirmed its position as a major power, yet the Habsburg dynasty had fallen short of its full war aims: Spain had been lost to Philip V and Sicily lost to the Duke of Savoy. Although Sardinia was exchanged for Sicily in 1720 the island, together with the acquisitions of the Spanish Netherlands and Naples, extended the Monarchy's responsibilities beyond their traditional interests and commitments – an overextension which made the Habsburg territories more vulnerable at their periphery, particularly without {{the assistance of the}} Maritime Powers. In Germany, the Imperial army had been unable to recover the lost lands in Alsace and Lorraine, and the Holy Roman Empire itself made no gains, and even lost territory (Landau). This was largely {{due to the fact that}} Vienna's principal concern had been to establish a secure <b>Danubian</b> <b>state,</b> and the Emperor and his ministers had been unwilling to put German interests before those of Italy and Hungary. The Habsburgs would make further gains when Prince Eugene once again defeated the Ottomans in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18, but Vienna's influence within the Empire declined, not least because the rulers of Hanover, Saxony, and Prussia had territorial claims beyond Germany, and now had royal titles which they considered equal to the Emperor.|$|E
50|$|The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, {{signed in}} 1774 between the Ottomans and Russians, gave Russia {{the right to}} {{intervene}} on behalf of Eastern Orthodox Ottoman subjects in general, a right which it used to sanction Ottoman interventions in the Principalities in particular. Thus, Russia intervened to preserve reigns of hospodars who had lost Ottoman approval {{in the context of}} the Napoleonic Wars (the casus belli for the 1806-12 conflict), and remained present in the <b>Danubian</b> <b>states,</b> vying for influence with the Austrian Empire, well into the 19th century and annexing Moldavia's Bessarabia in 1812.|$|R
5000|$|During 1942, the Slovak-Hungarian {{continued}} to improve. Protracted war, accompanied by military defeats of the Axis, made {{adjustments to the}} diplomacy of the <b>Danubian</b> <b>states.</b> In March 1942, after {{the request of the}} Hungarian regent Miklos Horthy, Miklos Kallay formed a government and began secret negotiations with the British and Americans in order to withdraw Hungary from the war. In the spring of 1943 Kallay initiated the start of negotiations with Slovakia, where the central issue was the [...] "anti-German U-turn" [...] and the rapprochement between the two countries. However, Bratislava was primarily interested in the return of Kosice, that was inacceptable for Budapest. Meanwhile, Hungarians unofficially hinted to Slovaks that the frontiers of 1938 could be revoked if Slovakia would be merged with Hungary in a confederation.|$|R
50|$|So, in 1941, Berlin {{gradually}} {{achieved the}} reduction of the Soviet sympathies of both <b>Danubian</b> <b>states.</b> The Slovak and Hungarian declaration of war on the Soviet Union in June, and the UK and the US in December 1941 finally cemented the two States {{under the influence of the}} Axis Berlin-Rome. This dependence iced the revisionist hopes in Bratislava and Budapest as Berlin refused to raise the issue of border changes until the end of the war. In autumn 1941 the Slovak-Hungarian relations sharpened twice, however, they were normalized under German pressure. During the Berlin meeting of Slovak and Hungarian prime-ministers Vojtech Tuka and Laszlo Bardossy on 25-26 November 1941, two leaders agreed to improve State’s bilateral relations and to register the previously banned political and cultural organization of the Slovak and Hungarian minorities.|$|R

5000|$|After the 1848 Revolution, the Hungarian {{commander}} of Serbian nationality General János Damjanich, {{with a dozen}} other high-ranking officers, was hanged by the Austrians, and Vukovics, rightfully, feared for his life. He was hiding from the authorities at {{the homes of the}} Menyhért Lónyay and Ervin Vladár families immediately after the Surrender at Világos. Vukovics and the Polish general, Józef Bem, fled into exile, first in France. In Paris Vukovics joined Hungarian refugees Mihály Horváth, László Teleki, Bertalan Szemere, Gyula Andrássy, Lázár Meszáros and Mihály Vörösmarty, all of whom were sentenced to death in absentia by the Austrian crown. Vukovics was the most practical politician among the Paris exiles. In 1851 he emigrated to the United Kingdom, but maintained contact with all the revolutionaries, particularly Lajos Kossuth to whom he wrote many letters, outlining two basic principles for the near future: independence of Hungary, and [...] "complete democratic freedom with respect to politics, nationality, and religion." [...] Vukovics insisted on the unity of historical Hungary. Therefore he did not give up Transylvania but did acknowledge the independence of Croatia, and recognized the establishment of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar. Instead of a confederation he proposed an alliance with the neighbouring <b>Danubian</b> <b>states,</b> obviously vis-à-vis Austria. Vukovics subordinated the nationality question to the issue of universal suffrage while [...] "not keeping up any supremacy for the Hungarian nationality." [...] Since the [...] "central power" [...] would decide only in national affairs, county autonomy could satisfy nationalities claims. The official languages in national affairs would be decided by the state, in county affairs by the county, and municipal affairs by the community.|$|R

5000|$|Historical records {{document}} that in 682AD - 685AD {{a group of}} Bulgars led by a Bulgar called Kuber settled {{in the region of}} Keramisian plain, centred on the city of Bitola. Kuber was a chief, who was vassaled to the Avar Khagan. However, whilst he was certainly a Bulgar, he was made chief of a settlement consisting of the descendants of various peoples who had been subjegated by the Avars and actively re-settled in Sirmium, nearer to the Khanate's centre. [...] They may have consisted of Bulgars, Illyrians, Roman warriors and mercenaries, Slavs and even Germanic peoples such as Gepids and Franks. They referred to themselves as Sermesianoi, and at 680 AD they rebelled against the Avars and departed from Sirmium. Some sources suggest Kuber was the brother of Khan Asparuh, who founded the <b>Danubian</b> Bulgarian <b>state</b> in 681, known as First Bulgarian Empire which was centered around a north-western Bulgaria.In the following decades, these people launched campaigns against the Byzantine city of Salonica and established contacts with Danubian Bulgaria. [...] By the early 9th century the lands that Kuber settled had been incorporated into the First Bulgarian Empire. The archaeologist from Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Professor Ivan Mikulchik, revealed the presence not only of the Kuber group, but the whole later Bulgar archaeological culture throughout Macedonia. He describes the traces of Bulgars in this region, which consist of typical fortresses, burials, various products of metallurgy and pottery (including treasure with supposed Bulgar origin or ownership), lead seals, minted from Kuber, amulets, etc. However, it is likely that these artifacts actually represent evidence of Avar presence in the region, which fits with known historiography. Truly, there were vast similarities between early Avar and Bulgar material culture found in Old Bulgaria.|$|R
