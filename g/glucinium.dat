The original source is probably the Sanskrit word वैडूर्य (vaidurya), which is of South Indian origin and could be related to the name of the modern city of Belur. For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as [...] glucinum or <b>glucinium</b> (with the accompanying chemical symbol [...] "Gl", or [...] "G" [...] ), the name coming from the Greek word for sweet: γλυκυς, due to the sweet taste of beryllium salts.|$|E
50|$|Beryllium oxide (BeO), {{also known}} as beryllia, is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula BeO. This colourless solid is a notable electrical insulator with a higher thermal conductivity than any other non-metal except diamond, and exceeds that of most metals. As an amorphous solid, beryllium oxide is white. Its high melting point leads to its use as a refractory. It occurs in nature as the mineral bromellite. Historically and in materials science, beryllium oxide was called glucina or <b>glucinium</b> oxide. Formation of BeO from beryllium and oxygen releases the highest energy per mass of reactants for any chemical reaction, close to 24 MJ/kg.|$|E
