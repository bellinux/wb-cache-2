40|$|Therapy-induced {{senescence}} (TIS), a cytostatic {{stress response}} in cancer cells, is induced inefficiently by current anticancer agents and radiation. The mechanisms that mediate TIS in cancer cells {{are not well}} defined. Herein, we characterize a robust senescence response both in vitro and in vivo to the quinone <b>diaziquone</b> (AZQ), previously identified in a high-throughput senescence-induction small-molecule screen. Using AZQ and several other agents that induce senescence, we screened a series of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and found that p 27 Kip 1 was induced in all investigated prostate cancer cell lines. The ubiquitin-ligase Skp 2 negatively regulates p 27 Kip 1 and, during TIS, is translocated to the cytoplasm before its expression is decreased in senescent cells. Overexpression of Skp 2 blocks the effects of AZQ on senescence and p 27 Kip 1 induction. We also find that stable long-term short hairpin RNA knockdown of Skp 2 decreases proliferation but does not generate the complete senescence phenotype. We conclude that Skp 2 participates in regulating TIS but, alone, is insufficient to induce senescence in cancer cells...|$|E

We enrolled 474 patients younger than 60 years old with untreated de novo AML. Daunorubicin and cytarabine resulted in complete remission (CR) in 342 patients (72 %), and 309 of these patients were randomized to receive one of 2 different intensification regimens. The first regimen consisted of 3 courses of HiDAC. The second regimen consisted of one course of HiDAC, a second course with etoposide and cyclophosphamide, and a third course with <b>diaziquone</b> and mitoxantrone. After a median follow-up time of 8. 3 years, the median survival for all randomized patients was 2. 8 years (95 % CI, 1. 9 - 6. 8 years).

40|$|The group I aziridinylquinone {{anti-cancer}} agents mitomycin C, <b>diaziquone</b> or trenimon {{were much}} more cytotoxic to DT-diaphorase-enriched L 5178 Y/HBM 10 lymphoblasts than parental L 5178 Y cells and caused little oxygen activation. Furthermore, inactivation of cellular DT-diaphorase prevented cytotoxicity whereas catalase did not affect cytotoxicity. This suggests that DT-diaphorase activated these agents and the hydroquinone formed mediated DNA alkylation, crosslinking and cytotoxicity. The group II quinone agents phenanthrenequinone, 2 -amino- 1, 4 -naphthoquinoneimine or naphthazarin were also more cytotoxic to L 5178 Y/HBM 10 cells than parental cells and caused considerable oxygen activation. Inactivation of DT-diaphorase, however, prevented both oxygen activation and cytotoxicity. Furthermore added catalase decreased cytotoxicity, whereas catalase inactivation enhanced cytotoxicity. This suggests that DT-diaphorase activated these agents and the hydroquinone formed caused extensive oxygen activation sufficient to cause DNA oxidative damage and cytotoxicity. The group III quinone agents menadione, 2, 3 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone and 2, 6 -dimethoxy-benzoquinone, on the other hand, were more cytotoxic to the parental cells than L 5178 Y/HBM 10 cells and caused less oxygen activation than group II agents. Furthermore, inactivation of DT-diaphorase enhanced cytotoxicity and prevented oxygen activation than group II agents. Oxygen activation was therefore also attributed to hydroquinone autoxidation. However catalase did not affect cytotoxicity towards parental cells. This suggests that DT-diaphorase detoxified group III quinones and that cytotoxicity may involve DNA oxidative damage by the semiquinone radicals...|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{specimens}} from 15 medulloblastoma {{patients were}} used to establish early passage cultures. In vitro sensitivity to a battery of cytotoxic agents, including some in current medulloblastoma treatment protocols, was measured. Drug sensitivity was assessed at clinically relevant drug concentrations using the 3 H-thymidine uptake method. Tumours were predicted to be sensitive if greater than 37 % were killed by exposure to drugs at clinically achievable levels. A poor response to vincristine (Vcr), cis-platin (CDDP), hydroxyurea (HU) or <b>diaziquone</b> (AZQ) (no responders), and cytosine arabinoside (AraC) (1 / 12), was seen. Nine of ten tumours tested were sensitive to mafosfamide (Mfs); seven out of 12 were sensitive to carmustine (BCNU), 12 of 13 to teniposide (VM- 26) and seven of 13 to etoposide (VP 16 - 213). VM- 26 {{was the best of}} the agents tested with most tumours responding to very low concentrations of drug, suggesting that the role of epipodophyllotoxins in treatment of brain tumours be further investigated. Despite the marked sensitivity of the medulloblastomas to the epipodophyllotoxins, three early passage cultures were much more resistant to these drugs than the average for the group. The basis of this resistance was investigated. Deficient cellular uptake of drug was excluded as a cause of resistance. One resistant early passage culture displayed low cellular activity of topoisomerase II and decreased levels of drug induced enzyme-DNA strand break activity. This was not the case for the other resistant early passage cultures: the basis of resistance in these cells {{does not appear to be}} due to any previously reported mechanism...|$|E
