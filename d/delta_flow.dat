40|$|Well {{control in}} {{drilling}} operations is priority to personnel safety. Detection of kicks, or the unscheduled entry of formation fluids into the wellbore, {{is vital to}} well control. It has been determined that return flow rate is the parameter most sensitive to detecting kicks and lost circulation. One kick detection method associated with this parameter is <b>delta</b> <b>flow</b> early kick detection or simply the <b>delta</b> <b>flow</b> method. This method has limitations on floating vessels. Inaccurate readings can occur due to the heave motion of a vessel. This {{is a result of}} the sensor being downstream of the compensatory slip joint. Expansion and compression of this joint can result in return flow readings that are not representative of the actual value. Inaccurate readings could create situations in which a false kick or false lost circulation is detected. Other inaccurate readings could result in an actual kick or lost circulation situation not being detected. In the past, work has been done to address this by developing a sensor that adjusts for heave. This work supports a project aimed at removing the need for motion compensation by relocating the sensor to a location independent of this motion. A company is currently developing a <b>delta</b> <b>flow</b> early kick detection sensor to be placed at or near the seafloor. The stationary location of this sensor aims to remove the inaccuracy caused by slip joint compensation of vessel movement. This work will consist of a parametric study on the relationship of various drilling system and kick parameters at the seafloor using a well control simulator. The goal is to understand these relationships and determine the <b>delta</b> <b>flow</b> accuracy required based on a given kick size. As a result, this study found that a sensor capable of detecting a 10 barrel kick would require an accuracy of 2. 4 % and a 20 barrel kick would require a 4. 6 % accuracy for detection. This case was a shallow water, low kick intensity scenario. This accuracy and the others reported for the drilling and kick parameter ranges provide the boundaries for a well control sensor to be placed at the seafloor...|$|E

Because of the very standardized experimental conditions {{as well as the}} high-time resolution of measurements the reciprocal impact of various variables of respiratory mechanics can be analyzed precisely. Using a two-compartment {{model of the}} respiratory system regional alterations of lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) were simulated.

The experimental design included a lung simulator, a transport ventilator and a computer for control and data management. To assess the amount of pendulum air the Integral <b>Delta</b> <b>Flow</b> (∫∆V) was calculated as an equivalent value. The amount of pendulum air was increased in both volume controlled ventilation (VCV) with higher tidal volume and pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) with higher airway pressure.

New scientific information developed since 2010 largely confirm these recommendations and the Board’s conclusion that “the best available science suggests that current flows are insufficient to protect public trust resources ” (SWRCB 2010 : 2). For longfin smelt and other estuarine species, spring outflow {{continues to be the}} driver of abundance, and, as demonstrated by the high entrainment rates seen in 2012, additional restrictions to reduce and limit entrainment of adult, larval, and juvenile longfin smelt in the winter and spring months are necessary. For Delta smelt, substantial scientific information shows the necessity of limiting entrainment through OMR restrictions and the necessity and benefits of providing increased fall outflows. Additional evidence suggests that Sacramento splittail and other fishes benefit from increased flow rates on inundated floodplains, but that limitations on entrainment are also important (2011 was a record year for entrainment of Sacramento splittail (~ 9, 000, 000 individuals were salvaged at the SWP/CVP facility).

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{developing}} flow prescriptions to support desirable fish {{species in the}} Delta are compared. To be useful, flow prescriptions must respond to the changing characteristics of the Delta, including sea level rise, additional flooded islands, changes in water diversions, and new invasive species. Adaptive flow prescriptions for desirable fish species are likely to require a more causal, mechanistic, or process basis, so their effectiveness is not outstripped by underlying change and {{so they can be}} more easily modified with improvements in scientific understanding. A “bottom up ” or process-based method for establishing <b>Delta</b> <b>flow</b> prescriptions shows promise for developing flows, where flows required for different functions are examined for independence and synergism to develop an overall flow regime. This “bottom-up ” approach allows for the systematic organization, integration, and expansion of available scientific knowledge relating freshwater flows to native fish populations. No flow prescription approach will avoid controversy, but a “bottom-up ” functional approach should be able to compartmentalize controversies so they are better addressed scientifically. The adoption of more causally-reasoned and quantified flow standards will require significant changes in the scientific and management institutions and infrastructure of the Delta, but ultimately should provide more effective and adaptable flow prescriptions. “I believe in getting into hot water; it keeps you clean. ”- G.

40|$|This study {{aims for}} a better {{understanding}} of the sediment pathways in San Francisco South Bay (South Bay). Many issues relevant to the Bay Area community such as shipping, recreational and commercial fishing, habitat restoration, human health, and environmental water quality are reliant on understanding sediment pathways (McKee et al. [2006]). Existing theories suggest that the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta deliver sediment to South Bay during periods of high river flows. Different hydrodynamic forces, such as the tide, wind and baroclinic flows, redistribute these sediments around South Bay. In this research, trends are analysed using a new set of data (WY 2015 -WY 2017) and sediment pathways in time and space are investigated using a 3 D numerical model. In this model, the pathways of three sediment classes with different settling velocities are traced from their source throughout the Bay Area. No such study has yet been undertaken in the South Bay Area. There is a high Delta sediment input to South Bay during periods of high river flow. The local tributaries contribute only marginally to the suspended sediment concentration of South Bay. With a decreasing sediment load from the Delta, the importance of the local tributaries as a sediment source for South Bay could increase. In this research, three different types of sediment exchange between Central Bay and South Bay are observed. The first type is observed during periods of low river flows (Q 800 m 3 /s). A pulsed sediment flux from the Delta increases the turbidity of Central Bay, resulting in a horizontal spatial variation in SSC from Central Bay to South Bay. The diffusive character of the tide transports the sediments slowly from the turbid Central Bay to the relatively clearer South Bay. The third sediment exchange type is observed after an extreme Delta river flow (QDel ta È 5000 m 3 /s)). The extreme <b>Delta</b> <b>flow</b> refreshes a large part of Central Bay and South Bay. The salinity of Central Bay increases slowly, resulting in a substantially more saline Central Bay than South Bay for a couple of months. The resulting baroclinic flow transports the sediments from Central Bay into South Bay through the landward directed bottom current. Two dominant pathways with opposite transport direction characterise the sediment transport in South Bay. One pathway is located in the channel and is directed southward during periods of high river runoff. The second pathway is located on the extensive east flat and is directed northward during periods of high river runoff. The transport in the channel is dominant during the wet period, resulting in a net transport landward. Besides these two dominant pathways, four re-circulations cells are found, facilitating the exchange between the channel and the shoals. The next step in gaining more insight into the sediment physics is a model studywhich includes bed-interaction with the suspended sediments. A study like this could confirmthe hypotheses opted in this research...|$|E
