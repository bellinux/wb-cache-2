40|$|Music {{technology}} is a term commonly {{used to refer to}} electronic form of the musical arts, particularly devices and computer software that enable the facilitation, playback, recording, composition, storage, and performance of various musical compositions. There has been a growing awareness of the importance of aesthetics in early childhood education, especially for the music technology that offers young children benefits from the implementation of an appropriately complete music technology curriculum in the early childhood educational environment and instruments application. The findings in this paper demonstrate such music courses encourage creativity and foster a sense of cultural understanding and appreciation amongst children in an early education program. In short, with the progress of <b>developmentally</b> <b>appropriated</b> program, this study demonstrates that music technology curriculum is not only valuable, but essential to the early education program for young children...|$|R

500|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder (RAD) {{is described}} in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon disorder that can affect children. RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts.

Due to recent revision in the DSM-5 the [...] "disinhibited form" [...] is now considered a separate diagnosis named [...] "Disinhibited attachment disorder".|$|E
500|$|In DSM-IV-TR the {{inhibited}} form {{is described}} as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a <b>developmentally</b> <b>appropriate</b> fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers {{with a mixture of}} approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit [...] "frozen watchfulness", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour). Such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain [...] "proximity", an essential element of attachment behavior. The disinhibited form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures). There is therefore a lack of [...] "specificity" [...] of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.|$|E

Anderson {{called the}} structure of Blue's Clues a game that presented its viewers with increasingly challenging and <b>developmentally</b> <b>appropriate</b> problems to solve. Early episodes focused on basic subjects such as colors and numbers, but later the programs focused on math, physics, anatomy, and astronomy. The show's producers believed that comprehension and attention were strongly connected, so they wrote the episodes to encourage and increase their viewers' attention. They used content and production characteristics such as pacing which gave children time to respond, as well as [...] "camera techniques, children's voices, musical cues, sound effects, clear transitions, repeatable dialogue, and visuals." [...] Participation, {{in the form of}} spoken or physical response from the audience, and the mastery of thinking skills were encouraged by the use of repetition, both within {{the structure of}} individual episodes and across multiple episodes. The producers used a variety of formal features, which were auditory, and content features, which consisted of invitations given to the audience, such as [...] "Will you help?" [...] The features were also in the form of both recurrent and unique formats and content. The purpose of the recurrent formats and content, which were similar in every episode, was to increase viewers' attention, comprehension, and participation during key educational lessons.|$|E

40|$|Motoneurons <b>developmentally</b> acquire <b>appropriate</b> {{cellular}} architectures that ensure {{connections with}} postsynaptic muscles and presynaptic neurons. In Drosophila, leg motoneurons are organized as a myotopic map, where their dendritic domains represent the muscle field. Here we investigate mechanisms underlying development of {{aspects of this}} myotopic map, required for walking. A behavioral screen identified roles for Semaphorins (Sema) and Plexins (Plex) in walking behavior. Deciphering this phenotype, we show that PlexA/Sema 1 a mediates motoneuron axon branching in ways that differ in the proximal femur and distal tibia, based on motoneuronal birth order. Importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; PlexB/Sema 2 a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons. These findings indicate that communication within motoneurons and between glia and motoneurons, mediated by the combined action of different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems, are required {{for the formation of}} a functional myotopic map...|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} years of the group's existence, it seemed [...] "logical" [...] to develop a {{television}} program that both entertained and conveyed sound and <b>developmentally</b> <b>appropriate</b> values. [...] At the time, according to Field, Australian children's TV [...] "was an extremely staid and cautious genre", so it was difficult for them to break into it. [...] They filmed a television pilot for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) because they felt a program on the network would receive the most exposure to the pre-school market, but as The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) reported in 2002, [...] "the project never got off the ground due to irreconcilable artistic differences". Also according to the SMH, the ABC told them that they could not communicate with children, and that the members of the group should [...] "not speak, just sing". The ABC insisted that instead of what the SMH called their [...] "trademark colourful skivvies and black trousers", they wear shorts and caps. [...] The Wiggles responded to this criticism by creating thirteen episodes of a self-produced television series, The Wiggles, which they funded from their tours and video sales. [...] In this series, and in most of their early series, they cut costs by using two cameras and visually checked the performance of each song; that way, according to Paul Field, it took them less time to complete a forty-minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three-minute music video.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{children who}} have speech, language and communication difficulties. These can arise from insufficient quality or quantity of language experience, or they may arise <b>developmentally,</b> despite <b>appropriate</b> language input from families and carers. They {{may or may not}} be associated with impairments such as hearing loss, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy or autistic spectrum disorders. Whether children's difficulties are specific to language-learning or more general, it is important that they become motivated, engaged learners. Motivation is central, but not in itself enough to guarantee high engagement. Engaged readers are intrinsically (rather than extrinsically) motivated to read, and have the required resources and strategies to do so. Meta-analyses show that strategy teaching, curricular coherence, choice, social collaboration and purpose all impact upon reading engagement (Guthrie and Wigfield 2000). Motivation and engagement impact upon attainment through mechanisms such as practice effects and perseverance. Continued engagement is therefore particularly important for children with speech, language and communication difficulties. Where language is part of the problem, children are at significant risk of literacy difficulties persisting into adult life (Law et al. 2009) ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{children}} and adolescents, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy currently {{has the most}} research evidence {{for the treatment of}} substance abuse problems. Well-established studies also include ecological family-based treatment and group CBT. These treatments can be administered in a variety of different formats, [...] each of which has varying levels of research support Research has shown that what makes group CBT most effective is that it promotes the development of social skills, <b>developmentally</b> <b>appropriate</b> emotional regulatory skills and other interpersonal skills. A few integrated treatment models, which combines parts from various types of treatment, have also been seen as both well-established or probably effective. A study on maternal alcohol and drug use has shown that integrated treatment programs have produced significant results, resulting in higher negative results on toxicology screens. Additionally, brief school-based interventions {{have been found to be}} effective in reducing adolescent alcohol and cannabis use and abuse.

5000|$|Abusing incestuous {{relationships}} between siblings can have {{adverse effects on}} the parties involved. Such abuse can leave victims detrimentally hindered in developmental processes, such as those necessary for interpersonal relations, and can be the cause for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse in the victim's adult life. [...] Definitions used have varied widely. Child sexual abuse between siblings {{is defined by the}} (US) National Task Force on Juvenile Sexual Offending as: sexual acts initiated by one sibling toward another without the other's consent, by use of force or coercion, or where there is a power differential between the siblings. In Caffaro & Conn-Caffaro (1998), sibling child sexual abuse is defined as [...] "sexual behavior between siblings that is not age appropriate, not transitory, and not motivated by <b>developmentally,</b> mutually <b>appropriate</b> curiosity". When child sexual experimentation is carried out with siblings, some researchers, e.g. Bank and Kahn (1982), do consider it incest, but those researchers who do use that term distinguish between abusive incest and non-abusive incest. Bank and Kahn say that abusive incest is power-oriented, sadistic, exploitative, and coercive, often including deliberate physical or mental abuse.|$|R
