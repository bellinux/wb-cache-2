40|$|This study {{aimed at}} getting an insight to the {{practices}} of dialogic oriented shared book reading, as one potential language promotion activity for children with migration backgrounds in German kindergartens. Shared book reading in Germany itself has been one common daily activity in kindergartens, yet it has unfortunately not been {{so much of a}} specific research focus to be explored. One of the notable studies to refer to when discussing shared book reading in the German context is the study conducted by Wieler (1997). On the other hand, {{there are a number of}} internationally recognized studies in the field of early childhood education which already indicated that book reading influenced the outcome measures in preschool children’s language growth, emergent literacy and reading achievement (cf. Bus et al, 1995; Hargrave and Sénéchal, 2000; De Temple & Snow, 2003). Therefore, the theoretical framework under which this study was conducted was built under the claims resulted in these previous studies. The participants of this case study were five native German speaking early childhood educators (Erzieherinnen) and five groups of kindergarten children ages 3 - 6 years old who were acquiring German as a second language. The educators were given a specific picture book and generally instructed to perform “dialogic oriented book reading”. The reading sessions were videotaped with the consent of the kindergartens and the parents of the participating children. The obtained videotaped data were transcribed by native German speakers and then further analysed by using a qualitative content analysis method. The analysis process in this study was conducted to find: 1) An overview of the observed shared book reading practices; 2) Forms of interactions during the observed shared book reading, and 3) Educator’s strategies and children’s behaviours during the interactions. The instruments for the data analysis were two sets of coding schemes (for categorising and analysing educator’s strategies and children’s behaviours) which were developed by adapting the coding scheme and evaluation framework previously developed by DeBruin- Parecki (1999), Reese et al (2003) and Dickinson et al (2003). The reliability of the developed coding schemes in this study was tested by using Cohen’s Kappa for measuring intercoder reliability. For educators’ strategies categories, the computed Cohen Kappa’s value was 0. 773, which could be interpreted as reaching a “substantial agreement”. While, for children’s behaviours coding categories, the Cohen Kappa’s value was 0. 793 that indicated as well a substantial agreement. The results of the analysis indicated that the participating educators utilized considerably different reading styles even though receiving the same instructions. Their attempts of practicing the so-called “dialogic book reading” as prescribed by researchers such as Whitehurst (1992) revealed examples of different other reading styles. Some of the features and strategies of dialogic book reading, such as the PEER (Prompt- Expand- Evaluate- Recall) and CROWD (Completion Prompts- Recall Prompts- Open Ended Prompts- Wh Prompts- Distancing Prompts) appeared during the videotaped sessions. However, one most important point particular to dialogic book reading, i. e. the active role of the children to become the story teller, was missing in all observed cases. Furthermore, some educators performed more closely to what was defined as an “interactive book reading”, a reading situation in which an adult reads a book to a child or a small group of children and uses a variety of techniques to engage the children in the text (cf. Trivette & Dunst, 2007). There were three forms of interactions observed during the shared book reading sessions, namely: 1) educator- child (one-to-one) interaction, 2) peer interaction (between and among children) and 3) group (educator- children) interaction. The observed educator’s strategies were categorized as “instructional strategies” and “personal- management strategies”. The instructional strategies mostly employed by the participating educators were “naming and labelling” and giving feedback in forms of “confirmation”. While, the educator’s personal- management strategies were related to handling personal interaction with children, managing <b>floor</b> <b>selection</b> as well as maintaining children’s interests. The findings concerning children’s behaviours indicated that children mainly gave “responses” to educators’ strategies and their peers behaviours. They also showed several “self-initiated behaviours”. Furthermore, the most frequently coded children’s responses were: “naming and labelling”, “confirmation” and “contradiction/ correction”. While, the most frequently coded children’s self-initiations were: “naming and labelling”, “asking questions” and “picture description”. In addition to the abovementioned findings, it was also found from the study that most of the participating educators applied strategies which could be considered as “low cognitive level”, in other words the strategies which did not require further thinking skills such as inferring or reasoning (cf. Moschovaki & Meadows, 2005). Consequently, the children also responded in the similar cognitive level. Regarding the educators’ language use, to some extent they made use of “decontextualized language- in which the educators tried to connect the story to the children’s lives and experiences, to demonstrate and ask about world/ general knowledge, to explain word definitions and concepts, as well as to infer and make predictions (cf. Morgan & Goldstein, 2004). Moreover, from the observed sequences of interactions, some evidences of potential learning situations were detected. The educators provided input in forms of vocabulary instruction (for instance introducing new words and concepts). They also corrected children’s language use. Interestingly, in this case study, the participating children were also observed to exhibit simple forms of co-construction in terms of discussing words and concepts with their peers. Eventually, this study provided empirically based evidences on how practices of dialogic book reading might look like in kindergartens. The findings of the study revealed what strategies the early childhood educators might have been able to employ and how they employed the strategies. Moreover, the findings also showed how children who were still acquiring a second language could participate given the dialogic or interactive reading situation. Thus, these findings are expected to give theoretical and methodological contributions to the existing studies concerning adult- child shared book reading as well as to practically support the improvement of language promotion programs in Germany. Nevertheless, due to the limitation of the study, some recommendations for further study are also made, especially related to such issues as research design and generalizability of the results...|$|E

40|$|Before any inferences {{of adverse}} health effects from carpet-born VOCs can be drawn, {{exposure}} must be assessed. Understanding exposure is an early step in risk assessment methodologies. Whether based on animal toxicology or human epidemiology studies, exposure must be understood. This includes the specific chemicals to which exposure occurs (e. g., those emitted from carpet) and the extent and duration of exposure. Once the exposure scenario is understood, comparisons to recognized standards (e. g., threshold limit values, ambient air quality standards, etc.) can be achieved. Exposures lower than those recognized to cause {{adverse health effects}} should not be of concern. Carpet is not a public health concern in relation to chemical emissions.

Forward mapping aims at predicting the density and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) from the known set of squeeze cast process parameters such as time delay, pressure duration, squeezes pressure, pouring temperature, and die temperature. An attempt is also made to meet the industrial requirements of developing the reverse model to predict the recommended squeeze cast parameters for the desired density and SDAS.

For addressing these challenges, this research work proposes a Cloud-based knowledge-enriched framework for machining efficiency based on machine tool monitoring. More precisely, it focuses on the optimization of the machining parameters and moves through an event-driven optimization algorithm, utilizing the existing machining knowledge captured by the monitoring system. Based on the features of a new part, a similarity mechanism retrieves the the cutting parameters of successfully executed past parts that have been machined. Afterwards, the optimization module, using event-driven function blocks, adapts these parameters to efficiently optimize the moves and the cutting parameters.

Fortuitously, the final 10 days of the time-lapse sequence showed an enteropneust (of an undescribed species) abruptly appear in the field of view and spend 39 h foraging and producing a clockwise, four-whorl spiral fecal trail before ascending off the sea <b>floor.</b> The <b>selection</b> of the foraging site was not obviously influenced by previous biological or sedimentation processes observed in the time-lapse photographs over the 3 -month period prior to the enteropneust arrival.

In an ancillary analysis of 52 camera sled transects over a 15 -year period (1989 – 2004) at Station M, the photographs revealed that the same enteropneust species was present in small numbers through the 1990 s but increased four-fold in abundance between 2002 and 2004.

This paper {{presents}} {{the physical and}} petrographic characterization of selected granitic rock types from several quarries in Brazil and aims {{to contribute to a}} better knowledge of the engineering properties of granite dimension stone, focusing on laboratory physical determinations and the possible changes that would occur along processing operations, i. e., from the quarried rock to the polished slabs or tiles. The tests – petrography and porosity determinations – led to the collection of parameters of in natura and processed rock material, respectively from specimens obtained from small cubic blocks and polished slabs, situations considered representative of the stresses to which the rock is submitted to during the several processing stages. The results indicated that porosity tends to be higher for “tiles ” than for “blocks”, and that “S-type granites ” have higher porosity and open-pore volume than “ordinary granites”, mainly due to their conspicuous microcracking. Moreover, in spite porous configuration may be modified during stone processing, it was found that such changes are not homogeneous and intrinsically associated to the petrographic characteristics, as previous microcracking and alteration states. Finally, as the new physical conditions, acquired after processing, may influence the stone durability, it is strongly suggested that they should be taken into account, as an additional criterion, to the cladding or <b>flooring</b> natural stone <b>selection</b> and specification...|$|R
40|$|To build {{high-rise}} buildings made {{of timber}} has for long been limited by national laws, {{due to the}} lack of knowledge in engineering solutions. Frame structures made of wood has for a long time been associated with major fire hazards and consequently lower safety and this connection is still being made today. The increased environmental awareness in recent years has contributed to the exploitation of indigenous building materials, including wood from our own Swedish forests and has become increasingly common. Increased knowledge about how structures behave in fire and how they can be protected in order to achieve safe timber structures has resulted in a growing interest in these structures in the construction industry. Research in the area is constantly updated and new laws allow any number of storeys in wooden buildings in Sweden as long as the performance requirements are fulfilled. The main part of this work has involved calculations of the fire resistance and load bearing capacity of floor and wall constructions. The calculations are based on different models, both old and new. There are many alternative ways to handle the problems. The report presents three different approaches that have been generalized into three calculation methods. The names used here for the methods are the same as the two manuals: Brandsäkra trähus version 2 and Fire Safety In Timber Buildings, as well as the standard Eurocode 5, where a detailed description of the methods of calculation are introduced. This work has resulted in a number of updated tables in order to exemplify the fire resistance and load bearing capacity during fire for selected timber structures according to the latest calculation methods. In addition, values of bearing capacity for cross-laminated structures are included. The tables are grouped according to type of construction, namely, walls and <b>floors.</b>  A <b>selection</b> of relevant structures of varying claddings can be found in the tables, including single gypsum plasterboard, double plasterboard and gypsum plasterboard with plywood behind that protect underlying wood studs.

The thickness of the load bearing and non-bearing layers has also been varied in different ways in order to investigate how the bearing capacity is affected.

40|$|ABSTRACT Relative {{performance}} levels were compared for White Leghorn pullets of a selected and an unselected control strain in different laying-house environments {{in each of}} two experiments. Experiment 1 involved single-bird cages, separated-strain flocks in floor pens, and intermingled-strain flocks in floor pens. In addition, Experiment 2 included a three-bird cage environment. Genotype by environment interactions were detected in Experiment 1 for egg and body weights and in Experiment 2 for rate of lay after sexual maturity, livability, egg weight, hen-housed rate of lay, egg mass, body weight, and body weight gain. Although fewer genotype by environment inter-actions were found in Experiment 1, there was a distinct tendency for the strains to differ (or fail to differ) in similar ways {{in each of the}} three environments compared in the two experiments. Pullets of the more aggressive and socially dominant selected strain were generally superior in performance to unselected strain pullets when they were intermingled in floor pens, but those differences tended to disappear when pullets of the two strains were kept in separated-strain flocks. These results are taken as indirect evidence supporting the conclusion that differences in stress associated with the social environment may contribute to genotype by housing environment interactions for performance traits. Selected strain pullets generally were superior to unselected strain pullets when kept in cages with unlimited feed available. Unselected strain pullets put on excessive weight in cages as indicated by both linear and curvilinear regression analyses; the lighter the pullets were in body weight the greater the number of eggs laid after 40 weeks old. However, under the same conditions, selected strain pullets were, on the average, near optimal body weight for maximum egg production during the latter part of the laying year.

40|$|Normally, {{traditionally}} built houses {{as well as}} prefabricated {{houses have}} similar components as regards building technology. For example, this includes the supply with power and gas, the heating technology, the supply and disposal of water, sanitary equipment, communication technology as well as staircases and an optional lift. The current research project aimed at the concentration of these technologies to form a so-called supply and technical (VT) module for universal applications as far as possible. As an example, a product suitable for series production and adaptable to individual conditions was to be developed and produced for series production. The cost-efficient high-quality steel frame design proven in module construction was {{the starting point for}} this as a static support structure. During an intensive planning phase predictive requirements were collected and designed to form a model. Static calculation showed that the VT modules could compatibly be placed one above the other for houses with up to 5 floors. The concept is based on a strict separation of the VT modules from the other rooms in the building. All interfaces have largely been standardized and are of the plug-in or screw-type. Thus, building units erected with the traditional building technology, room module and prefabricated wood design can be interconnected easily. During a modernization of old buildings with multiple floors the specially designed VT modules can be 'docked' to existing buildings. A major advantage, for example, is a subsequent and easy retrofit of a building with a lift without essentially interfering with the existing buildings. A selection of the appropriate support heights allows a relatively simple adaptation to the different existing <b>floor</b> heights. A <b>selection</b> of the materials for designing the facade permits an optional adaptation to the existing buildings.

40|$|Flooring {{materials}} have a considerable {{impact on the}} indoor environment of healthcare facilities. In recent years, flooring options such as vinyl flooring and vinyl composite tiles have emerged as a popular choice in such facilities. They have been preferred extensively because of properties that make them durable, resistant to infections, and easy to maintain with minimum expenditure. However, there is limited literature and research which comprehensively evaluates floor finishes and their selection criteria in healthcare environments and the opinion of facility managers regarding the same. This study analyzed, identified and systematized literature on <b>selection</b> criteria for <b>flooring</b> in healthcare facilities. It found out the preferences of healthcare facility managers regarding floor finishes and their selection criteria and assigned empirical values to their opinions and carried out further analysis. This research investigated literature on different types of floor finishes currently used in healthcare facilities and the criteria applied for their selection. The literature review {{for this study was}} conducted through search engines using relevant keywords. Peer-reviewed studies and articles published between 2000 and 2016 and consistent with the research design were included. A questionnaire survey was conducted among healthcare facility managers in the state of Texas. Hence, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used for data analysis. The top five floor finishes used in the healthcare sector were identified: vinyl flooring, vinyl composite tile (VCT), rubber, linoleum, and ceramic <b>flooring.</b> Top five <b>selection</b> criteria that were identified: durability, infection control, ease of maintenance, maintenance cost, and user safety. Based on specific selection criteria the choice of floor finish may differ because each material exhibits its own properties which are different from other materials. For e. g. vinyl flooring could be preferred due to durability, infection control and low initial and maintenance cost. However, if selection criteria such as the effect on healing and aesthetics are preferred, then carpet flooring could be a better choice. The scope of future research has been provided...|$|R
40|$|The benthic {{environment}} in the Gulf of Cadiz, north-eastern Atlantic, is strongly affected by the Mediterranean outflow water undercurrent (MOW) which flows northwards along the western Iberian Margin at 500 – 1500 m water depth. Foraminiferal census counts of living and dead assemblages from 27 surface samples ranging from 103 to 1917 m water depth, and the examination of hard substrates reveal a close correlation of the fauna with the local hydrography and sediment facies. Four different faunal groups are separated by {{factor analysis of the}} living fauna. Assemblage 1 contains typical lower slope species and dominates samples from the lower MOW core layer and in the North Atlantic deep water below. Shelf edge foraminifera are common in assemblage 2 a which shows the highest proportions in samples from 103 to 272 m. Assemblage 2 b is dominated by upper slope species and suspension-feeders that are frequent in the upper MOW core layer and in distal settings between 396 and 901 m. Species from assemblage 3 prefer epibenthic habitats and are recorded with high proportions exclusively in the immediate flow paths of the upper MOW between 496 and 881 m. Colonisation structures and species composition of epibenthic assemblages from the proximal facies largely differ from those in distal settings. In general, epibenthic foraminifers only use elevated substrates under the influence of near-bottom flow. Under high current velocities, epibenthic foraminifers prefer large and heavy objects. They colonise high attachment levels where a maximum yield of advected food particles can be achieved. In distal settings at lower flow velocities, the elevation height does not exceed 20 mm above the surrounding sediment surface. This level is related to a hydrologic transition layer with high concentrations of suspended particles. The comparison of microhabitat preferences and faunal structure under high and low current velocities reveal that substrate stability may be a confining environmental variable for endobenthic and shallow epibenthic foraminifers. The observations also indicate that the preferential settling height of epibenthic foraminifera is related to the highest lateral flux rates of food particles within reach from the sea <b>floor.</b> A dynamic <b>selection</b> of elevated microhabitats is only used by 7. 8 % of all species recognised in the Gulf of Cadiz area...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of the 54 k goat chip has allowed the genotyping of 825 males from the French goat selection scheme for the two breeds Alpine and Saanen. In this species, genomic selection could improve annual genetic gain by reducing {{the length of the}} sire-son pathway (5. 5 years in 2011). This would require that accuracy of genomic breeding value of young males (without phenotype) is at least equal to the parent average one. Moreover, the quality of prediction being sensitive {{to the size of the}} reference population (sires already genotyped and phenotyped), a multi-breed (combining Alpine and Saanen performances) approach could be considered. The first part of the study focuses on genomic structure of the reference populations of these two breeds that may impact on expected accuracy of genomic predictions. Persistence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) phases between Alpine and Saanen, 0. 58 at 60 kb, was the same as the one find between Manech and Lacaune dairy sheep breeds. Moreover, a low correlation (68 %) between allele frequencies in Saanen and Alpine breeds and an analysis in principal component based on genotypes have shown that Alpine and Saanen have to be considered as two different breeds. Genetic correlation between the two breeds estimated on SNP data ranged between 0. 45 for milk yield and 0. 76 for udder <b>floor</b> position. Genomic <b>selection</b> was tested using a single step approach applied to a GBLUP model in the multi-breed or within-breed for production and udder type traits. The prediction quality was assessed by cross validation and the accuracy of genomic breeding values of candidates was compared to the parent average one. The prediction quality using multi-breed or within-breed model was similar, between 0. 34 for fore udder in Alpine breed to 0. 73 for protein content for Saanen breed. Within-breed, these values were higher in Saanen due to an higher inbreeding level, and similar as the one obtained in Lacaune dairy sheep with a reference population of 2 185 rams. Genomic breeding value accuracy of candidates exceeds parent average accuracy from 10 % for protein yield in Alpine breed to 14 % for protein content in Saanen breed. Clearly the single step GBLUP method provides opportunities for genomic selection in French goats’ population...|$|R
