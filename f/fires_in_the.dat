5|$|By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was {{continuing}} its rapid growth {{and began to}} enroll more and more students each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. The first of several strange <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> University's history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the college's first building. Two decades later on March 9, 1886, another fire destroyed the university's main building. In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom {{as well as several}} dormitory buildings in 1909.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, and it {{took several}} days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever {{been seen in the}} east. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.|$|E
5|$|Oak savanna {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered oak trees, {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. The Takelma tribe often set <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oak savanna and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk. It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison oak are also common.|$|E
5|$|The {{old town}} of Roskilde is centred around the main square, Stændertorvet, {{just south of}} the cathedral. The {{original}} street plan is preserved in nearby Skomagergade, Algade and Hestetorvet although most of the buildings were rebuilt after serious <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. The area is flanked to the north by two large parks, Byparken and Folkeparken, which stretch down to Roskilde Fjord.|$|E

5|$|The parish of Chatteris is large, {{covering}} 6,099 hectares, and {{for much}} of its history was a raised island in the low-lying wetland of the Fens. Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, the town has evidence of settlement from the Neolithic period. After several <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th and 19th centuries, {{the majority of the}} town's housing dates from the late Victorian period onwards, with the tower of the parish church the only medieval building remaining.|$|E
5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} {{starboard}} side of the Houston, blowing 20 men overboard and spreading gasoline <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00 on {{the morning}} of 31May, Laforey sent the boats from his {{squadron}} inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. Coming alongside the wreck at 12:45, the British boarding party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the boarding party started <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving along the shore. The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties.|$|E

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E

He also mentions a bull enraged by <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant, {{but there is nothing}} to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.|$|E

5|$|Russia {{had made}} a {{previous}} attempt to capture Viborg; in October 1706, a siege corps was sent there {{under the command of}} Robert (Roman) Bruce. On 22 October, mortars were placed and the bombardment began, which continued for four days and caused five <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fort at Viborg. After the bombardment, Russian forces retreated to Saint Petersburg after commanders realized that a siege could not be carried out without naval support and larger cannon. Also, autumn was not considered a suitable time for siege operations. The idea to reattempt a capture of Viborg was first proposed by Peter the Great in 1708, but rejected by the military due to the recent Swedish offensive.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{is one of}} {{the largest}} ports on the United States west coast and {{waterfront}} fires have been a continual concern for the city. Since 1891 the Seattle Fire Department has regularly operated at least two fireboats, which can be augmented by ships and small craft with fire suppression capabilities from the U.S. Coast Guard, Seattle Police, and neighboring municipalities. One of the worst maritime <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city's history occurred in 1968 when an electrical malfunction at Todd Shipyards sparked a fire that took 14 engine companies, two fireboats, two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, and several conscripted Foss Maritime tugboats more than half-a-day to extinguish.|$|E
5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one propeller shaft, {{and gave her a}} 29.5° list to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E

5|$|While {{the force}} {{was in the}} Strait of Bonifacio, Dornier Do 217s of the German Luftwaffes {{specialist}} wing KG 100armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombssighted the force. The first attack failed, but the second dealt Italia (ex-Littorio) and Roma much damage. The hit on Roma caused water to flood two boiler rooms and the after engine room, leaving the ship to limp along with two propellers, reduced power, and arc-induced <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stern of the ship. Shortly thereafter, another bomb slammed into the ship which detonated within the forward engine room, causing catastrophic flooding and {{the explosion of the}} #2 main turret's magazines, throwing the turret itself into the sea. Sinking by the bow and listing to starboard, Roma capsized and broke in two, carrying 1,393 menincluding Bergaminidown with her.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E
5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} distance {{that it was impossible}} to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aft half of the ship.|$|E
