40|$|This paper {{describes}} the wind assessment of high layer for siting the wind turbine on the complex terrain, {{which is based}} on the data measured by the use of <b>Doppler</b> <b>SODAR.</b> Although a rough estimation of the wind assessment using standard meteorological anemometers at low layer are cost effective and easy to be installed, it is necessary to measure the wind condition at hub height for accurate assessment. Comparison between measured data by <b>Doppler</b> <b>SODAR</b> and the data predicted from observation of the wind condition at low layer is performed. Large difference is seen in the measured wind profile and calculated power law plots of the wind. Estimation of generation power of wind turbine due to SODAR measurement agrees well with the actual turbine generation power. In the complex terrain, {{it can be said that}} observation of the low layers does not suffice to assess accurately the wind, while <b>Doppler</b> <b>SODAR</b> measurement is useful...|$|E

As part of this programme, {{in this study we}} examine with a <b>Doppler</b> <b>Sodar</b> (FAS 64) several echo and wind pattern characteristics associated with different meteorological phenomena, which are related to the complexity of the terrain. To test the validity of different flow fields connected with Sodar patterns, such as slope drainage winds, cool-air accumulation in low-lying regions, channelling flows created by terrain constrictions (Venturi effects) and sea breeze flows, numerical simulation with the MM 5 model was performed.

Ore mountains represent the region most suitable for construction of wind turbines in the Czech republic. Concerning the observed wind profiles, their generalization may serve for improvement of precision of the simulated wind profile fields.

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the study of nocturnal {{low-level}} jet streams (LLJ) at altitudes up to 400 m agl, with the help of <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodars.</b> The objective was twofold: firstly, to study the origin and behavior of LLJ in a mid-latitude region, and secondly, to compare the LLJ characteristics over urban and rural areas. To this end, simultaneous measurements of wind velocity profiles over the center of Moscow city and over a nearby countryside were carried out. The sodar data on wind speed and direction collected continuously during 27 days in July 2005 were analyzed together with in situ data from a meteorological mast. A good correlation between the height of the LLJ core and the inversion height was found. Empirical distributions of the maximum speed of the jet streams, the height of the jet core, and the wind turning across the stream were obtained. The relationships between the LLJs characteristics and some surface layer parameters were found. Over the urban area the jet streams appeared less frequently and at heigher altitudes than over the countryside...|$|R

40|$|The Rhine valley, which {{stretches}} {{from the main}} Alpine crest to the Lake of Constance, {{was chosen as the}} target area to study unstationary aspects of foehn during the Special Observing Period (SOP) of the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP). This large valley is up to 10 ?km wide and has some of the highest foehn frequencies in the European Alps. The MAP subprogram FORM (FOehn in the Rhine valley during MAP) was designed to investigate various aspects of the foehn including the interaction of foehn flow with the boundary layer and the processes that remove the cold air pool. The subprogram was also focused on improving the understanding and forecasting of foehn-related phenomena such as waves and turbulence. A large number of in-situ and remote sensing observing systems were deployed to take measurements during the field phase of MAP. Among them were about 50 surface stations, up to 9 radiosonde stations, 2 wind profilers, 4 <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodars,</b> 2 scintillometers, 1 scanning and 1 backscatter lidar and different research aircraft.

40|$|International audienceObservations {{from two}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodars</b> and a radar wind {{profiler}} {{have been used}} in conjunction with data from a rawinsonde station and a mesoscale surface observation network to conduct a case study of a gravity current entering into an environment containing a nocturnal inversion and an elevated neutral layer. On the basis of synoptic and mesoscale analyses, it is concluded that the gravity current might have originated either as a scale-contracted cold front or as a gust front resulting from thunderstorm outflows observed very near the leading edge of a cold front. Despite this ambiguity, the detailed vertical structure of the gravity current itself is well resolved from the data. Moreover, the vertical velocity measurements provided by the sodars and the radar wind profiler at high time resolution have given unique information about the height structure of gravity waves excited by the gravity current. Although only wave periods, and not phase speeds or wavelengths, are directly measured, it is possible to make reasonable inferences about wave excitation mechanisms and about the influence and control of ambient stratification on wave-field characteristics. Both Kelvin-Helmholtz waves generated in the regions of high wind shear found in association with the gravity current and lee-type waves forced by the gravity current acting as an obstacle to opposing prefrontal flow are identified. It is also found that the propagation speed of the gravity current and the relative depths of the prefrontal inversion and the postfrontal cold air were not favorable for the formation of either internal bores or solitary waves at the time of day at which the gravity current was being observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present the}} {{analytical}} and numerical solutions for (U, V) depending on (z, t) in the katabatic flow, where U and V are the downslope and cross-slope wind components. The solutions for (U, V) from the recently extended analytical 1 D Prandtl model are verified against observations (the 15 -min averages) from a novel autonomous <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> wind profiling system in Antarctica. Two {{cases of the}} wintertime, primarily katabatically driven, flows with the different stability values are investigated. The analytical and numerical model parameters are calculated from the <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> and AWS (automatic weather station) data. Observations of the downslope component are generally better described by the model solutions, {{especially in the case}} of the stronger stability. The model solutions for V agree qualitatively with the observations, but are not accurate enough in determining the height and the speed of the V maximum. Therefore, further improvements of the Prandtl model will be amendable as well as recommendations for a better parameterization of katabatic flows in large-scale numerical models...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Detailed {{knowledge}} of the wind resource is necessary in the developmental and operational stages of a wind farm site. As wind turbines continue to grow in size, masts for mounting cup anemometers‚Äîthe accepted standard for resource assessment‚Äîhave necessarily become much taller, and much more expensive. This limitation has driven the commercialization of two remote sensing (RS) tools for the wind energy industry: The LIDAR and the <b>SODAR,</b> <b>Doppler</b> effect instruments using light and sound, respectively. They are ground-based and can work over hundreds of meters, sufficient for the tallest turbines in, or planned for, production. This study compares wind measurements from two commercial RS instruments against an instrumented mast, in upland (semi-complex) terrain typical of where many wind farms are now being installed worldwide. With appropriate filtering, regression analyses suggest a good correlation between the RS instruments and mast instruments: The RS instruments generally recorded lower wind speeds than the cup anemometers, with the LIDAR more accurate and the SODAR more precise...|$|R
40|$|Humidity {{variability}} {{at the top}} of {{the marine}} boundary layer (MBL) and in the free troposphere was examined using a variety of measurements taken on and around San Nicolas Island (SNI) during the FIRE IFO in July, 1987. Doppler wind profiler reflectivity recorded at two minute time resolution has provided the most continuous record and detail of small scale humidity fluctuations. Rawinsonde data were available from both an island site and the research vessel Point Sur. The information extractable from these sources is somewhat limited due to the frequency of launches (3 to 4 /day at SNI and 6 /day on the Point Sur). Some additional data were available from instrumented aircraft although scheduling flights in the neighborhood of the island was difficult due to restrictions on the air space. Other relevant data were collected at SNI near the radar and rawinsonde launch sites. A continuous record of cloud base altitude was logged by a ceilometer. <b>Doppler</b> acoustic sounder (<b>sodar)</b> reflectivity data provided a good record of inversion height. The sodar also monitored turbulent temperature fluctuations in the MBL. A small ground station recorded hourly averages of solar irradiance and downward longwave irradiance. The analysis in progress of the various data sets for two adjacent two day periods from 11 July to 14 July is described. The earlier period was chosen because the marine inversion was unusually high and there was increased frequency of rawinsonde launches at SNI. The later period was chosen because of the significant descent with time of an elevated inversion indicated by the radar data. Throughout the four day period, but especially in the first half, the turbulent humidity structure calculated from Doppler radar reflectivity shows excellent agreement with humidity profiles evaluated from rawinsonde data...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-frequency}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> for precipitation measurements {{has been}} developed. Such a <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> (6 ‚Äì 20 kHz) can almost always measure precipitation and turbulence spectra simultaneously. Therefore, the mean vertical wind and spectral broadening {{effects can be}} directly removed. As the acoustic refractive indices for ice and liquid water are almost the same, the acoustic retrieval of precipitation can also be applied to rain with small hail (e. g., diameter D < 10 mm) or large hail, but for the latter, neglecting the effects of different orientations and shapes of hailstones.

The first prototype has been continuously operated at a coastal weather station since 25 October 2002. For stratiform rain events, the minisodar showed good agreement with a Joss‚ÄìWaldvogel disdrometer and an optical rain gauge. However, for convective heavy showers, the minisodar always observed higher rain rates. The continuous, nonattended automatic operation of the minisodar has shown its capability for all kinds of precipitation measurements. The retrieval of precipitation rates for snow and graupel will be provided in a subsequent paper...|$|E

40|$|Turbulence {{structures}} of high Reynolds number {{flow in the}} near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are investigated based on observations at Shionomisaki and Shigaraki, Japan. A <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> measured the vertical profiles of winds in the ABL. Using the integral wavelet transform for the time series of surface wind data, the pattern of a descending high-speed structure with large vertical extent (from the surface to more than 200 -m level) is depicted from the <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> data. Essentially this structure is {{a specific type of}} coherent structure that has been previously shown in experiments on turbulent boundary-layer flows. Large-scale high-speed structures in the ABL are extracted using a long time scale (240 s) for the wavelet transform. The non-dimensional interval of time between structures is evaluated as 3. 0 ‚Äì 6. 2 in most cases. These structures make a large contribution to downward momentum transfer in the surface layer. Quadrant analyses of the turbulent motion measured by the sonic anemometer (20 -m height) suggest that the sweep motion (high-speed downward motion) plays a substantial role in the downward momentum transfer. In general, the contribution of sweep motions to the momentum flux is nearly equal to that of ejection motions (low-speed upward motions). This contribution of sweep motions is related to the large-scale high-speed structures...|$|E
40|$|The diurnal {{evolution}} of the urban boundary layer over the central area of Rome was observed by the simultaneous and co-located operation of a <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar,</b> a microwave radiometer and a dual polarization lidar. The <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> was configured to provide a wind profile up to about 800 m, and a time-height picture of the thermal structure of the urban boundary layer. A microwave radiometer provided a temperature profile up to 600 m with a height resolution of 50 m. The lidar provided profiles of the aerosol backscattering up to about 7 - 10 km with 30 m height resolution. The experiment was conducted for several days in the year 1998 during day and night with clear sky and low wind. The aerosol profiles in the urban troposphere appear linked to stability conditions in the lower layers and strong pollution. The presence of aerosols, typically in the afternoon hours at heights up to 2 - 3 km, {{can be related to}} a relatively high mixed layer. Such layer is caused by free convection as indicated by the Richardson number, estimated by the temperature and wind data. Some typical case studies are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

When the acoustic data were compared with theoretical predictions from a fast field program (FFP), {{it was found that}} the FFP underpredicted sound levels measured in a shadow zone. Here, the effect on the predictions of including meteorological data for heights greater than the surface layer, i. e., wind profiles measured by a <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar,</b> is discussed.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe sea breeze circulation was investigated {{using a combination}} of acoustic <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar,</b> Doppler lidar and conventional observations in central California on the coast of Monterey Bay in September 1987. The study was called LASBEX (Land Sea Breeze EXperiment) and used the combined effort and resources of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), NOAA Wave Propagation Lab (WPL) and Naval Environmental Prediction Research Facility (NEPRF). A monostatic three-axis phased-array <b>Doppler</b> <b>sodar</b> was able to detect the various features of the sea breeze front, which has many of the characteristics of a gravity head current produced in laboratory experiments, such as the longitudinal vortex, lobe and cleft structure, and strong regions of turbulence and convergence. Profiles of the wind field and its component variances were generated every five minutes. Vertical velocities up to 1. 0 m/s were detected in the updraft region at the front. Vertical velocity fields were used to derive the horizontal divergence associated with the sea breeze and values of convergence in the range of 4 X 10 Àâ·∂üsÀâ·∂¶ and greater were calculated. These are believed to be more accurate values than any found in previous sea breeze studies. Doppler lidar radial velocity information was useful in mapping the various layers and wind structure of the sea breeze. The wind field of the sea breeze seen by the lidar was compared with the sodar. The results of this comparison showed that the sodar was well suited to investigate features under 600 meters in height, such as the updraft region behind the front and the variance of the wind, whereas the lidar was better at describing the larger scale flow, such as the return flow of the sea breeze, the convergence zone along the sea breeze front and prevailing synoptic winds. Together, these instruments gave a comprehensive and complete description of the sea breeze frontal structure, evolution and movement. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
