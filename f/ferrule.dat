By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors.

Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a <b>ferrule,</b> sinew, or wire.|$|E

The wooden handguard remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard <b>ferrule,</b> which retains the bipod legs, {{can be used to}} open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose which damaged them.|$|E
25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. valve trombone), allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a <b>ferrule</b> to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to crown lengthening {{to establish a}} proper biologic width, a 2mm height of tooth structure {{should be available to}} allow for a <b>ferrule</b> effect. [...] A <b>ferrule,</b> in respect to teeth, is a band that encircles the external dimension of residual tooth structure, not unlike the metal bands that exist around a barrel. [...] Sufficient vertical height of tooth structure that will be grasped by the future crown is necessary to allow for a <b>ferrule</b> effect of the future prosthetic crown; it has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of fracture in the endodontically treated tooth.. J Prosthet Dent 61:676, 1989. [...] Because beveled tooth structure is not parallel to the vertical axis of the tooth, it does not properly contribute to <b>ferrule</b> height; thus, a desire to bevel the crown margin by 1mm would require an additional 1mm of bone removal in the crown lengthening procedure. [...] Frequently, however, restorations are performed without such a bevel.|$|E

Int Endod J, 35:575–581, 2002. [...] On the other hand, it has also been shown that the [...] "difference between an effective, long-term restoration and a failure can be as small as 1 mm of additional tooth structure that, when encased by a <b>ferrule,</b> provides great protection. [...] When such a long-lasting, functional restoration cannot be predictably created, tooth extraction should be considered." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lock-blade knives {{have been}} dated to the 15th century. [...] In Spain, one early lock-blade design was the Andalusian clasp knife popularly {{referred}} to as the navaja. [...] Opinel knives use a twist lock, consisting of a metal <b>ferrule</b> or barrel ring that is rotated to lock the blade either open or closed. [...] In the late 20th century lock-blade pocket knives were popularized and marketed on a wider scale. Companies such as Buck Knives, Camillus, Case, and Gerber, created a wide range of products with locks of various types. The most popular form, the lockback knife, was popularized by Buck Knives in the 1960s, so much that the eponymous term [...] "buck knife" [...] was used to refer to lockback knives that were not manufactured by Buck.|$|E

It is not permissible in some games (e.g. Snooker) and may be frowned upon or even forbidden in some venues as attempts at it by unskilled players may cause damage to a table's cloth. A legal jump shot requires that the cue ball be hit above center, driving it down into the table, so that the ball will leave the table surface on a rebound. All authoritative rule sources deem it illegal to [...] "scoop" [...] under the cue ball {{with the tip of}} the cue to fling it into the air (technically because it is illegal to contact the cue ball with the <b>ferrule</b> of the cue, and because the cue ball is struck twice, both of which are classic fouls).|$|E

[...] Most handguards are of the solid, fiberglass variety (albeit shortened), but a limited number were made with shortened wood handguards. [...] The steel buttplate was deleted in favor of a rubber recoil pad, which greatly reduces perceived recoil. [...] A limited number of M14Ks were manufactured with the BM-59 Alpine / Para folding stock. [...] These too had the shortened stocks and handguards, making for an extremely compact package especially suited to vehicular and airborne operations. [...] A couple of M14Ks were built for SEAL Team members using the tubular folding stock assembly on a cut-down M14E2 stock found on some of the Team's full-size M14s prior to adoption of the Sage International EBR stock for M14 applications. [...] These are by far one of the rarest variants of the M14K.|$|E
