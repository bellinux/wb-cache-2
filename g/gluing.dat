Some {{of the most striking}} artifacts, including engraved pieces of red ochre, were manufactured at Blombos Cave in South Africa 70 ka. Pierced and ochred Nassarius shell beads were also recovered from Blombos, with even earlier examples (Middle Stone Age, Aterian) from the Taforalt Caves. Arrows and hide working tools have been found at Sibudu Cave as evidence of making weapons with compound heat treated <b>gluing</b> technology.|$|E

5000|$|Animal <b>glue</b> was {{the most}} common {{woodworking}} <b>glue</b> for thousands of years until the advent of synthetic <b>glues</b> such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and other resin <b>glues</b> in the 20th century. Today it is used primarily in specialty applications such as lutherie, pipe organ building, piano repairs, and antique restoration.

50|$|The {{significant}} {{disadvantages of}} hide <b>glue</b> - its thermal limitations, short open time, and vulnerability to micro-organisms - are offset by several advantages. Hide <b>glue</b> joints are reversible and repairable. Recently <b>glued</b> joints will release easily with {{the application of}} heat and steam. Hide <b>glue</b> sticks to itself, so the repairer can apply new hide <b>glue</b> to the joint and reclamp it. In contrast, PVA <b>glues</b> do not adhere to themselves once they are cured, so a successful repair requires removal of the old <b>glue</b> first - which usually requires removing some of the material being <b>glued.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{closely related}} 'strange' {{geometrical}} object is the Klein bottle. A Klein bottle {{can be produced}} by <b>gluing</b> two Möbius strips together along their edges; this cannot be done in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space without creating self-intersections.|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} prey capture <b>glues</b> {{produced}} by orb-weaving spiders (viscid <b>glue)</b> and their evolutionary descendents, the cobweb-weaving spiders (gumfoot <b>glue).</b> These <b>glues</b> are produced in homologous glands but exhibit contrasting structure, properties {{and response to}} changing humidity. Individual <b>glue</b> droplet stretching measurements indicate that the gumfoot <b>glue</b> behaves like a viscoelastic liquid {{in contrast to the}} viscid <b>glue,</b> which behaves like a viscoelastic solid. Moreover, the gumfoot <b>glue</b> is largely humidity-resistant – elasticity and adhesion are constant across variation in humidity and there is weak volume-dependence. Viscid <b>glue,</b> however, is highly humidity-sensitive. The <b>glue</b> expands an order of magnitude and demonstrates a monotonous reduction in elasticity under increased humidity, while <b>glue</b> adhesion optimizes at intermediate levels of humidity. We suggest that observed differences are due to different ‘tackifiers' used in these systems. These results shall inspire future efforts in fabricating stimuli-resistant and stimuli-sensitive materials...|$|R
50|$|Hide <b>glue</b> regains its working {{properties}} after cooling {{if it is}} reheated. This property can be {{used when}} the <b>glue's</b> open time does not allow the joint to be <b>glued</b> normally. For example, a cello maker {{may not be able}} to <b>glue</b> and clamp a top to the instrument's ribs in the short one-minute open time available. Instead, the builder will lay a bead of <b>glue</b> along the ribs, and allow it to cool. The top is then clamped to the ribs. Moving a few inches at a time, the maker inserts a heated palette knife into the joint, heating the <b>glue.</b> When the <b>glue</b> is liquefied, the palette knife is removed, and the <b>glue</b> cools, creating a bond. A similar process can be used to <b>glue</b> veneers to a substrate. The veneer and/or the substrate is coated with hot hide <b>glue.</b> Once the <b>glue</b> is cold, the veneer is positioned on the substrate. A hot object such as a clothes iron is applied to the veneer, liquefying the underlying <b>glue.</b> When the iron is removed, the <b>glue</b> cools, bonding the veneer to the substrate.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper also {{operated}} a successful <b>glue</b> factory in Gowanda, New York that produced <b>glue</b> for decades.

25|$|As for tool use, {{construction}} behaviour may {{be mostly}} innate.

25|$|If M is {{a closed}} 2-manifold, new orbifold {{structures}} {{can be defined}} on Mi by removing finitely many disjoint closed discs from M and <b>gluing</b> back copies of discs D/ Γi where D is the closed unit disc and Γi is a finite cyclic group of rotations.

5000|$|<b>Glue</b> {{is highly}} {{effective}} for joining timber when both {{surfaces of the}} joint are edge grain. A properly <b>glued</b> joint may be as strong or stronger than {{a single piece of}} wood. However, <b>glue</b> is notably less effective on end-grain surfaces. Animal <b>glue</b> is soluble in water, producing joints that can be disassembled using steam to soften the <b>glue.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Animal <b>glue,</b> {{especially}} hide <b>glue,</b> was {{the primary}} adhesive of choice for a great many types of woodworking, including furniture and lutherie, for many centuries. It is manufactured from rendered collagen from the skins (hides) of animals. It is chemically similar to edible gelatin and is non-toxic if ingested. Hide <b>glue</b> is still used today in specialized applications: musical instruments (lutherie), for replica furniture, and for conservation-grade repairs to antique woodwork. Hide <b>glue</b> is measured {{on the basis of}} its gel strength, a measure of how many grams of force it requires to depress a 1/2 in plunger 4 mm into a 12.5% protein solution of the <b>glue</b> at 10 C. <b>Glue</b> is manufactured in standard grades from 32 - 512 g. 192 g strength is the most commonly used for woodworking; 251 g is the highest normally used for instrument building; 135 g is the lowest used for general woodwork. <b>Glue</b> above 250 g strength requires excessive dilution and so leaves too little <b>glue</b> in joints for effective adhesion, so it is not commonly used. Liquid versions of hide <b>glue</b> are now available; typically they have urea added to keep the <b>glue</b> liquid at room temperature and to extend drying time. Examples of liquid hide <b>glue</b> are Old Brown <b>Glue</b> or Titebond Liquid Hide. Hide <b>glue</b> does not creep. Hide <b>glue</b> joints are easy to repair, by just heating and adding more hide <b>glue.</b>|$|R
25|$|CW-complexes: A CW {{complex is}} a topological space formed by <b>gluing</b> disks of {{different}} dimensionality together.

25|$|Acacia melanoxylon timber has a {{density of}} {{approximately}} 660kg/m3 and is strong in compression, resistant to impact and is moderately stiff.

25|$|Intuitively, two {{spaces are}} homeomorphic {{if one can}} be {{deformed}} into the other without cutting or <b>gluing.</b> A traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut, since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glue</b> traps {{are made}} using natural or {{synthetic}} adhesive applied to cardboard, plastic trays or similar material.

40|$|Abstract. We study <b>glue</b> {{operators}} used in component-based frameworks {{to obtain}} systems as {{the composition of}} atomic components described as labeled transition systems (LTS). <b>Glue</b> operators map tuples of LTS into LTS. They restrict the behavior of their arguments by performing memoryless coordination. In a previous paper, we have proposed a simple format for SOS rules that captures, in particular, <b>glue</b> operators from known frameworks such as CCS, SCCS, CSP, and BIP. This paper studies a new way for characterizing <b>glue</b> operators: as boolean <b>glue</b> constraints between interactions (sets of ports) {{and the state of}} the coordinated components. We provide an SOS format for <b>glue,</b> which allows a natural correspondence between <b>glue</b> operators and <b>glue</b> constraints. This correspondence is used for automated synthesis of <b>glue</b> operators implementing given <b>glue</b> constraints. By focusing on the properties that do not bear computation, we reduce a very hard (and, in general, undecidable) problem of synthesizing controllers to a tractable one. The examples in the paper show that such properties are natural and can be expressed as <b>glue</b> constraints in a straightforward manner. Finally, we compare expressiveness of the proposed formalisms with the <b>glue</b> used in the BIP framework and discuss possible applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Iatrogenic preterm prelabor rupture of {{membranes}} (iPPROM) {{remains the}} main complication after invasive interventions into the intrauterine cavity. Here, the proteolytic stability of mussel-mimetic tissue adhesive (mussel <b>glue)</b> and its sealing behavior on punctured fetal membranes are evaluated. The proteolytic degradation of mussel <b>glue</b> and fibrin <b>glue</b> were compared in vitro. Critical pressures of punctured and sealed fetal membranes were determined under close to physiological conditions using a custom-made inflation device. An inverse finite element procedure {{was applied to}} estimate mechanical parameters of mussel <b>glue.</b> Mussel <b>glue</b> was insensitive whereas fibrin <b>glue</b> was sensitive towards proteolytic degradation. Mussel <b>glue</b> sealed 3. 7 mm fetal membrane defect up to 60 mbar (45 mmHg) when applied under wet conditions, whereas fibrin <b>glue</b> needed dry membrane surfaces for reliable sealing. The mussel <b>glue</b> can be represented by a neo-Hookean material model with elastic coefficient C(1) = 9. 63 kPa. Ex-vivo-tested mussel <b>glue</b> sealed fetal membranes and resisted pressures achieved during uterine contractions. Together with good stability in proteolytic environments, this makes mussel <b>glue</b> a promising sealing material for future applications...|$|R
25|$|<b>Gluing</b> {{edges of}} polygons {{is a special}} kind of {{quotient}} space process. The quotient concept can be applied in greater generality to produce new or alternative constructions of surfaces.

25|$|One {{method of}} {{identifying}} points (<b>gluing</b> them together) {{is through a}} right (or left) action of a group, which acts on the manifold. Two points are identified if one is moved onto the other by some group element. If M is the manifold and G is the group, the resulting quotient space is denoted by M / G (or G \ M).|$|E
25|$|Formally, the <b>gluing</b> {{is defined}} by a {{bijection}} between the two boundaries. Two points are identified when they are mapped onto each other. For a topological manifold this bijection should be a homeomorphism, otherwise the result {{will not be a}} topological manifold. Similarly for a differentiable manifold {{it has to be a}} diffeomorphism. For other manifolds other structures should be preserved.|$|E

50|$|Hide <b>glue</b> also {{functions}} {{as its own}} clamp. Once the <b>glue</b> begins to gel, it pulls the joint together. Violin makers may <b>glue</b> the center seams of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with hot hide <b>glue,</b> and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the hide <b>glue</b> starts to gel, {{at which point the}} <b>glue</b> becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the hide <b>glue</b> pulls the joint together as it hardens.|$|R
