5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends {{to spend the day}} resting in piles of two <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E

50|$|During the 17th century, over 80,000 women {{lived and}} were educated in convents. Nuns never {{received}} monetary compensation. They served without salary, surviving on charity.

5000|$|Cryosurgery or cryotherapy, which {{involves}} freezing the wart (generally with liquid nitrogen), creating a blister between the wart and epidermal layer {{after which the}} wart and the surrounding dead skin fall off. An average of 3 to 4 treatments are required for warts on thin skin. Warts on calloused skin like plantar warts might take <b>dozens</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> treatments.|$|R
5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} nurse sharks, the {{tawny nurse shark}} {{is believed to be}} a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at all hours off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|E

25|$|During its height, the Detroit Publishing Company drew upon 40,000 negatives for its {{publishing}} effort, and had {{sales of}} seven million prints annually. Traveling salesmen, mail order catalogues, {{and a few}} retail stores aggressively sold the company's products. The company maintained outlets in Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, London, and Zurich, and also sold their images at popular tourist spots and through the mail. At the height of its success, the company employed some forty artisans and a <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> traveling salesmen.

25|$|American white {{pelicans}} like to {{come together}} in groups of a <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> birds to feed, as they can thus cooperate and corral fish to one another. When this is not easily possible – for example in deep water, where fish can escape by diving out of reach –, they prefer to forage alone. But the birds also steal food on occasion from other birds, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. White pelicans are known to steal fish from other pelicans, gulls and cormorants {{from the surface of}} the water and, in one case, from a great blue heron while both large birds were in flight.|$|E

25|$|Crisp {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} to Griffith for several years and learned much during this time from Griffith, an early master of film story telling who was influential in advancing a number of early techniques, such as cross cutting in editing his films. This experience fostered a similar passion in Crisp to become a director in his own right. His first directing credit was Little Country Mouse, made in 1914. Many directors (and actors) would find themselves turning out a <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> films in a single year at this time. Over the next fifteen years, Crisp directed some 70 films in all, most notably The Navigator (1924) with Buster Keaton and Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925) with Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. A step up to the next level of mechanization is determined by economics of scale until you reach production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory employing a <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> workers.|$|E
