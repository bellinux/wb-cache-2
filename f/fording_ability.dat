5000|$|The M35 {{family was}} {{introduced}} in 1950 to replace the GMC CCKW and M135 family cargo trucks that constituted the backbone of U.S. military transport since their introduction in World War II. The M35 would not completely replace the M135 family {{until the middle of}} the 1960s. However, the M35 would quickly become the dominant truck in its class in the U.S. military, serving with all the services in various capacities. For a short period the M35 was called [...] "The Eager Beaver" [...] by the U.S. Army due to its <b>fording</b> <b>ability.</b> But the name was never popular and forgotten in a few years.|$|E
50|$|The Germans {{gave their}} Tiger tank a long snorkel, {{essentially}} a long tube on the commander's hatch that {{allowed it to}} wade through up to four metres of water, as well as rubber gaskets on all openings. This was necessary {{due to the fact}} that the large tank was too heavy for most bridges in Europe and Russia at the time, meaning that they had to be able to deep ford across rivers when a bridge wasn't available. The Tiger was the first tank to come with deep <b>fording</b> <b>ability</b> as designed, although the earlier Tauchpanzer, a modification of the Panzer III and Panzer IV, was designed to drive on the sea-bed, part of the German preparations for Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain in 1941. A long, flexible rubber hose with a floating buoy on the end supplied the engine and crew with air and gave the waterproofed tank a maximum diving depth of 15 m making it an extreme example of a wading tank. They were also extremely unpopular with their crew, due to the danger of breakdown while in deep water and the possibility of drowning. Since the crew was unable to see where they were going, direction was given was by means of radio and a spotter on the surface. The Germans eventually converted 168 Panzer IIIs and 42 Panzer IVs into Tauchpanzers, although they were never used for their intended purpose in the end.|$|E
5000|$|Production of the P7 {{came to an}} end in December 1971. [...] Some sources {{give the}} car's final year as 1972 which presumably {{reflects}} <b>Ford’s</b> <b>ability</b> to continue to supply, from “inventory” cars that could be registered as new, though they had been manufactured during the previous year. That was not unusual, although ceasing production of a model in December was.|$|R
50|$|Tommy Ton {{was born}} in Oakville, Ontario to Vietnamese Canadian parents. When Ton was 13 years old, he was asked by his sister to record FashionTelevision. Tom Ford {{appeared}} in the segment that Ton was recording, where Ford began expressing his views on women and sexuality. Impressed by <b>Ford’s</b> <b>ability</b> to speak eloquently with carefully chosen words about his collection, Ton’s interest in fashion began.|$|R
5|$|Goebel was {{a friend}} of Gerald R. Ford's mother and {{stepfather}} in Grand Rapids. Goebel {{played an important role in}} guiding Ford to the University of Michigan. When Ford graduated from Grand Rapids South High School, Goebel recognized <b>Ford’s</b> <b>ability</b> as a football player and recommended him to his former teammate Harry Kipke, who had taken over as Michigan’s head football coach. Kipke recruited Ford, who became Michigan's Most Valuable Player in 1934.|$|R
500|$|Ford {{was also}} a notorious {{alcoholic}} whose excesses contributed to his death six years after Johnson's visit. This event deeply affected Johnson, and he remembered Ford in his Life of Fenton, saying that <b>Ford's</b> <b>abilities,</b> [...] "instead of furnishing convivial merriments to the voluptuous and dissolute, might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the wise". Having spent six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Hunter, [...] "angered by the impertinence of this long absence", refused {{to allow him to}} continue at the grammar school.|$|R
50|$|On land, {{the vehicle}} {{was too heavy}} and its body too {{unwieldy}} to be popular with the soldiers. GPAs would frequently get stuck in shallow waters, where the regular Willys MB's water <b>fording</b> <b>abilities</b> allowed it to drive straight through (Pohl, 1998). Production was already halted in March 1943 after production of only 12,778 vehicles due to financial quibbles between Ford and the US government, as well as bad reception of the vehicle in theatre. Although some sources (Pohl; Carlin, 1989) state that {{less than half of}} that number were ever completed, serial numbers of surviving specimens suggest that the 12,7XX figure is actually correct.|$|R
25|$|The {{company was}} founded with a paid-up capital of $15,000 ($369,205 in 2007). Henry Ford managed the {{manufacturing}} plant at 1343 Cass Avenue and Amsterdam in Detroit; initially with no pay until {{he left his}} job at the Detroit Edison Company, after which he was given a monthly salary of $150 ($3,692 in 2007). He refused to put a car into production until he had perfected it to his satisfaction, infuriating investors who quickly began to lose confidence in <b>Ford's</b> <b>ability</b> to bring a product to market. The company's primary objective was to make a profit for its investors, who had seen the Oldsmobile plant, where the Curved Dash Oldsmobile was built which was profitable for its owner Samuel Smith.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1991, Marc Ford sat in {{a couple}} of times with The Black Crowes in-concert, {{performing}} The Allman Brothers Band's classic hit, [...] "Dreams". When The Black Crowes severed their relationship with their original guitarist Jeff Cease, Ford was asked to fill the vacancy, stepping into the lineup {{just in time for the}} band to record their 1992 sophomore album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. The album would go on to reach Number 1 on the Billboard charts and earn a double platinum certificate for sales. Ford would go on to perform on the next two Black Crowes releases, Amorica (1994) and Three Snakes and One Charm (1996) and is also credited for tracks from the band's two unreleased albums (1993's Tall and 1997's Band; later released together as The Lost Crowes). His addition to the Black Crowes sound, which consisted primarily of slide guitar and southern twang, helped define the band at the time. <b>Ford's</b> <b>ability</b> to adapt to core songwriter, Rich Robinson's music and crunchy rhythm guitar sound, solidified him and Robinson, as arguably, the preeminent guitar duo of the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Also, GM {{agreed to}} cover {{one half of}} the cost for workers and their families. The UAW, in return, agreed to a five-year term of the {{contract}}. Fortune named the contract the [...] "Treaty of Detroit" [...] and noted Reuther’s impressive negotiating <b>abilities.</b> <b>Ford</b> and Chrysler soon negotiated contracts along the same lines as the Treaty.|$|R
5000|$|It didn't take Bennett long to {{assemble}} a collection of football players, boxers, wrestlers and even Detroit river gang members as Service Department employees. Bennett possessed no car making skills at all. His success with the company came solely from his close relationship with Henry <b>Ford</b> and his <b>ability</b> to get things done. All Henry {{had to do was}} ask, [...] "Can you take care of that, Harry?" [...] and it was done.|$|R
5000|$|His first {{credited}} {{role was}} in Fords 3 Godfathers; {{the film is}} notable for the riding skills demonstrated by both Johnson and star Pedro Armendáriz. He later said the film was the most physically challenging of his career. Ford then suggested him for a starring role in the 1949 film Mighty Joe Young; he played [...] "Gregg" [...] opposite Terry Moore. Ford cast him {{in two of the}} three films that have {{come to be known as}} Fords cavalry trilogy, all starring John Wayne: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and Rio Grande (1950); both roles showcased Johnsons riding <b>ability.</b> <b>Ford</b> also cast Johnson as the lead in Wagon Master (1950), one of Fords favorites.|$|R
50|$|The public {{success of}} Pricing and Revenue Management at <b>Ford</b> {{solidified}} the <b>ability</b> {{of the discipline}} to address the revenue generation issues of virtually any company. Many auto manufacturers have adopted the practice for both vehicle sales and the sale of parts. Retailers have leveraged the concepts pioneered at Ford to create more dynamic, targeted pricing {{in the form of}} discounts and promotions to more accurately match supply with demand. Promotions planning and optimization assisted retailers with the timing and prediction of the incremental lift of a promotion for targeted products and customer sets. Companies have rapidly adopted price markdown optimization to maximize revenue from end-of-season or end-of-life items. Furthermore, strategies driving promotion roll-offs and discount expirations have allowed companies to increase revenue from newly acquired customers.|$|R
