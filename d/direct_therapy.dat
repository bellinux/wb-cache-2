50|$|Direct therapies {{address the}} {{physical}} aspects of vocal production. Techniques work to either modify vocal fold contact, manage breathing patterns, and/or change the tension at {{level of the}} larynx. Notable techniques include, {{but are not limited}} to, the yawn-sigh method, optimal pitch, laryngeal manipulation, humming, the accent method, and the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment. An example of a <b>direct</b> <b>therapy</b> is circumlaryngeal manual therapy, which has been used to reduce tension and massage hyoid-laryngeal muscles. This area is often tense from chronic elevation of the larynx. Pressure is applied to these areas as the patient hums or sustains a vowel. Traditional voice therapy is often used to treat muscular tension dysphonia.|$|E

50|$|Dysphonia can be {{categorized}} into two broad main types: organic and functional. The type of dysphonia {{is dependent on the}} cause of the pathology. While the causes of dysphonia can be divided into five basic categories, all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation, which affects the voice. The assessment and diagnosis of dysphonia is done by a multidisciplinary team, and involves the use of a variety of subjective and objective measures, which look at both the quality of the voice as well as the physical state of the larynx. Multiple treatments have been developed to address organic and functional causes of dysphonia. Dysphonia can be targeted through <b>direct</b> <b>therapy,</b> indirect therapy, medical treatments, and surgery. Functional dysphonias may be treated through direct and indirect voice therapies, whereas surgeries are recommended for chronic, organic dysphonias.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{parents of}} four third-grade {{stuttering}} children (A, B, C and D) {{participated in a}} 20 -hour group for parent education. Afterwards parent groups, C, D, E and F participated in a 15 -hour <b>direct</b> <b>therapy</b> group for stuttering. E and F were in the 2 nd and 1 st grade, respectively. All {{of the children were}} male; their disfluencies, measured by SLDs/ 100 syllables were assessed at the beginning, end and 1 -month follow-up of the parent group, and then of the <b>direct</b> <b>therapy,</b> individually. This study made comparisons regarding the efficacy of both parent education and <b>direct</b> <b>therapy</b> on the Mandarin-speaking children with stuttering. For the parent group, in terms of disfluency, 3 (75 %) stuttering children showed obvious improvements at the end; 1 (25 %) did not. At the follow-up, 2 (50 %) maintained their gains and 2 (50 %) regressed. For the <b>direct</b> <b>therapy,</b> 2 (50 %) stuttering children decreased their disfluencies at the end obviously and 1 (25 %) slightly; 1 (25 %) did not. At the follow-up, 3 (75 %) maintained their gains; 1 (25 %) regressed. For the individual children, although A did not receive <b>direct</b> <b>therapy,</b> parental influence on disfluency reduction still occurred after 9 months. However, the same effect was not for B. E and F had obvious improvements in their speech performances until the follow-up after having <b>direct</b> <b>therapy.</b> Both C and D had 2 interventions but with unstable improvements. In summary, comparing to the disfluencies at the first assessment, 75 % suttering children apparently decreased their disfluencies {{at the end of the}} parent group; 50 % maintained their gains until the one-month follow-up; 75 % decreased their disfluencies until the follow-up of the <b>direct</b> <b>therapy.</b> Various effects occurred in different interventions for the school-age stuttering children who speak Mandarin because environmental factors may have impacts on children's disfluencies, such as parent-child relationship and academic stress...|$|E

40|$|Background : Metastatic renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) to the liver portrays a poor prognosis and liver <b>directed</b> <b>therapy</b> remains controversial. We aimed to determine potential selection criteria for patients who might benefit from this strategy. Materials and Methods : We evaluated 247 consecutive patients with RCC metastatic to the liver from a prospectively maintained database. Results : Eighteen patients received liver <b>directed</b> <b>therapy</b> (18 / 247, 7 %). Ten patients underwent liver resection (10 / 247, 4 %) and eight patients underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA, 8 / 247, 3 %). All were rendered free of disease in the liver. Five had synchronous liver disease and underwent synchronous resections with their primary. Mortality was 0 %. Fourteen had single (surgery 7, RFA 7) and four (surgery 3, RFA 1) had multiple liver lesions, respectively. Median size of lesions was 5 cm (0. 5 - 10 cm) and 2. 5 cm (1 - 6 cm) in the surgery and RFA groups, respectively. Median DFI was 10 months, and no difference was observed in those with a longer vs. shorter than median DFI (p = 0. 95); liver specific progression free survival for the surgery and RFA groups were 4 and 6 months, respectively (p= 0. 93). 1, 3 and 5 -year actuarial survivals for the whole group were 89 %, 40 %, 27 %. Median survival for the surgery group was 24 (3 to 254 +) months, and for the RFA group 15. 6 (7 - 56 +) months (p = 0. 56).

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, there is {{increasing}} evidence that the small airways, i. e. airways < 2 mm in internal diameter, contribute significantly to the pathophysiology and clinical expression of asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The increased interest in small airways is, at least in part, a result of innovation in small-particle aerosol formulations that better target the distal lung and also advanced physiological methods of assessing small airway responses. Increasing the precision of drug deposition may improve targeting of specific diseases or receptor locations, decrease airway drug exposure and side effects, and thereby increase the efficiency and effectiveness of inhaled drug delivery. The availability of small-particle aerosols of corticosteroid, bronchodilator or their combination, enables a higher total lung deposition, better peripheral lung penetration, and provides added clinical benefit, compared to large-particle aerosol treatment. However, a number of questions remain unanswered on the pragmatic approach relevant in order for clinicians to consider the role of small airways <b>directed</b> <b>therapy</b> in the day-to-day management of their patients with asthma and COPD.

The length of ICU stay, total length of stay and the mortality on 28 days of following up were recorded. Results 　Of the 53 enrolled patients, 27 were assigned to the nitroglycerin group and 26 to the control group. There was no significant increase in TVDs at the points of 24 h and 72 h of treatment in the both groups. However, compared to that at the beginning of fluid resuscitation, the indexes of PVDs, PPVs, MFI and De Backer score increased at the 6, 24 and 72 hour points; and the data were also higher at the 24 and 72 hour points than at the 6 hour point; moreover, the nitroglycerin group showed significant increase at the 72 hour point compared with control group. Simultaneously, the reduced mechanical ventilation (MV) time (P< 0. 05), the shorter ICU stay (P< 0. 05) and total hospital stay (P< 0. 05), the decreased in-hospital mortality (P< 0. 05) and 28 -day mortality (P< 0. 05) were in nitroglycerin group than in control group. Conclusion 　Nitroglycerin can significantly improve the microcirculation in patients with septic shock after early goal <b>directed</b> <b>therapy,</b> decrease the mechanical ventilation time, shorten the ICU days and the length of hospital stay, and reduce the mortality.

MethodsThis prospective randomised pilot study included patients over the age of 50 undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. In the intervention group pulse pressure variation measurements were used to guide fluid boluses of 6 % Hydroxyethylstarch 130 / 0. 4. The control group received standard care. Serum urea, creatinine and cystatin C levels were measured prior to and at the end of surgery and postoperatively on day 1, day 3 and day 5. ResultsThirty patients were recruited. One patient died prior to surgery and was excluded from the analysis. The intervention group received a median of 750 ml of hydroxyethylstarch. The peak values of postoperative urea were 6. 9 (2. 7 – 31. 8) vs. 6. 4 (3. 5 – 11. 5) mmol/l (p= 0. 425), creatinine 100 (60 – 300) vs. 85 (65 – 150) μmol/l (p= 0. 085) and cystatin C 1. 09 (0. 66 – 4. 94) vs. 1. 01 (0. 33 – 2. 29) mg/dl (p= 0. 352) in the control and intervention group, respectively.
