40|$|It is {{well known}} that most {{rational}} life-cycle models predict much larger annuitization levels than those observed empirically. We examine the relative importance of three leading explanations for low annuity demand: <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk, incomplete annuity menus, and bequest motives. We find that high <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk can potentially explain very low annuity demand, while incomplete annuity menus and realistic bequest motives cannot. We find that the timing of the <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk is important. If out-of-pocket medical expenses can already be sizeable early in retirement, empirically observed low annuitization levels are optimal. In case <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk early in retirement is low, individuals can better save out of their annuity income to build a buffer for <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> shocks at later ages. Empirical evidence shows that in the US for many individuals <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk is indeed substantial early in retirement. Incomplete annuity markets do not reduce predicted annuity levels to the empirical levels, as agents are better of buying nominal annuities, save out of this income, and invest that in equity.

The {{objective of the}} study was to compare Holstein cows selected for large versus small body size for <b>health</b> care <b>cost.</b> All <b>health</b> treatments were recorded for cows from 1983 to 2005, and treatments were assigned to one of 11 categories of <b>health</b> disorders. Actual <b>cost</b> for veterinary treatments, health supplies, and drugs, as well as the value of labor required by animal attendants, was recorded. Data were for 1, 035 lactations of 486 cows, of which 199 cows were from the large line and 287 cows were from the small line. Large-line cows had significantly greater total <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> than small-line cows during first lactation and tended to have greater total <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> for the first 3 lactations of cows. During first lactation, large-line cows had total <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> of $ 62. 41, and small-line cows had total <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> of $ 41. 41. Cows in the large line had significantly greater <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> for the individual categories of displaced abomasum and pneumonia than small-line cows during first lactation. Across the first 3 lactations, large-line cows had a total <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> per lactation of $ 54. 15 and small-line cows had a total cost of $ 38. 09. Cows in the large line had significantly greater <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> for the categories of locomotion and displaced abomasum across the first 3 lactations than small-line cows.

If medical {{expenses}} can be sizeable early in retirement, full annuitisation at retirement {{is no longer}} optimal because agents {{do not have enough}} time to build a liquid wealth buffer. Furthermore, large deviations from optimal annuitisation levels lead to small utility differences.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk on optimal annuity demand and consumption/savings decisions. Many retirees are exposed to {{sizeable}} out-of-pocket medical expenses, while annuities potentially impair {{the ability to get}} liquidity to cover these costs and smooth consumption. We find that if out-of-pocket medical expenses can already be sizeable early in retirement, full annuitization is not optimal. In the other case of low <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk early in retirement, individuals should take advantage of the mortality credit that annuities provide and save out of the annuity income to build a buffer for <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> shocks at later ages. When comparing to empirically observed levels of annuitization, we find that high <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk early in retirement may resolve the annuity puzzle. Moreover, we explain the observed pattern of annuitization as a function of initial wealth at retirement. For personal financial planning purposes, we develop a simple rule of thumb for annuity demand, based on expected <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> risk early in retirement, wealth at retirement, and minimum consumption levels. We show that the welfare costs from using the rule compared to the full life cycle model are small. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Farm {{workers and}} female cotton pickers {{are exposed to}} {{residual}} impacts of pesticide use in cotton production, in addition to dust, ultraviolet radiation, etc. Cotton picking causes various health hazards among cotton pickers with varied <b>health</b> <b>cost.</b> A soil bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is incorporated in cotton seed through genetic modification and it has resistance against certain bollworms of cotton. So it is considered that Bt cotton fields have less pesticide exposure compared to non-Bt cotton fields. This {{study was designed to}} examine and compare the impacts and <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> of cotton picking among female cotton pickers working in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields. Methods The study used the data collected from Vehari district of Pakistani Punjab. Health hazards and associated <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> of the respondents involved in Bt cotton picking were compared with those who harvested non-Bt cotton. Comparative use of the personal protective measures among those respondents was also examined. <b>Health</b> <b>cost</b> function and its determinants were analyzed using ordinary least square method. Results Findings of the study showed that 61  % cotton pickers from Bt cotton households reported one or more health effects of pesticide during picking season whereas this percentage for non-Bt cotton households was 66  %. Health impacts included skin problems, headache, cough, flu/fever, eye irritation and sleeplessness, however, percentage of these health impacts was comparatively higher among non-Bt cotton households. <b>Health</b> <b>cost</b> from exposure to pesticide use in cotton was US$ 5. 74 and 2. 91 per season for non-Bt cotton and Bt cotton households, respectively. Education, picking in Bt cotton fields and preventive measures were significantly related with <b>health</b> <b>cost.</b> Conclusion Cotton pickers working in Bt cotton fields are found to have less occupational health hazards compared to those working in non-Bt cotton fields. Thus generating awareness among cotton pickers for adopting precautionary measures during harvesting and the use of Bt cotton seed can result in a decline in the ill-effects of cotton picking...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recent {{estimates}} {{suggest that}} obesity accounts for 5. 7 % of US total direct <b>health</b> care <b>costs,</b> but these estimates have not {{accounted for the}} increased death rate among obese people. This article examines whether the estimated direct <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> attributable to obesity are offset by the increased mortality rate among obese individuals. METHODS: Data on death rates, relative risks of death with obesity, and <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> at different ages were used to estimate direct <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> of obesity from 20 to 85 years of age with and without accounting for increased death rates associated with obesity. Sensitivity analyses used different values of relative risk of death, given obesity, and allowed the relative costs due to obesity per unit of time to vary with age. RESULTS: Direct <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> from 20 to 85 years of age were estimated to be approximately 25 % lower when differential mortality was taken into account. Sensitivity analyses suggested that direct <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> of obesity are unlikely to exceed 4. 32 % or to be lower than 0. 89 %.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the external <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> due to emissions from different {{sources in the}} Stockholm area using the Impact pathway approach. The estimated health impact {{is the result of}} detailed dispersion modelling with high spatial resolution. We make separate calculations for the impact that occur within the Stockholm area, the surrounding region and the rest of Europe. The pollutants considered are combustion and secondary particulate matter (PM) from the burning of fuels and also road wear (non-exhaust PM) that makes a large contribution to measured concentrations of PM locally in Stockholm. We also investigate the influence of assumptions made regarding the exposure-response functions used in these calculations since PM of different origin are expected to have different health impacts. According to the results road traffic makes important contributions to the external <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> both on a local and a regional scale compared to other sources. This is in part due to emissions being released in close proximity to where people live but also because of the amount of pollutants emitted. Although non-exhaust PM makes a large contribution to local population exposure within Stockholm the external <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> is relatively small which is due to other health impact being relevant for this emission source. Residential heating also makes an important contribution to exposure and external <b>health</b> <b>cost</b> on a local scale while power plants have a large influence regionally.

40|$|Rising <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> {{threaten}} {{many older}} Americans’ financial security, perhaps leading people to delay retirement. For workers receiving health benefits from their employers, continued work {{reduces the risk}} of high out-of-pocket <b>health</b> care <b>costs.</b> Working longer also increases retirement incomes, making <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> more affordable. This paper examines the impact of expected future out-of-pocket medical spending on retirement decisions. The results show that the premium costs associated with retirement before age 65 and expected out-of-pocket <b>health</b> care <b>costs</b> after 65 substantially delay retirement. A $ 1, 000 -increase in the own premium cost of retirement before age 65 lowers the likelihood that both men and women retire by about 0. 1 percentage points, implying an elasticity of about – 0. 058 for both groups.
