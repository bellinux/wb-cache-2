The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band’s history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: [...] "oh, I was guilty [...] What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked." [...] Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.|$|E

While not fully atmospheric, the Indiana Theatre's original lighting system gave a blue hue to the auditorium ceiling and scattered light to simulate stars. The tile and terrazzo flooring, shapes of windows, prominence of Spanish coats of arms, Churrigueresque exterior, as well as numerous plaster designs that were seen first in the Indiana Theatre became a framework for later designs.

5000|$|The Indiana Theatre is a {{historic}} theater in Terre Haute, Indiana.

The theatre was built by Terre Haute resident T. W. Barhydt and was designed by John Eberson. Eberson, who later developed the atmospheric theater style of movie palace, first experimented with atmospheric design elements at the theatre.

50|$|Another {{class of}} {{exceptions}} is verbs with the conditional endings -by, -bym, -byśmy, etc. These endings are not counted {{in determining the}} position of the stress; for example, zrobiłbym (<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do)</b> <b>is</b> stressed on the first syllable, and zrobilibyśmy (we would do) on the second. According to prescriptive grammars, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings -śmy, -ście, although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so zrobiliśmy we did is said to be correctly stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third). These irregular stress patterns are {{explained by the fact that}} these endings are detachable clitics rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of kogo zobaczyliście? (whom did you see?) it is possible to say kogoście zobaczyli? - here kogo retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns.|$|E

3000|$|Some {{administrators and}} clinicians {{discussed}} ways to treat group traits as targets for clinical intervention. One administrator explained the medicalization of cultural {{knowledge in the}} hospital: “Cultural competence means the ability to understand [the] different cultures of people. In nursing, we have meetings on different cultures. Staff talk about, ‘That’s {{what you do with}} Chinese. With Koreans you do this.’ Things like that so that we can learn. In our orientation time, we have a little talk about culture.” Another administrator explained interventions by group: “Hispanic people have kind of personality types or needs that needs to be met. For example, they want to feel like when they come to see anybody, it feels like family. It feels like they can trust.” Three clinicians also defined cultural competence through group traits related to clinical practice. For one clinician, traits informed communication: “I had this patient who was from the Asian culture. He had a lot of problem with eye contact. What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> that I would not make that much eye contact with that particular patient until he became more comfortable.” For another clinician, traits determined family involvement: “Most of the Asian cultures have nuclear families. They want the family to be included. Mothers and fathers, you need to speak to them first.” For the third clinician, traits influenced treatment: “In the African-American community, it’s a shame to have a mental illness. The best kind of treatment for an African American is called brief therapy. Make it quick, give them their medication. They don’t want to try and go all into the dynamics of the disease or the biopsychosocial aspects of it.” [...]...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{commercial}} applications of artificial intelligence (AI) is in the rapidly expanding computer game industry. Virtually every game that is sold today has some sort of AI, {{whether it is the}} &quot;computer player &quot; in a chess game, the opposing paddle in a one-player version of Pong, or the machinegun-toting enemies in a first-person shooter. Any virtual being that does not behave in a strictly pre-scripted manner has some sort of AI behind it. Sadly, the multi-billion dollar gaming industry has done very little to advance the field of AI. New games may sport stunning 3 D graphics, but a realistic-looking enemy is not worth much if he is a moron – and not even a realistic moron at that. The industry has moved past the day when an AI opponent would not even react to the death of his teammate standing three feet away, {{but that does not mean}} these bots, as they are commonly called, have any serious thought processes. Most are completely reactive, and while they may often appear to behave sensibly, they still require three-to-one odds to beat a human player despite having perfect aim. The AI in these games often seems like an afterthought, with game designers unwilling to spend the time to implement more complex AI, much less waste the user’s precious processing power being spent on rendering the 3 D graphics. My proposal was to take an existing first-person shooter and expand the capabilities of its AI. All of the “hard work, ” namely the graphics, physics and gameplay system, would be done for us and all <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> focus on the AI and try to improve the thinking ability of the bots within the current system by implementing fairly orthodox planning algorithms. Some of the most basic planning algorithms have only recently been implemented in these types of games, and so it should be fairly simple to improve the existing AI by taking the planning algorithms to the next level of complexity. But before discussing how to do this, I will go back to the “square one ” of bot design and discuss the issues in first-person shooters that every bot since “Doom” has had to deal with. State of the Art: 1992 All first-person shooters (FPS) are 3 D games, meaning the human player is shown a first-person view of a 3 D environment that he or she can move about in, using the images on th...|$|E
