These included mathematical jokes— such as [...] "Loew's -plex" [...] (aleph-null-plex) movie theater,— as well as various forms of science humor— for example, Professor Farnsworth, at a racetrack, complains about the use of a quantum finish to decide the winner, exclaiming [...] "No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it", a reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In the season six episode [...] "Law and Oracle", Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th-century quantum physicist. On the <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies [...] "A cat, some poison, and a cesium atom". Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrödinger answers [...] "It's a superposition of both states until you open the box and collapse the wave function." [...] When Fry opens the box, the cat jumps out and attacks him. The run is a reference to the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics. The series makes passing references to quantum chromodynamics (the appearance of Strong Force-brand glue), computer science (two separate books in a closet labeled P and NP respectively, referring to the possibility that P and NP-complete problem classes are distinct), electronics (an X-ray— or more accurately, an [...] "F-ray"— of Bender's head reveals a 6502 microprocessor), and genetics (a mention of Bender's [...] "robo- or R-NA").

The {{aim of this study}} is to get an insight into the reliability of the AMA method in comparison with the IMA method. Both methods were used in 1990 to observe the safety belt use on <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars. These methods were applied simultaneously at 8 locations within and outside built-up areas in the Netherlands. The AMA observer noted: (1) the seat belt use by and sex of both drivers and <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> passengers <b>of</b> cars, as many as possible, while these were waiting at traffic lights; and (2) the first four characters of the cars' licence number. The AMA allows more observations than the IMA method, as the cars waited at traffic lights. The overall results of both methods show that the AMA method appears to be appropriate to carry out overall measurements <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belt use on the <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars, and possibly of the occupants' sex. However, more certainty is required about the AMA's reliability for a number of specific conditions, for instance, certain road types within built-up areas.
