5|$|Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential {{election}}. While {{the election}} was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet. According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace <b>George</b> <b>Tenet</b> {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E

Details on how the non-pilot ("muscle") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director <b>George</b> <b>Tenet</b> later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Ahmad Shah Massoud {{had been}} the only {{resistance}} leader able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani military and was sheltering hundreds of thousands of refugees which had fled the Taliban on the territory under his control. He had been seen as the leader most likely to lead post-Taliban Afghanistan. After his assassination, Abdul Haq was seen as one of the main contenders for that position. He had private American backers which had facilitated his re-entry into Afghanistan after 9/11. But journalists reported about tensions between the CIA and Haq.

25|$|During {{their time}} in government, both Fischer and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder were widely {{considered}} sincerely, if not uncritically, pro-Israeli.

By 2001, he emerged as a pivotal figure in the hopes for the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, in part because he helped bring about a lull in the violence after the Dolphinarium discotheque massacre in June 2001. His intervention led to an announced cease-fire arranged by <b>George</b> <b>Tenet,</b> the United States Director of Central Intelligence; Fischer had been in Tel Aviv at the time of the blast. Fischer later brokered a meeting between Arafat and the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to discuss how to implement the cease-fire.|$|E

500|$|The {{first weeks}} of {{deliberations}} and testimonies gleaned little new {{information on the}} threat being investigated, so in mid-February, with their mandate supposedly giving them access to all necessary information from the executive branch, the commission complained in person to then DCI <b>George</b> <b>Tenet.</b> [...] From that point on, the commission gained much greater access to the information and personnel of the US intelligence community.|$|E
500|$|The {{findings}} of the commission generated mixed reactions among lawmakers, intelligence officers, and experts. [...] The intelligence community was privately angered by the harsh language the report used to describe their own assessments of the threat, although CIA Director <b>George</b> <b>Tenet</b> did not openly criticize it in public. [...] Congressional proponents of a national missile shield, especially Republicans, used the findings to further push their case that such a shield was necessary. However, some experts {{in and out of}} government questioned the usefulness of the report, saying that it made general speculations without reaching any definite conclusions. [...] Whereas the intelligence estimate focused on what was actually occurring, the commission focused on what might occur.

500|$|National Security Advisor Sandy Berger called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 {{to notify}} {{him of the}} bombings. That day, Clinton started meeting with his [...] "Small Group" [...] of {{national}} security advisers, which included Berger, CIA director <b>George</b> <b>Tenet,</b> Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton. The group's objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E

[...] He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the Defense Department to go to [...] "Threat Condition Delta." [...] Clarke would later write that [...] "Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States... in [...] FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States...

The embassy was located at this mistaken target, and three Chinese journalists were killed. Clark's intelligence officer called Clark taking full responsibility and offering to resign, but Clark declined, saying {{it was not the}} officer's fault. Secretary Cohen and CIA Director <b>George</b> <b>Tenet</b> took responsibility the next day. Tenet would later explain in testimony before the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on July 22, 1999, that the targeting system used street addresses, which gave inaccurate positions for air bombings. He also said that the various databases of off-limit targets did not have the up-to-date address for the relatively new embassy location.|$|E
5000|$|Yitzhak Rabin was {{the first}} Israeli prime {{minister}} to intervene on Pollard's behalf; in 1995, he petitioned President Bill Clinton for a pardon. Other requests followed. At a critical juncture in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations at the Wye River Conference in 1998, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to make the outcome contingent on Pollard's release. [...] "If we {{signed an agreement with}} Arafat, I expected a pardon for Pollard", he wrote. Clinton later confirmed in his memoir that he tentatively agreed to the condition, [...] "...but I would have to check with our people". When that information was made public, the American intelligence community responded immediately, with unequivocal anger. Seven former Secretaries of Defense—Donald Rumsfeld, Melvin R. Laird, Frank C. Carlucci, Richard B. Cheney, Caspar W. Weinberger, James R. Schlesinger and Elliot L. Richardson—along with several senior Congressional leaders, publicly voiced their vigorous opposition to any form of clemency. Central Intelligence Agency director <b>George</b> J. <b>Tenet</b> initially denied reports that he had threatened to resign if Pollard were to be released, but eventually confirmed that he had. Other Clinton advisors, including Madeleine Albright and Sandy Berger, were [...] "adamantly opposed" [...] to clemency as well. Clinton, who had not expected such forceful opposition, told Netanyahu that Pollard’s release could not be a condition of the agreement, and ordered a formal review of Pollard's case. Dennis Ross confirmed Clinton's version of events in his book The Missing Peace.|$|R

This border area is an unforgiving landscape, where the enemy can hide at close range while remaining invisible.

As U.S. Army Colonel Rodney Davis puts it, [...] "Shkin is the evilest place in Afghanistan." [...] The fire base has seen a great deal of enemy contact and the units that have served there have taken more casualties from enemy fire than any other location.
