But one day, when she goes to leave, the friend refuses to allow her and locks every exit in the castle they are abiding in. Bloo, Mac, Coco, Eduardo, and Wilt become curious with her sudden disappearance. They {{go up to the}} attic and enter the toy box, {{discovering}} for themselves the vast world that resides in it. They ask around a small town if anyone has seen a woman of Frankie's description but nobody responds. A group of weeble policemen discover they have entered {{the world and}} chase after them, but the gang are saved by a heroic man. He tries to warn them that their pursuit of Frankie will lead through extremely dangerous environments, but they are determined to rescue her. Mr. Herriman, in the meantime, is outraged by Frankie's disappearance and attempts to find a replacement for her, but to no avail.|$|E

25|$|The Washington Avenue Bridge carries County Road 122 and the METRO Green Line {{light rail}} across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota and connects the East Bank and West Bank {{portions}} of the University of Minnesota's main campus. The bridge has two decks, with the lower deck designated for motor vehicle traffic and light rail trains and the upper deck used for pedestrians and bicycles (lanes specifically for bikes are on the north side). It is a utilitarian structure with simple architecture, but it has cultural significance because thousands of students, faculty, staff, and visitors walk across <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man {{can be a good}} citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E

[...] Chris Carter from Destructoid wrote, [...] "I don't want to play <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> forever and ever, but it's definitely worth the time I invested in it."

But in a way, it's a challenge. It's invigorating. There isn't any point in not being a player – you're here.... It's not only the money. It's the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I'm not sure I'd have a big problem with that. On the other hand I'm not sure I wouldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season Vlasic, now a fifth-year senior, {{became the}} starter, as Long graduated. Although {{he was taking}} over for the Heisman Trophy runner-up, his strong arm was complimented, albeit backhandedly, by coach Hayden Fry, who said, [...] "He's got a stronger arm than Long, and he proves <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> by overthrowing his receivers." [...] In Vlasic's first game as starter, he threw for 288 yards in a 43-7 win against Iowa State University, a game that made Hayden Fry the most victorious coach in Iowa football history. After two more victories, Vlasic went down with a separated shoulder, returning to the lineup after freshmen Dan McGwire and Tom Poholsky took over the starting role.|$|E

I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow.

500|$|Sayers' {{ability as}} a runner in the open field was {{considered}} unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. Although he possessed modest raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds—he was highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to [...] "ballet" [...] and [...] "poetry". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him [...] "the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest." [...] Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> in practice. We played live, and you could never get a clean shot on Gale. Never.|$|E
500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... and I must say that I miss <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different." ...|$|E

500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for <b>it.</b> <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Watts's {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} the image of Hope had near-miraculous redemptive powers. In his 1908 work Sermons in Art by the Great Masters, Stoke Newington Presbyterian minister James Burns wrote of a woman who had been walking to the Thames with the intention of suicide, but had passed the image of Hope in a shop window and been so inspired by the sight of it that rather than attempting suicide she instead emigrated to Australia. In 1918 Watts's biographer Henry William Shrewsbury wrote of [...] "a poor girl, character-broken and heart-broken, wandering about the streets of London with a growing feeling that nothing remained but to destroy herself" [...] seeing a photograph of Hope, using the last of her money to buy the photograph, until [...] "looking at <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> the message sank into her soul, and she fought her way back to a life of purity and honour". When music hall star Marie Lloyd died in 1922 after a life beset with alcohol, illness and depression, it was noted that among her possessions was a print of Hope; one reporter observed that among her other possessions, it looked [...] "like a good deed in a naughty world".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal {{range in the}} song span from the note of Eb3 to Cb5. Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises a strong man. 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just takes my breath away, b-b-b-breath away / I feel <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips, our energy connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E

500|$|The caloric {{content and}} {{structure}} of medieval diet varied over time, from region to region, and between classes. However, for most people, the diet tended to be high-carbohydrate, {{with most of the}} budget spent on, and the majority of calories provided by, cereals and alcohol (such as beer). Even though meat was highly valued by all, lower classes often could not afford it, nor were they allowed by the church to consume <b>it</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> In England in the 13th century, meat contributed a negligible portion of calories to a typical harvest worker's diet; however, its share increased after the Black Death and, by the 15th century, it provided about 20% of the total. Even among the lay nobility of medieval England, grain provided 65–70% of calories in the early 14th century, though a generous provision of meat and fish was included, and their consumption of meat increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Black Death as well. In one early 15th-century English aristocratic household for which detailed records are available [...] (that of the Earl of Warwick), gentle members of the household received a staggering [...] of assorted meats in a typical meat meal in the autumn and [...] in the winter, in addition to [...] of bread and [...] of beer or possibly wine (and there would have been two meat meals per day, five days a week, except during Lent). In the household of Henry Stafford in 1469, gentle members received [...] of meat per meal, and all others received , and everyone was given [...] of bread and [...] of alcohol. On top of these quantities, some members of these households (usually, a minority) ate breakfast, which would not include any meat, but would probably include another [...] of beer; and uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals. The diet of the lord of the household differed somewhat from this structure, including less red meat, more high-quality wild game, fresh fish, fruit, and wine.|$|E
