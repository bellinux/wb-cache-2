To date, there are few direct comparisons of these methods on real sequence data.

We compare four recently proposed rare variant methods (combined multivariate and collapsing, weighted sum, proportion regression, and cumulative minor allele test) on simulated phenotype and next-generation sequencing data as part of Genetic Analysis Workshop 17. Overall, we find that all analyzed methods have serious practical limitations on identifying causal genes. Specifically, no method has more than a 5 % true discovery rate (percentage of truly causal genes among all those identified as significantly associated with the phenotype). Further exploration shows that all methods suffer from inflated false-positive error rates (chance that a noncausal gene will be identified as associated with the phenotype) because of population stratification and <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> between noncausal SNPs and causal SNPs. Furthermore, observed true-positive rates (chance that a truly causal gene will be identified as significantly associated with the phenotype) {{for each of the four}} methods was very low (< 19 %). The combination of larger than anticipated false-positive rates, low true-positive rates, and only about 1 % of all genes being causal yields poor discriminatory ability for all four methods. <b>Gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> and population stratification are important areas for further research in the analysis of rare variant data. </p...|$|E

The population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, Canada, {{is among the}} more intensively studied wild animal populations. Its long-term pedigree data, together with extensive genetic sampling, have allowed the study {{of a range of}} questions in evolutionary biology and ecology. However, the availability of genetic markers has been limited. We here describe 191 new microsatellite loci, including 160 high-quality polymorphic autosomal, 7 Z-linked and 1 W-linked markers. We used these markers to construct a linkage map for song sparrows with a total sex-averaged map length of 1731 cM and covering 35 linkage groups, and hence, these markers cover most of the 38 – 40 chromosomes. Female and male map lengths did not differ significantly. We then bioinformatically mapped these loci to the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome and found that linkage groups were conserved between song sparrows and zebra finches. Compared to the zebra finch, marker order within small linkage groups was well conserved, whereas the larger linkage groups showed some intrachromosomal rearrangements. Finally, we show that as expected, recombination frequency between linked loci explained the majority of variation in <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>disequilibrium.</b> Yet, there was substantial overlap in <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> between pairs of linked and unlinked loci.

Deterministic models with and without <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> between the major gene and other genes that affect the trait (polygenes) were considered. Genetic variance due to polygenes was assumed constant. Optimal control theory was used {{to formulate}} selection on an index of major gene effects and estimates of polygenic breeding values and to derive index weights that maximize cumulative response over multiple generations. Optimum selection strategies were illustrated using an example and compared with mass selection and with selection with full emphasis on the major gene (genotypic selection). The latter maximizes the single-generation response for a major gene with additive effects. For the example considered, differences between selection methods in cumulative response {{at the end of}} a planning horizon of 5, 10, or 15 generations were small but responses were greatest for optimum selection. Genotypic selection had the greatest response in the short term but the lowest response in the longer term. For optimum selection, emphasis on the major gene changed over generations. However, when accounting for variance contributed by the major gene, optimum selection resulted in approximately constant selection pressure on the major gene and polygenes over generations. Suboptimality of genotypic selection in the longer term was caused not so much by <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> but rather by unequal selection pressure on the major gene (and, therefore, on polygenes) over generations, as frequency and variance at the major gene changed.

Recently, association mapping has been exploited to dissect quantitative trait loci (QTL). With the exception of maize and Arabidopsis, little research has been conducted on LD in plants.

40|$|Abstract The authors present ELB, an easy to {{programme}} and computationally fast algorithm for inferring <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> in population samples of multilocus genotypes. Phase updates {{are made on}} the basis of a window of neighbouring loci, and the window size varies according to the local level of linkage disequilibrium. Thus, ELB is particularly well suited to problems involving many loci and/or relatively large genomic regions, including those with variable recombination rate. The authors have simulated population samples of single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes with varying levels of recombination and marker density, and find that ELB provides better local estimation of <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> than the PHASE or HTYPER programs, while its global accuracy is broadly similar. The relative improvement in local accuracy increases both with increasing recombination and with increasing marker density. Short tandem repeat (STR, or microsatellite) simulation studies demonstrate ELB's superiority over PHASE both globally and locally. Missing data are handled by ELB; simulations show that phase recovery is virtually unaffected by up to 2 per cent of missing data, but that phase estimation is noticeably impaired beyond this amount. The authors also applied ELB to datasets obtained from random pairings of 42 human X chromosomes typed at 97 diallelic markers in a 200 kb low-recombination region. Once again, they found ELB to have consistently better local accuracy than PHASE or HTYPER, while its global accuracy was close to the best. </p...|$|R

Empirical equations have been proposed that reliably relate single-phase compositions of amphibole with the temperature (T) and pressure (P) conditions of crystallization and the SiO 2 content of coexisting silicate melt (SiO_ 2 ^melt) (Ridolfi et al. 2010; Ridolfi and Renzulli 2012; Putirka 2016). By using empirical equations, the T, P, and SiO_ 2 ^melt related to amphibole crystallization can be estimated without assuming equilibrium between phases. In addition, the empirical equations enable recognition of disequilibrium between amphibole and other phases (Putirka 2016). Geothermobarometric methods based on multiple phases require a priori assumptions of equilibria between coexisting <b>phases.</b> Although <b>disequilibrium</b> between coexisting <b>phases</b> causes large errors in thermobarometric results, it is not easy to evaluate equilibrium/disequilibrium between coexisting phases.

Two main causes emerged: population stratification and long-range correlation (<b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> <b>disequilibrium)</b> between rare variants. Population stratification was expected because of the diverse sample. Correlation between rare variants was attributable to both random causes (e. g., nearly 10, 000 of 25, 000 markers were private variants, and the sample size was small [n = 697]) and nonrandom causes (more correlation was observed than was expected by random chance). Principal components analysis was used to control for population structure and helped to minimize type I errors, but this was at the expense of identifying fewer causal variants. A novel multiple regression approach showed promise to handle correlation between markers.

40|$|Each {{independently}} evolving {{segment of}} the genomes of a sexually reproducing organism has a separate history reflecting part of the evolutionary history of that organism. Uniparentally or clonally inherited DNA segments such as the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes and the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome have provided, to date, most of the known data regarding compound haplotypic variation within and among populations. These comparatively small segments include numerous polymorphic sites and undergo little or no recombination. Recombining autosomes, however, comprise the major repository of genetic variation. Technical challenges and recombination have limited large-scale application of autosomal haplotypes. We have overcome this barrier through development of a general approach to the assessment of short autosomal DNA segments. Each such segment includes one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and exactly one short tandem repeat (STR) locus. With dramatically different mutation rates, {{these two types of}} genetic markers provide complementary evolutionary information. We call the combination of a SNP and a STR polymorphism a SNPSTR, and have developed a simple, rapid method for empirically determining <b>gametic</b> <b>phase</b> for double and triple heterozygotes. Here, we illustrate the approach with two SNPSTR systems. Although even one system provides insight into population history, the power of the approach lies in combining results from multiple SNPSTR systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{improvement}} includes genetic bottlenecks, wild species introgressions, and divergence into distinct market classes. This history makes tomato an excellent model {{to investigate the}} effects of selection on genome variation. A combination of linkage mapping in two F 2 populations and physical mapping with emerging genome sequence data was used to position 434 PCR-based markers including SNPs. Three-hundred-and-forty markers were used to genotype 102 tomato lines representing wild species, landraces, vintage cultivars, and contemporary (fresh market and processing) varieties. Principal component analysis confirmed genetic divergence between market classes of cultivated tomato (P < 0. 0001). A genome-wide survey indicated that linkage disequilibrium (LD) decays over 6 – 8 cM when all cultivated tomatoes, including vintage and contemporary, were considered together. Within contemporary processing varieties, LD decayed over 6 – 14 cM, and decay was over 3 – 16 cM within fresh market varieties. Significant inter-chromosomal (<b>gametic</b> <b>phase)</b> LD was detected in both fresh market and processing varieties between chromosomes 2 and 3, and 2 and 4, but in distinct chromosomal locations for each market class. Additional LD was detected between chromosomes 3 and 4, 3 and 11, and 4 and 6 in fresh market varieties and chromosomes 3 and 12 in processing varieties. These results suggest that breeding practices for market specialization in tomato {{have led to a}} genetic divergence between fresh market and processing types...|$|R
