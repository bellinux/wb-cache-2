5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>that,</b> repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E

500|$|The {{music on}} Escape, in {{particular}} [...] "Five Minutes of Funk", was {{originally intended to}} be rock-oriented, with Hutchins suggesting that the song {{would be similar to}} the [...] "rawer" [...] work of groups such as The Isley Brothers. Whodini had planned to use a Minimoog synthesizer on the track, although Smith left his at home, assuming that he could find one in the UK. Unable to locate one, the group then heard Run–D.M.C.'s [...] "Rock Box" [...] and decided to follow a more R direction. Smith said that although he was told by Jive Records to make the album sound like Run–D.M.C., he [...] "didn't want to <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>that.</b> Whodini's a bit more adult, I think, and rap's not just for kids anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Northern Force {{made up the}} {{northern}} prong of a pincer movement designed by Botha to encircle the German forces in South-West Africa. Two smaller South African columns came from the Cape and the Orange Free State (the latter coming over the deserts of Bechuanaland). The principal target was Windhoek, the capital of South-West Africa. The field of operations was arid and barren in the extreme; water was a precious commodity, so the South Africans and Southern Rhodesians brought {{thousands of tons of}} it with them. In the [...] of desert between Walvis Bay and Windhoek, temperatures could rise to above [...] in the daytime, then drop below freezing at night, all while desert winds blew sand and dust into every bodily and mechanical orifice. Germany based much of its defensive strategy in South-West Africa around the assumption that no enemy commander could feasibly attempt to advance across the desert from Walvis Bay to Windhoek, but Botha resolved to <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

[...] "That's a complaint you hear mostly from people who don't empty slop jars. This country {{has a lot of}} people who <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> for a living. And they do it well. It's not pleasant work, but it's a living. And it has to be done. Somebody has to go around and empty all those bed pans. And it's perfectly honorable work. There's nothing the matter with doing it. Indeed, there is a lot that is right about doing it, as any hospital patient will tell you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Duckpin bowling is a {{variation}} of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling, weighing [...] each, which are devoid of finger holes. The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a [...] "flock of flying ducks". While the rules remained almost identical {{to those of the}} Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a wood turner to <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

Take the key and unlock the desk, and bring me the bundle of papers that are tied with an old tape; or--stop--bring me all the papers." [...] With {{trembling}} hand Nina took the key. She was now desired by her father to <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>that</b> which her lover wished her to have done; or, better still, her father {{was about to do}} the thing himself. She would at any rate have positive proof that the paper was not in her father's desk. He had desired her to bring all the papers, so {{that there would be no}} doubt left. She took the key very gently, as softly as was possible to her, and went slowly into the other room. When there she unlocked the desk and took out the bundle of letters tied with an old tape which lay at the top ready to her hand. Then she collected together the other papers, which were not many, and without looking at them carried them to her father. She studiously avoided any scrutiny of what there might be, even by so much as a glance of her eye. [...] "This seems to be all there is, father, except one or two old account-books." ...|$|E
