500|$|In his {{document}} Edward provided, {{in case of}} [...] "lack {{of issue}} of my body", for the succession of male heirs only, that <b>is,</b> <b>Jane</b> Grey's mother's male heirs, Jane's, or her sisters'. As his death approached and possibly persuaded by Northumberland, he altered the wording so that Jane and her sisters themselves {{should be able to}} succeed. Yet Edward conceded Jane's right only as an exception to male rule, demanded by reality, an example not to be followed if Jane or her sisters had only daughters. In the final document both Mary and Elizabeth were excluded because of bastardy; since both had been declared bastards under Henry VIII and never made legitimate again, this reason could be advanced for both sisters. The provisions to alter the succession directly contravened Henry VIII's Third Succession Act of 1543 and have been described as bizarre and illogical.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the house}} of the judge (Clarissa's father), the demon and Rosebud meet. He tells her, mistakenly, that he has {{abducted}} the nurse and brought her to Sir Trevor's flat. Rosebud summons the fairies to help her [...] "rescue" [...] the girl, whom she assumes <b>is</b> <b>Jane.</b> Aloysius now arrives to tell the judge of Clarissa's disappearance. Rosebud magically summons Jane (alias Lady Angela), still thinking that it was Jane who was abducted, and Lady Angela magically appears, wearing only her dressing jacket. Rosebud is angry at the demon for carrying off the wrong lady. The only solution, she thinks, is to transform the mortals into harlequinade characters. She changes Parfitt into Harlequin, Jane into Columbine, the judge into Pantaloon and Sir Trevor into Clown. All are angry, but Rosebud insists that they play the harlequinade and uses her magic to force them to do so.|$|E
