The dentist wanted to know <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>he</b> wasn't one of the {{characters}} in the popular strip. Schmidt replied, [...] "Because I already have one fat guy in it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Finally, in a {{clash of}} Rabbinical humour and Israeli humour: A Rabbi dies and goes up to the gates of heaven. Before he's let in, the angel in charge has to consult with God {{for a long period}} of time if he deserves a place in heaven. As the Rabbi is waiting, an Israeli bus driver {{approaches}} the gates of heaven. Without a second thought, the angel who was consulting with God let the bus driver through. The Rabbi points at the bus driver and yells, [...] "Hey! <b>How</b> <b>come</b> <b>he</b> gets in so quickly? He's a simple bus driver, while I'm a Rabbi!" [...] The angel explains, [...] "Dear Rabbi, you don't understand. When you would be giving your sermon during the prayer services, your whole congregation would fall asleep. When this bus driver drove towards Tel Aviv, all his passengers would be at the edge of their seats praying to God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was but {{the inquiry}} {{of his first}} {{confusion}} and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, <b>how</b> <b>came</b> <b>he,</b> Jarvis Lorry, there? <b>How</b> <b>came</b> <b>he</b> to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning? ...|$|R

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a mixed 2 stars {{out of a}} {{possible}} 4. He wrote: [...] "A few loopholes I can forgive. But when a plot is riddled with them, crippled by them, made implausible by them, as in Along Came a Spider, I get distracted. I'm wondering, since Dr. Alex Cross is so brilliant, <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>he</b> doesn't notice yawning logical holes in the very fabric of the story he's occupying? ... The film contains two kinds of loopholes: (1) Those that emerge when you think back on the plot, and (2) Those that seem like loopholes at the time, and then are explained by later developments that may contain loopholes of their own ... There are places in this movie you just can't get to from other places in this movie." [...] Nonetheless, Ebert thought that Freeman's performance made Cross an intriguing character, even when the plot was verging on the nonsensical.|$|E
5000|$|The Griffins' power returns just as Peter concludes the story, Meg then asks Peter [...] "What {{about the}} prequel trilogy?" [...] with Peter {{suggesting}} that The Cleveland Show might do the prequels (though that show's subsequent cancellation has made such parodies impossible). After that, Chris asks Peter another question about <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>he</b> {{says in the}} story that Seth Green is a douche. Peter answers saying that in his opinion that Green {{has done a lot}} of unsuccessful projects and that Green sucks. Chris retaliates with saying that he thinks Seth MacFarlane is a douche. Peter, Stewie and Brian (all voiced by MacFarlane) defend MacFarlane as a talented young man with fresh ideas and good humor. Chris tells the three in anger that he got the whole idea of Family Guy off The Simpsons, with Meg and Lois supporting Chris that MacFarlane [...] "only brings ten new episodes of the show a year" [...] and [...] "we get it, he watched a lot of television in the '80s" [...] (a reference to the show's many cutaway gags referencing 1980s television). The argument ends with Peter claiming that people will just remember the laughter, before the family looks awkwardly at each other.|$|E
5000|$|Random Quest {{works well}} {{as both a}} science fiction story and as a love story, and is rightly {{accounted}} one of Wyndham's best. Still, a closer look reveals some dangling ends. ... What happened to the other Ottilie in the other world? Supposedly the nasty other Colin Trafford came back, to cause her even more heartbreak. Our Colin Trafford is a physicist, he knows what experiment accidentally {{sent him to the}} other world. <b>How</b> <b>come</b> <b>he</b> does not even consider repeating that experiment under controlled conditions? ... And is Belinda Gale truly Ottilie? The other Colin Trafford was a completely different man, with a very different personality, though both Colin Traffords shared the very same childhood and diverged only at 10 or 11. Ottilie and Belinda diverged from each other even before birth, growing up each with a different name, with a different father, in a different country. There is every reason to think that Belinda would be a completely different person. Colin thinking of her as being just a [...] "copy" [...] of another woman from another world might not be the best beginning for a marriage.... The film made on the base of the story resolves all these problems, by having the other world's Ottilie die suddenly of a congenital heart defect of which she was tragically not aware. Thus, Colin Trafford has nothing to seek in that world - the only Ottilie he can still hope to find is the one in our world. And also, whether or not this other Ottilie is the same person that he fell in love with, he must find and warn her {{to take care of her}} heart defect, before it kills her, too. Anything else can wait until her life is saved. ... A film adaptation is not always more logically consistent than the literary original. In this case, it is.|$|E

Their proceedings fill the equivalent of more than three London telephone directories. A patient {{with spinal cord injury}} may wonder if he is living on the same planet. <b>How</b> <b>come</b> <b>he</b> is still confined to a wheelchair? Is it simply the magnitude of the problem?
