5|$|On November 29, Tropical Storm Epsilon {{formed in}} the Central Atlantic, forming the same way Delta <b>did</b> <b>when</b> a non-tropical low {{pressure}} system well east of Bermuda acquired tropical characteristics. On December 2, the storm strengthened into a hurricane, making it the fifteenth {{of the season and}} the first storm since Hurricane Lili in 1984 to reach hurricane strength after the official end of a season.|$|E

5|$|True {{to their}} {{longtime}} {{identity as a}} stage racing team, all of Astana's 2011 victories came in stage races. They had a much lesser presence at the Grand Tours than they <b>did</b> <b>when</b> Contador rode for them, achieving just one stage win and sixth overall as their best placing, both from the Giro d'Italia. They also took stage wins at seven other races.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. When {{he went to}} the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> he went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of the novel, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow elements of the horror genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on more contemporary horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Each has {{the same}} basic {{sequence}} of events: The camera zooms through cumulus clouds, through the show's title towards the town of Springfield. The camera then follows {{the members of the}} family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by David Silverman, and was the first task he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> production began on the show. The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.|$|E
5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, {{and put an end}} to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> he favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E

Season three also revealed why Lionel is angry with Lex; he blames his son {{for the death of}} his youngest son Julian Luthor, although Lex took the blame to protect the true killer, his mentally unwell mother Lillian (Alisen Down). Lionel also learns that he has a terminal liver disease, which he divulges to Lex while awaiting arraignment.|$|E
5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears {{much the same as}} it <b>did</b> <b>when</b> it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were gone and the only way into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Tecmo began {{releasing}} low-priced episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for AT and Verizon {{mobile phones}} on both BREW and Java platforms. The official English Tecmo Games mobile website advertised {{it for a}} future release along with a mobile version of Tecmo Bowl. They planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 {{in a series of}} four installments – similar to what Upstart Games <b>did</b> <b>when</b> they ported the NES version of Castlevania to mobile phones. The port featured the same visuals and soundtrack found on the NES version, and each installment was to consist of several levels of gameplay at a time. The first installment, titled Ninja Gaiden EpisodeI: Destiny, was released on , and it included only the first Act from the NES version but added two new levels. The second installment was planned to be released in North America and was previewed by GameSpot in September 2004, but it – along with the third and fourth installments – was never released.|$|E

5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress <b>did.</b> <b>When</b> Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were drawn}} against Manchester City in the semi-finals which were held over two-legs. The first leg was at City's home ground, the Etihad stadium. Liverpool won the match 1–0, {{courtesy}} of a Steven Gerrard penalty. The second leg was held at Liverpool's home ground Anfield. City {{took the lead in}} the first half when Nigel de Jong scored, ten minutes later Gerrard equalised when he scored a penalty. At half-time, the score was 1–1 with Liverpool leading 2–1 on aggregate. City took the lead in the match when Edin Džeko scored in the 67th minute. The goal meant the aggregate score was 2–2 but City would progress to the final if the score remained the same due to the away goals rule. Liverpool needed to find an equaliser, and seven minutes after Džeko's goal they <b>did,</b> <b>when</b> Bellamy scored. City tried to score an equaliser but to no avail, and the match finished 2–2, with Liverpool progressing to the final {{courtesy of a}} 3–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E

5|$|Stamford Wharf was {{the upper}} limit of navigation, and was {{situated}} below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal {{on both sides of}} the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines, to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side of the mill. Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut. The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow than it <b>did</b> <b>when</b> the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal continue through the park.|$|E
5|$|The Cyrus Cylinder bears {{striking}} {{similarities to}} older Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. Two notable examples are the Cylinder of Marduk-apla-iddina II, who seized the Babylonian throne in 722/1 BC, and {{the annals of}} Sargon II of Assyria, who conquered Babylon twelve years later. As a conqueror, Marduk-apla-iddina faced {{many of the same}} problems of legitimacy that Cyrus <b>did</b> <b>when</b> he conquered Babylon. He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk, who ensured his victory. When he took power, he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines. He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king, which he left undisturbed and honored. All of these claims also appear in Cyrus's Cylinder. Twelve years later, the Assyrian king Sargon II defeated and exiled Marduk-apla-iddina, taking up the kingship of Babylonia. Sargon's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign, honouring the gods, maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite. Again, Cyrus's Cylinder makes exactly the same points. Nabonidus, Cyrus's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon, commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders – such as the Cylinder of Nabonidus, also in the British Museum – that follows the same basic formula.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she was younger as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They {{get married and have}} two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
