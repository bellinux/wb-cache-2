5|$|Spanish <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{province}} of Soconusco {{was subject to}} frequent changes.

It was governed by colonial officers appointed in Mexico. In 1556, Soconusco passed into {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia Real of Guatemala, with independent governors appointed by the Crown.

In addition to having <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> legislation <b>the</b> Committee has extensive oversight powers. It has authority to investigate, review and evaluate existing laws, and the agencies that implement them.|$|R
