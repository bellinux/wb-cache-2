25|$|The VEF Riga has a three-element flat <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> lens. Performance {{could be}} improved, so the {{short-lived}} Minox II (1948-1951) {{had a new}} 5 element lens (called complan) whose final element would rest against the film itself when the pressure plate pushed the film onto the lens. Customers complained of film scratches with this new design, so most of these lenses were replaced by MINOX with the later curved-field compensating lens. Consequently, original 'film lens' Minox II are exceptional.|$|E
25|$|Early Minox cameras from Minox A/III to Minox B were {{equipped}} with a four-element, three-group Complan (lens) designed by ex-Leica lens designer Arthur Seibert. The Complan lens has a curved <b>film</b> <b>plane,</b> hence in these cameras the negative must be held in an arc to improve the edge-to-edge sharpness of the image. The Minox enlarger also holds the negative in this same curve. Later models, beginning with late model Minox B, to the current model TLX, using the 15mm f/3.5 four-element, three-group flat-field Minox lens, and the negative was held flat. The advance was attributed by Kasiemeir (Small MINOX Big Pictures 1971 edition) to new rare-earth elements. Note that lens performance between old and new complan/minox lenses was rated by MINOX themselves as identical.|$|E
2500|$|For Riga Minox to Minox B, {{the film}} {{advances}} {{each time the}} camera is closed, regardless of whether a picture is taken or not. Opening the camera causes the pressure plate to press the film into a concave or flat (depending on the model) surface to stiffen thin emulsions for better clarity. When the camera is closed, the pressure plate moves back from the <b>film</b> <b>plane,</b> thus allowing the film strip to move freely {{to advance to the}} next frame. From Minox BL onward, the camera is equipped with a [...] "freewheeling" [...] mechanism, such that the film advances one frame only when a picture is taken, otherwise, closing the camera does not advance a frame.|$|E

50|$|The {{focal-plane shutter}} {{operates}} {{as close to}} the <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> as possible and consists of cloth curtains that are pulled across the <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> with a carefully determined gap between the two curtains (typically running horizontally) or consisting of a series of metal plates (typically moving vertically) {{just in front of the}} <b>film</b> <b>plane.</b> The focal-plane shutter is primarily associated with the single lens reflex type of cameras, since covering the film rather than blocking light passing through the lens allows the photographer to view through the lens at all times except during the exposure itself. Covering the film also facilitates removing the lens from a loaded camera (many SLRs have interchangeable lenses).|$|E
50|$|Altering {{the angle}} of the lens {{standard}} in relation to the <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> by swiveling it from side to side is called swing. Swing is like tilt, but it changes {{the angle of}} the focal plane in the horizontal axis instead of the vertical axis. For example, swing can help achieve sharp focus along the entire length of a picket fence that is not parallel to the <b>film</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E

50|$|Varying the {{distance}} between the lens and sensor or <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> across the field of view permits focussing on objects at varying distances from the camera. One means of achieving this is to tilt the lens and/or the sensor or <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> in relation to each other. This will mean that individual points in the picture plane will focus on different points of depth, with the effect that the plane of sharp focus will tilt.|$|E

50|$|Linear {{disturbances}} are vibrations {{that are}} {{perpendicular to the}} <b>film</b> <b>plane,</b> side-to-side and straight up and down movements. If the linear disturbance is 0.1 of an inch at the <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> then {{at the line of}} sight a mile away the lens will move only 0.1 of an inch. This phenomenon is not noticeable at the long end of the lens and only slightly negligible with short lenses when the subject is very close to the focal plane.|$|E

5000|$|Because focus {{depends on}} the {{distance}} between lens and the sensor or <b>film</b> <b>plane,</b> focus in the space {{in front of the}} camera is not on a point but rather on a plane parallel to the <b>film</b> <b>plane.</b> Spherical construction of lenses, rather than the ideal parabolic construction which is rarely and expensively achieved, means that this plane is slightly concave—more so in simple single element lenses and increasingly so with lenses of lower quality construction and materials. Compound lenses are built to correct this [...] "spherical aberration" [...] or [...] "curvature of field".|$|E
50|$|A <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> is {{the area}} inside any camera or image taking device with a lens and film or digital sensor upon which the lens creates the focused image. The <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> varies in {{distance}} from the lens focal point in cameras from different manufacturers. Thus each lens used has to be chosen carefully {{to assure that the}} image from the lens is focused on the exact place where the individual frame of film or digital sensor is positioned during exposure. It is sometimes marked on a camera body with the 'Φ' symbol where the vertical bar represents the exact location.|$|E
50|$|Until {{recent years}} {{focusing}} {{of a camera}} lens to achieve a sharp image on the <b>film</b> <b>plane</b> was achieved {{by means of a}} very shallow helical thread in the lens mount through which the lens could be rotated moving it closer or further from the <b>film</b> <b>plane.</b> This arrangement, whilst simple to design and construct, has some limitations not least the rotation of the greater part of the lens assembly including the front element. This could be problematical if devices such as polarising filters were in use that require maintaining an accurate vertical orientation irrespective of focus distance.|$|E
