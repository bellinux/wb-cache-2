40|$|Background: Branding in the B 2 B sector can be {{conducted}} in a phenomenon called <b>ingredient</b> branding. <b>Ingredient</b> branding is an alliance between two brands where the <b>ingredient</b> brand is applied on a host brand and works as an <b>ingredient</b> on the product. An <b>ingredient</b> brand works as a guarantor for the host brand. <b>Ingredient</b> brand {{will be used to}} enhance and build associations to a host brand. Purpose: The purpose of the thesis is to investigate how consumer’s attitudes are affected by <b>ingredient</b> branding on products in the segment of low price host brands. Research Questions: How does an <b>ingredient</b> brand affect consumer’s attitudes on a low price host brand in a positive or a negative way? How does an <b>ingredient</b> brand affect consumer’s attitudes on high or low involvement products? Method: The thesis was conducted as a qualitative research with an abductive approach and focus groups as data collection method. Conclusion: <b>Ingredient</b> branding can change consumer’s attitudes both in a positive and negative way on products in the segment of low price brands. This research shows that when an <b>ingredient</b> brand is added the consumer are expecting that the price and quality increase on the end product.  An <b>ingredient</b> brand has low effect on consumer’s attitudes on high involvement products and high effect on low involvement products. ...|$|R

5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where <b>ingredients</b> are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The <b>ingredients</b> and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle {{is filled with the}} correct <b>ingredients,</b> it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many <b>ingredients</b> are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct <b>ingredients,</b> and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as truffles and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E

40|$|Branding is {{becoming}} increasingly important to companies within the B 2 B-sector and they {{put a lot of}} effort and capital to develop and strengthen their brands. One way of working with brands is through <b>ingredient</b> branding. An <b>ingredient</b> brand is an alliance between two brands where the <b>ingredient</b> brand is applied on a host brand and works as an <b>ingredient</b> on the product. The purpose of <b>ingredient</b> branding is to create competiveness, differentiation and to create quality associations. <b>Ingredient</b> brands can be divided into emotional and functional categories. The functional fills a function for the customer while the emotional increases the value in an emotional aspect. Ethical brands works as emotional <b>ingredient</b> brands and the concept of ethical brands has become more commonly used as a market solution. Marketing managers have become ethically more sensitive, and they are largely convinced that customers and the public expect them to act in a morally acceptable way. The {{purpose of this study was}} to create knowledge about the most important aspects a company should take into consideration when establishing an ethical <b>ingredient</b> brand. And the research questions were:  Which are the biggest risks when establishing an ethical <b>ingredient</b> brand? What are the possibilities when establishing an ethical <b>ingredient</b> brand? This research used a qualitative approach, using in-depth interviews with brand managers on Swedish ethical organizations to gain data. In the literature review six concepts could be identified: impact, risks, expectations, reason to cooperate, <b>ingredient</b> brand and finally marketing and InBranding. Based on these concepts the empirical data was presented. When the empirical material had been analyzed it could be concluded that for <b>ingredient</b> brands the main focus is to spread their message, not necessarily to gain profit margins. The <b>ingredient</b> brand then can use the host brands as a marketing tool. Furthermore a big risk for the ethical <b>ingredient</b> brand is to lose credibility due to unfulfilled criteria’s by the host brand...|$|R
