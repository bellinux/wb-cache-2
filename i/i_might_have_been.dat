25|$|Sargon I or Šarru-kīn I (c. 1861 BC – c. 1822 BC), son and {{successor}} of Ikunum, reigned as {{king of the}} Old Assyrian Empire. Sargon <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{named after}} Sargon of Akkad. The name “Sargon” means “the king is legitimate” in Akkadian. Sargon I {{is known for his}} work refortifying Assur. Very little is known about this king.|$|E
25|$|I {{was well}} placed at table between {{one of the}} Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his black hair was worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His {{complexion}} was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...|$|E

500|$|In retirement, Nash {{was asked}} why he never won a Brownlow Medal (the award for the Best and Fairest player in the VFL). He replied, [...] "I was never the best and fairest but I reckon <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the worst and dirtiest. I played it hard and tough." ...|$|E
500|$|His parents {{divorced}} {{when he was}} seven. Growing up, Levine spent weekdays {{with his mother and}} weekends with his father. He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the fact that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things you do when you find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|The reverse was {{designed}} by the assistant engraver who would succeed Morgan on his death in 1925, John R. Sinnock. It is an adaptation of the Seal of Illinois, an eagle perched on a rock mound, with the rising sun beyond it. The bird holds in its beak a scroll with the Illinois state motto, STATE SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL UNION and it clutches the Federal shield. An olive branch is seen, but without any arrows representing war, even though these symbols are often paired on U.S. coins. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen suggested [...] "their presence on a coin designed during the concluding months of World War <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered just a bit raw". The reverse also bears the legends, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, E PLURIBUS UNUM (the national motto, meaning [...] "out of many, one") and HALF DOLLAR.|$|E

500|$|... "'What about Agnew?' {{suggested}} Peter Willey... 'He's bowling {{pretty well}} at the moment.' David's face lit up. 'Of course!' he said. 'Jonathan, you're in. Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I'll call first thing tomorrow...' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, {{and the opportunity to}} set the record straight... the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart, so you're not in any more. They've gone for Alan Igglesden. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the Today newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many years later, in 1975, Schmeling said, [...] "Looking back, I'm almost happy I {{lost that}} fight. Just imagine if I {{would have come}} back to Germany with a victory. I {{had nothing to do}} with the Nazis, but they would have given me a medal. After the war <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{considered}} a war criminal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{drivers and}} press members {{believed}} the safety improvements for which Stewart advocated detracted from the sport, while track owners and race organizers {{balked at the}} extra costs. [...] "I {{would have been a}} much more popular World Champion if I had always said what people wanted to hear. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dead, but definitely more popular.", Stewart later said.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{no known}} intact film of Gehrig's speech; {{only a small}} snippet of the {{newsreel}} footage has survived, incorporating his opening and closing remarks: [...] "For {{the past two weeks}} you've been reading about a bad break. (pause) Today I consider myself the luckiest man {{on the face of the}} earth. (cut) When you look around, wouldn't you consider it a privilege to associate yourself with such fine-looking men as are standing in uniform in this ballpark today? (cut) ... that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given a bad break, but I've got an awful lot to live for. [...] Thank you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cohen is {{mentioned}} in the Nirvana song [...] "Pennyroyal Tea" [...] from the band's 1993 release, In Utero. Kurt Cobain wrote, [...] "Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld/So I can sigh eternally." [...] Cohen, after Cobain's suicide, {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man. I {{see a lot of people}} at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school. There are always alternatives, and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to lay something on him." [...] He is also {{mentioned in the}} lyrics of songs by Mercury Rev and Marillion.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2001, Piper {{appeared}} {{in court to}} testify against a woman named Juliet Peters. Peters was charged with, and eventually convicted of, stalking as well as making numerous threats against Piper and members of her family. Peters received psychiatric treatment {{as part of her}} sentence. According to her autobiography, Piper was reluctant about the court case, but was pushed by her parents and her label. She also stated in the book that this was why [...] "The Tide Is High" [...] wasn't released as a single, writing: [...] "The court case succeeded in doing what I alone could not [...] cutting the ties. Without it <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tempted back." ...|$|E
60|$|This impression, however, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{altogether}} {{the result}} of fancy and prejudice in me. The distance was so great as to obliterate any play of feature by which <b>I</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made a partaker of their counsels.|$|R

2500|$|Reading about Grandin renewed Gerson Saines' [...] "energy, {{motivation}} and spirit" [...] {{in coping with}} her son's condition. [...] "Temple's story brought me hope and (her mother)'s story gave me direction and purpose," [...] Gerson Saines said in a later interview. [...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> one of them, but all I could think of was, 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here. This woman's my hero.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
