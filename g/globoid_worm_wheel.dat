This paper deals with the evolvent worm whose curve of the tooth side in the front plane is evolvent. The production of worm with an optimal profile for optimal meshing conditions is an increasingly frequent focus of worm gear manufacturers. The problem of designing the tool cutting edge can be divided into several steps. This article deals with the problems of optimum design of a tool shape for the production of worms; and the problems of calculating the coordinates of the transition cutting edge shape, and thus the path of grinding wheel for sharpening the tool cutting edge shape are solved. By grinding tool of grinding machine we can complete the worm shape and also sharpen the cutting edges of tools for production of worm surface. The problems of calculation of the coordinates are solved with regard to the functioning of the KON 250 CNC grinding machine logic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gear honing with <b>globoid</b> honing <b>worms</b> {{is seldom}} used {{because it has}} no {{distinct}} advantages to honing with internal geared honing rings. The paper puts forward a new process to honing gear with <b>globoid</b> honing <b>worms</b> on hobbing machines. First the <b>globoid</b> honing <b>worm</b> is profiled by diamond dressing gears, which has the same geometric parameters with the machined gears. Then the profiled <b>globoid</b> honing <b>worm</b> is used to hone workpieces. Both the profiling process and honing process are implemented on same hobbing machines. Meshing and Tooth contact analysis of <b>globoid</b> honing <b>worm</b> profiling has been considered.

40|$|Plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is widely}} used in the vehicle {{manufacturing}} field because it is favorable for weight lightening, vibration and noise reduction, as well as corrosion resistance. However, {{it is very difficult}} for general plastics to secure the mechanical properties that are required for vehicle gears. If the plastic resin is reinforced by glass fiber in the fabrication process of plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> it is possible to achieve the mechanical properties of metallic material levels. In this study, the mechanical characteristic analysis of the glass-reinforced plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> according to the contents of glass fiber, is performed by analytic and experimental methods. In the case of the glass fiber-reinforced resin, the orientation and contents of glass fibers can influence the mechanical properties. For the characteristic prediction of plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis processes such as structural and injection molding analysis were executed with the polyamide resin reinforcement glass fiber (25 wt %, 50 wt %). The injection mold for fabricating the prototype plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> was designed and made to reflect the CAE analysis results. Finally, the durability of prototype plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> fabricated by the injection molding process was evaluated by the experimental method and the characteristics according to the glass fiber contents...|$|R

40|$|Number of {{conventional}} methods {{are available for}} solving different types of optimization problems. But due to their complexity and convergence problems these methods {{are not able to}} give optimal solution. A gear transmission problem {{is one of the most}} complex optimization problems because of relationship between different variables. A Gear design require the designer to compromise many design variables; i. e. continuous, discrete & integer variables in order to determine best performance of gear set. Therefore researchers are now going to use Evolutionary Techniques. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of such technique. In this paper the attempt has been made to optimize <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> with multiple objectives, which takes gear ratio (i), face width of <b>worm</b> & <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> (b) and pitch circle diameters of worm (dw) & <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> (dg) as design variables.

40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of tilting table driven by <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of tilting table behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} tilting table driven by <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of tilting table system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> the torsional stiffness of <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft, and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings. Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{worm gear}} drives usually show run-in capable {{material}} pairing. In {{most cases the}} worm is made of case hardened steel and the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> of copper-tin alloy. This choice of material leads to an effective avoidance of the appearance of scuffing. The wear of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is desirable in the running-in phase, limits, along with the known load carrying capacities of other gear types, the life expectancy of the gear set. The {{aim of this study}} is to optimize the copper-tin alloys of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> with respect to the wear properties. Extensive tests on worm gear drives with different copper-tin alloys allow statements concerning the effects of varying the different material parameters to the wear behaviour. The result is a wear optimized <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> material and an extended load carrying capacity calculation. Furthered load carrying capacity calculation makes a contribution which forms the existing calculation procedure more accurately. The derivation of a statistical evaluation procedure for the test results leads to a wear life expectancy with a specification of an appearance probability. The physical based wear parameter allows the prediction of the wear behaviour of copper-tin alloys using the material properties. Detailed measurements of the power losses in the worm gear drives make possible the calculation of the tooth coefficient of friction of the various material pairing. The introduced order- and purchase regulations guarantee, that in the future, the optimized bronze can be reproduced and supplied. (orig.)
