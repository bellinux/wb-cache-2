25|$|The United Kingdom and Germany resumed {{commercial}} {{production in the}} 1990s. British production is mostly used as bedding for horses; other uses are under development. Companies in Canada, the UK, the United States and Germany, among many others, process <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> into a growing range of food products and cosmetics; many traditional growing countries still continue to produce textile-grade fibre.|$|E
25|$|Hemp seeds can {{be eaten}} raw, ground into a meal, sprouted, or made into dried sprout powder. The {{leaves of the}} hemp plant can be {{consumed}} raw in salads. Hemp can also {{be made into a}} liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as hemp milk, hemp juice, and tea. Hempseed oil is cold-pressed from the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids. In 2011, the U.S. imported $11.5 million worth of hemp products, mostly driven by growth in demand for <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> and hemp oil for use as ingredients in foods such as granola.|$|E

500|$|Until its {{discovery}} and importation from the New World, tobacco was unknown to western medicine. [...] Europeans were not {{ignorant of the}} effects of smoke; incense has been used since antiquity, and the psychoactive effects of burning <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> was well known by the Scythians and Thracians. [...] The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the inhalation of smoke for [...] "female diseases" [...] as did Pliny the Elder, as a cure for coughs. [...] The Native Americans from whom the first western explorers learnt about tobacco used the leaf for a variety of purposes, including religious worship, but Europeans soon became aware that the Americans also used tobacco for medicinal purposes. [...] The French diplomat Jean Nicot used a tobacco poultice as an analgesic, and Nicolás Monardes advocated tobacco as a treatment for a long list of diseases, such as cancer, headaches, respiratory problems, stomach cramps, gout, intestinal worms and female diseases. [...] Contemporaneous medical science placed much weight on humorism, and for a short period tobacco became a panacea. [...] Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability to soak up moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so important to a healthy person. [...] In an attempt to discourage disease tobacco was also used to fumigate buildings.|$|E

2500|$|Both Washington and Jefferson grew {{cannabis}} {{to produce}} hemp, and Washington used hemp fiber to make clothes for his slaves, {{but there is}} no direct evidence that either Washington or Jefferson consumed it for its psychoactive properties. Washington is commonly quoted as saying [...] "Make the most of the Indian <b>hemp</b> <b>seed,</b> and sow it everywhere," [...] often cited as a note to his gardener published in The Washington Papers. However the closest phrase to this in The Washington Papers is in a letter to William Pearce – [...] "I am very glad to hear that the Gardener has saved so much of the St. foin seed, and that of the India Hemp. Make the most you can of both, by sowing them again in drills. [...] The Hemp may be sown any where." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hemp {{is used to}} make {{a variety}} of {{commercial}} and industrial products including rope, clothes, food, paper, textiles, plastics, insulation and biofuel. The bast fibers {{can be used to make}} textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other organic fibers such as flax, cotton or silk, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are more woody and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding and litter. When oxidized (often erroneously referred to as [...] "drying"), hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a moisturizing agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well. A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> sold in the European Union was used in animal and bird feed.|$|E
2500|$|... {{confirmed}} vegetarian diets {{provide sufficient}} protein intake {{as long as}} a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, <b>hemp</b> <b>seed,</b> almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. [...] Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.|$|E

50|$|This {{procedure}} {{allows for}} the harvest of leaves for hemp juice as well as <b>hemp</b> <b>seeds</b> from the same field {{in areas where the}} climate is suitable. This procedure starts a few weeks after sowing, with the harvest of the leafy tops only. As a consequence, the plant grows new tops which will be multiply leafy tops in most cases and they can be harvested later on. If the plant grows on until <b>seeds</b> are ripe, <b>hemp</b> <b>seeds</b> can be harvested. Thus, harvest for juice and harvest for seeds are both possible. Partial harvest can help to increase the seed crop.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997 Frederick Brewing Company made beer {{flavoured}} with <b>hemp</b> <b>seeds</b> {{which they}} called Hempen Ale. The ale received international attention. The Baltimore Sun quotes the Hemp Association {{as saying that}} Frederick Brewing Company was the only brewery doing this at the time. [...] The National also says that Frederick Brewing Company was the first brewery in the United States to make beer with <b>hemp</b> <b>seeds.</b> [...] By June 1997 Frederick Brewing Company had back-orders of 10,000 cases for their Hempen Ale. The ale also {{caught the attention of}} the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration who got involved because it is illegal to grow hemp in the United States. [...] <b>Hemp</b> <b>seeds,</b> imported from China, were a key ingredient in Hempen Ale making up 10% to 30% of the beer by weight. Federal regulators were also concerned about the label on the bottles, which included Japanese maple leaves, which resemble cannabis leaves. Frederick Brewing Company was able to get approval of their label, but they spent nearly $20,000 in legal fees to do so.|$|R
