"Look here, Will,"--he {{had begun}} to call me [...] "Will," [...] of late, {{probably}} because Corny called me so,--"I think it is too bad that we should <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and do nothing. I spoke to Mr. Parker about it, and he says, {{we can get a}} tug-boat, he thinks, and go out and do what looking we can. If it eases our minds, he says, there's no objection to it.

And if we want to understand why people are like that and maybe {{what we can do to}} change those behaviors when they turn out to be something kind of harmful or dangerous to society... how can we sway the population into thinking a little bit more critically... we have to know what they're thinking and what they're experiencing. We can't <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> back <b>here</b> and say 'Oh, ghosts are stupid. People who believe in them are stupid.' You need to go to these events and see how emotional people get when they talk about these things... that they really, really do believe them. And that they're really, really part of their lives. And the only way you're going to do that is if you go to these events and observe.|$|R
5000|$|Gradually, Babbitt realizes his {{dissatisfaction with}} [...] "The American Dream," [...] and {{attempts}} to quell these feelings by going camping in Maine with his close friend and old college roommate Paul Reisling. When Babbitt and Paul arrive at the camp they marvel at the beauty and simplicity of nature. Looking out over a lake Babbitt comments: [...] "I'd <b>just</b> like to <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> - {{the rest of my}} life - and whittle - and sit. And never hear a typewriter." [...] Paul is similarly entranced, stating: [...] "Oh it's darn good, Georgie. There's something eternal about it." [...] Although the trip has its ups and downs, the two men consider it an overall success, and leave feeling optimistic about the year ahead.|$|R

Clara, dear, put your feet upon the coal-scuttle, and do try to look a little dissipated. I wish we could crown ourselves with flowers. There are some lettuces on the sideboard. Oh dear, here he is!

I would excuse you {{altogether}} if I could, for I know you must be dead tired, up all night, that way, on the train, but Mrs. Miller is {{one of those people who}} never can listen to reason, and she would take deadly offence if you missed her musicale, and wouldn't forgive us the longest day she lived. So you see?" [...] Mrs. Roberts addresses herself to her husband in the library of their apartment in Hotel Bellingham, at Boston, as she stands before the fire pulling on a long glove and looking at him across his desk, where he has sunk into a weary heap in his swivel chair. [...] "You are dreadfully used up, Edward, and I think it's cruel to make you go out; but what can I do? If it was anybody but Mrs. Miller I wouldn't think of having you go; I'm sure I never want to have her about, anyway. But that's just the kind of people that you're a perfect slave to! Now, dear, I've let the two girls go out, and you must remember that you're in the place alone with the children; but you needn't be troubled, because nobody will come after this hour till Willis does, and the girls will be back before that. Willis is to come and get you on his way to the Millers', and it's all been arranged for you, and you needn't think of a thing till Willis comes. You'll have to dress, of course; but you needn't begin that at once, and you can <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> in your chair and rest." [...] Mr. Roberts stretches his arms wildly abroad, and, throwing back his head, permits himself a yawn that eclipses his whole face. Mrs. Roberts lets both her arms fall at her side in token of extreme despair. [...] "Edward! If you should go to sleep!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no. They 've {{got some}} Englishman. They say he 's devoted to Ella. Every {{one seems to}} have an Englishman, now. We 've got one here, Captain Lovelock, the Honourable Augustus Lovelock. Well, they 're awfully handsome. Ella Maclane is dying to come to Baden-Baden. I wish you 'd write to her. Her father and mother have got some idea in their heads; they think it 's improper--what do you call it?--immoral. I wish you would write to her and tell her it is n't. I wonder if they think that Mrs. Vivian would come {{to a place that}} 's immoral. Mrs. Vivian says she would take her in a moment; {{she does n't seem to}} care how many she has. I declare, she 's only too kind. You know I 'm in Mrs. Vivian's care. My mother 's gone to Marienbad. She would let me go with Mrs. Vivian anywhere, on account of the influence--she thinks so much of Mrs. Vivian's influence. I have always heard a great deal about it, have n't you? I must say it 's lovely; it 's had a {{wonderful}} effect upon me. I don't want to praise myself, but it has. You ask Mrs. Vivian if I have n't been good. I have been just as good as I can be. I have been so peaceful, I have just sat here this way. Do you call this immoral? You 're not obliged to gamble if you don't want to. Ella Maclane's father seems to think you get drawn in. I 'm sure I have n't been drawn in. I know what you 're going to say--you 're going to say I have been drawn out. Well, I have, to-night. We <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> so quietly--there 's nothing to do but to talk. We make a little party by ourselves--are you going to belong to our party? Two of us are missing--Miss Vivian and Captain Lovelock. Captain Lovelock has gone with her into the rooms to explain the gambling--Miss Vivian always wants everything explained. I am sure I understood it the first time I looked at the tables. Have you ever seen Miss Vivian? She 's very much admired, she 's so very unusual. Black hair 's so uncommon--I see you have got it too--but I mean for young ladies. I am sure one sees everything here. There 's a woman that comes to the tables--a Portuguese countess--who has hair that is positively blue. I can't say I admire it when it comes to that shade. Blue 's my favorite color, but I prefer it in the eyes," [...] continued Longueville's companion, resting upon him her own two brilliant little specimens of the tint.|$|E

When she dies--she is killed by a fall from her horse in hunting, and has just time to join the hands {{of her husband and}} the man she liked first, and tell them everything-- it is wrought up so that you hold your breath. I suppose it was reading that that made me think there were burglars getting in. But perhaps you're right not to read it now, if you're excited already. I'll get you {{something}} cheerful." [...] She whirled {{out of the room and}} back in a series of those swift, nervous movements peculiar to her. [...] "There! that will amuse you, I know." [...] She put the book down on the table before Lemuel, who silently submitted to have it left there. [...] "It will distract your thoughts, if anything will. And I shall ask you to let me <b>sit</b> <b>just</b> <b>here</b> in the reception-room, so that I can call you if I feel alarmed." ...|$|R

5000|$|A short {{signature}} tune would herald {{a change}} of scene to the Glums' front room, where Ron and Eth would be sitting on the sofa. Eth would say, [...] "Oh, Ron…!" [...] - [...] her catchphrase [...] - [...] and Ron would vacantly reply something like, [...] "Yes, Eth?" [...] and the week's story would begin in earnest. This opening formula was constantly varied slightly. For instance, in one episode, Eth says, [...] "Oh, Ron, is there anything on your mind, beloved?", to which Ron, after a pause, replies, [...] "No, Eth." [...] Another example has Eth saying [...] "Oh really, Ron, {{do you expect me}} to <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> like a lemon?", to which Ron responds [...] "No thanks Eth, I've just had a banana." ...|$|E

500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|R

Cui, who was allied with Zhu, in turn summoned Zhu, who put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege. [...] In early 903, with Fengxiang's situation becoming increasingly desperate, Han had Emperor Zhaozong issue an edict calling on the military governors around the realm to rise and attack Zhu. [...] The edict particularly singled out Wang as an adherent of Zhu's and, {{as part of the}} order to Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), commissioned Yang's subordinate Zhu Jin, who had ruled Taining at one point, as the military governor of Pinglu. [...] Upon reading the edict, Wang was greatly distressed, and commented, [...] "We are the outer defenses for the Emperor. How can we <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and watch the Son of Heaven be trapped and humiliated? Do we have these troops just to defend ourselves?" [...] The retired chancellor Zhang Jun also wrote Wang and encouraged to rise against Zhu Quanzhong. Wang therefore prepared to do so.|$|E
