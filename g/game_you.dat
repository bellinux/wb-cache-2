5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual <b>game,</b> <b>you</b> can see that it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That {{was a very different}} depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E

25|$|Natsume was {{the voice}} of a {{character}} in the Sega video game Ryu Ga Gotoku 2 (龍が如く2) or Yakuza 2 for PlayStation 2 released on December 7, 2006. Her role as a nightclub hostess in the game was minor but she played a large part in publicity for the game. She was also engaged to publicize the August 2008 Nintendo DS supernatural ghost story <b>game</b> <b>You</b> Mustn't Look (Mitewa Ikenai - みてはいけない) from video game producer Dimple. Part of the campaign was a comic photo series and video at the offices of game reporters Famitsu.|$|E
25|$|When Fruit Ninja {{celebrated its}} second anniversary, Halfbrick {{released}} an update {{with a new}} feature called Gutsu's Cart, which comprises two characters, a pig named Truffles and a human named Gutsu. In the various modes of the <b>game,</b> <b>you</b> can earn starfruit to purchase items in Gutsu's Cart. There are three purchasable items at the cart which {{are used in the}} game; Berry Blast causes sliced strawberries to explode and gives the player five extra points. Another item is Peachy Times: slicing a peach in Zen or Arcade mode gives the player two extra seconds. The third item is Bomb Deflects which enables the player to deflect Bombs upon accidentally slicing them. Starfruit can be obtained after each game, proportional to the score, or by slicing the semi-rare starfruit.|$|E

25|$|ABC {{cemented}} {{its reputation}} as a youth-oriented network in daytime {{with the addition of}} One Life to Live to its schedule, with {{much of the rest of}} its lineup consisting of soap operas like Dark Shadows, sitcom reruns, and game shows packaged by Chuck Barris. One Life to Live replaced the short-lived Baby Game, in a three-way shuffle with Dark Shadows and Dating Game. The network placed the new serial at 3:30 PM EST, against CBS's established hit Edge of Night and the popular NBC <b>game</b> <b>You</b> Don't Say. Despite the tough competition, the intense tone of the plot and strong characters allowed the show to get a leg up on You Don't Say, wearing that game down to the point of its cancellation in September 1969; NBC replaced the Tom Kennedy-hosted game in that time slot with three unsuccessful serials: Bright Promise, Return to Peyton Place, and How to Survive a Marriage.|$|E
25|$|Turn of {{the century}} {{baseball}} attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the 1901 season was 3,247. However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built {{for many of the}} larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Shibe Park in Philadelphia, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Boston's Fenway Park along with Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago. Likewise from the Eastern League to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising Negro Leagues professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in 1909, before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams barnstorming, company clubs and amateur men's leagues. In the days before television, if you wanted to see a <b>game,</b> <b>you</b> {{had to go to the}} ballpark.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the <b>game</b> <b>you</b> are playing as.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked to}} respond to {{criticism}} of his defense, Jeter replied: [...] "I play in New York, man. Criticism is part of the <b>game,</b> <b>you</b> take criticism as a challenge." [...] Jeter further asserted that many defensive factors cannot be quantified. The controversy over Jeter's fielding has become a flash point for the debate over whether the analyses of statistics or subjective observation is the better method to assess a player's defensive ability, and for criticism of the Gold Glove Award.|$|E
500|$|As {{winners of}} the FA Cup in the {{previous}} season, Arsenal contested the 2005 FA Community Shield against league champions Chelsea. Two goals scored by striker Didier Drogba {{in the first half}} meant Arsenal lost the match. Wenger commented afterwards that Chelsea's gameplan made it difficult for the Arsenal defenders, and noted his opposition's strength was playing long balls. When asked if he was concerned by the performance, Wenger replied: [...] "Why should I worry? Did you see the <b>game?</b> <b>You</b> can worry for the Chelsea supporters." ...|$|E
