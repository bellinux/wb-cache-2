The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is <b>demanding</b> <b>and</b> possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well.

5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by <b>demanding</b> <b>and</b> relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically <b>demanding</b> <b>and</b> entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the relationship between}} indicators of psychological <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> job control among nursing workers, according to the Demand-Control Model. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study, with 491 nurses of a public university hospital in Rio Grande do Sul, {{in the period of}} March to December 2006. It was used the Brazilian version of the Job Content Questionnaire, to assess the psychosocial dimensions of work (psychological <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> control). Results: It was found that 30 % of nursing workers were classified in the passive work group (low <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> low control), 29 % in the active work (high <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> high control), 21 % in the high <b>demand</b> (high <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> low control) and 20 % in the low <b>demand</b> (low <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> high control).

He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically <b>demanding</b> <b>and</b> required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the government's restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local families at a time when food shortages were commonplace.|$|E

However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition.

5|$|By 1959, Gates {{and other}} {{officials}} viewed the Corps as fraught with internal squabbling and alienated from the other services. Because of this condition, combined with the reputation gained from the Ribbon Creek incident, {{it was decided that}} Pate needed to be replaced. Gates believed Shoup was a strong leader who could steer the Corps in the right direction. Shoup was selected over five lieutenant generals and four major generals senior to him in rank. Lieutenant General Merrill B. Twining was considered the likely appointee to the position; Lieutenant Generals Edward Pollock and Vernon E. Megee also aspired to the position of Commandant. Twining openly vied for the position and retired immediately after Shoup was selected, reportedly in protest, as did several other officers. Shoup emphasized military readiness, training, and inter-service cooperation, which differed from the political climate of the time. He rapidly gained a reputation as being extremely <b>demanding</b> <b>and</b> critical of poor performance, especially by Marine generals and leaders. He was sometimes blunt in his criticism of what he saw as poorly performing officers, to the extent that some considered him a bully.|$|E

5|$|Historically, equestrians honed {{their skills}} through games and races. Equestrian sports {{provided}} entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship {{that was needed}} in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring <b>demanding</b> <b>and</b> specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries {{has resulted in the}} preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.|$|E

The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very <b>demanding,</b> <b>and</b> was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E

5|$|The {{search for}} a singer-actress to play Carmen began {{in the summer of}} 1873. Press {{speculation}} favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice.

In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a <b>demanding</b> <b>and</b> at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1926–27, with other {{candidates}} unavailable, Gilligan was chosen to captain an MCC team which toured India; the side was not fully representative and did not play Test matches. In first-class games, he scored three fifties and, bowling infrequently, took ten wickets on the tour. The team, the first to tour India under the colours of the MCC, was very successful. Gilligan left most of the day-to-day organisation to his vice-captain, Raleigh Chichester-Constable, and did not take his speech-making duties particularly seriously. He nevertheless had several issues to deal with. One of his players, Jack Parsons, refused for religious reasons to play in any matches in which play took place on a Sunday; Gilligan threatened to send him home {{but in the end}} he agreed to play on condition that he could leave early on a Sunday to attend religious services. Parsons was also openly critical of racial and social discrimination that he saw. Gilligan intervened at one point when his team's professionals were excluded from some invitations in Calcutta and told their hosts that no-one would attend the functions if the professionals were not included. Both the sporting and social programmes for the tour were <b>demanding,</b> <b>and</b> Gilligan wanted to attend most functions for fear of offending the European or Indian hosts. The members of the team were left exhausted, necessitating the use of reinforcements to their number, including the occasional use of English cricketers who were coaching in India, and on several occasions, the Maharajah of Patiala, {{who was a member of}} the MCC and entitled to play.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Patients' {{oral health}} needs are {{estimated}} through dialogue and professional assessment. The concepts of need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> {{are vital to}} studies of dental care and oral health. Need does not always lead to demand for treatment or to utilization, depending on the gatekeeping processes between need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization. <b>Demand</b> must be accepted {{with the understanding that}} there is no objective need <b>and</b> that <b>demand</b> depends on the patient's opinion. In accordance with this, the need for prosthodontic treatment is highly individual and is not automatically related to oral health status, making need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> difficult to measure in that respect. Therefore, sociodental factors should be included and evaluated in studies of need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> for utilization of prosthodontic care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This theoretical and analytic paper focuses on the gatekeeping processes between need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization of prosthodontic care. RESULTS: The concept of gatekeeping refers to the social and psychologic processes that transform need into <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> into utilization. It implies that they are complex processes that can render great differences between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> actual utilization. CONCLUSION: It is not possible to estimate a patient's needs for prosthodontic care, since there is no objective need. <b>Demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization are factors that {{play an important role in}} the gatekeeping process. These factors are dependent on the patient's opinion, which is influenced by numerous factors...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, Japanese inflation has been relatively stable with slight declines, while output has remained volatile with a prolonged stagnation. This paper attempts to explore possible explanations for these macroeconomic facts based on the aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply framework. Specifically, applying a vector autoregressive framework that allows for correlations between structural disturbances, it examines two broad questions in a unified way: (i) whether the slope of the short-run aggregate supply curve became significantly flattened and/or (ii) whether structural <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply shocks are more strongly positive correlated. Our results suggest that positive correlation between structural <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply shocks has become stronger since the 1990 s, while there is less evidence that the short-run aggregate supply curve has been flattened. We argue that shifts in aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply curves in the same direction lead to larger, permanent effects on output and to limited effects on prices in Japan.
