40|$|BACKGROUND—Hyperinsulinaemia {{has been}} {{associated}} with many common diseases in developed countries, such as ischaemic heart disease and colon cancer. <b>Gall</b> <b>stones</b> are also very prevalent in these countries but {{little is known about the}} association between insulin and <b>gall</b> <b>stones.</b>  AIMS—To study the relationships between insulin and the incidence of <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> in a sample of the general population.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS—Between May 1985  and June 1986, systematic sampling from the electoral register of Castellana, a small town in southern Italy, yielded 2472  subjects who had their gall bladder checked for <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> by ultrasonography. Between May 1992  and June 1993,  1962  of the 2235  subjects without <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> at the first examination agreed to a further ultrasound examination. A total of 101  subjects with newly diagnosed <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> and 303  randomly chosen controls entered the study. Serum insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay, and concentrations of cholesterol, cholesterol high density lipoprotein (HDL), glucose, and triglycerides by standard enzymatic colorimetric methods. Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to study the association between insulin and <b>gall</b> <b>stones,</b> controlling for the most common confounding factors.  RESULTS—In individuals with no clinical diagnosis of diabetes and serum glucose < 7 mmol/l, insulin was associated with <b>gall</b> <b>stones.</b> This association persisted even after controlling for sex, age, body mass index, and serum glucose. The risk of <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> in the highest quintile of serum insulin was 2. 66  (95 % confidence interval 1. 04 - 6. 72; χ 2 test for trend, p= 0. 03). The association of insulin with <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> persisted when total and HDL cholesterol were entered in the logistic regression models, and only slightly decreased when serum triglycerides were included in the model.  CONCLUSIONS—The results of the study indicate that hyperinsulinaemia may play an important role in the aetiology of <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> even in individuals without diabetes and with normal serum glucose levels.    Keywords: gallstones; insulin; epidemiology; case control stud...|$|R

50|$|Volume {{rendering}} {{techniques have}} been developed to enable CT, MRI and ultrasound scanning software to produce 3D images for the physician. Traditionally CT and MRI scans produced 2D static output on film.

It was first described in a patient examined at autopsy by Bartholin in 1654. This paper based on unusual recurrent intestinal obstructions by a <b>gall</b> <b>stone.</b> The patient presented with large bowel obstruction and it was due to a large <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> impacted in the pelvic colon. Four months later the same patient presented with small bowel obstruction due to large <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> impacted in the terminal part of the ileum at 61 cms from the ileo-caecal valve. <b>Gall</b> <b>stone</b> obstruction of the colon is one of the rare complications.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} pathogenesis of cholesterol microlithiasis, and it is not clear if biliary lipid composition in these patients is similar to changes seen in cholesterol <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> patients.  AIMS—To measure biliary lipid composition in patients with cholesterol microlithiasis.  PATIENTS—Eleven patients with cholesterol microlithiasis, 20  cholesterol <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> patients, and 17  healthy controls.  METHODS—Duodenal bile was collected in the fasting state during ceruletide infusion. Biliary cholesterol, phospholipids, and total bile acids were analysed by enzymatic assays, and conjugated bile acids by high pressure liquid chromatography.  RESULTS—Patients with microlithiasis had a cholesterol saturation index significantly higher than controls (mean value 1. 30  (95 % confidence interval 1. 05 - 1. 54) v 0. 90  (0. 72 - 1. 08)) but similar to <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> patients (1. 51  (1. 40 - 1. 63)). This was due to a significant decrease in per cent phospholipid (10. 0 % (7. 1 - 12. 8)) compared with controls (21. 4 % (18. 1 - 24. 6)) and <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> patients (24. 9 % (20. 5 - 29. 3)). Per cent cholesterol was similar in patients with microlithiasis and controls (5. 3 % (4. 5 - 6. 1) and 5. 6  % (4. 3 - 6. 8), respectively) but was significantly increased in <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> patients (10. 9 % (9. 3 - 12. 4)).

After confirmed complete <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> dissolution and withdrawal of treatment, gall stones recur frequently. Before the stones reappear, these patients have 'poststone <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> disease'. In 13 such patients we confirmed complete <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> dissolution with two normal cholecystograms and in 11 of the 13 by normal ultrasonography, measured bile acid and bile lipid composition in fasting duodenal bile, bile acid synthesis from marker corrected three day faecal bile acid excretion, bile acid pool size using an abbreviated isotope dilution technique, 'steady-state' bile lipid secretion using a duodenal amino acid perfusion system and then calculated the enterohepatic cycling frequency of the bile acid pool and the relationship between pool size and body weight. The results confirm that after withdrawal of treatment the biliary cholesterol saturation index reverts to levels (1. 6 +/- SEM 0. 4) comparable with those before dissolution therapy first began (1. 6 +/- 0. 2; NS). The mean bile acid pool size in the 13 patients of 4. 4 +/- 0. 5 mmol was comparable with that in untreated <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> patients. Pool size was significantly smaller in the nine non-obese patients (3. 5 +/- 0. 3), than in the four obese (6. 0 +/- 0. 8; p less than 0. 05). It also correlated significantly with body weight (r = 0. 72) and with %IBW (r = 0. 79). The coefficients of variation for biliary bile acid, phospholipid and cholesterol secretion were high, but the mean hourly secretion rates were of the same order as those seen in untreated <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> patients studied with the amino acid duodenal perfusion stimulus. These results provide a baseline for assessing the response to postdissolution treatment and may indicate metabolic events leading to <b>gall</b> <b>stone</b> formation...|$|E
40|$|Necropsy {{records from}} two large general {{hospitals}} in Dundee showed short-term {{fluctuations in the}} prevalence of <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> that had not previously been described. There {{was no evidence of}} a rise in the standardised prevalence rate between 1902 - 9 and 1953 - 73. A spurious increase was apparent from the crude prevalence rates for these periods, which resulted simply from the increased age of the patients in the later period. Since there was no real increase in prevalence no conclusions can be drawn about dietary or other changes. Patients with stones in the common bile duct were likely to die from an associated cause. This related mainly to a high mortality rate in women. In patients with established epilepsy the prevalence of <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> was greater than expected, which suggests that phenobarbitone does not diminish the likelihood of <b>gall</b> <b>stones...</b>|$|R
40|$|In most {{patients}} with radiolucent <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> {{who were given}} chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in doses of 13 - 15 mg/kg body weight/day the bile became unsaturated in cholesterol, and their <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> dissolved. The patients whose stones did not dissolve were significantly heavier and fatter than the responders, which suggested that obese patients might be “resistant” {{to the effects of}} CDCA. To test this hypothesis, 32 consecutive patients presenting for medical treatment of <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> had their ideal body weight (IBW) and estimated body fat mass calculated. The eight most obese and the eight least obese patients were then selected, and their fasting bile lipid responses to CDCA 13 - 15 mg/kg/day were measured. The very obese patients were also given larger doses, and any changes in bile lipid composition were studied in relation to subsequent gall-stone dissolution...|$|R
40|$|Of 406 {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} gall-bladder stones, 387 were treated by cholecystectomy and 19 {{were treated with}} chenodeoxycholic acid. The <b>gall</b> <b>stones</b> found in 356 of the 387 patients at operation were analysed chemically for cholesterol and calcium, physically for number, size, and mass, and radiologically before cholecystectomy for <b>stone</b> lucency. <b>Gall</b> <b>stones</b> rich in cholesterol (greater than 80 % by weight) were present in 75 % of patients, while pigment stones (less than 25 % cholesterol) were found in 12 % of patients. Out of the 406 gall-stone patients, 77 (19 %) had functioning gall bladders which contained radiolucent stones 1. 5 cm or less in diameter, thereby fulfilling the criteria which are used by most clinicians in selecting patients for dissolution therapy of cholesterol <b>gall</b> <b>stones.</b> The stones of 61 of these patients were available for chemical analysis and 52 (85 %) were rich in cholesterol. Using the more stringent criterion for stone size of 1 cm or less in diameter, only 11 % of patients had stones suitable for dissolution treatment. Taking into account other factors such as lack of compliance with treatment, obesity, and calcium salts in <b>gall</b> <b>stones,</b> it appears that no more than 10 % of gall-stone patients presenting to a general hospital could be successfully treated with chenodeoxycholic acid...|$|R
