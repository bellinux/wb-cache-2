The {{study of}} bore well inventory data in byramangala area {{is carried out}} and data of 142 bore wells were collected. The minimum depth of bore wells drilled is 80 m and maximum depth drilled is 1500 m. The minimum <b>inserted</b> <b>casing</b> is 40 m and maximum is 200 m. The minimum yield of groundwater is 2 inches and 3 inches pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons respectively. Whereas, maximum yield of groundwater observed in bore wells are 3 inches and 5 inches in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons respectively. The bore well inventory analysis reveal that 68 % of bore wells having good yield and 44 % having low yield in pre-monsoon season whereas, in post-monsoon season 98 % of bore wells having good yield and 8 % having low yield...|$|E
50|$|Another {{branch of}} the tramway track lead to the cable tanks, large {{concrete}} tanks filled with seawater pumped from the harbor and used for insulation and conductivity testing of the many miles of electrical cable that were used for mine operations. The torpedo storehouse had its own smaller tanks that were used for submergence testing of the mine casings and their fuzes, which were <b>inserted</b> into the <b>casings</b> through watertight plugs.|$|R
50|$|Some Typex rotors came in two parts—a slug {{containing}} the wiring was inserted into a metal casing. Different casings contained different numbers of notches around the rim, such as 5, 7 or 9 notches. Each slug could be <b>inserted</b> into a <b>casing</b> {{in two different}} ways by turning it over. In use, all the rotors of the machine would use casings with {{the same number of}} notches. Normally five slugs were chosen from a set of ten. On a Typex rotor, each electrical contact was doubled to improve reliability.|$|R
50|$|Latch seals may be {{monolithic}} and {{consist of}} several elements (a {{case and the}} insert). For sealing is used the sealing wire. The case color and the insert can be of the same color or different colors.The operating principle is simple. Insert is fixed inside the body due to the special design of both elements, which does not allow re-extract the <b>insert</b> from the <b>casing</b> without visible traces or without damage. The design often resembles {{the shape of an}} anchor. Basic elements of protection - seal number, material that should leave traces tamper, additional elements such as a thermal indicator of attempts to heat.|$|R
5000|$|The early 19th century {{brought a}} very {{different}} style of corset (still called [...] "stays"). A return to the natural or classical form was embraced by fashion {{and for the first}} time in corset history the bust was separated. To achieve and enhance the separation of the bust the [...] "busk" [...] was used. The busk was essentially a large rigid [...] "Popsicle stick" [...] shaped bone <b>inserted</b> into a <b>casing</b> down the center front of the corset. These busks were made from either wood, ivory, bone, or baleen and were often elaborately carved and given as gifts. It was most often the only bone within corsets of this type as other required shaping was provided by cut of the pattern and enhanced with cording (cotton or similar cords within casings). The cording of the early 19th-century corsets (stays) was often very elaborate, and there are many beautiful corded stays to be found in museums.|$|R
40|$|At {{the time}} this manual was written (June 2011), the {{metabolic}} centre of the University of Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich is still under construction. In its first stage it will be situated at a temporary location and it will consist of two large chambers for cattle, two medium chambers for sheep and goats and two small chambers for smaller animals (piglets etc; not discussed in detail in this manual). It is planned to enlarge the metabolic centre to four chambers per size. Facility air flow is about 910 m 3 /h and temperature ranges from 20 °C to 26 °C without humidity control. The chamber casings are constructed with insulated sandwich panels. Windows are <b>inserted</b> into the <b>casing</b> {{on each side of}} the chamber. Chamber volume of the large and medium chambers is about 22. 4 m 3 and 9. 2 m 3, respectively. The chambers will be operated at a slight negative pressure (maximal 100 Pa below ambient pressure). Air flow through the chambers will be between 300 – 1000 L/min (large chamber) and 40 – 250 L/min (medium chamber). Each of the chambers forms an independent system with its own flow generator, air conditioning unit, animal welfare monitoring and data logging. The two large chambers share a common gas analysis and data acquisition system, so do the two medium chambers. From the flow generators a sub sample is directed to the analyser system by the means of a multiplexer at regular intervals. The duration of these intervals is not yet known. Concentration of water vapour, CO 2, CH 4 and O 2 are measured with a four-gas analyser. Intervals of gas analyser calibration and recovery tests are not yet defined and will be set according to the dynamics of the chamber and the gas analysers. The large and medium chambers are planned to suit the needs of research animals and operators while enabling monitoring of CH 4 emissions for a maximal time during measurement...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 335 (14 April– 4 June 2011) will be {{the fourth}} ocean cruise of the "Superfast" {{campaign}} to drill a deep hole into intact oceanic basement and will return to Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 1256 D to deepen this scientific reference penetration a significant distance into cumulate gabbros. Cores and data recovered during the Superfast 4 expedition will provide hitherto unavailable observations that will test models of the accretion and evolution of the oceanic crust. Site 1256 was specifically located on oceanic crust that formed at a superfast spreading rate (> 200 mm/y) to exploit the observed relationship between spreading rate and depth to axial low velocity zones, thought to be magma chambers, seismically imaged at active mid-ocean ridges. This was a deliberate strategy to reduce the drilling distance to gabbroic rocks because thick sequences of lavas and dikes have proved difficult to penetrate in past. ODP Leg 206 (2002) initiated operations at Site 1256, including the installation in Hole 1256 D of a reentry cone with 16 inch <b>casing</b> <b>inserted</b> through the 250 m thick sedimentary cover and cemented into basement to facilitate deep drilling. The hole was then cored ~ 500 m into basement. IODP Expeditions 309 and 312 (2005) successfully completed the first sampling of an intact section of upper oceanic crust from lavas, through the sheeted dikes, and into the upper gabbros. Hole 1256 D now penetrates > 1500 meters below seafloor (mbsf) and > 1250 m subbasement and currently resides in the dike–gabbro transition zone. The first gabbroic rocks were encountered at 1407 mbsf. Below this lies a ~ 100 m complex zone of fractionated gabbros intruded into contact metamorphosed dikes. Although previous cruises achieved the benchmark objective of reaching gabbro in intact ocean crust, critical scientific questions remain. These include the following: 1. Does the lower crust form by the recrystallization and subsidence of a high-level magma chamber (gabbro glacier), crustal accretion by intrusion of sills throughout the lower crust, or some other mechanism? 2. Is the plutonic crust cooled by conduction or hydrothermal circulation? 3. What is the geological nature of Layer 3 and the Layer 2 / 3 boundary at Site 1256 ? 4. What is the magnetic contribution of the lower crust to marine magnetic anomalies? Hole 1256 D is poised at a depth where samples that should conclusively address these questions can be obtained, possibly {{with only a few}} hundred meters of drilling. Importantly, as of the end of Expedition 312, the hole was clear of debris and open to its full depth. Increased rates of penetration (1. 2 m/h) and enhanced core recovery (> 35 %) in the gabbros indicate that this return to Hole 1256 D could deepen the hole > 300 m into plutonic rocks, past the transition from dikes to gabbro, and into a region of solely cumulate gabbroic rocks...|$|R
