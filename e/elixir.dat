5|$|In New York City during November 1930, Szilard {{succeeds in}} recreating the <b>elixir,</b> {{only to have}} it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard. The <b>elixir</b> {{continually}} moves around the city because of Dallas, with the three mafiosi Gandor brothers, the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, and Maiza's protege Firo Prochainezo and their Camorra family, the Martillo, all passing it around. Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the <b>elixir.</b> However, all other parties accidentally consume the <b>elixir,</b> mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo {{falls in love with}} Szilard's immortal homunculus Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement Dallas to a barrel {{at the bottom of the}} Hudson River to punish him for killing Gandor members.|$|E
5|$|When Guybrush {{returns to}} LeChuck's ship with the <b>elixir,</b> he learns that LeChuck has {{returned}} to Mêlée IslandTM to marry Elaine at the church. He promptly returns to Mêlée IslandTM and gatecrashes the wedding, only to ruin Elaine's own plan for escape; in the process he loses the <b>elixir.</b> Now confronted with a furious LeChuck, Guybrush is savagely beaten by the ghost pirate in a fight ranging across the island. The fight eventually arrives at the island's ship emporium, where Guybrush finds a bottle of root beer. Substituting the beverage for the lost <b>elixir,</b> he sprays LeChuck, destroying the ghost pirate.

5|$|An oral legend {{tells how}} the goddess Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} {{to aid the}} gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the <b>elixir</b> of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the <b>elixir</b> and then beheaded herself {{to prevent them from}} acquiring it.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{majority}} of hsien (immortality) <b>elixirs</b> were combinations of jindan, many other <b>elixirs</b> were formed by combining metallic bases with natural herbs or animals bi-products. The rhinoceros' horn was commonly used in medicines and <b>elixirs</b> and was held to have fertility-increasing abilities. <b>Elixirs</b> were composed of metallic compounds such as gold and silver, but they could also be made of more lethal components like arsenic, and sulphur.|$|R

50|$|Particularly {{during his}} later years, the Jiajing Emperor {{was known for}} {{spending}} {{a great deal of}} time on alchemy in hopes of finding medicines to prolong his life. He would forcibly recruit young girls in their early teens and engaged in sexual activities in hopes of empowering himself, along with the consumption of potent <b>elixirs.</b> He employed Taoist priests to collect rare minerals from all over the country to create <b>elixirs,</b> including <b>elixirs</b> containing mercury, which inevitably posed health problems at high doses.|$|R

5|$|In the present, Kratos overcomes several {{obstacles}} {{in his quest}} to find the Ambrosia, including defeating a giant spider, ignoring Athena's pleas to stop his quest, and overcoming the reanimated corpses of Captain Nikos and his men—a final attempt by Hades to stop the Spartan. On returning to the island, Kratos discovers that the island is {{actually one of the}} Chaos Giants, the fifty-headed and one hundred armed Gyges. An outraged Gyges explains that Kratos had thwarted the Giant's plan to use the <b>elixir</b> to resurrect his brothers Briareus and Cottus, and then reclaim the world. In his fiery battle with Cereyon, Kratos inadvertently burned off Gyges' one hundred arms, and then stole the Ambrosia. Without arms and now unable to reach the Ambrosia, Gyges was forced to wait for Kratos' return. During the battle, Kratos reveals that he seeks to destroy the <b>elixir</b> to prevent the worshipers of the slain god Ares from resurrecting their master. Kratos then uses the Fire of Apollo to destroy both the Tree of Life and Gyges.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata (Adi Parva book) {{records that}} Kamadhenu-Surabhi {{rose from the}} {{churning}} of the cosmic ocean (Samudra manthan) by the gods and demons to acquire Amrita (ambrosia, <b>elixir</b> of life). As such, she is regarded the offspring of the gods and demons, created when they churned the cosmic milk ocean and then given to the Saptarishi, the seven great seers. She was ordered by the creator-god Brahma to give milk, and supply it and ghee ("clarified butter") for ritual fire-sacrifices.|$|E
5000|$|At {{least five}} Tang dynasty (618-907) {{emperors}} were incapacitated {{and killed by}} immortality <b>elixirs.</b> In the 9th century Tang imperial order of succession, two father-son emperor pairs died from elixirs: first Xianzong (r. 805-820) and Muzong (r. 820-824), then Wuzong (r. 840-846) and Xuanzong (r. 847-859). In historic recurrences, the newly enthroned emperor understandably executed the Daoist alchemists whose <b>elixirs</b> had killed his father, and then subsequently came to believe in other charlatans enough to consume their poisonous <b>elixirs</b> (Ho 2000: 184).|$|R

5|$|A six-issue {{comic book}} series titled God of War, written by Marv Wolfman with art by Andrea Sorrentino, was {{published}} by WildStorm and DC Comics between March 2010 and January 2011. The narrative switches between Kratos' past and present; it occurs while he is a soldier of Sparta and involves his search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius, which has legendary healing properties and eventually saved his plague-ridden daughter, Calliope. Kratos also embarks upon a quest to destroy the same <b>elixir</b> to deny it to the worshippers of the slain god Ares, who wish to resurrect him.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to <b>elixir</b> sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, {{which showed that}} the 107 deaths were caused {{by the use of}} diethylene glycol as a solvent. The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to her interest in teratogens, drugs that cause congenital malformations (birth defects).|$|E
5|$|Heat was {{followed}} by five additional releases: Heat Ultimate <b>Elixir</b> meant to capture a more private side of the entertainer, Heat Rush intended as a daytime fragrance, Midnight Heat, a night fragrance, Heat The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, a limited product dedicated to the tour of that name, Heat Wild Orchid, a floral update of the original, Heat Kissed, a romantic update of the original and Heat Seduction. Each scent {{was followed}} with its own Eau De Parfum release and multiple gift sets. In 2013, in addition to becoming the best-selling celebrity-branded fragrance line, the perfumes {{went on to become}} the third best-selling fragrance worldwide with $400 million earned at retail globally.|$|E
5000|$|Chapter 4 [...] "Gold and Cinnabar" [...] (Ware 1966: 68-96) {{provides}} {{a variety of}} formulas for <b>elixirs</b> of immortality.

Many Baopuzi <b>elixirs</b> are based on arsenic and mercury compounds, which have [...] "excellent embalming properties" [...] (Sivin 1968: 41). Some less effective <b>elixirs</b> only provide longevity, cure disease, or allow the adept to perform miracles. The Baoppuzi lists a total of 56 chemical preparations and <b>elixirs,</b> 8 of which were poisonous, with hallucinations from mercury poisoning the most commonly reported symptom (Needham et al. 1976: 89-96).|$|R

5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers. The Taoist tradition of Chinese alchemy, for example, can be {{considered part of the}} life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the <b>elixir</b> of life). The system of classical Chinese medicine usually revolved around the theory of yin and yang, and the five phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E
5|$|Kratos gains {{control of}} Danaus' head and uses its power against Alrik, who is {{torn apart by}} rocs. Having also been covered with the Ambrosia, Alrik is revived only to be killed once again until the Ambrosia is spent. Kratos then escapes and returns to Sparta with the Ambrosia, saving his daughter, and giving the King of Sparta {{the rest of the}} <b>elixir,</b> who then officially awards Kratos the rank of Captain in the Spartan Army. Bitter at having lost the wager, Hades resurrects Alrik, who becomes King after his father dies and swears vengeance against Kratos.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} set after Kratos' {{defeat of the}} former God of War, Ares. Now the new God of War, Kratos is on a quest to destroy the legendary Ambrosia of Asclepius, an <b>elixir</b> with magical healing {{properties}} that he once found {{when he was a}} soldier in Sparta. During his quest, Kratos has flashbacks to this period, as he searches for the Ambrosia to save his newly-born daughter, Calliope, who is suffering from the plague. Given until the next full moon, General Kratos travels with a host of Spartans to find the Ambrosia. During this period, he takes counsel from Captain Nikos, his superior in the Spartan army who instructs him about the Spartan code of honor.|$|E
5|$|Through flashbacks in {{the comic}} series written by Marv Wolfman, Kratos meets his wife Lysandra {{and they have}} a {{daughter}} named Calliope. Upon birth, Calliope was stricken with the plague. In order to save his daughter, Kratos was granted a quest to find the Ambrosia of Asclepius, an <b>elixir</b> with magical healing properties. Five of the gods entered into a wager with Ares: each chose a champion to search for the Ambrosia with Ares' champion being Kratos. Kratos overcame all obstacles, including, among others, Hades' champion, the Barbarian Prince Alrik who eventually became the Barbarian King, and thus Kratos saved his daughter.|$|E
5|$|Toxicology testing became {{important}} in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, {{in response to the}} <b>Elixir</b> Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.|$|E
