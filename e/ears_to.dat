5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E

Recently, the group was involved in sending radios to Haiti so victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake could stay abreast of local disaster recovery efforts.|$|E

5|$|The Sirens and Ulysses {{is a large}} oil {{painting}} on canvas by the English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1837. It depicts the scene from Homer's Odyssey in which Ulysses (Odysseus) resists the bewitching song of the Sirens by having his ship's crew tie him up, while they are ordered to block their own <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> prevent themselves from hearing the song.|$|E
5|$|American actor Stuart Milligan {{was cast}} as President Nixon, {{which he said}} he found exciting, having played other presidents in the past, {{including}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prosthetic pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> make him resemble Nixon as much as possible. He also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he had to wear fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland {{as the voice of}} Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> reach high areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{single largest}} niche {{industry}} {{is based on}} Latin music. Latin music has long influenced American popular music, and was an especially {{crucial part of the}} development of jazz. Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America, including Colombian cumbia, Puerto Rican reggaeton, and Mexican corrido. Latin popular music in the United States began with a wave of dance bands in the 1930s and 1950s. The most popular styles included the conga, rumba, and mambo. In the 1950s Perez Prado made the cha-cha-cha famous, and the rise of Afro-Cuban jazz opened many <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music. The most famous American form of Latin music, however, is salsa. Salsa incorporates many styles and variations; the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban-derived genres. Most specifically, however, salsa refers to a particular style that was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants, and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica. Salsa rhythms are complicated, with several patterns played simultaneously. The clave rhythm forms the basis of salsa songs and is used by the performers as a common rhythmic ground for their own phrases.|$|E
5|$|This spotted cat {{most closely}} resembles the leopard physically, {{although}} it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer {{to those of the}} tiger. While dense rainforest is its preferred habitat, the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains. Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts. The jaguar is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The jaguar is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator {{at the top of the}} food chain (an apex predator). It is a keystone species, playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts. The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats. This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of prey between the <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> deliver a fatal bite to the brain.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is often}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have used}} its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other {{members of a group}} or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. He noted that the crests internal structures {{are similar to those of}} a swan, and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.|$|E
