5|$|Here and there, {{there are}} some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> better than any other {{football}} player I ever saw.|$|E
5|$|I've {{had a great}} time, but I'm frightened that, if I {{stick around}} too long, I'll end up unable to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> else. It's not about money, it's about doing other things and not wanting Mike to pale into insignificance.|$|E

5|$|District constable was {{powerless}} {{to stop the}} violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen. When violence erupted in a district, the time-consuming process involved the constable summoning the county sheriff, who would organize a posse. During the May 6 violence, the posse arrived armed only with clubs and was {{powerless to}} <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E
60|$|Much vexed by this reflection, Mr Squeers {{looked at}} the little boy to see whether he was <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> he could beat him for. As he {{happened}} not to be <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> at all, he merely boxed his ears, and {{told him not to}} do it again.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> about those servicemen {{who had been}} rejected by the courts prior to Denning's judgment, which provoked public outcry under the slogan 'Fit for Service, Fit for Pension'.

The series also led to versions and similar series abroad.|$|E

5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse.
