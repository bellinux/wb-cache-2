In this report, we describe ApoE−/− mice on a cholate-containing high-fat diet that exhibit granulomatous lung inflammation similar to human sarcoidosis. Histological analysis revealed well-defined and non-necrotizing <b>granulomas</b> in about 40 % of mice with the highest number of <b>granulomas</b> after 16 weeks on a cholate-containing high-fat diet. <b>Granulomas</b> contained CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, and the majority of the cells in <b>granulomas</b> showed immunoreactivity for the macrophage marker Mac- 3.

50|$|Sarcoidosis is {{a disease}} of unknown cause {{characterized}} by non-necrotizing ("non-caseating") <b>granulomas</b> in multiple organs and body sites, most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes within the chest cavity.

However, in most cases of sarcoidosis, the <b>granulomas</b> do not contain necrosis and are surrounded by concentric scar tissue (fibrosis). Sarcoid <b>granulomas</b> often contain star-shaped structures termed asteroid bodies or lamellar structures termed Schaumann bodies. However, these structures are not specific for sarcoidosis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a {{heterogenous}} disease {{characterized by}} variable manifestations and outcomes, and increasing in incidence in China. Phenotypic classification {{has been proposed}} to assist in subtyping of disease. Non-caseating intestinal <b>granulomas</b> are a hallmark of CD, but whether intestinal <b>granulomas</b> help predict Chinese CD phenotypes or determine severity, is not known. AIMS: To determine the association between intestinal <b>granulomas</b> with CD phenotype, severity, risk factors, and serological markers. METHODS: This was a single-centre study of consecutive definite Chinese CD cases. <b>Granulomas</b> were diagnosed by an experienced GI pathologist. Correlation with the Vienna Classification and other parameters was performed. RESULTS: Eighty Chinese CD patients were recruited, 40 (50 %) of whom had intestinal <b>granulomas.</b> Intestinal <b>granulomas</b> were independently associated with the stricturing behavior (OR: 4. 71; 95 % CI: 1. 41 - 15. 72), colonic location of disease (OR: 26. 96; 95 % CI: 2. 68 - 271. 14), but not with age of CD diagnosis. Current or previous smoking protected against the development of <b>granulomas</b> (OR: 0. 16; 95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 59). <b>Granulomas</b> were not associated with peri-anal involvement, extra-intestinal manifestations, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody or anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody serology, or severity of CD gauged by the requirement of major intestinal surgery or immunomodulating therapy.
