5000|$|The {{half-halt}} may {{be performed}} two ways, {{both of which}} are commonly used by various skilled horsepeople. The first is a split-second application of the <b>driving</b> <b>aids,</b> to create energy, which is then quickly and immediately harnessed with the restraining aids, and then released. The second is the opposite approach: an application of the restraining aids, asking the horse to [...] "almost halt" [...] and bring its hindquarters under itself in the process, then immediately applying the <b>driving</b> <b>aids</b> to maintain the gait. In both cases, the <b>driving</b> and restraining <b>aids</b> should never be applied for a prolonged period, as that will only cause the horse to lean against the bit, tighten its back, and finally ignore the aids.

We propose a system that uses a standard GPS <b>driving</b> <b>aid,</b> augmented with peer-to-peer wireless communication.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effectiveness of mass media campaigns for reducing alcoholimpaired <b>driving</b> (<b>AID)</b> and alcohol-related crashes was conducted for the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide). In eight studies that met quality criteria for inclusion in the review, the median decrease in alcohol-related crashes resulting from the campaigns was 13 % (interquartile range: 6 % to 14 %). Economic analyses of campaign effects indicated that the societal benefits were greater than the costs. The mass media campaigns reviewed were generally carefully planned, well executed, attained adequate audience exposure, and were implemented in conjunction with other ongoing prevention activities, such as high visibility enforcement.

Forty-two participants drove a suburban scenario with several bicycle crossroads having difference configurations and presence/absence of cyclist. 378 speed profiles were plotted from 150 m before each crossroads to obtain the explanatory variables of the driver behavior.

Results showed that countermeasures affected in statistically significant way the distance at which the driver ends the braking maneuver, highlighting the better effectiveness of the colored pavement. A general improvement of the driver speed behavior was also observed for this counter-measure.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{considerable}} attention has focused on aid fragmentation, the proliferation of donors and projects in developing countries. Aid fragmentation has continued to increase despite international efforts to foster donor coordination. One possible implication of fragmentation is smaller aid projects, potentially with the result of more administrative work for overtaxed recipient governments per dollar of aid received. In principle, project size can {{be a function of}} donor characteristics, recipient characteristics, donor-recipient relations, and the type of projects funded. This paper makes use of PLAID data on bilateral aid commitments, sector, and funding agency to explore the determinants of project size and to better understand the forces <b>driving</b> <b>aid</b> fragmentation. To the extent that project size is driven by the sectoral composition or purpose of aid, the associated administrative costs may be justified.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect on drivers’ behavior of several countermeasures at bicycle crossroads during the driver–cyclist interaction (a cyclist that crosses the road) by the use of a driving simulator. Three conditions of cyclist crossroads were investigated: baseline condition (no treatment), raised island and the colored paved markings. Forty-two participants drove a suburban scenario with several bicycle crossroads having different configurations and presence/absence of cyclist. 378 speed profiles were plotted from 150 m before each crossroads. The analysis revealed that the driver’s speed behavior was fully consistent with the behavioral models in literature. A further analysis was performed on driver’s speed by ANOVA. Results showed that there was a main effect of the countermeasures, which determined lower speeds compared with that of the baseline condition. In addition, driver behavior was actually characterized by the specific peculiarities of the two countermeasures and both determined a better yielding behavior. However, the outcome of the questionnaire to participants showed that colored paved markings was considered as the most effective in terms of <b>driving</b> <b>aid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Perception sensors (cameras, laser, radar…) {{are being}} {{introduced}} into certain vehicles. These sensors {{have been designed}} to operate within a wide range of situations and conditions (weather, luminosity, etc.) with a prescribed set of variation thresholds. Effectively detecting when a given operating threshold has been surpassed constitutes a key parameter in the creation of driving assistance systems that meet required reliability levels. With this context in mind, an atmospheric visibility measurement system may be capable of quantifying the most common operating range of onboard exteroceptive sensors. Such information comes handy to adapt the way the sensors are operated, and the way the data they record is processed, or to warn the driver that the onboard assistance system is momentarily inoperative. Moreover, a system capable of either detecting the presence of fog or estimating visibility distances constitutes in itself a <b>driving</b> <b>aid,</b> because people actually tend to overestimate headway distances in foggy weather [1], and to drive at inappropriate speeds.
