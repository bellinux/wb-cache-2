5|$|Diplomatic {{exchanges between}} the Song and Jin {{did not stop}} during the period {{preceding}} the war. The History of Song claims that the Song realized that the Jin were planning for an invasion when they noticed the discourtesy {{of one of the}} Jin diplomats. Some Song officials foresaw the impending war, but Emperor Gaozong hoped to maintain peaceful relations with the Song's northern neighbor. His reluctance to antagonize the Jin delayed the fortification of the Song border defenses. The Song quickly built just three military garrisons in 1161. Wanyan Liang departed from Kaifeng on October 15, 1161. The offensive comprised four armies, and Wanyan Liang personally led the army that entered Anhui. The Jin passed the Huai River boundary on October 28, advancing <b>into</b> <b>Song</b> territory. The Song resistance was minimal because they had fortified the southern shore of the Yangtze River and not the Huai.|$|E
5|$|Giles' dream {{begins with}} Giles {{swinging}} a watch {{in front of}} Buffy. They are in Giles' apartment, which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed. She laughs, and Giles' dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a fairground. Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks <b>into</b> <b>song,</b> giving {{suggestions on how to}} deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1075, Nùng Tông Đán {{advanced}} <b>into</b> <b>Song</b> territory in Guangxi while a naval fleet commanded by Lý Thường Kiệt captured Qinzhou and Lianzhou prefectures. Lý Thường Kiệt calmed the apprehensions of the local Chinese populace, claiming that he was simply apprehending a rebel who took refuge in China and that the local Song authorities had refused to cooperate in detaining him. In the early spring of 1076, Thường Kiệt and Nùng Tông Đán defeated the Song militia of Yongzhou, and during a battle at Kunlun Pass, their forces beheaded the Governor-General of Guangnan West Circuit, Zhang Shoujie (d. 1076). After a forty-two-day siege, Yongzhou was breached and razed to the ground. When Song forces attempted to challenge Lý's forces, the latter retreated, with their spoils of war and thousands of prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way <b>into</b> <b>Song</b> Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year (1259), Uriyangkhadai returned to Đại Việt with {{an army of}} three thousand Mongols and ten thousand local troops from the conquered Kingdom of Dali, now the Yuan province of Yunnan.

25|$|According to the Twenty-Four Histories, in 1123, {{three years}} after the fall of Liao, a Jin general Zhang Jue (張覺) {{defected}} to the Song dynasty. Since he was governor of the Jin-controlled Pingzhou Prefecture, an area just north of the Sixteen Prefectures {{on the other side of}} the Great Wall, Pingzhou Prefecture was also merged <b>into</b> <b>Song</b> territory. The Song imperial court initially welcomed the defection and awarded Zhang Jue an honorific title and land. The Jin dynasty, on the other hand, sent a small army aimed to overturn the defection but was defeated by Zhang Jue's troops.|$|E

25|$|Güyük {{took steps}} to reduce corruption, announcing that he would {{continue}} the policies of his father Ögedei, not Töregene. He punished Töregene's supporters except governor Arghun the Elder. He also replaced young Qara Hülëgü, the khan of the Chagatai Khanate, with his favorite cousin Yesü Möngke to assert his newly conferred powers. He restored his father's officials to their former positions and was surrounded by the Uyghur, Naiman, and Central Asian officials, favoring Han Chinese commanders who helped his father conquer Northern China. He continued military operations in Korea, advanced <b>into</b> <b>Song</b> China {{in the south and}} Iraq in the west, and ordered an empire-wide census. Güyük also divided the Sultanate of Rum between Izz-ad-Din Kaykawus and Rukn ad-Din Kilij Arslan, though Kaykawus disagreed with this decision.|$|E
25|$|Spektor's first, self-released album, , was {{recorded}} and self-released {{while she was}} still in college. The album differs from Spektor's later releases as she was heavily influenced by blues and jazz {{at the time of its}} recording. Her second album, Songs, {{was recorded}} on Christmas Day, 2001. Each song was recorded with just one take and is entirely acoustic. The session from which the album was derived was not originally intended as an album recording session. Her third album, Soviet Kitsch, featured strings on several songs and was her first to feature a full rock band. Upon signing with a major label which in turn provided a bigger budget for production and studio time, Spektor's albums began to put more emphasis <b>into</b> <b>song</b> production and feature more prominent use of traditional pop and rock instruments.|$|E

500|$|Disney was {{concerned}} with Lasseter's position {{on the use of}} music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a buddy film featuring [...] "real toys." [...] Joss Whedon agreed, saying, [...] "It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion." [...] However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming [...] "Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking <b>into</b> <b>song</b> is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for." [...] Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in Toy Story would not break <b>into</b> <b>song,</b> but the film would use non-diegetic songs over the action, as in The Graduate, to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling. Disney and Lasseter tapped Randy Newman to compose the film. The edited Toy Story was due to Newman and Gary Rydstrom in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.|$|E

"Once More, with Feeling" [...] explores {{changes in}} the {{relationships}} of the main characters, using the plot device that a demon—credited as [...] "Sweet" [...] but unnamed in the episode—compels the people of Sunnydale to break <b>into</b> <b>song</b> at random moments to express hidden truths. The title of the episode comes from a line sung by Sweet; once the characters have revealed their truths and face the consequences of hearing each other's secrets, he challenges them to [...] "say you're happy now, once more, with feeling".|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the season, Murphy intended for the performances to remain reality-based, as opposed to having the characters spontaneously burst <b>into</b> <b>song.</b> As the season progressed, however, Glee began to utilize fantasy sequences, with paraplegic character Artie imagining himself dancing to [...] "The Safety Dance", and six separate characters performing a fantasy version of [...] "Like a Virgin". The first thirteen episodes of the season averaged five songs per episode. For the final nine episodes, the number of performances increased to eight.|$|E
500|$|Although Allegro {{is filled}} with music, the music is fragmented, as the {{characters}} often break <b>into</b> <b>song</b> briefly.

[...] Important songs are given to minor characters, such as [...] "So Far", given to Beulah, who only appears on the one date with Joe. Author and composer Ethan Mordden calls Rodgers's technique [...] "the deconstruction of theatre music, to match the show's deconstruction of traditional theatre design".|$|E

Music in the environment of the rink was the way Austin pitched the film [...] "as {{a way to make a}} musical without putting Singin' in the Rain on the screen... without the kids breaking <b>into</b> <b>song.</b> I'm determined to show Hollywood and New York the culture from the South." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams finds {{little value}} {{in the concept of}} celebrity, and {{maintains}} that the [...] "more that people know about me, the less they'll believe me and my characters". She attracts little gossip or tabloid attention, and strives to keep a healthy work-life balance. Adams makes an effort to remain unaffected by her fame, believing that it would hinder her ability to play roles with honesty. She has spoken about suffering from insecurity and lack of confidence from a young age and about how motherhood had made her calmer. She frequently breaks <b>into</b> <b>song</b> when stressed at work. Unlike some of her female contemporaries, Adams dislikes talking about issues such as the gender pay gap, believing it to be a topic for producers and decision-makers and not actors.|$|E
500|$|Aware that Tangled {{would not}} be [...] "a [...] musical like Beauty and the Beast or [...] ", on both of which Menken worked as a composer, Menken {{described}} the film as a [...] "hybrid" [...] because it is [...] "far from [...] classic break <b>into</b> <b>song</b> musical." [...] For Tangled, Menken challenged himself {{to come up with}} a different, unique sound that would differ significantly from the musical styles of his previous Broadway musical-influenced film projects and compositions. Inspired by the ongoing motif of Rapunzel's [...] "long hair and the freedom she wanted", Menken decided to draw particular influence from the musical genre of 1960s folk rock, citing the musicianship and artistry of Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell as a major source of musical inspiration.|$|E
