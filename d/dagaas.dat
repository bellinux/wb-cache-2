40|$|Various {{traditional}} methods are employed {{to preserve and}} process Rastrineobola argentea locally known as <b>dagaa</b> (sardines) an indigenous fish species of Lake Victoria. The widely used known customarily <b>dagaa</b> and <b>dagaa</b> products preservation methods include sundrying, smoking, salting and various combinations of these. The advantages of smoking <b>dagaa</b> are manifold. Fish smoking prolong shelf life, enhances flavour and increases acceptability and utilization of <b>dagaa.</b> Customarily traditional <b>dagaa</b> processing techniques used by fishers for example sun drying <b>dagaa</b> direct on the unhygienic sand, rocks and or grasses significantly contribute to poor <b>dagaa</b> products. Awareness of the shortcomings of traditional ovens had stimulated development work on new and improved smoking ovens such as Chorkor oven and Nyegezi models ovens for various reasons. In the light of {{lessons learned from the}} constraints and disadvantages associated with earlier smoking techniques, an improved <b>dagaa</b> smoking oven, the modified Altona for hot smoking was introduced. Hot smoking means curing fish by smoking at a temperature of 70 - 80 °C at some stage in the process in order to cook the flesh; hot smoked fish products do not require further cooking before consumption. Unlike other fishes, <b>dagaa</b> are readily available at cheaper price. However, smoked <b>dagaa</b> products have not been promoted in the country wide as well for the region and overseas markets. This may be contributed by the main middlemen traders for sun dried <b>dagaa</b> products who are not willing to opt to trade on smoked <b>dagaa</b> products at domestic markets. Because of the high quality of smoked <b>dagaa</b> compile the hygienic environment for storage and selling. This further enables hygienic handling during trading. If smoked <b>dagaa</b> and <b>dagaa</b> products are properly and hygienically handled extends shelf life. The quality of smoked fish is primarily linked to processing and post processing procedures...|$|R

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The most known Lake Victoria <b>dagaa</b> fishery (Rastrioneobola argentae) in Eastern and Southern {{countries}} of Sub-Saharan African region consists characterized by physical, quality and economical (PQE) losses along the supply chain. The survey {{was done on}} the PQE losses on Sun dried <b>dagaa</b> along the supply chain. Losses are at fishing, processing under sun drying on bare open beach sand and during consumers' preparation. During sun drying in open sand, birds and animals find an opportunity to eat. If it rains {{then there is a}} total physical loss. Similarly economical loss is in parallel due to poor raw <b>dagaa</b> and sand processed <b>dagaa</b> products which lead to low price of <b>dagaa.</b> The price of <b>dagaa</b> is dependent on {{the quantity and quality of}} the <b>dagaa</b> catch yield. <b>Dagaa</b> again suffers with a huge loss about 1 / 3 of total weight of <b>dagaa</b> during preparation for cooking at street restaurants and households. The heads and bellies of <b>dagaa</b> are removed on believes that heads contain sand and the bellies cause the bitter taste of <b>dagaa.</b>   The consumer encounters loss in quantity, nutrients and economical losses due the sand, heads and bellies parts being removed and thrown away during preparation.   PQE losses are costing all the stakeholders in the supply chain, the fishers, traders, Government and consumers. The <b>dagaa</b> business is not formally regulated; very few traders may declare exports. Hence the government is losing a lot of revenue as there is limited control of records on processed and exported <b>dagaa</b> products. ...|$|R
40|$|The pelagic cyprinid <b>dagaa</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{disrupted}} ecosystem of Lake Victoria. It is the main utilizer of zooplankton, a major prey for the introduced Nile perch and, after Nile perch, economically the second-most im-portant species in the fishery. Light fishery for <b>dagaa</b> was started in the 1960 s and boosted during the 1980 s. In spite of an intensified exploitation by man, Nile perch and piscivorous birds, the <b>dagaa</b> population increased significantly. Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of <b>dagaa</b> and its potential predators restricted the harvestable fraction of the <b>dagaa</b> stock mainly to mature fish. An increase in recruitment to the reproducing part of the population and a reduction in generation time enhanced the prospects for a sustainable fishery. However, a recent increase in the use of mosquito seines forms a potential danger for the fishery, since <b>dagaa</b> seems to use the inshore waters as spawning areas and nurseries...|$|R
40|$|During the 1980 s, the zooplanktivorous cyprinid <b>dagaa</b> (Rastrineobola argentea) ex-panded its {{habitat in}} Lake Victoria. After the {{eradication}} of the zooplanktivorous hap-lochromine cichlids from the sublittoral waters of the Mwanza Gulf (Tanzania) by intro-duced Nile perch (Lates niloticus), adult <b>dagaa</b> started to explore the bottom zone during daytime. This main daytime habitat for zooplankton and macrobenthic invertebrates was formerly occupied by the haplochromines. Besides extending its range of vertical distrib-ution, <b>dagaa</b> started to include macrobenthic invertebrates in its diet. In this paper, we present two rapid morphological adaptations of <b>dagaa</b> to its new niche. Samples from 1988, only one year after daytime bottom dwelling became a common habit in <b>dagaa,</b> showed a higher number of gill laments in comparison with samples from 1983. In contrast, the same samples showed {{a decrease in the}} number of gill rakers. The observed increase in the number of gill laments is postulated to have improved the capacity of <b>dagaa</b> to extract oxygen from the water, which may be crucial to survive the relatively poor oxygen conditions in the new habitat. By decreasing the number of gill rakers <b>dagaa</b> has probably increased its ef ciency of feeding on relatively large prey in a benthic habitat...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the ichthyofauna of Lake Victoria, the world's largest {{tropical}} lake, has gone through dramatic changes. The population of Nile perch, a large predator which has been introduced into the lake by man, increased explosively {{at the expense of}} many haplochromine cichlid species. At the same time, numbers of a small cyprinid (<b>dagaa)</b> rose sharply. Previously Pied Kingfishers on Lake Victoria fed mainly on haplochromines. Only the youngest nestlings depended on <b>dagaa</b> as primary food. The current diet of adult birds clearly reflects the changes which have occurred in the fish community. Pellet analysis reveals a shift towards a diet composed of almost 100 % <b>dagaa.</b> The change in prey species composition has increased the number of fish a kingfisher needs to catch daily in order to meet its energetic demands, because: (1) the mean size of haplochromines is larger than that of dagaa; (2) the mean size of <b>dagaa</b> has decreased since the increase in Nile perch; (3) the weight of <b>dagaa</b> is lower than that of haplochromines of equal size; (4) mainly juvenile <b>dagaa</b> and adults in poor condition are accessible to kingfishers...|$|R

The overall objective {{of this study was}} to propose cost effective management strategy to reduce <b>dagaa</b> post-harvest loss in Tanzania. To meet this objective a cost and benefit analysis was done, to determine whether adopting drying <b>dagaa</b> on racks project will reduce post-harvest loss, and hold positive public value in the future. Two categories of analysis were set i. e. private (individual) and public (Government) for a pilot district (500 fishers), the analyses were divided into five parts: 1).

40|$|After the {{population}} increase of introduced Nile perch (Lates niloticus) in Lake Victoria, {{a decrease in}} the relative abundance of herbivorous cladocerans and calanoids was reported for the pelagic zone. The shift from large herbivores to small-bodied predatory cyclopoids has been attributed to the increase of the zooplanktivorous cyprinid <b>dagaa</b> (Rastrineobola argentea), which rose concomitantly with the Nile perch. However, we observed that in the Mwanza Gulf of the lake cyclopoids dominated the zooplankton community already before the rise of <b>dagaa.</b> Furthermore, there are indications that <b>dagaa</b> takes fewer calanoids than expected from their representation in the environment, although a slight preference for cladocerans may exist. Calanoids dominated the diet of small Nile perch of about 4 cm length, but juvenile Nile perch did not occur in the study area until after the size shift in zooplankton. The lumped biomass of <b>dagaa</b> and small Nile perch is lower than the biomass of the original haplochromine-dominated community of zooplanktivorous fish. Thus, the decline of large zooplankters in the lake cannot be explained by intensified predation after the replacement of zooplanktivorous haplochromines by <b>dagaa</b> and Nile perch. Increased eutrophication, resulting in a shift in predominance from diatoms to cyanophytes, is suggested as an alternative explanation for the shift in zooplankton composition. © 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevie...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{abstract}} The thesis explored how {{the global}} market for Nile Perch fish has reconfigured the social and the natural in dramatic ways. The demand for Nile Perch and <b>Dagaa</b> played, willingly or unwillingly, {{an important role in}} converting its products into regionally and globally desired commodity. It has also simultaneously restructured the organisation of fisheries into a complex and aggressively managed sector. In fishing and fish trade, one needs to externalize costs and risks to the lower actors in the production and business hierarchy. From an historical point of view, power has shifted from many points of coordination and decision making into a few hands, those that own fishing camps and export processing factory.   Moreover, illegal fishing and trading are continuous and corruption is rife to safe guard individual interest in turn shaping the local practices (governance) of Lake Victoria. Finally the debate about fisheries policies and fisheries regulation in L. Victoria does not address local realities and are largely irrelevant and that the real focus of power and driver of change is the international and regional markets for Nile Perch and <b>Dagaa</b> and global players with a lot of capital.  ...|$|R

Fish marketing plays {{a vital role in}} the lives of much of the lake basin's population, both in terms of employment and nutrition. The results of the survey comprise, in part, a base-line data set which will facilitate further research, analysis and management decision-making in relation to stakeholders of the lake's resources. Data collection, methods and research difficulties encountered are described and details given of a profile of a boat owner/renter and aslo of a profile of a crew member. The survey shows that Lake Victoria's fishery is one of very limited diversity. The fishers recount that they consistently target {{one or more of the}} 3 most common species within the lake (Nile perch, tilapia and <b>dagaa)</b> and very rarely consider any other species type. The largest proportion of fishers on the lake are Nile perch fishers; there is considerable demand for this species, and hence fishers have little incentive to either target alternative fish species, not to try and establish firm marketing outlets through the creation of arrangements with their principal buyers. In Kenyan waters, however, the number of Nile perch fishers is equaled by the number of <b>dagaa</b> fishers; this fish now commands a considerable portion of the market for fish from Lake Victoria through its availability as well as its relatively low prices. The tilapia fishery is in decline, and all 3 riparian states would not appear to be attracting investment almost certainly as a result of declining catches. For many of those working in Lake Victoria's fishery, the problems faced appear most often to be associated with the vagaries of an unstable market which may rise or fall depending on the state of the international market or the state of access roads to fish landings.

Unfortunately, the best catches are made during the rainy season when drying is difficult resulting in lower quality of the dried product. The lowest quality is however still usable as chicken feed. Drying is often done on the sand, on rocks or on old nets spread on the grass. Drying racks have not caught on, neither have salting or smoking. The dried fish is packed in sacks and traders take the fish to the market. A major wholesale market for dried <b>dagaa</b> is in Mwanza, Tanzania, from where it is transported all over eastern and southern Africa for use as food or chicken feed. Sometimes it competes with dried kapenta which is usually preferred though more expensive.|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{acceptability of}} two flours and porridges of complementary foods based on germinated grain amaranth and maize {{with or without}} edible termites and <b>dagaa</b> small fish named “Winfood Classic” (WFC) and “Winfood Lite” (WFL), respectively, compared to Corn Soy Blend Plus (CSB+) among mothers and young children. A total of 57 children consumed {{each of the three}} foods on separate days with one-day washout between foods. Each food was considered acceptable if the child consumed at least 75 % of the serving. Most mothers preferred WFL flour and porridge (63. 2 % and 70. 2 %, respectively) compared to WFC (24. 4 % and 10. 5 %) and CSB+ (12. 3 % and 19. 3 %). Children consuming at least 75 % of served porridge were 43 %, 19. 6 % and 21 % for WFL, WFC and CSB+, respectively. No adverse effects were observed for all the foods throughout the study period and follow up lasting 4 weeks. All foods were acceptable and can be further developed and be tested for efficacy. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|The Dagaaba people (singular Dagao, and, in {{northern}} dialects, Dagara for both plural and singular)) are {{an ethnic group}} in the African nations of Ghana, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire. They speak the Dagaare language, {{made up of the}} related Northern Dagaare dialects, Southern Dagaare dialects, a number of sub dialects. In northern dialects, both the language and the people are referred to as Dagara. They are related to the Birifor people and the Dagaare Diola. The language is collectively known as Dagaare (also spelled and/or pronounced as Dagare, Dagari, Dagarti, Dagaran or, Dagao) and historically some non-natives have taken this as the name of the people. One historian, describing the former usage of [...] "Dagarti" [...] to refer to this community by colonials, writes : [...] "The name 'Dagarti' appears to have been coined by the first Europeans to visit the region, from the vernacular root <b>dagaa.</b> Correctly 'Dagari' {{is the name of the}} language, 'Dagaaba' or 'Dagara' that of the people, and 'Dagaw' or 'Dagawie' that of the land." ...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acids (FAs) {{particularly}} ω 3 and ω 6 polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) play {{important role in}} human health. This study aimed to investigate the composition and levels of selected ω 3 PUFAs in four commercial fish species, Nile perch (Lates niloticus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Tilapia zillii, and <b>dagaa</b> (Rastrineobola argentea) from Mwanza Gulf in Lake Victoria. The results indicated that 36 types of FAs with different saturation levels were detected. These FAs were dominated by docosahexaenoic (DHA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA), and eicosatetraenoic acids. O. niloticus had the highest composition of FAs (34) compared to L. niloticus (27), T. zillii (26), and R. argentea (21). The levels of EPA differed significantly among the four commercial fish species (F= 6. 19, [*]P= 0. 001). The highest EPA levels were found in R. argentea followed by L. niloticus and O. niloticus and the lowest in T. zillii. The DPA levels showed no significant difference among the four fish species studied (F= 0. 652,[*] P= 0. 583). The study concluded that all four commercial species collected from Mwanza Gulf are good for human health, but R. argentea is the best for consumption because it contains higher levels of ω 3 FAs, mainly EPA...|$|R
40|$|Nile perch (Lates niloticus), tilapia (Oreochromis spp), <b>dagaa</b> (Rastrineobola argentea, silver cyprinid), and haplochromines (Tribe Haplochromini) {{form the}} {{backbone}} of the commercial fishery on Lake Victoria. These fish stocks account for about 70 % of the total catch in the three riparian states Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. The lake fisheries have been poorly managed, in part due to inadequate scientific analysis and management advice. The overall objective of this project was to model the stocks of the commercial fisheries of Lake Victoria with the view of determining reference points and current stock status. The Schaefer biomass model was fitted to available data for each stock (starting in the 1960 s or later) in the form of landings, catch per unit effort, acoustic survey indices, and trawl survey indices. In most cases, the Schaefer model did not fit all data components very well, but attempts were made to find the best model for each stock. When the model was fitted to the Nile perch data starting from 1996, the estimated current biomass is 654 kt (95 % CI 466 – 763); below the optimum of 692 kt and current harvest rate is 38 % (33 – 73 %), close to the optimum of 35 %. At best, these can be used as tentative guidelines for the management of these fisheries. The results indicate that there have been strong multispecies interactions in the lake ecosystem. The findings from our study {{can be used as a}} baseline reference for future studies using more complex models, which could take these multispecies interactions into account...|$|R
