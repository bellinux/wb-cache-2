40|$|Abstract. There is {{ever-increasing}} {{competition for}} the many uses and natural resources of forests in the eastern United States. Multiple-use management {{has long been a}} stated goal for these forests, but application has been problematic and seldom satisfactory to all users. There is a need to incorporate more science into management decisions for Eastern forests, and thereby convincingly demonstrate to forest managers and the public why certain combinations of uses {{may or may not be}} compatible. One proven approach for doing this is to use watershed <b>ecosystem</b> <b>analysis.</b> Small watersheds, usually < 100 ha in area, serve as a convenient ecosystem for studying how forests function in terms of cycling energy, nutrients, and water. Results of these studies allow assessments of forest health and pro-ductivity, and evaluations of impacts of both natural and human-related disturbances. This paper provides illustrations of how watershed <b>ecosystem</b> <b>analysis</b> can be used to study the effects of current harvesting practices, acidic deposition, and past land use. The paper also shows how recommendations for land use are derived from watershed <b>ecosystem</b> <b>analysis,</b> and how they are put into practice.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an ecosystem biomimicry methodology for urban design called <b>ecosystem</b> service <b>analysis.</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> services <b>analysis</b> can provide quantifiable goals for urban ecological regeneration that {{are determined by}} site specific ecology and climate of an urban area. This is important given the large negative environmental impact that most cities currently have on ecosystems. If cities can provide {{some of their own}} ecosystem services, pressure may be decreased on the surrounding ecosystems. This is crucial because healthier ecosystems enable humans to better adapt to the impacts that climate change is currently having on urban built environments and will continue to have in the future. A case study analyzing two ecosystem services (provision of energy and provision of water) for an existing urban environment (Wellington, New Zealand) is presented to demonstrate how the <b>ecosystem</b> services <b>analysis</b> concept can be applied to an existing urban context. The provision of energy in Wellington was found to be an example of an ecosystem service where humans could surpass the performance of pre-development ecosystem conditions. When analyzing the provision of water it was found that although total rainfall in the urban area is almost 200 % higher than the water used in the city, if rainwater harvested from existing rooftops were to meet just the demands of domestic users, water use would need to be reduced by 20 %. The paper concludes that although achieving ecological performance goals derived from <b>ecosystem</b> services <b>analysis</b> in urban areas is likely to be difficult, determining site and climate specific goals enable urban design professionals to know what a specific city should be aiming for if it is to move towards better sustainability outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Too often, {{wilderness}} conservation ignores {{a temporal}} perspective {{greater than the}} past 50 years, yet a long-term perspective (centuries to millennia) reveals the dynamic nature of many <b>ecosystems.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of fossil pollen, charcoal and stable isotopes, combined with historical analyses and archaeology can reveal how ongoing interactions between climatic change, human activities and other disturbances have shaped today's landscapes over thousands of years. This interdisciplinary approach can inform wilderness conservation and also contribute to interpreting current trends and predicting how ecosystems might respond to future climate change. In this paper, we review literature that reveals how increasing collaboration among palaeoecologists, archaeologists, historians, anthropologists and ecologists is improving understanding of ecological complexity. Drawing on case studies from forested and non-forested ecosystems in Europe, the Americas, Africa and Australia, we discuss how this integrated approach can inform wilderness conservation and ecosystem management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Communications {{ecosystem}} {{covers a}} huge area from technical issues to business models and human behaviour. Due to this extreme diversity various societies {{need to discuss}} with each other, each of them using their own language. Engineers talk about network performance and quality of service, business people talk about {{average revenue per user}} and customer churn while behavioural scientists talk about happiness and experiences. Thus, everyone who wants to understand, or even analyze, the whole ecosystem, has to deal with all these diverse issues. In addition to the apparent communication problems, the main challenges of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>analysis</b> are to realistically model human behaviour, and to efficiently combine the models developed for different domains. A central concept when solving these problems is quality of experience (QoE). This paper sheds light on the role of QoE by means of a common framework that covers the whole communications ecosystem.

This is important because more than half of all people live in urban environments, cities have a large negative impact on ecosystems, humans are dependent on ecosystems for survival, and issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss are already impacting on the built environment and people, and continue to become more urgent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} of computer systems and geographic information systems the digital elevation models have started to be used {{more and more in}} spatial analysis processes.

An important aspect of DEM in terms of sustainable development is the way that it is obtained, so that the resources consumption for its generation to be minimal and the applicability for large scale.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Traditionally, {{the target}} of {{software}} evolution research has been single software systems. However, in the recent years, researchers observed that software systems are often not developed in isolation, but within a larger context: the ecosystem level. Analyzing software evolution at the ecosystem level allows {{a better understanding of}} the evolution phenomenon, as the entire development context can be studied. Nonetheless, software <b>ecosystem</b> <b>analysis</b> is challenging because of the sheer amount of data to be processed and understood. We present Complicity, a web-based application that supports software <b>ecosystem</b> <b>analysis</b> by means of interactive visualizations. Complicity breaks down the data quantity by offering two abstraction levels: ecosystem and entity. To support a thorough exploration and analysis of ecosystem data, the tool provides a number of fixed viewpoints and the possibility of creating new viewpoints with given software metrics. We illustrate in a case study how Complicity can help to understand the GNOME ecosystem in a bottom-up approach, starting from a single project and contributor towards their impact on the ecosystem.

The 15 N-DON signature is calculated from the difference between total dissolved 15 N (15 N-TDN) and inorganic 15 N. We quantified the 15 N recovery and signature of DON, NH 4 +, and NO 3 - in a series of inorganic N/DON mixtures (with a TDN concentration of 10 mg N L- 1) for three lab protocols. Phenylalanine was used as a model compound for DON. The best lab protocol determined the concentration of inorganic N and TDN prior to diffusion using improved spectrophotometric techniques.

40|$|Each {{of the two}} "new" {{paradigms}} {{for ecological}} anthropology, <b>ecosystems</b> <b>analysis</b> and ethnoecology, explores only one pair of phenomena relevant to cultural ecology, environment and action, and environment and belief respectively. This study argues that ecological analysis is weakened by the exclusion of {{any one of those}} three orders of phenomena as objects of study. A detailed analysis of cognitive and behavioral data on the resource management of Waswanipi Cree hunters shows how religious beliefs incorporate both cultural logics and realistic models of environmental relationships; and, how action informed by those beliefs can effectively manage hunting, animal populations, human population distributions, and subsistence. Beliefs are formulated as recipes that apply to diverse situations so that actions informed by these are responsive to changing conditions. Decisions concerningalternative goals, situations and strategies are shown to be socially located with the men who are the "owners" of hunting territories. *Abstract only previously published in Dissertation Abstracts International, Vol. 40, No. 9, page 5100 -A, 1980.
