5|$|Eladio {{returns to}} see Gabrielle, {{but by now}} has grown {{deformed}} from the fungus. Gabrielle, afraid of him, gives him her money and lies to the agents about his location {{when they come to}} see her. In actuality, Eladio has returned to the camp where Maria died, where Lozano tries to spur Soledad on in killing his brother. Soledad finds he can't do it, and Lozano struggles with him, being accidentally killed when the gun goes off. Soledad becomes a carrier of the <b>fungal</b> <b>growth</b> himself and flees with Eladio towards Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative {{brood care}} (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle {{to do so is}} the weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of tunnels, in the heartwood of Eucalyptus trees. It is one of more than 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels and maintain the <b>fungal</b> <b>growth,</b> probably never reproducing. Cooperative brood care is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested faeces of the adults.|$|E
5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam on the driver shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio of being an unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the day to make the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads to the grocery store where Gabrielle works, spreading the <b>fungal</b> <b>growth.</b> The agents later confront Soledad at the supermarket, discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem is}} ongoing, as are {{efforts to control}} the {{microbial}} and <b>fungal</b> <b>growths</b> in the cave.

5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. <b>Fungal</b> <b>growth</b> is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} towards colourisation was the {{restoration}} of the original negatives, which were in poor condition owing to extensive printing of the negative during the original theatrical release. Costly and labour-intensive restoration was essential before colourisation could be carried out. The negative was cleaned of <b>fungal</b> <b>growth,</b> damaged portions were restored, and missing parts of frames were re-instated. After cleaning, each of the 300,000 frames of the negative was scanned into a 10 megabytes-sized file and then was digitally restored. The entire restoration work was undertaken by Acris Lab, Chennai. The dialogues in the original soundtrack were also in a bad state of preservation, which necessitated having the sound cleaned at Chace Studio in the United States. The background score and the entire musical track was recreated by Naushad and Uttam Singh. For the songs, the original voices of the singers like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar were extracted from the original mixed track and the same were recreated with re-recorded score in 6.1 surround sound.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or {{sometimes}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground or}} on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar. The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B.mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B.mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for <b>fungal</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ergosterol {{involves}} in <b>fungal</b> cell <b>growth</b> as a {{major component}} in fungal cell membranes. It can be an indicator that shows the fungal activity, and its content depends on the <b>fungal</b> strains, culture, <b>growth</b> conditions and so on. In this study, <b>fungal</b> activities and <b>growth</b> patterns of three white-rot fungi strains isolated in Korea were evaluated by determination of ergosterol contents during the incubation. Wood decay test and chemical analyses of wood were also performed to verify the rela-tionship between fungal activity and wood degrading capacity of white-rot fungi for 60 days. In the results of experiments, it is considered that the test strains selectively degrade large amount of lignin in wood at the early stage of decay. Especially, Phanerochaete chrysosporium showed the best capability on selective degradation of lignin among the test fungi. It is sug-gested that the determination of ergosterol content in the fungal culture during the incubation is the simple and effective screening method of white-rot fungi for the application to biopulping of wood...|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of <b>fungal</b> <b>growth</b> include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{energy of the}} land is {{significantly}} affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and <b>fungal</b> <b>growth</b> (gravitropism), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the look of}} the Infected, the art team cycled through various iterations. Some early ideas included the Infected looking like aliens or zombies. The final design was chosen when lead character artist Michael Knowland incorporated images of diseases and <b>fungal</b> <b>growth</b> onto a human. He expressed the difficulty in changing the art from 2D to 3D, which would allow viewing from different angles. The process of sending completed concept art to the lighting and visual effects artists, who re-create the art within the game's engine. Due to the lack of artificial light sources in the game's world, the team was forced to work with natural light. To achieve high quality lighting, they used lightmaps. The use of lightmaps led to various problems, such as the discontinuities in the lighting; this was fixed by slightly modifying the texel intensities. When characters were added to scenes, they initially looked out of place; the addition of a shadow generally fixed this.|$|E

5|$|Suillus collinitus is {{the most}} {{frequent}} fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed {{in the south of}} France discovered that S.collinitus and S.mediterraneensis are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may {{play a key role in}} the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S.collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S.grevillei and S.spraguei, S.collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy. The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring <b>fungal</b> <b>growth</b> and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations.|$|E

5000|$|More {{extreme and}} outlandish giant squid size claims—belonging {{firmly in the}} realm of cryptozoology—have {{appeared}} in the works of authors such as Bernard Heuvelmans, Willy Ley, and Ivan T.

The existence of these gargantuan squids is often supported by reference to the giant circular scars sometimes found on sperm whales, which are assumed to have been inflicted by the suckers of struggling giant squid. Sometimes these claims are accompanied by extrapolations of body size based on the isometric upscaling of a [...] "typical" [...] giant squid. However, such scars are not necessarily of squid origin and may instead represent <b>fungal</b> <b>growths</b> or bite marks, with sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) being one possible source (Wood, 1982:193).

40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{the effects of}} varying osmotic and matric {{potential}} on <b>fungal</b> radial <b>growth</b> and accumulation of polyols were studied in three isolates of Pochonia chlamydosporia. <b>Fungal</b> radial <b>growth</b> was measured on potato dextrose agar modified osmotically using potassium chloride or glycerol. PEG 8000 was used to modify matric potential. When plotted, the radii of the colonies were found to grow linearly with time, and regression was applied to estimate the radial growth rate (mm day- 1). Samples of fresh mycelia from 25 -day-old cultures were collected and the quantity (mg g- 1 fresh biomass) of four polyols (glycerol, erythritol, arabitol and mannitol) and one sugar (glucose) was determined using HPLC. Results revealed that <b>fungal</b> radial <b>growth</b> rates decreased with increased osmotic or matric stress. Statistically significant differences in radial growth were found between isolates in response to matric stress (P< 0. 006) but not in response to osmotic stress (P= 0. 759). Similarly, differences in the total amounts of polyols accumulated by the fungus were found between isolates in response to matric stress (P< 0. 001), but not in response to osmotic stress (P= 0. 952). Under water stress, the fungus accumulated a combination of different polyols important in osmoregulation, which depended on the solute used to generate the stress. Arabitol and glycerol were the main polyols accumulated in osmotically modified media, whereas erythritol was the main polyol that was accumulated in media amended with PEG.
