But adulteration is not carried on {{to such an extent}} as is generally supposed. The majority of the people seem to think that the rare thing is getting food that is not adulterated. This is humorously expressed by a little poem written by Robert J.

Introduction: The {{question}} of <b>food</b> <b>adulterations</b> is of very great importance {{at the present}} time, since the greater amount of our food supply consists of canned and preserved products. Not many years ago, canned food products were considered luxuries, and only people of means could afford them, but as times have grovel better, {{there is a growing}} demand, by all classes of people, for the manufactured goods, and it id the producer trying to meet the popular demand that has, in c great measure, facilitated the manufacture of goods which must necessarily be inferior. The average individual wants the greatest quantity for the least money, regardless of the purity of the article purchased. Manufacturers cannot give high grade food for low prices. Hence the pure product is imitated by using cheap, undesirable, and often poisonous, substances, to give the desired flavor and color. This brings to mind an instance under my own observation. A woman was purchasing baking powder. The clerk showed her several of the better brands and gave prices. She remarked that she wanted something cheaper and when shown the ten cent can, she took it. The law of the state of New York defines <b>adulterations</b> of <b>food</b> as follows: The term food shall include every article of food and drink used and adulterations are (1) If any substance or substances has or have been mixed with it so as to reduce or lower, or injuriously affect, its quality or strength. (2) If any inferior or cheaper substance or substances have been substituted, wholly or in part, for the article. (3) If any valuable material has been wholly or in part abstracted...|$|R

50|$|The 1906 US Pure Food and Drug Act “defined <b>food</b> <b>adulterations</b> as {{a danger}} to health and as {{consumer}} fraud”. The “Meat Inspection Act,” which accompanied the law, made tax payers pay for the new regulation. The Department of Chemistry {{was transformed into a}} regulatory body charged with regulating packaging, labeling and protecting the consumer. The jam industry {{was one of the first}} to be subject to regulation. If a jam did not fit a certain standard of fruit-to-sugar-to-pectin ratio, it bore a “Compound Jam” label. After World War One, these companies, like BRED-SPRED, started aggressive marketing campaigns and attractive packaging to promote themselves. Branded with ‘distinctive names’ like “Peanut Spread” and “Salad Bouquet,” they sold a weak product (like a low ratio of peanuts, or weak vinegar) as high-quality substitutes. Similar deceptive labeling in canned foods prompted the McNary-Mapes Amendment in 1930 which “authorized standards of quality, condition, and/or fill-of-containers.” If a product was sub-standard, it had to display a ‘crepe label’ which read ‘below US standard, low quality, but not illegal’.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{possibilities}} offered by agent-base modelling techniques in evaluating the impact of alternative sets of innovation policies on the system where these are implemented and on its actors. The policies selected for this exercise are inspired by the Regional Government's policy document - the Programme for Rural Development (2007 - 2013) of the Puglia Region, Italy. These regard, inter alia, the promotion of organic agriculture and GMO-free cultivar, the introduction of a zero-food-miles strategy and new regulations and controls to prevent <b>food</b> <b>adulterations.</b> The paper presents and discusses the results of the simulations showing a trade-off between alternative growth paths and the overall structure of the sector. A "light-touch approach" affects positively smallholdings, associations of micro-small enterprises and the local retail sector by promoting shorter and more rewarding routes to markets for food products. Pursuing the policies more aggressively, will shift the focus of economic activities towards larger enterprises in the primary sector, manufacturing and business services and towards the large distribution for retail, while smallholdings and associations of micro-small enterprises will be increasingly marginalised. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

Introduction: The woman of today who would make her home a model of all {{it should be in}} point of beauty, cleanliness, healthfulness, and opportunities for ever larger development, must be the mistress of many sciences. If she would have her house constructed of proper materials and suitably located, and surrounded by the beauties of nature, she must know something of architecture and landscape gardening; for a pleasing interior the science of color and line harmony come into play. She must know physics and hydraulics that she may know that her house is properly plumbed, heated and ventilated. The science of economics enables her to watch intelligently the trend of business affairs and so plan wisely her own household affairs. The science of mathematics enables her to figure out her expenses - the cost of clothing and food - and thus use the family income to the best advantage. From physiology she learns the conditions of the body in health and disease, and from chemistry, the constituents of food, the effects of cookery on it, and the particular need each constituent subserves. Chemistry also teaches her the composition of the various cooking utensils she uses {{and the best way to}} take care of them; the mysteries of the fuel she burns and the ways of getting the greatest amount of heat from it; the effects of poisons, <b>food</b> <b>adulterations</b> an preservatives; the effects of various chemical substances used in the laundry upon her clothes; the composition of the water used for drinking and cooking; the dyeing of fabrics which are used as clothing, draperies and for fancy work...|$|R
