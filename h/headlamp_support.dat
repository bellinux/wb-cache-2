50|$|Model B {{was derived}} with as few {{technical}} changes {{as possible to}} keep cost low. Other than the engine, and badging on <b>headlamp</b> <b>support</b> bar (later: grille) and hub caps, it was virtually indistinguishable from the V-8. Its intention {{was to be a}} price leader, and as it offered more than the popular Model A, this should have been a winning formula. In fact, the new and only slightly more expensive V-8 stole the show, and finally made it obsolete. The V8 engine was previously exclusive to Lincoln products, which in 1932 switched to V12 engines only.|$|E
50|$|When the Model 40 {{and the new}} B were {{introduced}} February 9, 1933, revisions of the car were substantial, especially considering how important the 1932 change had been. For its second year, the wheelbase was stretched, from 106 in (2692 mm) to 112 in (2845 mm) on a new crossmember frame. The grille was revised, gaining a pointed forward slope at the bottom which resembled either a shovel or the 1932 Packard Light Eight. Both the grille and hood louvers curved down and forward. The overall design and grille were inspired by the English Ford Model Y. Streamlining was further accentuated by the new hood which now covered the cowl, giving an impression of more length. In addition, there were more rounded and skirted fenders and new, elegantly bowed bumpers. <b>Headlamp</b> <b>support</b> bars were no longer in use, and there were new wire wheels. The cars got a new dashboard with instruments set in an oval insert {{in front of the}} driver. There was a glove box on the passenger side. Closed Deluxe models received heavy DI-NOC woodgraining on dash and window frames, and there were deeper seat cushions.|$|E
50|$|A {{headstock}} of a {{rail vehicle}} is a transverse structural member {{located at the}} extreme end of the vehicle's underframe. The headstock supports the coupling at that end of the vehicle, and may also support buffers, in which case {{it may also be}} known as a buffer beam. The headstocks form part of the underframe of a locomotive or a railroad car. The headstocks of locomotives, railcars and cabcars also <b>support</b> <b>headlamps</b> and the hoses for air brakes, vacuum brakes as well as the cables for train control and head end power.|$|R
