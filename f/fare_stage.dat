50|$|Kaniyapuram {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} {{developing}} town in Trivandrum district.The upcoming Technocity on the left side and technopark on the right both of which are 2 km from the town. The National Highway (NH47) passes through Kaniyapuram junction dividing the town into two. The main features of Kaniyapuram are the Bus Stand in the National Highway and Railway Station, which are situated very close to each other. There is no other place in between Trivandrum and Quilon towns with this feature. The KSRTC (Kerala State Road Transport Corporation) bus depot has about 40 buses, originating and terminating from/in Kaniyapuram.This is the only depot which has no <b>fare</b> <b>stage</b> for Fast passenger and Super fast buses. Unfortunately, only a few trains stop at the Kaniyapuram Railway station though efforts are being undertaken to establish stops for some express trains.Proximity to government establishments, business places, educational institutions such as Technopark, Power Grid, CRPF Base, KINFRA Park, LNCPE, University Campus, Marian Engineering College, St. Xavier's College, Teacher's Education College and numerous schools etc. has also put Kaniyapuram on the state maps. At present Kaniyapuram area {{is one of the}} most developing areas around Trivandrum city.|$|E
5000|$|The {{middle section}} of the line passed through thinly {{populated}} marshy farmland. The line was single track with passing places ("loops" [...] in railway parlance) every half mile. The points {{at the ends of}} the loops were spring loaded as the line was unsignalled, motormen drove by line of sight. All eight passing loops served as halts, with passengers alighting onto cinders beside the tracks. For the benefit of the few who took advantage of these facilities in the early years each passing loop carried its number on a metal plate. Initially the halts were known as No. 1 Passing Place, No. 2 Passing Place etc. Some were named informally at first, but these names stuck and had become official by 1915. No. 5 Passing Place, however, was [...] "in the middle of nowhere" [...] with no road access or building in sight. Its position as the only passing place in an over 2 mile stretch and its status as a <b>fare</b> <b>stage</b> meant that it was retained as a halt which featured on tickets, though it is not mentioned in the GCR Timetables of 1915 or 1919, nor the July 1922 Bradshaw, appearing regularly only from LNER days. In the early days it served a rifle range which pre-dated the tramway. It kept its prosaic name until the line closed in 1961.|$|E

To help speed boarding times the fares were restructured to multiples of 3d. <b>Fare</b> <b>stages</b> at regular 0.85 mi intervals were introduced in December 1975 to further simplify the fare structure.

50|$|In 1954, Metropolitan Toronto ("Metro") was created, {{covering}} the whole present {{area of the}} City of Toronto. The TTC took on responsibility for transit within the entire area. A flat fare was {{not considered to be}} feasible for so large an area; so the TTC created the Central Zone, which roughly incorporated the City of Toronto, and set up a series of concentric semicircular rings around it as Suburban Zone 1, 2, etc., with an additional fare required for each one. Routes extending beyond the Metro limit continued to be separate radial routes, so the zones still had the effect of <b>fare</b> <b>stages,</b> but, within Metro, it became possible to change buses within a suburban zone.This external link shows a route map of this period. The (roughly rectangular) Metro limit is not marked on the map, but Suburban Zone 2 extends to just reach this limit in the north and the southwest only; the Port Credit bus and part of the North Yonge bus are the only TTC routes then extending outside Metro.|$|R

40|$|The bus {{transport}} {{industry in}} Sri Lanka {{has an important}} role to play as public transport. It’s performance affects the economic activity in various ways. Therefore an efficient public transport system is considered a highly required condition for faster economic growth and social progress in the country. However, the public transport sector in Sri Lanka especially the bus transport suffers many deficiencies {{due to the lack of}} effective and consistent policy to guide the sector. Basically bus fare is one of the most important factors regarding profit maximization in the industry as well as providing a quality service to the passengers. If not people are not interested to invest their money and they don’t stay in the industry for long. Therefore it needed a policy regarding bus fare which comes to affect a policy for the fare revisions since 2002. This policy has guided the industry to make fare revisions in scientific way. Anyhow there is a question arises that the rate which decided to revise the bus fare earlier and after introducing the policy is comparatively reasonable with other economic indicators. On the other hand it is important to examine that the rate which decided to revise the fare is reasonably applied to the individual <b>fare</b> <b>stages</b> which consist different segment of distance. Generally the accepted idea is that the short distance fare was overpriced and long distance services were under priced. This situation badly affected to the industry where the quality of the services are not improved comparatively with the increase of bus fare. Before nationalization bus fare was revised few times and available data of that are insufficient to analyze. Therefore this study mainly focused to analyze the existing fare structure which comes from nationalization of the bus transport. The bus fare was revised 25 times since 1958 under the different institutional structure and the analysis further useful to identify the period which mostly affected the collapse the uniformity of the fare structure. Basically qualities of the services depend on its price level. However the fare level in bus transport also needs to examine how fare structure affects the quality of the services. It is evident that the passenger’s views and level of satisfaction on bus transport to be identified by a survey. This study also emphasizes to recognize certain improvements to the existing fare structure which possible to achieve a better service from the bus industry...|$|R
