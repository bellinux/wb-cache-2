The primary objectives are to investigate the pilot flame dynamics and to provide bases {{for the study of}} the interaction mechanisms between the pilot flame and the main flame. Dynamic pressures are measured by dynamic pressure transducers. A high speed camera with CH∗ bandpass filter is used to capture the pilot flame dynamics. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to further analyze the high speed images. With the increase of the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> the pilot flame changes from stable to unstable state gradually. The combustion instability frequency is 136 Hz when the pilot flame is unstable. Numerical simulation results show that the equivalence ratios in both the shear layer and the recirculation zone increase as the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> increases. The mechanism of the {{instability of}} the pilot flame can be attributed to the coupling between the second order acoustic mode and the unsteady heat release due to symmetric vortex shedding.

40|$|The {{validity}} {{and accuracy of}} performance measurements for pulse detonation engines depend {{on the ability to}} accurately measure thrust and <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> during system operation. Experimental tests have revealed that when <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> are calculated by conventional mass metering methods, incorrect values of the aggregate <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> in the combustor will often be calculated due to inaccurate assumptions regarding the spatial fuel distribution. The difficulty in predicting the actual fuel distribution affects the ability to achieve reliable detonations for successful operation and introduces inaccuracies directly into the performance calculations. Tunable diode laser and absorption spectroscopy techniques have been applied to provide time-resolved <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction measurements and improve the fidelity of the specific impulse calculations. Results show that stratified fuel distributions that begin near stoichiometric at the forward end of the combustor and gradually become fuel lean near the combustor exit produce substantially higher specific impulse values than axially uniform fuel distributions with the same amount of aggregate fuel due to the ability to reliably detonate while operating at an overall lean condition. Axially uniform fuel distributions at the same average equivalence ratio demonstrated lower detonability and accordingly had lower thrust and specific impulse values.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{turbines}} blades erosion {{on the performance}} of a twin shafts gas turbine engine for helicopter propulsion are investigated by simulation. The engine behavior has been simulated by a mathematical model extensively validated. In order to understand the effects of low (LPT) and high (HPT) pressure turbine stator erosion (increase of throat section and blade thickness reduction according to the experimental evidence from the engine tests from Piaggio Aero Industries), the LPT and HPT performance have been simulated and their performance maps have been obtained {{with a high level of}} accuracy. Nine degradation levels have been considered. The introduction of the modified turbine characteristics into the gas turbine simulator has allowed to estimate the degradation effects on the overall engine performance, both in constant <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (engine on the test bed), and engine running under effective operative conditions (engine installed on the helicopter) with the addition of the fuel control module into the simulator...|$|E

Nowadays utilization of highly efficient and low pollutant power production systems {{is one of the}} primacies and attractive topics for researchers. Solid oxide fuel cells are such systems; and their capabilities to integrate with power cycles such as gas turbine cycles propose a hybrid system for future power plant. This study examines the performance a natural-gas-fed tabular solid-oxide fuel cell combined with a conventional recuperative gas turbine power plant. The overall system performance is analyzed by analyzing all components separately. Also a parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of various parameters such as compressor Pressure ratio and <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> on the cycle energy performance, entropy generation rate, SOFC power, electrical power and C 02 emission. The results revealed that it is possible for this system to reach a first law efficiency of about 60 % and optimum entropy generation rate at that of gas turbine. ej 201...|$|E
40|$|New {{computational}} {{procedures are}} proposed {{for evaluating the}} exhaust brake specific mass emissions of each pollutant species in internal combustion (IC) engines. The procedures start from the chemical reaction of fuel with combustion air and, {{based on the measured}} exhaust raw emissions THC, CH 4, NOx, CO, O 2, CO 2, calculate the volume fractions of the compounds in the exhaust gases, including those that are not usually measured, such as water, nitrogen and hydrogen. The molecular mass of the exhaust gases is then evaluated and the brake specific emissions can be obtained if the exhaust <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and the engine power output are measured. The algorithm can also be applied to the evaluation of air/fuel ratio from measured raw volume emissions of IC engines. The new procedures take the effects of various fuel and combustion air compositions into account, with particular reference to different natural gas blends {{as well as to the}} presence of water vapor, CO 2, Ar and He in the combustion air. In the paper, the algorithms are applied to the evaluation of air-fuel ratio and brake specific mass emissions in an automotive bi-fuel Spark Ignition (SI) engine with multipoint sequential port-fuel injection. The experimental tests were carried out in a wide range of steady-state operating conditions under both gasoline and compressed natural gas operations. The specific emissions calculated from the new procedures are compared to those evaluated by applying Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and International Standards Organization (ISO) recommended practices and the air-fuel ratio results are compared to those obtained either from directly measured air and <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> or from Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor data. The sensitivity of the procedure results to the main engine working parameters, the influence of environmental conditions (in particular the effect of air humidity on NOx formation) and the experimental uncertainties are also determined...|$|R
40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center {{to study}} the {{transient}} response of the burner-generated spherical diffusion flame caused by its initial displacement from the steady-state position. The experiment involved issuing H 2 /CH 4 /inert mixtures of constant <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> from a bronze, porous, 1. 27 -cm-diameter, spherical burner into atmospheric air. The experimental results on the flame trajectory were found to agree well with those obtained through fully transient computational simulation with detailed chemistry and transport, and appropriate initial conditions. Further-more, although steady-state behavior should exist for such flames, the experimental and computational results indicated that it cannot be reached within the 2. 2 -s microgravity duration for the fuels and mass-flow rates tested. To assess the role of radiation on the flame dynamics and extinction, computations were performed without radiation, with radiation employing the optically thin approximation, and with radiation utilizing a detailed emission/absorption statistical narrow band (SNB) model. The computation showed that while the influence of radiative heat loss on {{the position of the}} flame is small, proper consideration of radiative effects is crucial in assessing the state of flame extinction. Specifically, while all simulations of the experimental cases studied incorporating radiative heat loss revealed that the flame extinguishes well before the attainment of steady state, simulations accounting for gaseous reabsorption of radiative emissions were required to adequately represent the experiments in terms of extinction time, with the optically thin simulations predicting premature extinction during the flame expansion process. Effects of heat loss to the porous burner were also examined, and the lack of correspondence between the visible flame luminosity and flame strength, as related to flame temperature and heat release rate, was noted. © 2001 by The Combustion Institut...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{mobility}} {{has become}} a major issue for internal combustion engines and has led to increasing research efforts in the field of alternative fuels, such as bio-fuel, CNG and hydrogen addition, as well as into engine design and control optimization. To that end, a thorough control of the air-to-fuel ratio appears to be mandatory in SI engine {{in order to meet the}} even more stringent thresholds set by the current regulations. The accuracy of the air/fuel mixture highly depends on the injection system dynamic behavior and to its coupling to the engine fluid-dynamic. Thus, a sound investigation into the mixing process can only be achieved provided that a proper analysis of the injection rail and of the injectors is carried out. The present paper carries out a numerical investigation into the fluid dynamic behavior of a commercial CNG injection system by means of a 0 D- 1 D code. The model has been validated by comparing the experimental readings to the numerical outputs in terms of injection system pressure profiles versus time. The model has hence been applied to the prediction of the pressure waves produced by the injection event and of their effect on the actually injected fuel. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the predictive model. A general good match between the predicted values and the measured rail pressure and injected <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> has been observed over a wide range of engine operation conditions. Moreover, the dynamic simulations have brought out a reduced independence of the injected <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> on the average rail pressure level, which further reduced for increasing engine power outputs. Moreover, the results have proved that the correct simulation of the system behavior relies on the consistent characterization of the pressure regulator functioning. It is worth observing that the full fluid dynamic characterization of the rail allows for the design of optimal control strategies so as to meet the engine requirement...|$|R
