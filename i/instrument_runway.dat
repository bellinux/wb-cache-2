40|$|In {{this work}} it was {{necessary}} to get acquainted with the problems concerning the development of airports at first. The essential idea was : "the first step was to construct an airplane, and the construction of an airport came only after it. " The airports were classified according to the classification made by our Ministry of Transport and according to legal enactments. Airports of thirty-seven states out of forty-one states of Europe were rated. The resting four countries couldn´t be rated, because they don´t have their own airports. The aim of this work was to gather the set of main international airports of the individual states of European area. A comparing analysis according to the runway system, to <b>instrument</b> <b>runway,</b> to category for fire fighting, to number of passengers and the distance from the centre of the capital was made. Another aim was a comparing analysis. This analysis was realized by means of charts and diagrams in Excel programme. In the last part of this work individual airports were compared...|$|E
5000|$|Precision <b>instrument</b> <b>runways,</b> {{which are}} found at medium- and large-size {{airports}}, {{consist of a}} blast pad/stopway (optional, for airports handling jets), threshold, designator, centerline, aiming point, and 500 ft, 1000 ft/1500 ft, 2000 ft, 2500 ft, and 3000 ft touchdown zone marks. Precision runways provide both horizontal and vertical guidance for instrument approaches.|$|R

40|$|Unsteady state gait {{involving}} net accelerations {{has been}} studied overground and on a treadmill.

This study documents the differences in ground reaction forces for accelerated running on an <b>instrumented</b> <b>runway</b> and running on an accelerating treadmill by building a theoretical framework which is experimentally put to the test. It is demonstrated that, in contrast to overground, no mean fore-after force impulse should be generated to follow an accelerating treadmill due to the absence of linear whole body acceleration. Accordingly, the adaptations in the braking phase (less braking) and propulsive phase (more propulsion) to accelerate overground are not present to follow an accelerating treadmill. It can be concluded that running on an accelerating treadmill is mechanically different from accelerated running overground...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on joint movement and load transfer efficiency (LTE) was evaluated {{based on data}} collected from an <b>instrumented</b> <b>runway</b> at Denver International Airport (DIA). The measured pavement temperature data from DIA was compared with an existing heat transfer model, the Integrated Climatic Model. Good agreement was obtained between the measured and predicted temperature differential and the average pavement temperature for airport concrete pavements. Average pavement temperature significantly affected the dummy and doweled joint movement. Hinged joints were not affected by changes in the average pavement temperature. The doweled and dummy joint movements varied {{the most in the}} fall season. The doweled and dummy joint movements were also restricted during certain periods in the summer due to the joint completely closing. The average pavement temperature affected the LTE of dummy joints due to its affect on aggregate interlock. A new correlation was developed between LTE and average pavement temperature for dummy joints. The LTE of dummy joints was found to be less than 50 percent for 55 percent of the year. The LTE of doweled and hinged joints were not significantly affected by changes in average pavement temperature. Hinged joints at DIA were found to be the most effective in transfer load between adjacent slabs...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model was used to analyze runway pavement responses under moving aircraft tire loading. The analysis modeled an <b>instrumented</b> <b>runway</b> at Cagliari Elmas airport in Sardinia, Italy, with a 350 -mm asphalt layer, a 400 -mm granular base layer, and subgrade. The {{finite element model}} characterized the asphalt layer as a linear viscoelastic material, and two interface bonding conditions between asphalt layers (full bonding and partial debonding) {{were used in the}} analysis. The aircraft tire loading was simulated with a nontraditional loading assumption that represented the nonuniform distribution of tire contact stresses along contact length and width under five ribs of an aircraft tire. Analysis results showed that a traditional loading assumption that assumed uniform contact stresses at the tire-pavement interface underestimated the critical tensile and shear strains in the asphalt layer. In particular, the relatively high contact stresses at tire edge ribs under heavy aircraft loading caused significant shear stresses at the pavement near-surface. The pavement responses under various loading conditions (aircraft type, wheel load, and speed) were calculated, and the critical responses were identified. Good agreements were achieved when the calculated pavement responses (vertical pressure and horizontal strain) at various locations were compared with the measured responses from field instrumentation. The model results showed that partial debonding between asphalt layers caused much greater tensile strains {{at the bottom of the}} whole asphalt layer...|$|R
40|$|Demand for air {{transportation}} has been increasing. A {{response to this}} is enhancing the runway utilization and throughput before investing on new <b>runways</b> or <b>instruments.</b> <b>Runway</b> through-put can be increased by reducing in-trail landing separation between aircraft, but the consequence may {{be an increase in}} the chance of a severe wake vortex encounter or a simultaneous runway occu-pancy (or go-around). Current instrument flight rule (IFR) standards provide fixed separation minima for given pairs of wake vortex weight classes of aircraft. In practice, the observed separation is a random variable and fluctuates near or above the specified minimum. In this paper, we propose a framework for statistical separation standards that specifies not only a lower bound for the separation but also a standard for the target value and the variance of the process. We address the question of what a more efficient separation standard is in order to control the risk in the approach process. We also consider whether separation variability may be re-duced by employing such standards, i. e. more detailed standards that take the “realized vari-ability ” into account. Analytical {{results of this study suggest}} that (under specific assumptions) through-put can be increased to some extent without degrading safety for the given facilities, infra-structure, and weather condition. The arguments and concepts are illustrated with statistical observa-tions from Detroit airport (DTW). ...|$|R

40|$|Arboreal {{animals with}} prehensile hands must balance the complex demands of bone strength, {{grasping}} and manipulation. An informative {{example of this}} problem {{is that of the}} aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a rare lemuriform primate that is unusual in having exceptionally long, gracile fingers specialized for foraging. In addition, they are among the largest primates to engage in head-first descent on arboreal supports, a posture that should increase loads on their gracile digits. We test the hypothesis that aye-ayes will reduce pressure on their digits during locomotion by curling their fingers off the substrate. This hypothesis was tested using simultaneous videographic and pressure analysis of the hand, foot and digits for five adult aye-ayes during horizontal locomotion and during ascent and descent on a 30 degrees <b>instrumented</b> <b>runway.</b> Aye-ayes consistently curled their fingers during locomotion on all slopes. When the digits were in contact with the substrate, pressures were negligible and significantly less than those experienced by the palm or pedal digits. In addition, aye-ayes lifted their hands vertically off the substrate instead of 'toeing-off' and descended head-first at significantly slower speeds than on other slopes. Pressure on the hand increased during head-first descent relative to horizontal locomotion {{but not as much as}} the pressure increased on the foot during ascent. This distribution of pressure suggests that aye-ayes shift their weight posteriorly during head-first descent to reduce loads on their gracile fingers. This research demonstrates several novel biomechanical trade-offs to deal with complex functional demands on the mammalian skeleton...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze runway pavement responses under moving aircraft tire loading using a developed three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element (FE) model. The <b>instrumented</b> <b>runway</b> at Cagliari-Elmas airport (Sardegna, Italy) was modeled in the analysis, which consists of a 350 -mm asphalt layer, a 400 -mm granular base layer, and subgrade. The FE model characterized the asphalt layer as a linear viscoelastic material, and two interface bonding conditions between asphalt layers (full bonding and partial debonding) were used in the analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{describe}} the biomechanics of spontaneous walk-to-run transitions (WRTs) in humans. After minimal instructions, 17 physically active subjects performed WRTs on an <b>instrumented</b> <b>runway,</b> enabling measurement of speed, acceleration, spatiotemporal variables, ground reaction forces and 3 D kinematics. The present study describes (1) the mechanical energy fluctuations of the body centre-of-mass (BCOM) as a reflection of the whole-body dynamics and (2) the joint kinematics and kinetics. Consistent with previous research, the spatiotemporal variables showed a sudden switch from walking to running in one transition step. During this step there was a sudden increase in forward speed, the so-called speed jump (0. 42 m s(- 1)). At total body level, this was reflected in a sudden increase in energy of the BCOM (0. 83 +/- 0. 14 J kg(- 1)) and an abrupt change from an out-of-phase to an in-phase organization of the kinetic and potential energy fluctuations. During the transition step a larger net propulsive impulse compared with the preceding and following steps was observed due to a decrease in the braking impulse. This suggests that the altered landing configuration (prepared during the last 40 % of the preceding swing) places the body in an optimal configuration to minimize this braking impulse. We hypothesize this configuration also evokes a reflex allowing a more powerful push off, which generates enough power to complete the transition and launch the first flight phase. This powerful push-off was also reflected in the vertical ground reaction force, which suddenly changed to a running pattern...|$|R
