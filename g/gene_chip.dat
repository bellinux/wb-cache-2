50|$|Current cancer {{research}} makes use primarily of DNA microarrays {{in which an}} arrayed series of microscopic spots of pre-defined DNA oligonucleotides known as probes are covalently attached to a solid surface such as glass, forming {{what is known as}} a <b>gene</b> <b>chip.</b> DNA labeled with fluorophores (target) is prepared from a sample such as a tumor biopsy and is hybridized to the complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences on the <b>gene</b> <b>chip.</b> The chip is then scanned for the presence and strength of the fluorescent labels at each spot representing probe-target hybrids. The level of fluorescence at a particular spot provides quantitative information about the expression of the particular gene corresponding to the spotted cDNA sequence. DNA microarrays evolved from Southern blotting which allows for detection of a specific DNA sequence in a sample of DNA.|$|E

5000|$|A {{different}} {{application of}} microarray technology {{that has become}} the gold standard for RNA analysis in recent years is the widespread utilization of expression microarrays, or [...] "gene chips". <b>Gene</b> <b>chip</b> preparation calls for the quantitative reverse transcription of the total cellular RNA pool into labeled and fragmented single-strand DNA prior to hybridization-based capture. Up- and down-regulation of genes in response to stressors or disease states are quantitatively compared in cell lines and organisms. Coupled expression microarray and quantitative proteomics experiments have allowed for the in-depth exploration of the oftentimes non-linear relationship between the abundance of a particular transcribed message and that of its corresponding translated protein. These integrative studies, partially enabled by quantitative DNA microarray technology, have been successfully applied to a variety of biological systems, including yeast, bovine, mouse, bacterial, and human. The expression analysis community has amassed such a significant amount of expression microarray data that they are freely available in public databases.|$|E
50|$|Cannabinoid receptors are G-protein coupled receptors {{located on}} the pre-synaptic membrane. While {{there have been some}} papers that have linked {{concurrent}} stimulation of dopamine and CB1 receptors to an acute rise in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, it is generally accepted that CB1 activation via cannabinoids causes a decrease in cAMP concentration by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a rise in the concentration of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). The relative potency of different cannabinoids in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase correlates with their varying efficacy in behavioral assays. This inhibition of cAMP is followed by phosphorylation and subsequent activation of not only a suite of MAP kinases (p38/p42/p44), but also the PI3/PKB and MEK/ERK pathway (Galve-Roperh et al., 2002; Davis et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2006). Results from rat hippocampal <b>gene</b> <b>chip</b> data after acute administration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) showed an increase in the expression of transcripts encoding myelin basic protein, endoplasmic proteins, cytochrome oxidase, and two cell adhesion molecules: NCAM, and SC1; decreases in expression were seen in both calmodulin and ribosomal RNAs (Kittler et al., 2000). In addition, CB1 activation has been demonstrated to increase the activity of transcription factors like c-Fos and Krox-24 (Graham et al., 2006).|$|E

Methods: The rat model with degenerated cervical intervertebral discs caused by imbalance between the dynamic and static forces was established. The mRNA was extracted from the cervical intervertebral discs of rats in the normal control and experiment groups, and the cDNA probes were obtained by inverse transcript.

40|$|AbstractDiagnosis of {{and therapy}} for early-stage tumors has the {{potential}} to decrease morbidity and mortality among patients with such malignancies. Although promising advances in imaging technology and other diagnostic modalities have been achieved, evidence that primary cancers begin shedding neoplastic cells into the circulation at an early stage is accumulating. Specifically, approximately 106 cells are shed daily per gram of tumor. Thus, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a potential source for the noninvasive and early diagnosis of cancers. Several studies have indicated that a preoperative detection of micrometastases may reflect the transient shedding of tumor cells, metastatic potential, or residual disease, but that postoperative micrometastases are likely to indicate minimal residual disease. Such neoplastic cells may be present in the bloodstream in very low numbers and would be difficult to detect by conventional methods. In this article, we introduce a highly sensitive <b>gene</b> <b>chip</b> analysis method, developed from a colorimetric membrane array into a weighted enzymatic chip array, to detect the gene clusters of CTCs. This <b>gene</b> <b>chip</b> method provides a fast and accurate analysis of gene clusters, with performance that is substantially better than that of traditional biochemical examinations.
