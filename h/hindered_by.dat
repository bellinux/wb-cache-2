5|$|In the aftermath, {{air rescue}} {{operations}} were conducted, but {{the destruction of}} roads in the area hindered convoys carrying aid. Planes also made supply drops, but rescue operations were <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> broken roads and rails. Survivors were vaccinated against typhoid and tetanus. Part of Manzanillo was placed under quarantine.|$|E
5|$|James Buchanan {{was easily}} elected President in 1856.

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in Yorkshire, the {{majority}} of location filming was moved to Buckinghamshire, although Levisham railway station {{and the surrounding area}} in North Yorkshire were used. The location shooting of the film began on 18 August 1986, at St. Mary's church in Radnage. Filming was periodically <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> inclement weather – the perfect summer in which the book was set was not forthcoming, and scenes were filmed during breaks in heavy rain. Interiors were shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Early in his term, Morehead {{approved}} two new bank charters, but {{he later}} vetoed several others, {{beginning with the}} proposed Bank of Harrodsburg. Many other proposed bank charters died in the General Assembly. The later years of Morehead's administration were <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> the financial Panic of 1857. In December 1857, he reported state expenditures of $21,000 for relief of the poor.|$|E

5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> war, {{diseases}} and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to dissipate because of strong wind shear. Moving little, its development was constantly <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> wind shear. The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of taller buildings during the 1870s was <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> the financial Panic of 1873 {{and the ensuing}} economic depression, which lasted until around 1879. Construction slowed, and property values slumped. By 1880, however, the recovery was well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871, and the economic upturn making the {{construction of}} taller buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions {{for the development of}} the skyscraper.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the day, Warren's {{squadron}} closed {{from the}} north-east while Bompart made frantic {{efforts to reach}} open water. Both fleets were <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> a gale which swept the sea shortly before 20:00. All three of Hoches topmasts were blown down and her mizzensail shredded, leaving her substantially slower than her compatriots and forcing them to hold back in her defence. Other ships suffered too, as the French Résolue sprang a severe leak and HMS Anson lost her mizzenmast and several topmasts.|$|E
5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E

5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> a desire to promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E

5000|$|There is an {{argument}} in political economy that foreign aid could have the same negative effects on the long run towards development {{as in the case}} of the resource curse. The so-called "aid curse" [...] results from giving perverse political incentives on a weak body of civil servants, lowering politicians accountability towards citizens and decreasing economic pressure thanks to the income of an unearned resource to mitigate economic crisis. When foreign aid represents a major source of revenue to the government and especially in low-income countries the state building capacity <b>hinders</b> <b>by</b> undermining responsiveness toward taxpayers or by decreasing the incentive for the government to look for different sources of income or the increase in taxation.|$|R
5|$|Because the {{advancement}} of his legal career had been <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance. This was not an immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition, but {{in the summer of}} 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London. Hogg embarked on a course of study in preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds. This setback upset Hogg greatly, and he became very bitter about it. A lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831.|$|E
5|$|Congregation is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band The Afghan Whigs, released on January 31, 1992, by Sub Pop. After touring {{for two years in}} support of their 1990 album Up in It, the band received $15,000 advance from Sub Pop to record a follow-up album. It was primarily recorded at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville and Buzz's Kitchen in Los Angeles during July to August 1991. The band's frontman Greg Dulli produced the album entirely with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. The album's production and release were <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> Sub Pop's financial difficulties, which were eventually resolved by the massive commercial success of Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are <b>hindered</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that}} some species are {{difficult}} to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
