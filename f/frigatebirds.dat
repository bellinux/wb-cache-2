5|$|<b>Frigatebirds</b> are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus have been recovered from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from magnificent and great <b>frigatebirds</b> of the Galapagos Islands. <b>Frigatebirds</b> tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E
5|$|<b>Frigatebirds</b> will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although <b>frigatebirds</b> are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great <b>frigatebirds</b> stealing from masked boobies estimated that the <b>frigatebirds</b> could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{including}} <b>frigatebirds,</b> gulls, and skuas, {{engage in}} kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism {{is thought to}} be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great <b>frigatebirds</b> stealing from masked boobies estimated that the <b>frigatebirds</b> stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>frigatebird</b> {{was first}} {{described}} as Atagen ariel by the English zoologist George Gray in 1845 from a specimen collected on Raine Island, Queensland, Australia. The lesser <b>frigatebird</b> {{is one of}} five closely related species belonging to the genus Fregata. The other four are: the great <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata minor), the Christmas <b>frigatebird</b> (Frigata andrewsi), the magnificent <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata magnificens) and the Ascension <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata aquila). The genus is {{the only member of the}} Fregatidae family.|$|R

50|$|The Christmas <b>frigatebird</b> or Christmas Island <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata andrewsi) is a seabird of the <b>frigatebird</b> family Fregatidae {{which is}} endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.|$|R
5|$|The Fregatidae are {{a sister}} group to Suloidea which {{consists}} of cormorants, darters, gannets, and boobies. Three of the five extant species of <b>frigatebirds</b> are widespread, (the magnificent, great and lesser <b>frigatebirds)</b> while two are endangered (the Christmas Island and Ascension Island <b>frigatebirds)</b> and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus Limnofregata, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of parental care in <b>frigatebirds</b> {{is among the}} longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids. <b>Frigatebirds</b> take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great <b>frigatebirds</b> in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine {{years of age and}} by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.|$|E
5|$|As <b>frigatebirds</b> rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, {{overfishing}} threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As <b>frigatebirds</b> nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they {{are vulnerable to}} local disasters that could wipe out the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnificent}} <b>frigatebird</b> {{was originally}} considered {{to belong to}} the species Fregata aquila but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed that the magnificent <b>frigatebird</b> should be considered as a separate species with the binomial name Fregata magnificens. Of the four other species within the Fregata genus, genetic analysis has shown that the magnificent <b>frigatebird</b> is most closely related to the Ascension <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata aquila).|$|R
50|$|The Christmas <b>frigatebird</b> {{was once}} {{considered}} {{to belong to}} the species Fregata aquila but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed that the Christmas <b>frigatebird</b> should be considered as a separate species with the binomial name Fregata andrewsi in honour of the English paleontogist Charles Andrews. Of the four other species within the Fregata genus, genetic analysis has shown that the Christmas <b>frigatebird</b> is most closely related to the great <b>frigatebird.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{juvenile}} <b>frigatebird</b> found {{dying in}} 1953 in Tiree, Scotland was identified {{at the time}} as magnificent <b>frigatebird</b> but the specimen was re-examined in 2002 and found to be an Ascension <b>frigatebird.</b> In July 2013 a juvenile was photographed at Bowmore on the island of Islay in Scotland.|$|R
5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, <b>frigatebirds</b> are {{essentially}} aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great <b>frigatebirds</b> could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. <b>Frigatebirds</b> bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, <b>frigatebirds</b> do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|The {{average life}} span is unknown but {{in common with}} seabirds such as the {{wandering}} albatross and Leach's storm petrel, <b>frigatebirds</b> are long-lived. In 2002, 35 ringed great <b>frigatebirds</b> were recovered on Tern Island in the Hawaiian Islands. Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} seabirds, <b>frigatebirds</b> drink {{freshwater}} {{when they come}} across it, by swooping down and gulping with their bills.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata ariel) is a seabird of the <b>frigatebird</b> family Fregatidae. At around 75 cm (30 in) in length, {{it is the}} {{smallest}} species of <b>frigatebird.</b> It occurs over tropical and subtropical waters across the Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as off the Atlantic coast of Brazil.|$|R
50|$|The Ascension <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata aquila) is a seabird of the <b>frigatebird</b> family Fregatidae which breeds on Boatswain Bird Island and Ascension Island in the {{tropical}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
50|$|The great <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata minor) {{is a large}} seabird in the <b>frigatebird</b> family. Major nesting {{population}}s {{are found in the}} Pacific (including the Galapagos Islands) and Indian Oceans, as well as a population in the South Atlantic.|$|R
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, <b>frigatebirds</b> have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. <b>Frigatebirds</b> also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. <b>Frigatebirds</b> have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of <b>frigatebirds</b> due to their association with large marine predators. <b>Frigatebirds</b> also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Maritime {{folklore}} {{around the}} time America was discovered held that <b>frigatebirds</b> were birds of good omen as their presence meant land was near.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnificent}} <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata magnificens) is a seabird of the <b>frigatebird</b> family Fregatidae. With {{a length}} of 89 - 114 cm {{it is the largest}} species of <b>frigatebird.</b> It occurs over tropical and subtropical waters off America, between northern Mexico and Ecuador on the Pacific coast and between Florida and southern Brazil along the Atlantic coast. There are also populations on the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific and the Cape Verde islands in the Atlantic.|$|R

5|$|<b>Frigatebirds</b> {{remain in}} the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their {{feathers}} would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking off again.|$|E
5|$|<b>Frigatebirds</b> {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur {{at any time of}} year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{consistently}} shown that pelicans, the namesake {{family of the}} Pelecaniformes, are actually {{more closely related to}} herons, ibises and spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill than to the remaining species. In recognition of this, the order comprising the <b>frigatebirds</b> and Suloidea was renamed Suliformes in 2010.|$|E

5|$|This {{catch-all}} category {{refers to}} other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up. Kleptoparasites are seabirds {{that make a}} part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. Most famously, <b>frigatebirds</b> and skuas engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other species will steal food opportunistically. The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy. Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of the}} diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great <b>frigatebirds</b> stealing from masked boobies estimated that the <b>frigatebirds</b> could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%. Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises, as will giant petrels. Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses. Some species will also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.|$|E
5|$|A {{cladistic}} {{study of}} the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the <b>frigatebirds</b> formed a clade with Limnofregata. Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae, unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17. The age of Limnofregata indicates that these lineages had separated by the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as <b>frigatebirds,</b> skuas, other terns or large gulls.|$|E
