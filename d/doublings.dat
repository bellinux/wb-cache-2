5|$|Asplenium bradleyi, {{commonly}} known as Bradley's spleenwort or cliff spleenwort, is a rare epipetric fern of east-central North America. Named after Professor Frank Howe Bradley, who first collected it in Tennessee, it may be found infrequently {{throughout much of the}} Appalachian Mountains, the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains, growing in small crevices on exposed sandstone cliffs. The species originated as a hybrid between mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron); A.bradleyi originated when that sterile diploid hybrid underwent chromosome doubling to become a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as allopolyploidy. Studies indicate that the present population of Bradley's spleenwort arose from several independent <b>doublings</b> of sterile diploid hybrids. A.bradleyi can also form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts.|$|E

40|$|THE EFFECT OF PROTAMINE, A POLYCATIONIC PROTEIN ON MESOTHELIAL PERMEABILITY ANDULTRASTRUCTURE WAS EVALUATED IN A RAT MODEL OF PERITONAL DIALYSIS. PERITONEALPERMEABILITY TO UREA AND INULIN WERE MEASURED AFTER INTRAPERITONEAL INSTILLATION OF PROTAMINE SULFATE IN VARYING CONCENTRATIONS. FUNCTIONAL CORRELATION WASMADE WITH ULTRASTRUCTURE OF OMENTUM. PROTAMINE CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN 5 AND 30 MG/ML DECREASED PERMEABILITY TO INULIN WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERING THAT OF UREA. AT CONCENTRATIONS FROM 30 TO 75 MG/ML, PROTAMINE INCREASED PERMEABILITY TO UREA BY 50 % AND TO INULIN BY 20 %. MESOTHELIAL CELLS SHOWED LOSS OF MICROVILLI AND MINOR DEGREES OF DISORGANISATION OF SUBMEMBRANOUS CYTOPLASMIC MICROFILLAMENTS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INTRAMEMBRANOUS STRUCTURE OF OCCLUDING JUNCTIONS.

40|$|This paper explores {{organizational}} becoming as {{a process}} of dialogic imagination of practice. Experiences from the organic growth process of a professional service firm form the basis for reconceptualizing becoming as a duality between practice and meaning, fueled by a set of acts. We focus on boundary objects representing those acts and the reflexive field they constitute. Two successful projects stand out as having decisive influence in the becoming of our case firm. They seem particularly valuable as learning experiences because of four qualities: (1) grounding in core practice, (2) authorization by lead users, (3) resonance in identity, and (4) generation of new ideas. We argue that it is useful to think of these qualities as dialogic relations constituting strong fields of collective meaning. Patterns of management style and the introduction of a metaphor of the indomitable Gauls seem to possess similar qualities. Expressions of experiences enter a field of signifiers, a field whose collectivity is made of intersubjective and intertextual relations. This field stretches backwards and forward in time and may at any moment, by certain types of acts, reconfigure. a crystal willow, a poplar of water, a tall fountain the wind arches over, a tree deep rooted yet dancing still, a course of a river that turns, moves on, doubles back, and comes full circle, forever arriving <b>DOUBLING</b> BACK This is a case study of acts of becoming {{within the context of a}} professional service firm (PSF).

40|$|Loss of {{differentiation}} during oncogenesisis generally {{thought to}} be a coincidental, rather than a causal, aspectoftumour progression. We tested whether master regulators of differentiationcould have more direct roles in tumour formation by acting as tumour suppressorgenes. In this work we demonstrate that the transcription factor atonal, which is necessary fordifferentiation in the Drosophilaeye, and ATOH 1, which is essential forthe differentiation of Merkel cells in the skin and secretory cells in theintestine, shows all the hallmarks of a tumour suppressor gene. To investigatethe possible tumour suppressor function, we looked in tumours derived fromtissues which depend on ato-orthologuesto differentiate, namely eye tumours in Drosophila,two mouse models for colon adenocarcinoma (CAC), Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and CAC samples from patients and in celllines derived from MCC and CAC patients. Gain of atonalfunction leads to strong suppression of tumour formation in Drosophila. Conversely, loss of atonal (ato) in the Drosophila cancermodel enhances tumour progression and denovo tumour formation. We show that atofunctions by enhancing apoptosis and by the expression of cell cycle inhibitors. The effects of ato depend on JNKsignalling pathway. In addition, the mouse orthologue Atoh 1 shows all the hallmarks of atumour suppressor gene. To this end, we conditionally ablated Atoh 1 in the gut in two mouse models of CAC. The first model uses chemical carcinogenesis, the second sensitizes themice bymutations in the APC gene. In both cases, a significant increase in theincidence, the number as well as the size of the tumours is observed. Knock-outof Atoh 1 in pre-neoplastic colonepithelium leads to more proliferation but no more apoptosis. In agreement with the functional data inthe Drosophila and the mouse model, humanCAC and MCC tumours show a marked decrease in the expression of ATOH 1 opposed to control tissue. Moreaggressive stages of CAC have less ATOH 1 expression than less malignant tumours. This is due to genetic and epigeneticmutations in the form of deletions and methylation of the ATOH 1 locus. Finally, gain and loss of function of ATOH 1 in cell lines derived from CAC andMCC lead to a decrease and increase in growth, respectively. The decrease ingrowth upon Atoh 1 activation ismediated by an increase in apoptosis and a slowing of the cell cycle. ATOH 1 functions by activation ofreceptor tyrosine kinase signalling leading to phosphorylation of JNK. Similarly like in Drosophila, theeffects of ATOH 1 are mediated by JNK.

2500|$|Style guides codify {{rules to}} {{minimize}} inconsistency, {{the ultimate goal}} of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and interdocument consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the [...] "follow dictionary X" [...] rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary thus closes up preempt, reexamine, deemphasize, nonnegotiable, posttransfusion, and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of [...] "awkwardness" [...] for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, reexamine and deemphasize are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to prefer the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion, but to insist that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some <b>doublings</b> attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the /coworker example (mentioned earlier) or with antiinflammatory/, many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas plenty of others don't, and in such cases, dictionary styles may vary (Dorland's, antiinflammatory; Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, [...] ).

From below, the sides had presented an exceedingly rugged appearance--a wild confusion of huge jagged rocks, mixed with a tangled vegetation of trees, bushes, and vines; but following her in all her <b>doublings,</b> it became easy enough, although it fatigued me greatly owing to our rapid pace. The hill was conical, but I found that it had a flat top--an oblong or pear-shaped area, almost level, of a soft, crumbly sandstone, with a few blocks and boulders of a harder stone scattered about--and no vegetation, except the grey mountain lichen and a few sere-looking dwarf shrubs.|$|E
60|$|For five or {{six feet}} from the trunk, which had at {{the surface of the}} ground a {{diameter}} of several inches, it ran downward, single and straight, into a loose, friable earth; then it divided and subdivided into rootlets, fibers and filaments, most curiously interwoven. When carefully freed from soil they showed a singular formation. In their ramifications and <b>doublings</b> back upon themselves they made a compact network, having in size and shape an amazing resemblance to the human figure. Head, trunk and limbs were there; even the fingers and toes were distinctly defined; and many professed to see in the distribution and arrangement of the fibers in the globular mass representing the head a grotesque suggestion of a face. The figure was horizontal; the smaller roots had begun to unite at the breast.|$|E
60|$|We forbear {{to detail}} all the {{circumstances}} and adventures of upward of a months voyage, down the windings and <b>doublings</b> of this vast river; {{in the course}} of which they stopped occasionally at a post of one of the rival fur companies, or at a government agency for an Indian tribe. Neither shall we dwell upon the changes of climate and productions, as the voyagers swept down from north to south, across several degrees of latitude; arriving at the regions of oaks and sycamores; of mulberry and basswood trees; of paroquets and wild turkeys. This is one of the characteristics of the middle and lower part of the Missouri; but still more so of the Mississippi, whose rapid current traverses a succession of latitudes so as in a few days to float the voyager almost from the frozen regions to the tropics.|$|E
60|$|When on warlike expeditions, they painted {{their faces}} and bodies in the most hideous and {{grotesque}} manner, according to the universal practice of American savages. Their arms were bows and arrows, spears, and war clubs. Some wore a corselet of pieces of hard wood laced together with bear grass, so as to form a light coat of mail, pliant to the body; {{and a kind of}} casque of cedar bark, leather, and bear grass, sufficient to protect the head from an arrow or war club. A more complete article of defensive armor was a buff jerkin or shirt of great thickness, made of <b>doublings</b> of elk skin, and reaching to the feet, holes being left for the head and arms. This was perfectly arrowproof; add to which, it was often endowed with charmed virtues, by the spells and mystic ceremonials of the medicine man, or conjurer.|$|E
