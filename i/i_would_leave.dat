Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become [...] "abundantly {{clear that it is}} the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept... I promised {{the people of this country}} that I would continue to negotiate to the bitter end and that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> no stone unturned in my endeavours to secure an honourable and mutually accepted settlement; it now falls to me to tell you that negotiations have come to an end".|$|E

2500|$|The New York critics' {{reviews of}} the {{original}} production were mixed. Fortunately for the show, Ed Sullivan approached Lerner and Loewe to create a segment for his television variety program, celebrating {{the fifth anniversary of}} My Fair Lady. They decided to do very little from their previous hit and instead to perform four highlights from Camelot. The show stimulated ticket sales, and Camelot achieved an unprecedented advance sale of three and a half million dollars. Robert Goulet received favorable reviews, most notably for his rendition of the show-stopping romantic ballad [...] "If Ever <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Leave</b> You", which became his signature song.|$|E
2500|$|The New York critics' {{reviews of}} the {{original}} production were mixed to positive. A 1993 New York Times review commented that the musical [...] "has grown in stature over the years, primarily because of its superb score.... combined a lyrical simplicity with a lush romanticism, beautifully captured in numbers like 'I Loved You Once in Silence' and 'If Ever <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Leave</b> You.' These ballads sung by Guenevere and Lancelot {{are among the most}} memorable in the Lerner-Loewe catalogue. King Arthur supplies the wit, with songs like 'I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight.'" [...] A 2003 review noted, [...] "this musically rich, legend-based classic evokes enough swashbuckling spectacle to keep one smiling. And for lovers of dime-store romance, Camelot has it all – a beautiful English princess swept off her feet by a shy, but passionate bachelor king; an ardent French knight, torn between devotion to his liege and an uncontrollable hunger, reciprocated, to be sure, for the king's tempestuous wife.... Camelot features a score rich in English country-tune charm by Mr. Lerner. [...] Its lyrics, by Mr. Loewe , never fail to dazzle with their virtuosity and wit." [...] However, [...] "Jay Lerner's murky book... has helped sink many a revival of the musical.... It's a good story, but Lerner's book is talky and dense, filled with pontificating soliloquies that would have been more powerfully contained in song. Moreover, while the entire show rushes towards a bloody climax... when it finally arrives, it is merely sketched upon in one song, [...] "Guinevere." ...The score, though, is pure magic" ...|$|E
