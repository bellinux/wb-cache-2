Nevertheless, resources for management are limited, which makes prioritization unavoidable. We present a prioritization framework which can be useful for decision makers as it includes both a scientific impact assessment and the evaluation of <b>impact</b> <b>importance</b> by affected stakeholders. The framework is divided into five steps, namely 1) stakeholder selection and weighting of stakeholder importance by the decision maker, 2) factual description and scoring of changes by scientists, 3) evaluation of the importance of impact categories by stakeholders, 4) calculation of weighted impact categories and 5) calculation of final impact score and decision making. The framework could be used at different scales and by different authorities. Furthermore, it would make the decision making process transparent and retraceable for all stakeholders and the general public. v 2012 o...|$|E
40|$|Vibrations of a {{wind turbine}} have a {{negative}} impact on its performance. Mitigating this undesirable impact requires knowledge of the relationship between the vibrations and other wind turbine parameters that could be potentially modified. Three approaches for ranking the <b>impact</b> <b>importance</b> of measurable turbine parameters on the vibrations of the drive train and the tower are discussed. They include the predictor importance analysis, the global sensitivity analysis, and the correlation coefficient analysis versed in data mining and statistics. To decouple the impact of wind speed on the vibrations of the drive train and the tower, the analysis is performed on data sets with narrow speed ranges. Wavelet analysis is applied to filter noisy accelerometer data. To exclude the impact malfunctions on the vibration analysis, the data are analyzed in a frequency domain. Data-mining algorithms are used to build models with turbine parameters of interest as inputs, and the vibrations of drive train and tower as outputs. The performance of each model is thoroughly evaluated based on metrics widely used in the wind industry. The neural network algorithm outperforms other classifiers and is considered to be the most promising approach to study wind turbine vibrations. Copyright 2010 by ASME...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is first and {{foremost}} to investigate and identify perceptual distances on undesired events in Norwegian-Brazilian business dyads, and to understand their underlying forces with regards to informal and formal governance mechanisms. The data collection took place as a field study in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. It involved Norwegian companies operating in Brazil, and their Brazilian counterparts. The thesis builds upon, and use the construct created in Prof. Terje I. Vålands dissertation from 2002. He looked at the role informal and formal governance mechanisms had, in understanding interorganizational conflicts in the oil industry. We conducted a sequential exploratory mixed method approach with an experimental design. And interviewed informants on both sides of a dyad as our main source of data. We interviewed all participants two times. The first was to uncover the undesirable events in the relationship. The second interview’s purpose was to have the informants express, through a rating of the events, whether they considered the events to take place due to either lack of formal or informal mechanisms. These findings are used alongside existing theory to explain our findings. We also scratch the surface by asking them how they consider <b>impact</b> (<b>importance)</b> of an event in relation to the governance mechanisms. Our sample consists of three dyads. Two complex and one owner-operator relationship. The findings show, that for the complex dyads, {{there seems to be a}} mutual understanding towards the events resulting from lack of formal governance.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{normative}} {{concept in}} social-psychology {{has been applied}} to major recreational management issues such as determining evaluative standards, user conflict, and depreciative behaviors. This thesis examines the influence of information on user norms for the purpose of finding better applications of information as problem solving, management tools. The study used data collected at campgrounds in Chin-Mountain National Park, Korea, in 1993 and 1994. To develop evaluative standards, high degrees of norm agreement and norm prevalence among users are necessary. Data analysis showed that a high proportion of users could specify norms for various types of impacts and that <b>impact</b> <b>importance</b> was related to norm prevalence. There were generally differences in social norms and norm agreement across locations. Social norms for the selected impact indicators were stable across time periods (one-year). It was found that information could converge social norms to correspond to given information. Contrary to the hypothesis, however, information didn't increase the degree of norm agreement for or perceived importance of an impact. Information didn't directly change types of norms or user expectations, and didn't reduce subsequent perceived conflict. This study supported the notion that perceived conflict occurs when norms, expectations, and recreation motives are interfered with by others' incompatible behaviors. Norm-interference was a better predictor of perceived conflict than was recreation motive or expectation-interference. Information (based on Schwartz's norm activation theory) didn't directly increase the degree of awareness of consequences (AC), ascription of responsibility (AR), or personal norms, and didn't decrease norm/rule violating behavior. Users who rated high in both AC and AR, or who had a high degree of personal norms (moral obligation), had less tendency to violate the rule for quiet time at a campground.

40|$|Understanding of hydro-climatic {{changes in}} the world’s river basins is {{required}} to ensure future food security. Different regional basins experience different levels of hydro-climatic change depending on the endorheic or exorheic nature of a hydrological basin, along with the climatic conditions and human land and water-use practices, for instance for irrigation. This thesis has analyzed long-term hydro-climatic changes in two main irrigated regions of the world: the Mahanadi River Basin in India and the Aral region in Central Asia. Thesis applies a basin-wise, data-driven water balance-constrained approach to quantifying the hydro-climatic changes, and to distinguish their main drivers {{in the past century}} and for future. Results point at human water-use and re-distribution for irrigation within a basin as a major driver of water balance changes, which also affect surface temperature in the region. Cross-regional comparison focused on the climatically important changes of water, vapor and latent heat fluxes at the land surface, and also on the changes to water resource availability in the landscape. Results show that irrigation- driven changes in evapotranspiration, latent heat fluxes and associated temperature changes at land surface may be greater in regions with small relative irrigation impacts on water availability in the landscape than in regions with severe such impacts. This implies that one cannot from the knowledge about only one aspect of hydro-climatic change simply extrapolate the <b>impact</b> <b>importance</b> of those changes for other types of water changes in a region. Climate model projections results show lack of consistency in individual GCM performance with regard to temperature and to precipitation, implying difficulties to identify well-performing GCMs with regard to both of these variables in a region. In Aral region, the thesis shows that ensemble mean of different GCM outputs may provide robust projection of future hydro-climate changes.

40|$|The craze for {{biofuels}} {{has increased}} in recent years mainly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel consumptions. The European Renewable Energy Directive (RED), published in 2009, defined guidelines to assess carbon footprint of a biofuel depending on biomass source. It also provided generic values of GHG emissions relative to {{each step of the}} life cycle taking into account all steps from the cultivation to the end-of-life. These values are used to evaluate the sustainability of European biofuels depending on the used crops and the used transformation technology. This study, based on local crops cultivated in Belgium (sugar beet and wheat), compares specific Belgian values with European generic ones. Belgium yields for both crops are among the best of the continent. Specific Belgian values for fertilizers and pesticides are used. The transformation of wheat into bioethanol is modelled using industrial data. As recommended by the RED, no land use change is taken into account for Belgium. Greenhouse gas emissions induce by the life cycle of Belgium sugar beet bioethanol are similar to the ones mentioned in the European directive but impact repartition is different. In our case, the transformation step achieves a higher part of the impact. That {{can be explained by the}} higher cultivation yield. Belgian wheat bioethanol obtains better results than those mentioned by the European directive with a 9 % higher reduction. Cultivation step is the major step for this <b>impact.</b> <b>Importance</b> of fertilizers consumptions and associated emissions are highlighted. The comparison of both bioethanols impacts for climate change category, using an energy basis, shows that wheat allows a higher reduction of GHG emissions than sugar beet. If the comparison is performed on a cultivated area basis, results are reversed and sugar beet achieves a twofold reduction compared with wheat. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the importance of N fertilizers and associated emissions and on energy consumptions relative to the transformation step. These analyses reveal non-negligible impact variations. A range of GHG reduction that can be reached using Belgian sugar beet and wheat bioethanol are then calculated. In any case, sugar beet does not achieve the amount of reduction given by the RED, while the opposite effect is shown for wheat with a reduction at least as high as the RED default value. These results indicate the importance of make use of specific values to assess the sustainability of bioethanol for a specific country using a specific crop and a specific technology. Further measurements and research about emission factors due to fertilizers application could improve the accuracy of our results. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Development and {{expansion}} of renewable energy generation {{is one of the}} highest political and environmental priorities facing today's Governments. Due to increased demand for green technology, the range of options for generating clean energy has expanded. In the case of energy generation from waste sources, it has been further fuelled by increasing pressure for environmentally benign waste disposal systems, burgeoning waste volumes and concerns over secondary pollution from disposed waste. An industry that is integral to energy production, and has a high profile in terms of environmental protection and pollution remediation, is oil spill response. There is scope for expanding the environmental management of the oil spill response industry to incorporate using waste oil from spill incidents as a source of fuel. In order for potential markets (in terms of environmental protection, waste management and energy generation) to be exploited, the necessary range of education and training demands must be established, developed and delivered. Education and training from grass roots to strategic management and Government levels are essential aspects in establishing the knowledge base, compliance, maintaining standards and ongoing development. This thesis examines the integration of the management of the waste stream, energy generation from waste and focuses specifically on the disposal of oil spill waste. The outputs of the research fall into two categories, (i) A series of laboratory and ex-situ field trials to quantify the potential of oil from marine spill incidents as a fuel source, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} pixel analysis as a mechanism to monitor the efficacy of oil spill response technologies, and to record the percentage recovery of oil and sorbent from the environment as a measure of clean up effectiveness, (ii) To examine the role and impact of education and training initiatives in disseminating scientific, technical and legislative material on bioremediation of marine oil spills. The research demonstrated that there are sufficient levels of carbon present in range of compounds of oils and sorbents from marine oil spill incidents to be utilised as fuel. Pixel analysis was established as an effective technique, oil and sorbent compound dependent, to quantify the extent to which oil had been removed from the environment. Percentage recovery was deemed a value-added data set to analyse the effectiveness of sorbents at recovering oils with varying viscosities. In terms of education and training, feedback from distance learning initiatives specifically developed for the research pathway, including undergraduate modules, and workshops and training courses for professionals and industry was analysed and integrated into the distance learning material on bioremediation. The positive nature of the feedback and subsequent suggestions for expanding the courses from all target audiences, demonstrated their <b>impact,</b> <b>importance</b> and effectiveness within the scope of the environmental management process. These recommendations contributed to the development and design of the bioremediation research...|$|E
