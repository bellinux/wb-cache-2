500|$|Cleveland fans' {{hopes were}} high upon {{the arrival of}} the new team. However, as an {{expansion}} team the Browns were forced to build a new roster from scratch using rookies, free agents, and the players other teams chose not to protect in the expansion draft. [...] With a new team composed of a mix of fresh faces and castoffs, the Browns floundered. The Steelers shut out the Browns 43–0 in the season opener at Cleveland Browns Stadium on September 12, 1999, the first of seven straight losses. A 2–14 season in 1999 was followed by a 3–13 record in 2000 after Couch suffered a season-ending thumb injury. Early in 2001, Policy and Lerner fired Palmer. The coach and the team, Policy said, were not <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E

FIU was <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> but still lacked consistency, and organization. As they began their 2006 season they almost evenly matched the teams which they played, losing almost all of their first few games by very narrow margins: Middle Tennessee 7-6, USF 21-20, Bowling Green 33-28, Maryland 14-10, and University of North Texas 22-25 (7OTs).|$|E

Bradley also gained attention for an infamous incident in a match against D.C. United that season in which he exploited an MLS rule allowing a 4th substitution for a goalkeeper by switching starting goalkeeper Tim Howard into an outfield player so that midfielder Eddie Gaven (who would go on to score the winning goal) could enter the game classified as a goalkeeper, before switching positions with Howard after ten seconds of play.|$|E

50|$|However, just as Sandlak's career {{appeared}} <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> injuries {{began to}} take their toll. His 1992-93 season was plagued by back problems which caused him to miss 25 games {{as well as most}} of the playoffs, and limited him to just 10 goals. Following the season, he was dealt to the Hartford Whalers as the future considerations in the Murray Craven trade. His two seasons with the Whalers were an absolute nightmare, however, as wrist, foot, knee, and heel injuries limited him to just 40 games and 8 points over that span. Released by the Whalers in 1995, he returned to Vancouver for the 1995-96 season, but again struggled with injuries (this time a stress fracture to a vertebra in his back) and his level of play had dropped off considerably. Following a failed tryout with Buffalo the following season he retired from the NHL, although he returned after a year off for a season in Germany before leaving the game for good.|$|E
5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} the adventure in The Space Gamer #71, writing that the module: [...] "soars with surprises at every turn", with locales such as [...] "a zombie palace made entirely of fungus, a flying ship manned by skeletons, and a ladder {{of light that}} extends to the moon." [...] He also found the maps and illustrations [...] "attractive and functional", and said {{the views of the}} Temple would help players visualize the unusual structure. He cautioned that because the adventure is largely set in the wilderness, it will challenge the Dungeon Master to keep the players <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> He felt that the Master is [...] "somewhat of a letdown" [...] as he is [...] "a pretty dull guy in light of what's come before". Swan felt that [...] "the two Desert Nomads adventures can't enjoyably be played on their own" [...] but concluded that [...] "Taken with Masters of the Desert Nomads, Temple of Death is great fun".|$|E

5000|$|Netflix {{picking up}} the series is a hopeful sign for {{independent}} filmmakers and another step into offering a variety of diverse content to audiences, according to Varghese.

[...] Varghese noted that series like The Mindy Project and Master of None have tremendously paved the way for South Asian representation, but while there is progress, there are more stories to tell. [...] "Our show is a little bit quirkier, I don't think it's as drama driven as the other two shows, but I think there's a lot more stories that we're able to explore." ...|$|E

Known as a tireless recruiter and a master game tactician, Moser has coached numerous all-conference players in his coaching career and Loyola's 24 wins last season were a culmination of his hard work recruiting and ability to put his players in a position to win games.Loyola's 2014-15 season was a magical one, as the Ramblers were the surprise package of the Missouri Valley, exceeding expectations {{every step of the way}} in posting their best season in 30 years. The Ramblers' 24 wins were their most since 1985 and their RPI improvement of over 200 spots was third-best among Division I programs.|$|E
50|$|Elle Varner {{spent most}} of her {{childhood}} sleeping on studio couches, running around green rooms, and watching her parents struggle to make a name in the industry. At age six she began to play musical instruments, beginning with the flute, and later she moved on to piano and guitar. She attended several music programs including actress Wendy Raquel Robinson's Amazing Grace Conservatory starting at age 11 and Alexander Hamilton High School's Academy of Music's Vocal Jazz Group.It was there she penned her first song, “Thankful”. The song, which she played with one string on the guitar, scored the top prize at a local talent show. Earning a coveted spot in New York University’s Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music (which only accepts 24 students per year) was further proof that she was <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> In 2008 Varner graduated from NYU's renowned Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music: “To be recognized for my talent in a program that only selects 24 students per class, out of thousands, was like, ‘Wow!’ I knew that I had really stepped up to the plate,” says Elle Varner.|$|E
