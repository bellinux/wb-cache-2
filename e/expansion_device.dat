5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus <b>expansion</b> <b>device</b> is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E
500|$|Several {{peripherals}} {{exist for}} the SG-1000 series. [...] Available at ¥13,800 at its time of release, the SK-1100 keyboard connects through the expansion slot and is compatible with all models. [...] Multiple controllers were created, including the SJ-200 joystick attached to the SG-1000, and the SJ-150 joypad, made for use with the SG-1000 II. [...] A racing wheel known as the SH-400 was made for use with games such as Monaco GP. [...] The C-1000 Card Catcher, sold at ¥1,000, allowing players to play Sega Card titles. [...] Additional accessories existed solely for use with the SC-3000, including the SR-1000 cassette deck, the SP-400 4-color plotter printer, and the SF-7000 <b>expansion</b> <b>device</b> which adds a floppy disk drive and additional memory.|$|E

50|$|Autoconfig {{is part of}} the Zorro II and Zorro III {{expansion}} bus specification for configuring <b>expansion</b> <b>devices</b> in Amiga systems. Zorro II was first used in the Amiga 2000, though a similar {{expansion bus}} is present on the Amiga 1000. Zorro II is a relatively straightforward extension of the 68000 bus. Autoconfig requires the 68000 data and address bus to be available to all devices on the bus. In theory, a virtual address system, as used in PCI, would require a minor revision to Autoconfig.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{satisfactory}} supporting and <b>expansion</b> <b>devices</b> for highway bridges {{is a problem}} which has concerned bridge design engineers for many years. The problems associated with these devices have been emphasized by {{the large number of}} short span bridges required by the current expanded highway program of expressways and interstate highways. The initial objectives of this investigation were: (1) To review and make a field study of devices used for the support of bridge superstructures and for provision of floor expansion; (2) To analyze the forces or factors which influence the design and behavior of supporting <b>devices</b> and floor <b>expansion</b> systems; and (3) To ascertain the need for future research particularly on the problems of obtaining more economical and efficient supporting and <b>expansion</b> <b>devices,</b> and determining maximum allowable distance between such devices. The experimental portion was conducted to evaluate one of the possible simple and economical solutions to the problems observed in the initial portion. The investigation reported herein is divided into four major parts or phases as follows: (1) A review of literature; (2) A survey by questionnaire of design practice of a number of state highway departments and consulting firms; (3) Field observation of existing bridges; and, (4) An experimental comparison of the dynamic behavior of rigid and elastomeric bearings...|$|R

50|$|The <b>expansion</b> <b>device</b> or {{refrigerant}} {{metering device}} (RMD) restricts {{the flow of the}} liquid refrigerantcausing a pressure drop that vaporizes some of the refrigerant; this vaporization absorbs heat from nearby liquid refrigerant.The RMD is located immediately prior to the evaporator so that the cold gas in the evaporator can absorbheat from the water in the evaporator. There is a sensor for the RMD on the evaporator outlet side whichallows the RMD to regulate the refrigerant flow based on the chiller design requirement.|$|E
50|$|As {{general purpose}} {{computing}} devices developed, these connections and disconnections were instead used to specify {{locations in the}} system address space where an <b>expansion</b> <b>device</b> should appear, {{in order for the}} device to be accessible by the central processing unit. If two or more of the same type of device were installed in one computer, it would be necessary to assign the second device to a separate, non-overlapping region of the system address space so that both could be accessible at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Up {{until about}} 2000, PC {{computers}} {{could still be}} purchased {{with a mix of}} ISA and PCI slots, so it was still possible that manual ISA device configuration might be necessary. But with successive releases of new operating systems like Windows 2000 and Windows XP, Microsoft had sufficient clout to say that drivers would not be provided for older devices that did not support auto-detection. In some cases, the user was forced to purchase new <b>expansion</b> <b>devices</b> or a whole new system to support the next operating system release.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>devices</b> {{respond to}} certain fixed memory {{addresses}} starting at hexadecimal 0xE8 0000 (or 0xFF00 0000 [...] for Zorro III) if the /CFGIN signal is asserted and {{the device is}} not already configured. The CPU reads nibbles of configuration information (usually supplied by a PAL) such as manufacturer ID, product ID, {{and the amount of}} address space the device requires. The CPU then writes a base memory address to the device (or tells it to [...] "shut up" [...] if for some reason it can't be configured), and the device asserts /CFGOUT.|$|R
50|$|The CoCo is {{designed}} to be attached to a color television set, whereas the Z80 machines use monochrome computer monitors, often built into the case. The CoCo also features an expansion connector for program cartridges (mostly games, although the EDTASM assembler is a cartridge) and other <b>expansion</b> <b>devices,</b> such as floppy-disk controllers and modems. In this way it is similar to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, and other cartridge-capable systems. Tandy released a Multi-Pak Interface which allowed switching quickly among four cartridges. This is similar in concept to the Model I's Expansion Interface.|$|R

5000|$|Phase-change cooling is an {{extremely}} effective way to cool the processor. A vapor compression phase-change cooler is a unit which usually sits underneath the PC, with a tube leading to the processor. Inside the unit is a compressor of the same type as in an air conditioner. The compressor compresses a gas (or mixture of gases) into a liquid. Then, the liquid is pumped up to the processor, where it passes through a condenser (heat dissipation device) and then an <b>expansion</b> <b>device</b> to vaporize the fluid; the <b>expansion</b> <b>device</b> used can be a simple capillary tube to a more elaborate thermal expansion valve. The liquid evaporates (changing phase), absorbing {{the heat from the}} processor as it draws extra energy from its environment to accommodate this change (see latent heat). The evaporation can produce temperatures reaching around [...] The gas flows down to the compressor and the cycle begins over again. This way, the processor can be cooled to temperatures ranging from , depending on the load, wattage of the processor, the refrigeration system (see refrigeration) and the gas mixture used. This type of system suffers from a number of issues but, mainly, one must be concerned with dew point and the proper insulation of all sub-ambient surfaces that must be done (the pipes will sweat, dripping water on sensitive electronics).|$|E
50|$|However, {{the process}} of {{configuring}} devices manually using jumpers or DIP switches, could be quite difficult, and there was usually no forgiveness for technical inexperience. Incorrect settings could render either the whole system or just the <b>expansion</b> <b>device</b> completely or partially inoperable. Some settings such as for interrupts (IRQ) or direct memory access (DMA) required knowledge of what configuration had been previously manually assigned to other devices, {{as well as what}} settings the main system itself may have been using. The system might still have seemed to work properly with an incorrect setting, until the IRQ or DMA was actually needed and the entire system suddenly froze and needed to be reset.|$|E
40|$|Processes of {{destruction}} of products used in orthodontic treatment, e. g. fixed orthodontic appliances, microimplants or dental prostheses considerably limit its operational lifetime and comfort {{and safety of}} patients.

The evaluated appliances showed discernible differences between the overall condition of the noble solders and the stainless steel elements. The Ag-rich solders were chiefly covered in corrosion pits, whereas stainless steel wires, molar bands and Hyrax screws presented corrosion-free surfaces. What is more, the EDS analysis showed differential element composition of the solders. According to the results, noble materials, such as Ag-rich solders, can corrode in a salivary environment when coupled with stainless steel. The selective leaching processes are observed...|$|R
