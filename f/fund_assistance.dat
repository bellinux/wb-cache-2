50|$|The Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges, {{popularly known}} as CSPC, {{is the brainchild of}} some Prominent Nabueños who have long dreamed of having their college. Its {{establishment}} came into reality {{as a result of the}} feasibility study initiated by the defunct Bicol River Basin Development Program (BRBDP). Said undertaking is an inter agency commitment with the aim of promoting a balance agro-industrial development in the region to achieve the national development goals of the 80’s. The idea of having a community college within Nabua was first conceived by then Municipal Mayor, Atty. Ulpiano D. Duran, Sr. so that poor and deserving Nabueños who wish to take post secondary and collegiate courses could be freed from the burden of going to other places and save a lot of their education. With the support of his Vice Mayor, Hon. Sofio Barela, Sr. the Sangguniang Bayan passed a resolution for the creation of a community college within the Nabua National High School. Atty. Duran submitted the resolution to then Governor Felix A. Fuentebella for approval and funding assistance. Considering the merit of the request, Governor Fuentebella deemed it wise to indorse the proposal to BRBDP Director, Col. Lorenzo Ballecer, a Nabueño, who then initiated the conduct of the feasibility study by his technical men with the assistance of some personnel of Nabua National High School. On the course of the study, the team did not only consider the establishment of a community college but also the possibility of putting up a state tertiary institution in the area. As a result of the study conducted, it came out to be very promising if a Polytechnic College would be created. This was based on the premise that very crucial to the overall development scheme is the rationalization of the technical and vocational education with an updated curricular and linkage programs to match the needs of industries and entrepreneurs for skilled and dedicated manpower. With the very strong representation of his father, Assemblyman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella sponsored a bill creating a Polytechnic College within the Nabua National High School using the result of the feasibility as basis, which later become Batas Pambansa Bilang 512, approved by the President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 10, 1983. Sec. 2 BP 512 states that: “the College shall primarily provide higher technological, professional, and vocational instruction and training in fisheries, trades and technology, arts and sciences, as well as short term technical and vocational courses, as the Board of Trustees may deem necessary, and shall promote researches in the exploration and conservation of natural resources in the province.” The immediate targets are the graduates of the barangay, private and public high schools, out of school youths and drop outs within Rinconada area, which comprises six municipalities and one city: Nabua, Baao, Bula, Bato, Buhi, Balatan and Iriga City. The first organizational meeting of the college was held on February 22, 1985 at the Provincial Capitol of Camarines Sur. Deputy Minister Vedasto G. Suarez who represented the MECS Minister Jaime C. Laya, presided over the meeting. Government officials present were: Hon. Felix A. Fuentebella, Governor; Atty. Fernando O. Beriña, Provincial Kagawad; Atty. Ulpiano D. Duran Sr., Municipal Mayor; Dir. Carmelo R. Villacorta, BRBDP Director; Dr. Franciscpo Pili, BFAR Director; Dr. Ciriaco N. Divinagracia, CSSAC President; Engr. Aproniano Los Baños, Provincial Engineer; Mr. Constancio Cater, Provincial Administrator; Mr. Germites C. Dineros, NNHS Principal; Atty. Magno Catabijan Sr., MECS Legal Officer; Atty. John Imlan, PASUC Administrative Officer. An Ad Hoc Committee was created headed by Dr. Ciriaco N. Divinagracia, the designated officer in charge. The committee was tasked to prepare the implementing guidelines for the operationalization of the college. During its second organizational meeting on April 1, 1985, the implementing guidelines were approved and Provincial Kagawad Fernando O. Beriña was designated Officer in charge. With only eleven (11) personnel; five (5) full-time instructors and six (6) administrative Personnel, the College has initially managed to run its affair. A total approximation of Five hundred thousand pesos (P500, 000.00) was approved by the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur for the 1985 operation of the college as provided for in BP 512. Thereafter, the operation and maintenance shall be incorporated in subsequent General Appropriation Act. May 7, 1985 was a red letter day for CSPC when the college opens its door for enrolment. For the first ten days, it seemed as if the target of 240 students could not be attained. But when enrolment closed on May 27, 1985, the target was overshot by 105 students or a total of 345 students, broken down as follows; One Year Junior Business Machine Certificate, 87; One Year Junior Electrical Certificates, 91; One Year Junior construction Technical Certificate, 80. Having no building of its own to accommodate its enrollees, a small office and six classrooms of NNHS war damage building were temporarily offered for use after classes, while drafting classes were held at the library. On September 25, 1986, Dr, Lylia Corporal-Seña was appointed as the first President of CSPC. Under her able leadership, she negotiated the temporary use of the Gabaldon Building owned by the Municipal Government of Nabua to accommodate the increasing enrolment. Day class schedules were opened. In the later part of 1986, the college rented a residential house owned by the Regalado Family to house congested offices at the War Damaged Building. This was the first attempt of the college to stand on its feet. Inspired by the strong determination of the leadership of Dr. Seña, a three classroom building was donated by the Late Engr. Cleto Descalso, a Retired US Navy. This was the first building erected at the swampy - 8 hectares site donated by the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur. In the same year, the Parents Teachers Association initiated the construction of a four classroom cottage made of Light Local Materials. In the latter part of 1987, classes housed at the War Damaged building were all transferred to the new site. Unfortunately, the cottage lasted only for more than One Year when it was totally destroyed by the Typhoon Sisang. Under the leadership of Dr. Seña, the ladder type curriculum came in full swing. Altogether, programs on instruction, student activities, administrative concerns, and infrastructure development were given priority. With the end of her term, Mr. Ferdinand B. Valencia become the Officer-in-charge (March 1, 1993 - May 15, 1997) of the college thru the designation of the then DECS Secretary Armand V. Fabella. Conscious of the aim and objectives of technical education, improvements of program offered as well as infrastructure developments have been realized. Vital to student’s development were clear-out policies on the on-the-job training/ in-company training/ in-house training and affiliation as well as expansion of the scholarship programs on academic, band/ majorettes, publication, athletics, Sangguniang Kabataan and Barangay Scholars to poor but deserving students. Attempts for voluntary accreditation to AACCUP have been started. The campus was able to house more classrooms, college library, college museum, audio visual room, information technology building equipped with radio and communication dish satellite, computers, prayer room, chemistry and laboratory room, refrigeration and air conditioning room, machine shop, medical and dental clinics. Physics room, drafting, carpentry shop, typing pool, clinical and midwifery laboratory rooms. Construction of Automotive and Shop Building, phase 1 was completed in 1995, followed by the newly constructed Multi Purpose stage and landscaping of the campus contributed much in physical development. Likewise, sports and athletics facilities improved with the construction of volleyball, basketball and lawn tennis court, and backfilling of almost one hectare athletic and NROTC training field. College library has a total collection of 7,185 volumes of books. Owing to the growing commitment to serve the community, it was not a surprise to the college to produce topnotchers in the board examination: in 1995, Mr. Josuel M. Terano - 9th place in ME and Miss Melanie C. Gaspi - 12th place in midwifery. In 2003, Mr. Wilson Solis got the 6th place in ECE and in 2004, Engr. Jeffrey V. Esteve and Engr. Domingo S. Panton Jr. got the 18th and 19th place, respectively, in civil engineering. In May 16, 1997 to March 4, 1998, Dr. Lourdes G. Laniog assumed officer-in-charge of the college until her presidency in March 5, 1998 to May 31, 2002. Through the years, instruction, research and extension have been the focus of her leadership coupled with the hiring of additional teaching and non-teaching personnel, improvements of school facilities particularly, construction of covered court but collapsed during the typhoon Rosing, construction and completion of Multi Purpose Building, additional construction of covered walk, upgrading and restructuring of the Laboratory Shop Building, improvement of the water supply system, completion of the IT Building and rehabilitation of the Automotive and Machine Shop Building. Under her leadership, Secretary Raul Roco donated a 2-classroom building and the improvement of the AVR thru the <b>fund</b> <b>assistance</b> from Senator Magsaysay. The 3rd CSPC President, Dr. Monsito G. Ilarde, was appointed on May 27, 2002 but his formal assumption to the presidency was on July 1, 2002. Within the first month of his presidency, pursuant to the provision No. 2 of the CHED FY 2002 budget under the General Appropriation Act of FY 2000 or RA trades (BCAT) to Camarines Sur Polytechnic College (CSPC). Today, pursuant to CSPC board of Trustees resolution No. 00-044, the Former BCAT is now CSPC Naga Campus. A strong opposition to the integration of BCAT to CSPC is very evident to the BCAT Community because of their move for its conversion as a separate state college. Until now, CSPC Naga Campus community hopes that such move will still be reconsidered which the present leadership understand. For the moment this long standing dream has not been realized, the two campuses, Nabua and Naga, are doing its best in responding to the call for quality instruction and other mandated functions along research, extension and production. Significantly, Dr. Ilarde was able to mobilize developments for the college that paved the way for its strong commitment to provide professional and technological education for regional development. These are: accreditation of all its programs; produced board examination topnotchers as well as high percentage of board passers in almost all programs; compliance to EO 358 requirements of its non-degree programs; better students development programs and services; establishments and expansion of linkages; creation of the Buhi extension Campus with strong partnership with LGU Buhi; scholarship programs for faculty and students; physical development in support to the college primary goal in providing quality education. In May 3, 2011, Dr. Dulce Fajardo-Atian assumed as the 4th President of Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges. She envisions CSPC as the regional center of excellence in polytechnic education. As such continuing accreditations of all programs are in place and plans for opening of other curricular programs are considered to attain the goal of a university status. CSPC also embarks to be internationally recognized through its on-going endeavor for ISO accreditation. The challenge came on October 19, 2012 when the long-awaited dream of CSPC Naga campus came into reality. President Benigno S. Aquino III signed Republic Act No. 1110231 separating CSPC Naga Campus and converting it into Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology (BISCAST).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Having had excess lending {{capacity}} {{at the beginning}} of 2008, {{by the end of the}} year International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending had increased and, in anticipation of a further increase in the demand for <b>Fund</b> <b>assistance,</b> arguments were being put forward for a substantial increase in IMF resources. Analysis of IMF lending over a protracted period of time reveals considerable volatility. Using both bivariate and multiple regression estimation, this paper investigates the determinants of IMF lending and examines the extent to which it is predictable. Although some significant relationships are discovered, many of them are unstable and time variant. This makes it difficult to predict IMF lending with any degree of confidence. The paper goes on to examine briefly the policy implications of unpredictability. It is critical of the ways in which the problem has been handled in the past and it offers what it argues is a preferable solution. Copyright 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E
