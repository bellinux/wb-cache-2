500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs. I related to it personally more than other songs, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun with it. I thought if it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E

I watch him on tapes and it's just ridiculous how good he was compared to the guys he was playing against. He's a great guy and you don't even know it's Bobby Orr, the way he talks to you." ...|$|E

500|$|From April 1888, Frederick {{became so}} weak {{he was unable}} to walk, and was largely {{confined}} to his bed; his continual coughing brought up large quantities of pus. In early June, the cancer spread to and perforated his esophagus, preventing him from eating. He suffered from bouts of vomiting and ran high fevers, but remained alert enough to write a last diary entry on 11 June: [...] "What's happening to me?

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

Patrick is [...] "enormously entertaining to portray" [...] because, according to Fagerbakke, [...] "when I'm performing Patrick, there are many secrets that I could never divulge". Fagerbakke's approach in voicing Patrick is [...] "much the same way I would do [...] any kind of character." [...] "I'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children. To be able to plug in to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun with that. I love kids; I raised two girls and I love being a parent," [...] he said. The cast members record as a whole cast. Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because [...] "there is something remarkable that happens when people are working together that is unique to that."

[...] In May 2010, Gaga told The Times about the concept of the video: [...] " [...] purity of my friendships with my gay friends, and how I've been unable to find that with a straight man in my life. It's a celebration and an admiration of gay love—it confesses my envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together. In the video I'm pining for the love of my gay friends—but they just don't want me to be with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cornelius {{focused his}} legal career and full {{attention}} on {{their vision of}} uplifting the Oneida people.

The Oneida Stock Farm, with its most modern barns in the county and its acres presaging such wonderful possibilities, is an example of his idea of bringing beautiful culture out of the wilderness. In cooperation with his sister, Laura M. Cornelius, who has originated a scheme for industrial organization for all Indians, and who hopes to establish a Cherry Garden City for the Oneidas." [...] Historian Ryan, remarked, [...] "C. P. Cornelius stands in a position to demonstrate to the world the large abilities and possibilities of the Indian race. Replying to the rebuke that he was foolish to give away so many of his ideas in improving farm machinery, which were not being patented, he replied, [...] "There is nothing for which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> contempt as the social parasite.
