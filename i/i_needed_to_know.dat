In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E
500|$|The album {{also helped}} the Red Hot Chili Peppers earn a {{dedicated}} cult fanbase in Los Angeles. [...] One of these fans was John Frusciante, {{who would later}} join the band as guitarist after Slovak's death. [...] Frusciante recalled: [...] "The first time I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center, {{and that was really}} amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound. [...] Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff. [...] It was the most magical experience I ever had in the experience of a show." [...] Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E
500|$|The band wasn't {{without a}} guitarist for very long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a {{replacement}} for McKnight in teenage guitarist, John Frusciante. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] knows all the shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Frusciante was not {{familiar}} with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and I just took it sideways from there." [...] Several weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro, whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse, was fired. Soon after, Chad Smith was added as the group's new drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album, 1989's Mother's Milk. Frusciante focused on emulating Slovak's signature style, rather than imposing his own personal style on the group. Producer Michael Beinhorn disagreed, and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic heavy metal tone, largely absent from the band's three preceding records. Frusciante and Beinhorn fought frequently over guitar tone and layering, and Beinhorn's idea ultimately prevailed as Frusciante felt pressured by the producer's much greater knowledge of the studio. Kiedis recalls that [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." ...|$|E
500|$|Slovak's {{work was}} one of the major {{contributing}} factors to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. When Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak, Kiedis likened the experience to [...] "shopping for a new Mom and Dad" [...] because of his influence over the band. [...] Flea, who originally listened exclusively to jazz, added that Slovak introduced him to a new genre of music, saying that [...] "it was Hillel who first got me into hard rockin. He was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante, who would later replace him as guitarist in the band. Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there." [...] Just like Slovak before him, Frusciante developed a heroin addiction. Unlike Slovak, Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit. The songs [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] (from Mother's Milk), [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] (from Blood Sugar Sex Magik), [...] "This is the Place" [...] (from By the Way), and [...] "Feasting on the Flowers" [...] (from The Getaway) were written about or as tributes to Slovak. The band's 1987 cover version of Jimi Hendrix's song [...] "Fire", recorded with Slovak and previously only released on the [...] "Fight Like a Brave" [...] single and The Abbey Road EP, was included on 1989's Mother's Milk along with and image of one of Slovak's paintings inside the album's booklet. In 1999, a book titled Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak was published. The book was authored by Slovak's brother, James Slovak, and features writings from his brother's diaries, paintings, photos and hand-written notes from Kiedis and Flea.|$|E
