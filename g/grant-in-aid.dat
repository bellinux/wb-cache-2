5|$|Until 1760 {{the monarch}} met all {{official}} expenses from hereditary revenues, {{which included the}} profits of the Crown Estate (the royal property portfolio). King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown {{in return for the}} Civil List, and this arrangement persisted until 2012. An annual Property Services <b>Grant-in-aid</b> paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel <b>Grant-in-Aid</b> paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment. Its size was fixed by Parliament every 10 years; any money saved was carried forward to the next 10-year period. From 2012 until 2020, the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid are to be replaced with a single Sovereign Grant, which will be set at 15% of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate.|$|E
5|$|The Kerala {{school of}} {{astronomy}} and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created {{a number of}} important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions. Following the instructions of the Wood's despatch of 1854, both the princely states, Travancore and Cochin, launched mass education drives with support from agencies, mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of <b>grant-in-aid</b> to attract more private initiatives. The efforts by leaders, Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and Kuriakose Elias Chavara towards aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state, with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches, {{led to the development of}} mass education in Kerala.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum is an {{executive}} non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, {{from which it}} receives financial support {{in the form of}} a <b>grant-in-aid.</b> The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation. The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister, and the Foreign, Defence, and Culture Secretaries. Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed ex officio by their respective governments. As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely. Past chairmen have included Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin (1967–77), Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Willis and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Grandy (trustee 1971–78, Chairman 1978–89). During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was chairman during the planning of Duxford's American Air Museum, which opened in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The period did {{lead to some}} {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before. As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government <b>grant-in-aid</b> of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has now grown to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E
25|$|The channel {{originally}} {{started as}} BBC World Service Television {{and was a}} commercial operation. The British government refused to fund to the new television service using <b>grant-in-aid.</b> (BBC World Service radio was funded by a <b>grant-in-aid</b> from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office until 2014.) The channel started broadcasting on 11 March 1991, {{after two weeks of}} real-time pilots, initially as a half-hour bulletin once a day at 19:00 GMT.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other Chinese {{schools in}} the Philippines, Xavier was {{established}} as an all-boys school, a Catholic school with an English curriculum that integrated Chinese studies. Through its <b>Grant-in-Aid</b> program, the school offers financially challenged but otherwise qualified students the opportunity of a Xavier education.|$|E
25|$|An aided {{school has}} all or {{a part of}} its {{property}} vested in a body of trustees or board of governors and is partially maintained by public funding or, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, has received a <b>grant-in-aid</b> out of public funds.|$|E
25|$|John J. Tigert {{became the}} third {{university}} president in 1928. Disgusted by the under-the-table payments {{being made by}} universities to athletes, Tigert established the <b>grant-in-aid</b> athletic scholarship program in the early 1930s, which was {{the genesis of the}} modern athletic scholarship plan used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.|$|E
25|$|The BBC Arabic Television {{news channel}} {{launched}} on 11 March 2008, a Persian-language channel followed on 14 January 2009, broadcasting from the Peel wing of Broadcasting House; both include news, analysis, interviews, sports and highly cultural programmes and {{are run by}} the BBC World Service and funded from a <b>grant-in-aid</b> from the British Foreign Office (and not the television licence).|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century (1889–90) a {{break-through}} {{was made}} to re-connect the rear rooms of No. 12 (north of the courtyard) through to the museum in No. 13 and since 1969 No. 12 has been run by the Trustees as part of the Museum, housing the research library (until 2009), offices and, since 1995, the Eva Jiřičná-designed 'Soane Gallery' for temporary exhibitions (until Summer 2011). The museum's trustees remained completely independent, relying only on Soane's original endowment, until 1947. Since that date the museum has received an annual <b>Grant-in-Aid</b> from the British Government (this now comes via the Department for Culture, Media and Sport).|$|E
25|$|A private school, not {{maintained}} by public funds {{and which has}} not, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, received any capital <b>grant-in-aid</b> out of public funds. The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, {{two of which are}} religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a Montessori school. Also, within the private sector {{there are a number of}} home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.|$|E
500|$|As {{a former}} {{university}} athlete and coach, Tigert took a {{particular interest in}} athletics-related policy issues while he was president and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Florida Gators sports program generally, and football in particular. [...] He {{was responsible for the}} construction of the university's first and only permanent football stadium, Florida Field, in 1930. [...] He borrowed $10,000 to begin construction of the stadium, and then raised $118,000 to pay the construction costs of the 22,800-seat facility. [...] Tigert was also instrumental in the organization of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), which the University of Florida joined as one of the thirteen founding institutions in December 1932. [...] Tigert subsequently served two terms as SEC president (1934–1936 and 1945–1947). [...] As a key leader within the SEC, he worked to impose a uniform set of rules and standards for academic eligibility for SEC athletes. [...] Appalled by the under-the-table payments to amateur college athletes that were prevalent at the time, he advocated the grant of scholarships to athletes which would become the <b>grant-in-aid</b> of other university athletic programs and as mandated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the years to follow.|$|E
500|$|Several {{explanations}} of {{the cause of the}} September 2008 attacks have been postulated. Many Christians believe that the attacks were a direct response from right-wing Hindu organisations who were targeting the people of Mangalore and the surrounding area because they had been outspoken about persecution of Christians in Orissa. St. Aloysius College, a Jesuit institution in Mangalore, and some other 2000 Christian schools in Karnataka, went on strike for varying periods between 29 August and 5 September prior to the attacks, protesting against anti-Christian persecution in Orissa, contrary to the orders of the government who stated that they were to be regular work days. Primary and secondary education minister Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, responding to the shutting down of the Christian educational institutions in Karnataka, had directed the public education department to issue show-cause notices to schools that had objected to the violence against Christians in Orissa. A Christian institution in Shimoga had reportedly received a notice from the education ministry of Karnataka during the strike saying, [...] "The VHP and Bajrang Dal have conducted a protest against the closure of schools and criticised your action. They have submitted letters requesting action against you for this. In this context, you are asked to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against you for using religion as an excuse to announce a holiday and as to why permission to run your institution should not be withdrawn." [...] State Home Minister V. S. Acharya explained the reason for the notices, [...] "All Christian institutions are <b>grant-in-aid</b> institutions of the government and they should have had the courtesy to inform us before declaring a holiday. Their decision to act unilaterally cannot be tolerated." [...] The education minister was backed by the State President D. V. Sadananda Gowda, who issued a statement in which he stated that Christian education institutions had committed a crime by declaring holiday without obtaining the state government's permission. However, the Indian National Congress (INC) condemned Hegde's statement to take action against Christian education institutions and the leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, Mallikarjun Kharge, stated that [...] "The minister's statement is not proper. It may lead to law and order problem in the State." [...] Bajrang Dal proponents protested with banners outside the St. Aloysius College gates and across Mangalore on Saturday 31 August, the day after the college had closed for a holiday, chanting slogans such as, [...] "Jai Mata Di" [...] (Hail to the Mother) and [...] "Bharat Mata ki jai" [...] (Hail Mother India). It should be noted, however, that the closure of the schools in Mangalore were not alone; some 45,000 institutions across India had participated on 29 August in a [...] "prayer for peace and communal harmony" [...] in response to the events in Orissa.|$|E
2500|$|India {{announced}} that it would provide a <b>grant-in-aid</b> of US$ 100,000 annually to each of the 14 Pacific Island countries, including Tuvalu, at the Post Forum Dialogue partner meeting in 2006. The amount was increased to US$125,000 annually from 2009. Tuvalu utilized the grants for several activities such as procuring computers, medicines, and medical equipment for the Princess Margaret [...] Hospital (the only government hospital in the capital city of Funafuti). At the first FIPIC Summit on 19 November 2014, Prime Minister Modi announced numerous steps that India would take to improve relations with Pacific Island countries, including the Marshall Islands, such as easing visa policies, increase in <b>grant-in-aid</b> to Pacific Island Countries to US$200,000 each annually, and several measures to boost bilateral trade and aid {{in the development of the}} Pacific Island countries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{couple have}} had {{the use of a}} five-bedroom, five-reception grace and favour {{apartment}} at Kensington Palace. The Queen had paid the rent for the apartment at a market rate of £120,000 annually from her own private funds with the couple paying the nominal amount of £70 per week. The rent goes to the <b>Grant-in-aid,</b> provided by the Government for the maintenance of the Occupied Royal Palaces. The rent is based on the current rate for commercially rented properties at Kensington Palace, and is recorded in the overall figures for commercial rents in the <b>Grant-in-aid</b> annual report. This rent payment by the Queen is [...] "in recognition of the Royal engagements and work for various charities which Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have undertaken at their own expense, and without any public funding," [...] according to a statement released by the British Monarchy Media Centre.|$|E
2500|$|The World Service {{is funded}} by the United Kingdom's {{television}} licence fee, limited advertising and the profits of BBC Worldwide Ltd. The service is also guaranteed £289 million (allocated {{over a five-year period}} ending in 2020) from the UK government. [...] The World Service was funded for decades by <b>grant-in-aid</b> through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the British Government until 1 April 2014.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 January 1938, {{the first}} foreign-language service was {{launched}} in Arabic. [...] Programmes in German started on 29 March 1938, {{and by the end}} of 1942 broadcasts were being made in all major European languages. As a result, the Empire Service was renamed the BBC Overseas Service in November 1939, and a dedicated BBC European Service was added in 1941. These were financed not from the domestic licence fee but from government <b>grant-in-aid</b> (from the Foreign Office budget), and known administratively as the External Services of the BBC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} large land owning private-Tharavad-owned schools in North Malabar {{expanded}} {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century partly due to the availability of government <b>grant-in-aid</b> for such enterprises from 1939 onwards. [...] Furthermore, corporate expansion of land owning Tharavads and a decrease in European engineered proletysing of the depressed classes also contributed to the growth pattern. These schools often had teaching staff from educated families. [...] In democratic Kerala however, many of these schools evolved as public and government enterprises, which led to the recruitment of teachers from the southern provinces and the subsequent immigration of teaching staff of all ethno-religious backgrounds, many of whom preferred to settle in the area permanently.|$|E
2500|$|Olof Palme's last government, elected {{during a}} time when Sweden's economy was in {{difficult}} shape, sought to pursue a [...] "third way," [...] designed to stimulate investment, production, and employment, having ruled out classical Keynesian policies {{as a result of the}} growing burden of foreign debt, together with the big balance of payments and budget deficits. This involved [...] "equality of sacrifice," [...] whereby wage restraint would be accompanied by increases in welfare provision and more progressive taxation. For instance, taxes on wealth, gifts, and inheritance were increased, while tax benefits to shareholders were either reduced or eliminated. In addition, various welfare cuts carried out before Olof's return to office were rescinded. The previous system of indexing pensions and other benefits was restored, the <b>grant-in-aid</b> scheme for municipal child care facilities was re-established, unemployment insurance was restored in full, and the so-called “no benefit days” for those drawing sickness benefits were cancelled. Increases were also made to both food subsidies and child allowances, while the employee investment funds (which represented a radical form of profit-sharing) were introduced.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} the war on the London theatres may now be imagined. The beds and the bevies drove every higher form of art out of it. Rents went up to an {{unprecedented}} figure. At the same time prices doubled everywhere except at the theatre pay-boxes, and raised the expenses of management {{to such a degree that}} unless the houses were quite full every night, profit was impossible. Even bare solvency could not be attained without a very wide popularity. Now what had made serious drama possible to a limited extent before the war was that a play could pay its way even if the theatre were only half full until Saturday and three-quarters full then. A manager who was an enthusiast and a desperately hard worker, with an occasional <b>grant-in-aid</b> from an artistically disposed millionaire, and a due proportion of those rare and happy accidents by which plays of the higher sort turn out to be potboilers as well, could hold out for some years, by which time a relay might arrive in the person of another enthusiast. Thus and not otherwise occurred that remarkable revival of the British drama at the beginning of the century which made my own career as a playwright possible in England. In America I had already established myself, not as part of the ordinary theatre system, but in association with the exceptional genius of Richard Mansfield. In Germany and Austria I had no difficulty: the system of publicly aided theatres there, Court and Municipal, kept drama of the kind I dealt in alive; so that I was indebted to the Emperor of Austria for magnificent productions of my works at a time when the sole official attention paid me by the British Courts was the announcement to the English-speaking world that certain plays of mine were unfit for public performance, a substantial set-off against this being that the British Court, in the course of its private playgoing, paid no regard to the bad character given me by the chief officer of its household.|$|E
