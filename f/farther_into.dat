5|$|The Scotch-Irish began immigrating to the Middle Colonies {{in waves}} after 1717. They {{primarily}} pushed <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the western frontier of the colonies, where they repeatedly confronted the Indians.

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 14thcentury, the westernmost Mongol territories had become subject to {{frequent}} Polish and Hungarian military offensives. Grand Prince Olgierd of Lithuania penetrated <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the territories controlled by the Golden Horde than any European army had hitherto done. He won a major victory over the united Mongol troops on the Dnieper near the Black Sea in 1363.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{managers}} and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the Hubble telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|The study {{proposed}} a possible surface base on Callisto that would produce rocket propellant for further {{exploration of the}} Solar System. Advantages of a base on Callisto include low radiation (due to its distance from Jupiter) and geological stability. Such a base could facilitate remote exploration of Europa, or be an ideal location for a Jovian system waystation servicing spacecraft heading <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the outer Solar System, using a gravity assist from a close flyby of Jupiter after departing Callisto.|$|E
5|$|With {{the tunnel}} now {{designated}} exclusively for subway service, Mayor Hylan, a former Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) employee {{who was a}} known opponent of both the BMT and the IRT, supposedly stopped the project {{as part of an}} overall effort to cripple the two private subway companies and promote the plans for the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND). It was also reported that Governor Smith, who had a financial stake in the Pennsylvania Railroad company, tried to stall the project in order to prevent the expansion of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad operations <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the city. The stoppage was also attributed to the political rivalry between Hylan and Smith, who were both members of Tammany Hall's Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not just seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last longer than that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E

25|$|Fifteenth Army {{never entered}} {{the main line}} of battle. However, its {{formations}} did see some action, when it contained and then reduced the enormous Ruhr Pocket from the west during April 1945 in conjunction with elements of Ninth Army. This resulted in the capture of 325,000 German prisoners. Fifteenth Army would take over occupation duties {{in the region as}} Ninth Army and First Army pushed <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> Germany.|$|E

25|$|The first {{significant}} attempts at exploring the Trans-Allegheny region occurred under {{the administration of}} Governor William Berkeley. Efforts to explore <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> Virginia were hampered in 1644 when about 500 colonists were killed in another Indian massacre led, once again, by Opechancanough. Berkeley is credited with efforts to develop others sources of income for the colony besides tobacco such as cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large Green Spring Plantation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} of the Allied line, Eisenhower {{inserted}} a new army—the 15th Army, under U.S. 12th Army Group control—to hold {{the western edge of the}} Ruhr Pocket along the Rhine while the 9th and 1st Armies squeezed the remaining German defenders there from the north, east, and south. Following the reduction of the Ruhr, the 15th Army was to take over occupation duties in the region as the 9th, 1st, and 3rd Armies pushed <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> Germany.|$|E
25|$|As pioneers, {{they were}} the advance guard blazing the trail through the {{wilderness}} far out on the frontier. They were {{the first line of}} defense against the savages, bearing the brunt of the Indian wars, and courageously enduring the hardships of pioneer life as the typical frontiersmen of provincial Pennsylvania. Step by step they had advanced along a perilous path, surmounting whatever difficulties arose, moving ever <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the wilderness and reclaiming it to the new civilization.|$|E

25|$|Searching for the {{remaining}} four travelers took more than two months. They were finally found on May 4 under four metres of snow in a ravine 75 metres <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the woods from the cedar tree. These four were better dressed than the others, and there were signs that those who had died first had apparently relinquished their clothes to the others. Zolotaryov was wearing Dubinina's faux fur coat and hat, while Dubinina's foot was wrapped {{in a piece of}} Krivonishenko's wool trousers.|$|E
25|$|Chongqing is {{the largest}} of the four direct-controlled {{municipalities}} of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over , is rural.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} is on Hidalgo Street, where one passes between two large chapels called the Chapel of Santa Cruz and the Chapel of the Tercera Orden. The Tercera Orden {{is considered to}} be the more valuable artistically of the two, with its highly sculpted early Baroque main and side portals painted in various colors. Inside, there is a later Churrigueresque main altar. A third chapel, called the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores is <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the atrium and near the Open Chapel of San José.|$|E

She was eight days in making a distance of about 100 miles, then headed down stream and returned to Lewiston in less than five hours. Captain Stump reported his explorations as having been of no practical value; but he had taken a steamer <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the heart of the regions lying to the east than any craft had ever gone before.|$|E
25|$|In April 2012, the {{university}} submitted a revised {{plan for the}} arts and transit center, calling for the extension of the station's freight house onto the right-of-way for possible use as a restaurant. The Regional Planning Board introduced an ordinance requiring the land be preserved for a transportation right-of-way that could eventually extend <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> the central business district at Nassau Street. According to {{the university}}, ownership of the trackage would have to change hands in order for the extended transitway to be implemented. Approvals were subsequently issued for converting the station house and the expanded freight house into a pair of restaurants, preserving two original ticket windows for kitchen views, and using the wooden arrival/departure boards as overhead menus.|$|E
25|$|Gira's {{disillusionment with}} their Uni/MCA {{exploits}} led to White Light from the Mouth of Infinity (1991), a successful blending of earlier hard rock and later pop styles. Produced by Gira, the album blended acoustic rock, blues and hypnotic guitar noise successfully, {{resulting in an}} album more complex than anything they had released in the past. This album was followed by Love of Life (recorded by Martin Bisi in 1992), the EP single Love of Life/Amnesia, taking the group even <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> experimentation, and then The Great Annihilator (1995), considered {{to be one of}} the band's most accessible releases, possibly through being their most straightforward. The songwriting style and musical approach, however, would take a more unusual turn the following year.|$|E
