40|$|Wildfire {{simulators}} {{based on}} empirical or physical models {{need to be}} locally calibrated and validated when used under conditions that differ from those where the simulators were originally developed. This study aims to calibrate the FARSITE fire spread model considering a set of recent wildfires that occurred in northern Iranian forests. Site-specific <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> in the study areas were selected by sampling the main natural vegetation type complexes and assigning standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models.</b> Overall, simulated fires presented reliable outputs that accurately replicated the observed fire perimeters and behavior. Standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> of Scott and Burgan (2005) afforded better accuracy in the simulated fire perimeters than the standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> of Anderson (1982). The best match between observed and modeled burned areas was observed on herbaceous <b>fuel</b> <b>models.</b> Fire modeling showed a high potential for estimating spatial variability in fire spread and behavior in the study areas. This work represents {{a first step in}} the application of fire spread modeling in northern Iran for wildfire risk monitoring and management...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Fuel</b> <b>Model</b> is {{a stylized}} set of fuel bed {{characteristics}} {{used as input}} {{for a variety of}} wildfire modeling applications. Wildfire behavior models, such as those of Rothermel, take into account numerous empirical variables. While these inputs are important for equation outputs, they are often difficult and time-consuming, if not impossible, to measure for each fuel bed. A <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> defines these input variables for a stylized set of quantitative vegetation characteristics that can be visually identified in the field. Depending on local conditions, one of several fuel models may be appropriate. As Anderson states “Fuel models are simply tools to help the user realistically estimate fire behavior. The user must maintain a flexible frame of mind and an adaptive method of operating to totally utilize these aids". Furthermore, depending on the application, the user must choose a <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> classification system. The major classification systems for use in the United States include the National Fire Danger Rating System, the 13 ‘original’ fuel models of Anderson and Albini, the subsequent set of 40 fuels produced by Scott and Burgan, and the Fuel Characteristics Classification System.|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{the spread}} of {{wildland}} fire is growing concern in the Netherlands, where fire events at the wildland urban interface {{is a growing concern}} with a changing climate. A multi-year project was initiated in 2012 to obtain field-based fuel measurements to be used to estimate wildland fire spread for surface fire. The overall objective was to develop either custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> or utilize existing Northern American <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> to <b>fuel</b> conditions in some of the hazardous vegetation in the Netherlands. Over a four-year period, 96 plots were established, a wide variety of fuel parameters measured, and ANOVA (p ≤ 0. 1) and Duncan’s MRT used to place these into 56 different vegetation communities. Following multiple permutations in Behaveplus, the 56 communities were consolidated into 28 different <b>fuel</b> <b>models.</b> It was then attempted to use these <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> as input variables in a Dutch-developed wildland fire spread <b>model.</b> Some <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> produced similar fire spread, and since they were within relatively similar communities, were combined, resulting in 21 working <b>fuel</b> <b>models.</b> The results of this project will provide land managers, fire brigades and landowners more accurate wildland fire spread estimations, improving safety of the public in this densely populated country. The results of this project will contribute to more accurate and detailed calculations of the NBVM (Dutch wildfire spreadmodel). The NBVM will provide necessary information, to be able to reduce the risk on uncontrollable wildfires, via wildfire prevention measurements and during an incident, to support decision making...|$|R
40|$|Field {{research}} was conducted in quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx., communities. Fifty-one plots were established in seven major locations in the Bear River Range of northern Utah. The locations inventoried {{were divided into two}} age classes: young aspen (under 70 yr) and old aspen (over 70 yr). Custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> were developed for each age class and the data were analyzed for relationships between fuel loads and other measurable factors, including: basal area, average diameter at breast height (d. b. h.), fuel depth, litter loads, tree regeneration, shrub loads, herbaceous loads, slope, tree height, aspect, percent aspen in the plot, grazing intensity, trees infected with disease, elevation, and stand age. The computer program BEHAVE, fuels inventory data, and the two customized <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> were used to predict fire behavior, including: flame length, fireline intensity, rate of spread, and heat per unit area. Young aspen stands and old aspen stands differed significantly for most of the variables studied. The customized <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> for the young aspen and old aspen also differed, and these <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> predicted different fire behavior in the two aspen age classes. When fuel loads were compared to the other stand characteristics inventoried for the 51 plots, fuel loads were most strongly correlated with avenge d. b. h. (F_=. 005). Fuel loads were also negatively correlated to grazing intensity (p=. 024) for the 51 plots. No significant correlations were found between fuel loads and the other variables when analyzed for the seven locations. In general, stand conditions were not good indicators of fuel loads in aspen communities. Most important to this study were the differences in the fuel data. When used to develop custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models,</b> the young and old aspen <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> represented two distinct stand types and predicted different fire behavior.
