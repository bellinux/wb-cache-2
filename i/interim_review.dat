25|$|To get Railtrack out of administration, the {{government}} {{had to go back}} to the High Court and present evidence that the company was no longer insolvent. The principal reason given by {{the government}} to the court for this assertion was the decision of the rail regulator – announced on 22 September 2002 – to carry out an <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> of the company's finances, with the potential to advance significant additional sums to the company. The High Court accepted that the company was not therefore insolvent, and the railway administration order was discharged on 2 October 2002.|$|E

50|$|The next day, Saturday 6 October 2001, {{the board}} of Railtrack met to discuss what the {{government}} intended to do. In the early evening, they called Winsor and asked whether he {{would be prepared to}} carry out an <b>interim</b> <b>review.</b> Despite the threatened legislation to stop him, Winsor replied that he would be prepared to help. Although he explained to Railtrack that he could not complete an <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> over a single weekend, he said he would be prepared to make a public statement that he had started the process, and suggested to Railtrack that if they were to show that to the administration judge the next day, the administration order would probably not be made. But Railtrack rejected Winsor's willingness to intervene, and the company went into administration - unopposed - the next day, Sunday 7 October 2001.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} realised that ending Railtrack's administration {{required the}} High Court {{to be satisfied}} {{that the company was}} solvent. Darling needed Winsor to announce his willingness to carry out an <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> of the company's financial position, with the probability that he would allocate substantially greater sums to the company for the operation, maintenance and renewal of the network. To enable Winsor to make that decision, Darling knew that he needed to make a formal statement to Parliament to the effect that the government had reviewed the economic regulatory regime for the railways and was satisfied with it, and in particular that its independence was an essential cornerstone of the regime and of continuing private investor confidence in the railways. Darling made that statement on 12 June 2002, and Winsor announced his intention to carry out the <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> on 22 September 2002.|$|E
50|$|Winsor's <b>interim</b> {{regulatory}} <b>review</b> {{lasted until}} 12 December 2003, {{when he announced}} an additional £7.4 billion in funding, taking Network Rail's income for the five years 2004-2009 to £22.2 billion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Since {{the advent}} of {{applying}} Agile [1] practices on DoD projects, specifi-cally Scrum [2] practices, the burning question asked by many has been, “How does Agile integrate with Waterfall [3] milestones?” Agile development is by definition incremental, meaning major functionality is com-pleted and demonstrated to the customer, users, and other stakeholders at specified releases and {{through a series of}} short, scheduled iterations (or sprints). Waterfall projects rely on completing all requirements by the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) milestone, completing all design by the Critical Design Review (CDR) milestone, and completing product development by the Test Readiness Review (TRR) milestone. Some success has been made to abate this issue by breaking the typical waterfall-based milestone <b>reviews</b> into multiple <b>interim</b> <b>reviews</b> enabled by the flex-ibility in the DoD 5000 acquisition regulation requirements. <b>Interim</b> <b>reviews</b> reflect the iterative nature of Agile as they can be held more frequently and with tighter focus than the traditional days-long milestone reviews. This article presents an approach that uses surveillance points throughout the proj-ect lifecycle as the basis for technical interchange meetings (TIMS) each of which includes a demonstration and review of completed functionality that can be deployed as an operational component of the final product. When deployed into the targeted domain, users are encouraged to provide reflections of product usage in the form of feedback to the project team in real time...|$|R

40|$|<b>Interim</b> {{external}} <b>review</b> of CIMMYT {{conducted in}} February 1993 {{by a panel}} chaired by Sir Ralph Riley. The document also contains a transmittal from the panel chairman. The transmittal from the TAC Chairman and the CGIAR Executive Secretary, TAC's commentary, and CIMMYT's response are in a separate record. This was an experiment to determine whether regular reviews could be conducted less frequently than every five years, with <b>interim</b> <b>reviews</b> requiring less work at centers in the meantime. The panel appraised the steps taken by CIMMYT in response to program and management reviews conducted in 1988, and other developments since that date. The impact of maize research was now clearer than before, and more attention was going to hybrids because of spreading demand. In wheat, much attention was being given to disease resistance, particularly to karnal bunt. The economics program had been transformed from major involvement in on farm research and outreach to broader research. The panel noted CIMMYT's conviction that it could contribute significantly {{to the understanding of}} environmental issues related to its mandate crops, and raised the issue of possible interference of this effort with the effectiveness of research on increased productivity. There were also comments on a variety of other research and management issues, and numerous suggestions, but no formal recommendations.

A subsequent <b>interim</b> <b>review</b> in 2011 did not change any ward boundaries, but increased the number of councilors to 1223 from May 2012.

50|$|Since 1950 each Member of Parliament has {{represented}} a single constituency. There remains a technical distinction between county constituencies and borough constituencies, {{but the only}} effect of this difference is {{in the amount of}} money candidates are allowed to spend during campaigns. The boundaries of the constituencies are determined by four permanent and independent Boundary Commissions, one each for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The commissions conduct general reviews of electoral boundaries once every 8 to 12 years, and a number of <b>interim</b> <b>reviews.</b> In drawing boundaries, they are required to take into account local government boundaries, but may deviate from this requirement to prevent great disparities in the populations of the various constituencies. The proposals of the Boundary Commissions are subject to parliamentary approval, but may not be amended. After the next general review of constituencies, the Boundary Commissions will be absorbed into the Electoral Commission, which was established in 2000. As of 2017, the United Kingdom is divided into 650 constituencies, with 533 in England, 40 in Wales, 59 in Scotland, and 18 in Northern Ireland.|$|R
