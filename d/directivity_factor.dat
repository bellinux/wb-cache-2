40|$|Abstract—Superdirective fixed beamformers {{are known}} to attain high {{directivity}} factors, but are extremely sensitive to uncorrelated noise and slight errors in the array elements, which are modeled by the beamformer white noise gain measure. The delay-and-sum beamformer, on the other hand, manages to maxi-mize the white noise gain, but suffers from a very low <b>directivity</b> <b>factor.</b> In this paper, we discuss {{the design of a}} broadband beam-former which controls both the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor</b> and the white noise gain. We combine a regularized version of the superdirec-tive beamformer together with the delay-and-sum beamformer to create a robust regularized superdirective beamformer. We derive analytic closed-form expressions of the beamformer gain responses, and extend them to derive a beamformer with full control of the desired white noise gain or the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor.</b> The proposed approach offers a simple and robust broadband beamformer with controllable characteristics, shown here through persuasive simulation results.

The heliolongitudes {{of the sources of}} these bursts, estimated at different frequencies by assuming that they are located on the Parker spiral magnetic field lines emerging from the associated active regions into the spherically symmetric solar atmosphere, and the heliolongitudes of the spacecraft are used to estimate the viewing angle, which is the angle between the direction of the magnetic field at the source and the line connecting the source to the spacecraft. The normalized peak intensities at each spacecraft Rj = Ij /[Sigma]Ij (the subscript j corresponds to the spacecraft STEREO A, B, and WIND), which are defined as the <b>directivity</b> <b>factors</b> are determined using the time profiles of the type III bursts. It is shown that the distribution of the viewing angles divides the type III bursts into: (1) bursts emitting into a very narrow cone centered around the tangent to the magnetic field with angular width of approximately 2 deg and (2) bursts emitting into a wider cone with angular width spanning from [approx] - 100 deg to approximately 100 deg. The plots of the <b>directivity</b> <b>factors</b> versus the viewing angles of the sources from all three spacecraft indicate that the type III emissions are very intense along the tangent to the spiral magnetic field lines at the source, and steadily fall as the viewing angles increase to higher values. The comparison of these emission patterns with the computed distributions of the ray trajectories indicate that the intense bursts visible in a narrow range of angles around the magnetic field directions probably are emitted in the fundamental mode, whereas the relatively weaker bursts visible {{to a wide range of}} angles are probably emitted in the harmonic mode...|$|R

A linear microphone array sometimes is used near some scattering objects, which affect its beamforming performance. This paper develops a numerical model with a linear microphone array near a rigid sphere for both far-field plane wave and near-field sources. The effects of the scatterer on two typical beamformers, i. e., the delay-and-sum beamformer and the superdirective beamformer, are investigated by both simulations and experiments. It is found that the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor</b> of both beamformers improves due to the increased equivalent array aperture when the size of the array is no larger than that of the scatter. With the increase of the array size, the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor</b> tends to deteriorate at high frequencies because of the rising side-lobes.

Measurements of the radiation pattern (amplitude and phase) and of the pressure reflection coefficient were obtained over an azimuthal wave number range of 0 to 6 and a frequency range up to 5000 Hz for an unflanged duct and a bellmouth. The measured radiated field and pressure reflection coefficient without flow for the unflanged duct agree reasonably well with theory. The influence of the inlet contour appears to be very drastic near the cut-on frequency of a mode and reasonable agreement is found between the bellmouth pressure reflection coefficient and a infinite hyperboloidal inlet theory. It is also shown that the flow has a weak effect on the amplitude of the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor</b> but significantly shifts the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor</b> phase.

Mammography units and computer tomographs made 6. 7 % each, accelerants – 0. 7 %. The most frequent reasons of primary refusals to accept design documentation were: absence of calculations of protection against all placed diagnostic X-ray devices (23. 6 % – at placing of diagnostic X-ray sets, 16. 2 % – at placing of dentist devices), absence of the upper floors layouts (26. 5 % – at placing of dentist X-rays) and absence of permitting documentation for X-ray devices (at placing of dentist X-ray devices – 22. 2 %). At carrying out of design activity of special importance is creation of medical and technical projects which were absent in 22. 9 % of presented projects and in 34. 6 % were replaced with technical projects. Significant drawbacks of the projects were ignoring the necessity to consider {{the distance from the}} personnel workplaces and the width of technical passes (34. 0 %). That was caused by the absence of corresponding documentation from suppliers of equipment for X-ray rooms. At calculation of protection against X-ray radiation in 11. 3 % of projects of placing X-ray diagnostic devices (sets) and in 7. 7 % of projects of placing dentist X-ray devices, radiation <b>directivity</b> <b>factors</b> (N) were determined incorrectly.

50|$|Antenna gain {{is closely}} related to {{directivity}} and often incorrectly used interchangeably. However, gain is always less than <b>directivity</b> by a <b>factor</b> called radiation efficiency, η. Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of antenna, gain takes into account the losses that always occur in the real world. Specifically, accelerating charge (time varying current) causes electromagnetic radiation per Maxwell's equations. Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on radiating elements to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna. This coupling is never 100% efficient (by Laws of Thermodynamics), and therefore antenna gain will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.|$|R

Moreover, when the VSA Bartlett estimator is applied for seabed parameter estimation, it will be shown that the estimation resolution of these parameters increased significantly, even for density and compressional attenuation, parameters difficult to estimate using an array of hydrophones...|$|E
40|$|Giant radio {{pulses of}} the {{millisecond}} pulsar B 1937 + 21 were recorded with the S 2 VLBI system at 1. 65 GHz with NASA/JPL’s 70 -m radio telescope at Tidbinbilla, Australia. These pulses {{have been observed}} as strong as 65000 Jy with widths ≤ 15 ns, corresponding to a brightness temperature Tb ≥ 5 · 10 39 K, the highest observed in the universe. The vast majority of these pulses occur in a 5. 8 µs and 8. 2 µs window at the very trailing edges of the regular main pulse and interpulse profiles, respectively. Giant pulses occur in general with a single spike. Only in one case out of 309 was the structure clearly more complex. The cumulative distribution is fit by a power law with index − 1. 40 ± 0. 01 with a low-energy but no high-energy cutoff. We estimate that giant pulses occur frequently but are only rarely detected. When corrected for the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor,</b> 25 giant pulses {{are estimated to be}} generated in one neutron star revolution alone. The intensities of the giant pulses of the main pulses and interpulses are not correlated with each other nor with the intensities or energies of the main pulses and interpulses themselves. Their radiation energy density can exceed 300 times the plasma energy density at the surface of the neutron star and can even exceed the magnetic field energy density at that surface. We therefore do not think that the generation of giant pulses is linked to the plasma mechanisms in the magnetosphere. Instead we suggest that it is directly related to discharges in the polar cap region of the pulsar...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the methodology of}} calculation of circular microstrip antenna. The antenna itself has been presented as a cylindrical resonator electrically small height. The mathematical description of the electromagnetic field inside the cavity volume and fields acting on the side wall of the cavity is presented. Input impedance of the antenna and the resonator formed on the sidewall of the cavity and the gain coefficient of the directional antenna are calculated. An evaluation of mathematical modeling of the simulated values is obtained match within 5 %. Mathematical modeling of the <b>directivity</b> <b>factor</b> and the quality factor is performed. To {{solve the problem of}} the radial waveguide excitation we used the expression for the longitudinal component of the electric field as a sum of incident and reflected waves with unknown coefficients of reflection. The analytical expressions were derived through the Bessel and Hankel function for them. To determine the field in the outer region of the gap instead of a side wall of the cavity located above the screen the annular slit unilateral radiation slotted in an infinite plane screen is mapd. It is acceptable because of the low height of the cavity. The input impedance of the antenna excited {{at the edge of the}} disc was induced electromotive force method. Restrict expression using dielectrics with high permittivity (fiberglass, ceramics, polycor etc.) is presented in this paper, but it provides an opportunity to obtain simple settlement relations. The obtained relations allow to analyze explicitly the basic laws. Due to the miniaturization of microelectronics problem the calculating microstrip antennas is very important. Thus, the approximate formulas with a very simple form provide a good estimate of the basic electrical characteristics of the circular strip (disk) antennas. ? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????. ???? ??????? ???? ???????????? ? ???? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????? ??????. ????????? ?????????????? ???????? ???????????????? ????? ??? ?????? ?????? ??????????, ??? ? ?????, ??????????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????????. ?????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ???????, ???????????? ?? ??????? ?????? ??????????, ? ????? ??????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ???????. ????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????? ? ???????????. ????? ???????, ? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????? ??????...|$|E
