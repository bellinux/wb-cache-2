40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the torque {{production}} and control strategies of variable flux reluctance machines (VFRMs). Based on energy conservation, an instantaneous torque equation is developed and analysed, which reveals the contributions of harmonic currents and inductances to the torque production. By using Fourier series, all of the harmonics in the phase currents and winding inductances are considered. It was found that the average torque of a 6 / 4 VFRM is mainly produced by the dc, fundamental and second harmonic components of the phase currents. Based on the <b>derived</b> <b>torque</b> equation, magnitudes and phases of the current harmonics are optimised so that the average torque is maximised under a given rms current. Undesirable level of torque ripple was found, due to the inductance harmonics. The third harmonic torque ripple is dominant in the 6 / 4 VFRM, whilst the 6 / 7 VFRM has a lower magnitude sixth harmonic component. In order to reduce the torque ripple, a harmonic field current is injected. Since the torque ripple reduction method utilises the machine parameters, the influence of the parameter mismatch is investigated. The torque waveforms predicted by the <b>derived</b> <b>torque</b> equation are compared with the results directly calculated by 2 D-finite element analysis (FEA). Additionally, the experimental results verify that the <b>derived</b> <b>torque</b> equations can predict the torque production of the VFRMs to a good degree of accuracy. In order to improve the machine efficiency and extend the operating speed range, an integrated field and armature current control strategy has been proposed. The field and armature currents are injected into a single coil as a sinusoidal current biased by a dc offset, rather than a separate field and armature winding. In the integrated current control scheme, a zero sequence current generates a virtual rotor flux as the field current, whilst the three-phase sinusoidal currents produce a rotating stator field. The zero sequence current is generated by adjusting the on-time of zero vectors between two inverters. In the case of the 6 / 4 VFRM, an open winding configuration is utilised since the field and armature windings have the same polarity in each tooth winding. In contrast, a dual three-phase winding configuration having a neutral point is adopted for the 6 / 7 VFRM, due to the opposite polarity between the field and armature windings. For the vector control, the voltage and torque equations are derived in the synchronous dq-axis frame. With the aid of MATLAB/Simulink, these equations are also utilised for the dynamic simulation. The simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed strategy can effectively increase the efficiency and extend the operating speed range of the VFRMs. As an extended work, a torque ripple reduction method is also applied to the integrated current control by injecting harmonic components into the zero sequence current...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to compliant taskspace control for high degree-of-freedom manipulators driven by positioncontrolled actuators. The actuators in our approach are back-drivable and allow to limit the torque used for position control. Traditional approaches frequently achieve compliance through redundancy resolution.

40|$|The {{origin of}} tensor {{analysis}} started with Dr. Kron of GE (General Electric), who began writing a {{series in the}} “General Electric Review< in April 1935 that continued until 1938. Meanwhile at Chubu University, the late Emeritus Professor of Electrical Engineering, Kunihiro Kato, presented a number of in-depth papers on tensor analysis and related topics.

40|$|Shortly {{after landing}} on Mars, post-flight {{analysis}} of the "Spirit" entry data suggested that the vehicle experienced large, anomalistic oscillations in angle-of-attack starting at about M= 6. Similar analysis for "Opportunity " found even larger oscillations starting immediately after maximum dynamic pressure at M= 14. Where angles-of-attack of 1 - 2 degrees were expected from maximum dynamic pressure to drogue deployment, the reconstructions suggested 4 to 9 degrees. The next Mars lander, 2007 Phoenix project, was concerned enough to recommend further exploration of the anomalies. Detailed analysis of "Opportunity" data found significant anomalies in the hypersonic aerodynamic torques. The analysis showed that these torques were essentially fixed in the spinning vehicle. Nearly a year after landing, the "Oportunity" rover took pictures of its aeroshell on the surface, which showed that portions of the aeroshell thermal blanket assembly still remained. This blanket assembly was supposed to burn off {{very early in the}} entry. An {{analysis of the}} aeroshell photographs led to an estimate of the aerodynamic torques that the remnants could have produced. A comparison of two estimates of the aerodynamic torque perturbations (one extracted from telemetry data and the other from Mars surface photographs) showed exceptional agreement. Trajectory simulations using a simple data <b>derived</b> <b>torque</b> perturbation model provided rigid body motions similar to that observed during the "Opportunity" entry. Therefore, the case of the anomalistic attitude behavior for the "Opportunity" EDL is now considered closed and a suggestion is put forth that a similar event occurred for the "Spirit" entry as well...|$|E

Nevertheless, the method of measurement we used, {{with the aid of}} VAM software, did enable us to analyse both anterior and posterior teeth, relying as it did on an “average” occlusal plane, passing through the centroids of the FACC points of all teeth (except for the canines) as a reference. Indeed, this plane is only minimally affected by the tooth movements achieved during treatment. That being said, the occlusal plane cannot be considered entirely stable and, moreover, it is difficult to compare the results of this type of analysis with those in the literature, which derive from superimpositions of the palatine folds and posterior teeth.|$|R

40|$|We provide torque {{formulae}} for {{low mass}} planets undergoing type I migration in gaseous disks. These torque formulae put {{special emphasis on}} the horseshoe drag, which is prone to saturation: the asymptotic value reached by the horseshoe drag depends on a balance between coorbital dynamics (which tends to cancel out or saturate the torque) and diffusive processes (which tend to restore the unperturbed disk profiles, thereby desaturating the torque). We entertain here the question of this asymptotic value, and we <b>derive</b> <b>torque</b> formulae which give the total torque {{as a function of}} the disk's viscosity and thermal diffusivity. The horseshoe drag features two components: one which scales with the vortensity gradient, and one which scales with the entropy gradient, and which constitutes the most promising candidate for halting inward type I migration. Our analysis, which is complemented by numerical simulations, recovers characteristics already noted by numericists, namely that the viscous timescale across the horseshoe region must be shorter than the libration time in order to avoid saturation, and that, provided this condition is satisfied, the entropy related part of the horseshoe drag remains large if the thermal timescale is shorter than the libration time. Side results include a study of the Lindblad torque {{as a function of the}}rmal diffusivity, and a contribution to the corotation torque arising from vortensity viscously created at the contact discontinuities that appear at the horseshoe separatrices.
