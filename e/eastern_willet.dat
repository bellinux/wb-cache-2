NY221 was extended east to its current <b>eastern</b> terminus in <b>Willet</b> by the following year. The portion of the route between the Harford loop road and Willet utilized a highway added to the state highway system sometime after 1926. NY221 was rerouted to follow its current alignment to the hamlet of Harford in the mid-1930s, and its former routing to Harford Mills was redesignated as NY200 in the 1940s.|$|R
