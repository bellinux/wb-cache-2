Changes in the overall length-frequency distribution were detected for 2 species (Coryphaenoides armatus, Synaphobranchus kaupii), but only at depths greater than 1800 m (outside the maximum depth for commercial trawling). This suggests that whilst there is evidence for likely fisheries impacts on the biomass distribution of the demersal fish population as a whole, species-specific impacts are highly variable. It is clear that changes in population structure can extend beyond the depth at which fishing takes place, highlighting the importance for also considering the indirect effects on deep-sea fish populations...|$|R

Comparison of rostral tooth microwear {{to assess}} rostrum function in sawsharks [...] Chapter 4. General discussion. Although sawsharks are frequent by-catch in commercial <b>deep-water</b> <b>fisheries,</b> {{our understanding of}} their behaviour is limited; in particular with regards to how they use their barbels and rostrum. This project employed {{a variety of techniques}} to infer how sawsharks use their barbels and rostrum. Evidence from histology and preliminary fluorescent microscopy work suggests that the barbels serve a tactile function, since they lack sensory structures such as taste buds, free neuromasts and ampullae, and contain neurons in the epidermis that may be connected to tactile receptors or free nerve endings. Regression analysis also provided evidence to suggest that sawsharks may have a preference as to whether they use the left or right barbel to sense the environment (behavioural lateralisation). Microwear (i. e. scratches) on the rostral teeth of sawsharks and sawfishes was found to be similar, suggesting that both elasmobranchs use their rostrum for a similar purpose. Analysis of stomach contents from recently caught sawsharks showed that diet consisted of small fish and prawns; however, whole prey items did not show signs of impalement by rostral teeth. Histological investigation of the unusual structure on the tip of the rostrum (named the "fingerprint") regarding a possible sensory purpose was inconclusive.

These schemes met with little cooperation (and in some cases active opposition) from the islanders, and came to nothing: by 1850 Gordon had owned Barra for ten years, and seen no return for his money. Consequently, the islanders were still both poor and heavily dependent on potatoes. Furthermore, their landlord had no sentimental ties to them or the island, and held that the islanders were largely the authors of their own misfortune: if they had supported his improvements they would not find themselves dependent on the benevolence of others.|$|R
40|$|The Fisheries Research Centre has {{conducted}} a deep-water survey programme since 1993 {{and as part}} of this programme a deep-water trawl survey was carried out in September 1996. The survey fished areas along the continental slope west of Ireland from 52 ° N to 58 ° N at depths of 500 - 1, 200 m The primary objective was to secure samples of potentially commercial deep-water shark and teleost species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. The survey was conducted on a chartered commercial fishing vessel using a deep-water otter trawl fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. A total of 26 hauls were made during 87 hours of fishing and yielded a total catch of 29, 345 kg. The ground covered ranged from mud to gravel and bare rock and there was no significant gear damage during the survey. Thirteen species of chondrichtian and 33 species of teleost fish were recorded. Length, weight sex and maturity data were taken from some of these species. The most abundant species in the catch were Baird's smoothhead, roundnose grenadier, leafscale gulper shark, black scabbard and orange roughy. Trawl discards expressed as kg discarded per tonne of roundnose grenadier landed were calculated for a broad range of the most abundant species in the catch. During the survey in the Rockall Trough an estimated 16 t of deep-water species were discarded and results are compared to estimates for 1995. The main species discarded were smoothhead, squaliform sharks and Lepidion eques.

The overall diet of E. spinax suggested a fairly generalized benthopelagic foraging behaviour primarily tuned to pelagic macroplankton/microneckton, teleost fish and cephalopods. Sex and maturity related differences in the diet were not significant. Two main ontogenic diet shifts were observed at about 17 and 28 cm total length. Small and medium sized immature sharks had a diet dominated by eurybathic crustaceans, chiefly Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Pasiphaea sivado.

Deep-water chondrichthyans had a higher age at maturity and longevity, and a lower growth completion rate than shallow-water species. The average fishing mortality needed to drive a deep-water chondrichthyan species to extinction (Fextinct) was 38 – 58 % of that estimated for oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Mean values of Fextinct were 0. 149, 0. 250 and 0. 368 for deep-water, oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Reproductive mode was an important determinant of extinction risk, while body size had a weak effect on extinction risk.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{ecological}} interactions between bycatch species and orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) within exploited slope and seamount communities off Tasmania. The diet of Etmopterus baxteri and E. unicolor, two important bycatch species of these fisheries, is described using four indices [percentage frequency of occurrence, percentage by number, percentage by weight, and percentage by the index of relative importance (%IRI) ] calculated for broad prey categories, individual prey taxa, and functional prey groups. The identifiable diet of E. unicolor was dominated by benthic cephalopods (96 %IRI), whereas benthic teleost prey, notably orange roughy (43 %IRI), dominated the diet of E. baxteri. Similar trophic mechanisms appear to support aggregations of orange roughy and Etmopterus spp. off Tasmania; they feed on demersal species and mesopelagic or vertically migrating nekton advected laterally onto the mid-slope. The importance of teleost prey in the diet of E. baxteri apparently increases with shark length, whereas crustaceans become less important, which is a similar diet shift to that of orange roughy. Etmopterus baxteri is both a potential competitor and predator of orange roughy in these ecosystems.

Given the uncertainties in the mortality estimates and in the available life history parameters, several different scenarios, some incorporating stochasticity in the life history parameters (using Monte Carlo simulation), were analyzed. If only natural mortality were considered, even af ter introducing uncertainties in all parameters, the estimated population growth rate (λ) suggested an increasing population. However, ifﬁshing mortality from trawlﬁ sheries is considered, the estimates of λ either indicated increasing or declining populations. In these latter cases, the uncertainties in the species reproductive cycle seemed to be particularly relevant, as a 2 -year reproductive cycle indicated a stable population, while a longer (3 -year cycle) indicated a declining population. The estimated matrix elasticities were in general higher for the survivorship parameters of the younger age classes and tended to decrease for the older ages.

Currently, information on the life history of H. octofasciatus is limited to the south-eastern Indian Ocean. We compared estimated life history parameters for H. octofasciatus from this region with the western central Pacific Ocean. Histological examination of gonads of H. octofasciatus from a wide length and age range (295 – 1740 mm TL and 6 – 65 years) suggested that this species is a protogynous hermaphrodite in the Pacific Ocean, which is consistent with data for this species in the south-eastern Indian Ocean and its congeners. However, the maximum length (1740 mm TL), asymptotic length (L∞, 1912 mm TL) and longevity (65 years) were much greater in the Pacific compared to the Indian Ocean (1509 mm TL, 1166 mm TL and 47 – 56 years), resulting in substantially different growth trajectories and a lower instantaneous rate of natural mortality in the Pacific Ocean (i. e., 0. 06 vs 0. 09 year− 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The recent {{development}} of <b>deep-water</b> <b>fisheries</b> off Brazil is reviewed from biological, eco-nomic, and political perspectives. This {{process has been}} centered in the southeastern and southern sectors of the Brazilian coast (19 °- 34 °S) and was motivated by the overfishing of the main coastal resources and a gov-ernment-induced vessel-chartering program. Shelf break (100 - 250 m) operations by national hook-and-line and trawl vessels intensified in the 1990 s. Around 2000 - 2001, however, foreign-chartered longliners, gillnet-ters, potters, and trawlers started to operate in Brazilian waters, leading the occupation of the upper slope (250 - 500 m), mostly targeting monkfish (Lophyus gastrophysus), the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), the Bra-zilian codling (Urophycis mystacea), the wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), the Argentine short-fin squid (Illex argentinus), the red crab (Chaceon notialis), and the royal crab (Chaceon ramosae). Between 2004 and 2007, chartered trawlers established a valuable fishery on deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae), heavily ex-ploiting the lower slope (500 - 1000 m). Total catches of deep-water resources varied annually from 5, 756 ton in 2000 {{to a maximum of}} 19, 923 ton in 2002, decreasing to nearly 11, 000 ton in 2006.

In the Porcupine Seabight west of Ireland, coral-colonised carbonate mounds (up to 350 m high) are present at 600 - 900 m water depth. The corals Lophelia pertusa L. and Madrepora oculata L. contribute to this diverse ecosystem that may also {{play a significant role}} in expanding <b>deep-water</b> <b>fisheries.</b> New side-scan sonar, multibeam echosounder, sub-bottom profiler and underwater video imagery supplemented with sedimentological sample material were used to map the seabed in the environs of the Belgica Carbonate Mound province, eastern Porcupine Seabight. The data were integrated in a GIS and provides information on sediment pathways and benthic current patterns within the study area. A facies map of the study area highlights differing sedimentary processes showing evidences for strong northward bottom currents whose interaction has an influence on mounds growth and morphology. This survey revealed mound flanks dominated by sediment waves that give way to coral banks towards the mound summits. A form of coral accumulation was also documented. Detailed analyses of sediment properties from a 26 m core through sediment drift have generated a high-resolution palaeoclimate record revealing temporal patterns in bottom current strength variations. An accurate assessment of this influence on mound through a comparison with coral growth rates is ongoing...|$|E
40|$|The {{biology of}} the bigeye {{grenadier}} Macrourus holotrachys caught as by-catch in the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides longline fishery conducted around South Georgia was investigated to improve data available for fisheries management. Age estimates suggest that M. holotrachys is a moderately slow growing species (K = 0. 10), reaching ages of > 30 years and attaining total lengths (L-T) > 80 cm (L-infinity = 33). The size at which 50 % of females {{had started to}} mature (L-int 50) for M. holotrachys was 21 cm pre-anal length (L-PA) and occurred at c. 9 years old. Estimates of natural mortality and Pauly's growth performance index {{were found to be}} low (M = 0 (.) 09 and Phi = 2. 82 respectively). Gonad maturity stage was described from macroscopic and histological investigation. Mature ovaries had oocytes at all developmental stages with between 22 and 55 % likely to be spawned each year. Absolute fecundity ranged from 22 000 to 260 000 eggs and was positively correlated with both pre-anal length and mass. A highly skewed sex ratio of 32 : 1, females: males, was found for specimens caught by longlines but not for a small sample of shallower trawl-caught specimens. It is suggested that females are far more susceptible to longline capture than males. Macrourus holotrachys is a bentho-pelagic predator and scavenger that feeds {{on a wide range of}} fishes and invertebrates. The fish are long lived, slow-growing species typical of <b>deep-water</b> grenadiers; <b>fisheries</b> management strategies should reflect their probable susceptibility to overfishing.

40|$|Marine {{fisheries}} {{have spread}} to the deep-sea because the fishes {{in many of the}} shallow-water marine habitats have been overexploited. Many studies have found that deep-sea fishes generally grow slowly and can achieve long life spans; however, most age estimates have not been validated. Several methods for validating age and growth estimates have been developed and applied to deep-water and other long-lived organisms. These include lead-radium and bomb radiocarbon dating of calcified structures. Application of these techniques has usually validated high lifespan estimates, some in ex-cess of a century. In this paper, we discuss the applications and limitations of these techniques for difficult-to-age fishes. Because many fishery manage-ment techniques focus on biomass or yield and not as much on life history stages of fished populations, we specifically focus on the relevance of age validation to fishery management of deep-dwelling fishes, especially relative to slow growth, late age at maturity, long life spans, and the relative contri-bution of big, old, fecund females (BOFFs) and maternal-age-dependent lar-val survival to future generations via lifetime fecundity. These life history traits make their populations more vulnerable to fishing mortality, thus em-phasizing the need to accurately assess longevity in fishes.

40|$|Information is {{critical}} to Ecosystem Approach and to research about Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems/Habitats (VME/Hs), fishing impacts on habitats and ad-hoc management measures are high-priority. Therefore, this paper presents the ECOVUL/ARPA Interdisciplinary Approach, {{a case study of}} methodology for the identification of VME/Hs in order to advise on conservation measures such as marine protected areas (MPAs). By means of an interactive process involving Conventional Fisheries Science, Geomorphology, Sedimentology and Benthic Ecology, the methodology developed under the ECOVUL/ARPA project, has been useful in order to contribute to define practical criteria to the identification of VME/Hs, to improve the knowledge about VME/Hs distribution and the adverse impacts of bottom trawl fisheries and to produce high quality advice on habitat protection. Applying an interdisciplinary approach, the project identified the <b>deep-water</b> bottom trawl <b>fishery</b> footprint on the Hatton Bank Western slope (NEAFC Regulatory Area), mapped the main fishing grounds and related seabed habitats and studied the interactions between fishing and cold-water corals. This approach was used to suggest, with high level of precision, the spatial limits of an area closed to bottom fishing, as an essential conservation measure to protect the cold-water corals in the framework of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries management. We present here the methods used, the main results obtained and discuss on the utility of this approach and the possibilities to apply it in the NAFO Regulatory Area, with the aim to advise on measures for reducing the interactions of bottom fishing with sensitive high-seas habitats and to contribute to implement the UNGA recommendations about habitat conservation...|$|R
