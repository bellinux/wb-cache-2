50|$|Hand sowing or (planting) is {{the process}} of casting handfuls of seed over {{prepared}} ground, or broadcasting (from which the technological term is derived). Usually, a drag or harrow is employed to incorporate the seed into the soil. Though labor-intensive for any but small areas, this method is still used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the desired rate. A <b>hand</b> <b>seeder</b> can be used for sowing, though it is less of a help than it is for the smaller seeds of grasses and legumes.|$|E

H?? interesse dos agricultores familiares em migrar para o sistema de semeadura direta, por??m n??o est??o dispon??veis no mercado semeadoras de pequeno porte adequadas para esse fim. Na regi??o sul do Brasil foi constatada a utiliza????o de semeadoras manuais port??teis (saraqu??) por mais da metade desses agricultores, {{inclusive}} para semeadura direta. Apesar dos fatores positivos da sua utiliza????o, h?? restri????es de capacidade e desempenho operacional, al??m de problemas ergon??micos. As empresas n??o se interessam em projetar equipamentos mais adequados para esse segmento, continuando a produzir semeadoras antiquadas. ?? urgente o desenvolvimento de equipamentos desse porte, que confiram maior qualidade na semeadura dessas culturas e reduzam a dificuldade de trabalho desses agricultores. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi, atrav??s de metodologia de projeto, realizar as fases de projeto informacional e projeto conceitual de uma semeadora de tra????o humana para semeadura direta de milho e feij??o. Foram desenvolvidas concep????es capazes de realizar semeadura direta e convencional, focando nas reais necessidades tecnol??gicas relativas ao cultivo dessas culturas. Foi escolhida uma, dentre as concep????es da semeadora, a qual evoluiu para a concep????o final, utilizando princ??pios de solu????o existentes e atualmente empregados, obtendo-se a concep????o de uma semeadora puncionadora de empurrar com caracter??sticas superiores em rela????o ??s semeadoras atualmente dispon??veis. A mesma ?? constitu??da de estrutura tubular de a??o, um dosador tipo anel vertical, nove puncionadores, rodas limitadoras de profundidade e roda cobridora compactadora, que permitem a semeadura com qualidade, m??nimo revolvimento do solo e, consequentemente, m??nima demanda energ??tica. The crops of {{corn and}} beans are sown on {{a large number of}} small farms where conventional tillage is commonly used. The farmers are interested in adopting no tillage farming. However, small planters suited for this purpose are not available in the market. The portable <b>hand</b> <b>seeder</b> (jab-type) was found to be used {{for more than half of}} these farmers, including direct seeding, in southern Brazil. Despite the positive factors of their use, there are field capacity and operating performance constraints as well as ergonomic problems. Companies are not interested in designing equipment better suited for this segment, continuing to produce old-fashioned planters. It is urgent to develop equipment of this size in order to enhance the sowing quality of these crops and to reduce the difficulty of the work of these farmers. The aim of this work was to conduct informational and conceptual design phases of a human-powered planter for direct seeding {{of corn and}} beans employing a design methodology. Drill concepts capable of performing tillage and no-tillage seeding have been developed, focusing on real technological needs related to the cultivation of these crops. One was chosen, among the concepts of the planters, which evolved into a final design, using currently existing principles of solution, obtaining the design of a push punch planter with superior characteristics when compared with the planters currently available. The concept is formed by a tubular steel frame, a ring-type vertical seed meter, nine punchers, depth gauge wheels and closure and firming wheel, enabling sowing quality, minimum soil disturbance and hence minimum energy deman...|$|E
40|$|No tillage, {{minimum tillage}} and {{conventional}} tillage practices {{are commonly used}} in maize crops in Alentejo, affecting soil physic conditions and determining seeders performance. Seeders distribution can be evaluated in the longitudinal and vertical planes. Vertical plane is specified by seeding depth (Karayel et al., 2008). If, in one hand seeding depth uniformity is a goal for all crop establishment, in the other <b>hand,</b> <b>seeders</b> furrow openers depth control is never constant depending on soil conditions. Seed depth uniformity affects crop emergence, Liu et al. (2004) showed an higher correlation between crop productivity and emergence uniformity than with longitudinal plants distribution. Neto et al. (2007) evaluating seed depth placement by measuring maize mesocotyl length under no tillage conditions in 38 farms concluded that 20 % of coefficient of variation suggests the need of improvement seeders depth control mechanisms. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate casual relationships and create spatial variability maps between soil mechanic resistance and vertical distribution under three different soil practices to improve seed depth uniformity...|$|R
30|$|We were {{interested}} in analyzing, through floristic analysis of understory vegetation, the role of soil seed bank regeneration in maintaining the balance between seeders and resprouters. The distinction between these fire adaptations were described by Schutte et al. (1995) and van der Bank et al. (1999). These authors clearly indicated that seeders are fire-prone, profuse producers of small seeds that have variable viability and tend to have short dormancy periods. In turn, resprouters are adapted to fire {{by means of the}} resprouting of dormant buds in underground or close-to-ground xylopods, and are low-number large seed producers that are highly sensitive to fire. Higgins et al. (2008) describe the seeder strategy as non-persistent semelparous, and the resprouter strategy as persistent iteroparous. In the context of Mediterranean vegetation, seeders are pioneer low shrubs that produce profuse numbers of seeds (r-strategy) and have rolled leaves (malacophyllous). This vegetation includes rock rose (Cistaceae), some heath (Ericaceae), brooms (Cytisus, Teline), and gorses (Ulex) (Blondel and Aronson 1999). In Portuguese pine vegetation, resprouters are of late sucessional stages and mostly hard-leaved (sclerophyllous) and do not produce large quantities of seeds (k-strategists). These include oaks (Quercus), pistachios (Pistacia), privets (Phillyrea), and junipers (Juniperus). Higgins et al. (2008) distinguish the two life-cycle strategies as fire adaptations in relation to seed production and emergence. Pine understory vegetation includes both seeders (nonpersistent semelparous) and resprouters (persistent iteroparous). Seeders coarsely correspond to pioneer, rolled-leaved many-seed producers, r-strategist from initial succession stages; while resprouters correspond to leathery leaved, few-seed producers, k-strategists from late successional stages (Blondel and Aronson 1999; Higgins et al. 2008). Two distinct parallel life-strategies of regeneration as a response to post-fire conditions was demonstrated to stand for two distinct evolutionary lineages by Pausas and Verdú (2005), Verdú et al. (2007), and Paula and Pausas (2008). On the one hand, resprouters represent a lineage in which evolutionary pressure seems to have acted mostly on positive selection of resprouting capacity, whereas post-fire seed survival is largely depressed (Paula and Pausas 2008). On the other <b>hand,</b> propagule-persistent plants (<b>seeders)</b> represent a distinct lineage in which post-fire germination is either not disfavored by fire or enhanced by it (Paula and Pausas 2008). Thus, post-fire seed production and survival seem to be, in general, negatively correlated in resprouters and seeders (Paula and Pausas 2008). Some differences in distinct Mediterranean vegetation biogeographical contexts were also found by Paula et al. (2006) between the Mediterranean basin and California, USA. This character-functional distinction suggests a degree of coherence with the paleo-biogeographical origin types identified by Herrera (1992): seeders were neomediterranean with a continental-dry late Tertiary Central-Asia origin, and resprouters were paleomediterranean xeric sub-tropical mid Tertiary autochthonous taxa. Soil seed banks {{play an important role in}} post-fire succession of these two distinct fire-functional types.|$|R
