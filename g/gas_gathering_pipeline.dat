40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a numerical internal corrosion rate prediction method into the internal corrosion direct assessment (ICDA) process for wet <b>gas</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>pipelines</b> {{based on the}} back propagation (BP), the genetic algorithm (GA) and BP, and the particle swarm optimization and BP artificial neural networks (ANNs). The basic data were collected {{in accordance with the}} terms established by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers in the Wet Gas Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (WG-ICDA) SP 0110, and the corrosion influencing factors, which are the input variables of the ANN model, are identified and refined by the grey relational analysis method. A total of 116 groups of basic data and inspection data from seven <b>gathering</b> <b>pipelines</b> in Sichuan (China) are used to develop the numerical prediction model. Ninety-five of the 116 groups of data are selected to train the neural network. The remaining 21 groups of data are chosen to test the three ANNs. The test results show that the GA and BP ANN yield the smallest number of absolute errors and should be selected as the preferred model for the prediction of corrosion rates. The accuracy of the model was validated by another 54 groups of excavation data obtained from pipeline No. 8, whose internal environment parameters are similar to those found in the training and testing pipelines. The results show that the numerical method yields significantly better absolute errors than either the de Waard 95 model or the Top-of-Line corrosion model in WG-ICDA when applying the approach to specific pipelines, and {{it can be used to}} investigate a specific pipeline for which the data have been collected and the ANN has been developed in WG-ICDA SP 0110...|$|R
40|$|A new slope {{assessment}} methodology {{has been developed}} by TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. {{in an effort to}} switch from a reactive to a proactive hazard management approach and to optimize maintenance expenditure. The company operates 37, 000 km of natural <b>gas</b> <b>gathering</b> and transmission <b>pipelines,</b> portions of which traverse slopes and stream crossings. The newly developed rainfall-ground movement model provides site-specific ground movement predictions for approximately 1100 slopes and establishes a risk-ranked list of slopes upon which maintenance decisions can be based. The input to the predictive model is derived from internal and public information regarding site conditions. This information serves as input to a pipe-soil interaction model to determine the probability of pipeline failure for each slope. The ground movement for this model is limited to creep-type which is typically less than 100 mm per year. Landslides are not addressed in this paper. A system-wide database has been constructed for slopes to prioritize the slope movement hazards. The slope information includes geotechnical data such as bedrock geology, surficial geology, slope details, precipitation and erosion potential. Information related to the pipeline includes the location, age, size, as well as design pressure and temperature. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} a simulation {{model for the}} analysis of natural <b>gas</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>pipeline</b> network system. The simulation mathematical model of the pipeline element and non-pipeline element in natural gas pipeline network is established, the implicit difference method is used to change the partial differential model into the finite difference equations. In order to determine the unknown pressure and flow parameters, the Newton–Raphson solution technique is applied to solve the model. The simulation model is used to analyze the pipeline network in a gas field. The result simulated comparing with the actual parameter showed that the developed simulation model enabled to determine the parameters with less than 5 % relative error. And we can see from the simulation results that: the pressure in each pipeline does not exceed the allowable pressure, the pressure drop is small in the pipeline network, and the flow in part of pipeline is very small. Therefore, we can adjust the gas transmission scheme, and increase the gas transmission volume properly...|$|E

40|$|Gathering pipelines, which {{transport}} {{gas from}} well pads to downstream processing, are a {{sector of the}} natural gas supply chain for which little measured methane emissions data are available. This study performed leak detection and measurement on 96 km of <b>gathering</b> <b>pipeline</b> and the associated 56 pigging facilities and 39 block valves. The study found one underground leak accounting for 83 % (4. 0 kg CH 4 /hr) of total measured emissions.

Emissions estimated by this study fall within the uncertainty range of emissions estimated using emission factors from EPA’s 2015 Greenhouse Inventory and study activity estimates.
