5|$|Written by Douglas Adams, {{this story}} would involve the Doctor going into {{retirement}} but being constantly {{called upon to}} solve various problems. It was considered as the final story of Series 17 till Williams dismissed the <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> replaced by Shada.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} were only transient, however, {{and by the}} time 1984 had come to a close, Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success. Having only $60,000 left in the bank, Laliberté went back to the Canadian government to secure funding for a second year. While the Canadian federal government was enthusiastic, the Quebec provincial government was resistant to the <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not until Quebec's premier, René Lévesque, intervened on their behalf that the provincial government relented. The original big top tent that was used during the 1984 Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil tour can now be seen at Carnivàle Lune Bleue, a 1930s-style carnival that is home to the Cirque Maroc acrobats.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, {{common with}} many British sitcoms of that era, Dad's Army {{was made into}} a feature film. Backers Columbia Pictures imposed {{arbitrary}} changes, such as recasting Liz Fraser as Mavis Pike and filming outdoors in Chalfont St Giles rather than Thetford, which made the cast unhappy. The director, Norman Cohen, whose <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to make the film, was nearly sacked by the studio.|$|E
50|$|The Kynseker {{instrument}} {{from the}} Germanisches Nationalmuseum {{is both the}} highpoint and the endpoing of development. It lags behind Mersenne's <b>ideas.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> possible that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already conceived as historicizing.|$|R

50|$|In {{the third}} part of the Ethics, Spinoza argues that all things, {{including}} human beings, strive to persevere in their being. This is usually taken to mean that things try to last {{for as long as}} they can. Spinoza explains how this striving ("conatus") underlies our emotions (love, hate, joy, sadness and so on). Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as <b>it</b> has adequate <b>ideas</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessarily active, and in so far as <b>it</b> has inadequate <b>ideas,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessarily passive.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Lambert {{attempted}} {{to win the}} rights to produce Doctor Who independently for the BBC; however, this effort was unsuccessful because the Corporation was already in negotiations with producer Philip Segal in the United States. Cinema Verity projects that did reach production included Sleepers (BBC1, 1991) and The Cazalets (BBC One, 2001), the latter co-produced by actress Joanna Lumley, whose <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to adapt the novels by Elizabeth Jane Howard.|$|E
25|$|K. P. Chen, whose {{bank had}} been {{involved}} with the cotton industry since its early days, served as Chairman of the Cotton Control Commission or CCC. He was close to T. V.

25|$|Stockholm and Andrea Doria were {{experiencing}} different weather conditions {{immediately prior to}} the collision. The collision occurred {{in an area of}} the northern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts, where heavy and intermittent fog is common. Although Andrea Doria had been engulfed in the fog for several hours, Stockholm had only recently entered the bank and was still acclimating to atmospheric conditions. The officer in charge of Stockholm incorrectly assumed that his inability to see the other vessel was due to conditions other than fog, such as the other ship being a very small fishing vessel or a 'blacked-out' warship on maneuvers. He testified that he had no <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> another passenger liner speeding through fog.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that in the late 1950s the IRFB was {{presented}} {{with the ideas of}} a world championship. In 1983 and 1984 respectively, the Australian and New Zealand Rugby Football Unions each proposed hosting such a tournament. The following year the board committed to conduct a feasibility study. A year later there was another meeting in Paris, and the Union subsequently voted on the <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> the South African Rugby Board's vote that proved to be crucial in setting up a tied vote, as they voted in favour, even though they knew they would be excluded due to the sporting boycott because of their apartheid policies. English and Welsh votes were then changed, and the vote was won 10 to 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} the {{property}} in 1614 did not alter or further publicize the tomb. He must have resealed it, hid the entrance and kept its location a secret, for whatever reasons, as it disappeared from public knowledge and was lost again, despite publication of the inscription. In 1780 the then owners of the vineyard, the brothers Sassi, who apparently had no <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> there, broke into the tomb again during remodelling of their wine cellar. They opened it to the leading scholars of the day. Someone, perhaps them, fragmented the slabs covering the loculi, with the obvious intent of accessing the contents, being careful to preserve the inscriptions. If the act is to {{be attributed to the}} Sassi, and if the motive of treasure-hunting is to be imputed to them, they found no treasure. What they did find they turned over to the Vatican under Pope Pius VI, including the gold signet ring taken off the finger bone of Barbatus. Apparently some masonry was placed in the tomb with an obscure intent.|$|E
500|$|... "Grey Matters" [...] {{was written}} by screenwriters Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz, and was {{directed}} by Jeannot Szwarc. In an interview the following year, Miller noted that [...] "Your characters will often assert themselves, and remind you who they really are. In 'Grey Matters' there's a moment where pre-madness Walter wakes up in the chair — that beat emerged on the page. We had no <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be in}} the script until we were writing the scene. As a writer, you live for that." ...|$|E

500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Coon {{suggested}} that Gerrold should {{wait until the}} following February {{to see if the}} show was renewed for a second season. They also discussed several story ideas, including some small furry creatures that bred too quickly. Coon thought it was a cute idea but would be too expensive as they'd have to build each creature. In preparation for the second series submission, by January, Gerrold had put together five premises to pitch. He had his best hopes on two treatments called [...] "Bandi" [...] and [...] "The Protracted Man", but decided to submit his fifth story despite Coon's earlier dismissal of the <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> called [...] "The Fuzzies". The idea was based on the introduction of rabbits in Australia in 1859, who reproduced at a vastly increased rate owing to the lack of predators.|$|E
500|$|Lopez was {{surprised}} by the enormous media coverage, declaring in an interview: [...] "It was a nice dress. I had no <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to become such a big deal." [...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and people were talking about her in that dress. It was one of those moments like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, {{freelance}} reporter Randy Shilts {{completed his}} first book: {{a biography of}} Milk, titled The Mayor of Castro Street. Shilts wrote the book while {{unable to find a}} steady job as an openly gay reporter. The Times of Harvey Milk, a documentary film based on the book's material, won the 1984 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. Director Rob Epstein spoke later about why he chose the subject of Milk's life: [...] "At the time, {{for those of us who}} lived in San Francisco, it felt like it was life changing, that all the eyes of the world were upon us, but in fact most of the world outside of San Francisco had no <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> just a really brief, provincial, localized current events story that the mayor and a city council member in San Francisco were killed. It didn't have much reverberation." ...|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{guest star}} Mike O'Malley {{appears in the}} episode as Kurt's father Burt, sharing a scene with Colfer and Monteith which Colfer has {{described}} as the most emotional scene of the series thus far, explaining: [...] "Reading it on paper I had no <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be that}} intense. Once I got into it, then I kind of realised, 'Oh, there's such a bigger meaning behind this. Oh my God, this is so dramatic'." [...] Colfer called [...] "Theatricality" [...] his favorite episode of the whole series. Other recurring characters who appear in [...] "Theatricality" [...] are glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton, who gets his first lines in this episode), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), school athletes and bullies Karofsky and Azimio, Principal Figgins, Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran and Finn's mother Carole Hudson.|$|E
500|$|... "Alpha" [...] {{was based}} on a notecard, penned by first year writer Jeffrey Bell, that read [...] "Scary dogs in the City." [...] Bell {{explained}} that he got the inspiration for the story after seeing a pack of wild dogs: [...] "Nobody owns [...] dogs," [...] he noted, [...] "yet these dogs are somehow surviving." [...] After pitching the <b>idea,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> later chosen as the sixteenth episode of The X-Files sixth season. Bell had several discarded ideas before he settled on the Dhole storyline. Initially, the story {{was going to be a}} [...] "reversal" [...] of 1963 movie The Incredible Journey, featuring [...] "a desperate family [...] moves three thousand miles to get away from their killer pet—who's waiting for them at their new house, really pissed." [...] The second story idea would feature a child who released his anger through the dogs at a local animal shelter. In this version, the dogs functioned as a manifestation of the child's id. Bell scrapped both of these ideas because they lacked [...] "really cool visuals." ...|$|E
