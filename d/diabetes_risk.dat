25|$|A 2013 review {{found that}} there is {{insufficient}} {{evidence to suggest that}} replacing dietary sugar with non-caloric sweeteners alone is beneficial for energy balance, weight loss, or <b>diabetes</b> <b>risk</b> factors. The review found that restricting calories is more important than avoidance of sugar for weight management. However, the review concluded that replacing dietary sugar with non-caloric sweeteners is useful for managing blood sugar in diabetes patients. The review recommends that all sweeteners be consumed in moderation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a curable disease state. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in <b>diabetes</b> <b>risk</b> for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a low-fat diet and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E

RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODSdWe conducted a randomized trial of <b>diabetes</b> genetic <b>risk</b> counseling among overweight patients at increased phenotypic risk for type 2 di-abetes. Participants were randomly allocated to genetic testing versus no testing. Genetic risk {{was calculated by}} summing 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes. Participants in {{the top and bottom}} score quartiles received individual genetic counseling before being enrolled with untested control participants in a 12 -week, validated, diabetes prevention program. Middle-risk quartile participants were not studied further. We examined the effect of this genetic counseling intervention on patient self-reported attitudes, program attendance, and weight loss, separately comparing higher-risk and lower-risk result recipients with control participants. RESULTSdThe 108 participants enrolled in the diabetes prevention program included 42 par-ticipants at higher <b>diabetes</b> genetic <b>risk,</b> 32 at lower <b>diabetes</b> genetic <b>risk,</b> and 34 untested control subjects.

40|$|Abstract Aims: To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} a screening tool to identify people with <b>diabetes</b> at increased <b>risk</b> of medication problems relating to hypoglycaemia and medication non-adherence. Methods: A retrospective audit of attendances at a diabetes outpatient clinic at a public, teaching hospital over a 16 -month period was conducted. Logistic regression was undertaken to examine risk {{factors associated with}} medication problems relating to hypoglycaemia and medication non-adherence and the most predictive set of factors comprise the <b>Diabetes</b> Medication <b>Risk</b> Screening Tool. Evaluating the tool involved assessing sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values, cut-off scores, inter-rater reliability, and content validity. Results: The <b>Diabetes</b> Medication <b>Risk</b> Screening Tool comprises seven predictive factors: age, living alone, English language, mental and behavioural problems, comorbidity index score, number of medications prescribed, and number of high-risk medications prescribed. The tool has 76. 5 % sensitivity, 59. 5 % specificity, and has a 65. 1 % positive predictive value, and a 71. 8 % negative predictive value. A score of 27 or more out of 62 was associated with high-risk of a medication problem. The inter-rater reliability of the tool was high (κ = 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 75 - 0. 84) and the content validity index was 99. 4 %. Conclusion: The <b>Diabetes</b> Medication <b>Risk</b> Screening Tool has good psychometric properties and can proactively identify people with <b>diabetes</b> at greatest <b>risk</b> of medication problems relating to hypoglycaemia and medication non-adherence...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Asian {{populations are}} documenting rapid {{increases}} in the rates of diabetes and hip fracture, {{but there are no}} prospective data linking both diseases in Asian studies. We investigated this association among a cohort of Chinese in Singapore. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A prospective cohort of 63, 257 Chinese in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, established between 1993 and 1998, was followed up for a mean duration of 12 years. Diabetes status was ascertained by baseline interviews, and incidence of hip fracture post-enrollment was identified through a nationwide hospital discharge database. RESULTS — The risk of hip fracture, after adjustment for other risk factors, was almost double among people with diabetes compared with people without <b>diabetes</b> (relative <b>risk</b> 1. 98, 95 % CI 1. 71 – 2. 29). When stratified by BMI, the increase in risk of hip fracture among people with diabetes relative to people without diabetes was similar in all four strata. There was a very strong dose-dependent relationship between duration of <b>diabetes</b> and <b>risk</b> of hip fracture (P for trend � 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Identification of {{asymptomatic}} {{patients with}} type 2 <b>diabetes</b> at increased <b>risk</b> for {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) remains a challenge. We evaluated the potential of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) for prediction of abnormal myocardial perfusion in this population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — CIMT and SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging were assessed in 98 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes. An increased CIMT was defined as � 75 th percentile of reference values. RESULTS — Increased CIMT was an independent predictor {{of the extent of}} abnormal perfusion (P � 0. 001). In patients with increased CIMT as compared with patients with normal CIMT, abnormal perfusion (75 vs. 9 %) and severely abnormal perfusion (28 vs. 3 %) were observed more frequently. CONCLUSIONS — Increased CIMT was significantly related to the presence and extent of abnormal myocardial perfusion. Assessment of CIMT may be useful to identify asymptomatic patients with type 2 <b>diabetes</b> at higher <b>risk</b> for CAD.
