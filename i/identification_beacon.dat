They discover that the mutineers, who have sent the ship off-course, and sabotaged the communications system and the ship's emergency <b>identification</b> <b>beacon,</b> are connected in some way with piracy and the destruction of the ansibles. Help finally arrives with the return of the mercenaries, now co-operating fully with the InterStellar Communications ansible monopoly, and Vatta captain Josiah Furman, the bane of Ky's apprenticeship voyage years ago. He attempts to order her to scrap her ship at Sabine and come with him but she refuses. She quickly get funds for full repairs from ISC, which is grateful for her information regarding the pirates, but has to re-register the ship under a new name because of the sabotage to the <b>identification</b> <b>beacon.</b> She chooses Gary Tobai in honor of her late cargo master. The return voyage to Belinta is without incident and the agricultural equipment is delivered in fine shape.|$|E

40|$|Reading and {{understanding}} algorithms {{is not an}} easy task and often neglected by educators in an introductory programming course. One proposed solution to this problem is the incorporation of a technological support tool to aid program comprehension in introductory programming. Many researchers advocate the <b>identification</b> of <b>beacons</b> and the use of chunking as support for code comprehension. Beacon recognition and chunking can also be used as support in the teaching model of introductory programming. Educators use a variety of different support tools to facilitate program comprehension in introductory programming. Review of a variety of support tools fails to deliver an existing tool to support a teaching model that incorporates chunking and the <b>identification</b> of <b>beacons.</b> The experimental support tool in this dissertation (BeReT) is primarily designed to encourage a student to correctly identify beacons within provided program extracts. BeReT {{can also be used to}} allow students to group together related statements and to learn about plans implemented in any semantically and syntactically correct algorithm uploaded by an instructor. While these requirements are evident in the design and implementation of BeReT, data is required to measure the effect BeReT has on the indepth comprehension of introductory programming algorithms. A between-groups experiment is described which compares the program comprehension of students that used BeReT to study various introductory algorithms, with students that relied solely on traditional lecturing materials. The use of an eye tracker was incorporated into the empirical study to visualise the results of controlled experiments. The results indicate that a technological support tool like BeReT can have a significantly positive effect on student comprehension of algorithms traditionally taught in introductory programming. This research provides educators with an alternative way for the incorporation of in-depth code comprehension skills in introductory programmin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Due {{to their}} high {{sensitivity}} and selectivity, minimum interference with living biological systems, {{and ease of}} design and synthesis, fluorescent hybridization probes {{have been widely used}} to detect nucleic acids both in vivo and in vitro. Molecular beacons (MBs) and binary probes (BPs) are two very important hybridization probes that are designed based on well-established photophysical principles. These probes have shown particular applicability in a variety of studies, such as mRNA tracking, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring, and microorganism <b>identification.</b> Molecular <b>beacons</b> are hairpin oligonucleo-tide probes that present distinctive fluorescent signatures in the presence and absence of their target. Binary probes consist of two fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide strands that can hybridize to adjacent regions of their target and generate distinctive fluorescence signals. These probes have been extensively studied and modified for different appli-cations by modulating their structures or using various combinations of fluorophores, excimer-forming molecules, and metal complexes. This review describes the applicabil-ity and advantages of various hybridization probes that utilize novel and creative design to enhance their target detection sensitivity and specificity...|$|R
40|$|Program {{comprehension}} is {{the most}} important and frequent process in software maintenance. Extensive research has found that individual characteristics of programmers, differences of computer programs, and differences of task-driven motivations are the major factors that affect the program comprehension results. There is no study specifically addressing the program comprehension process. There is no study specifically focusing on the explanation of how the programmers' comprehension process is affected by beacons, the in-line comments, and the task purposes. In addition, most of the studies conducted in the past used either verbal protocols or cloze procedures to collect data. The verbal protocols require subjects to organize their ideas for speaking aloud; the cloze procedures are difficult to grade a program comprehension performance. However, using an eye-tracker to collect eye-movement data that reflect the cognitive process during the program comprehension process can reduce these difficulties. Furthermore, advanced technology makes it possible to collect the eye movement data with minimum intrusion. The current body of literature in program comprehension shows that there are few studies using the eye-movement data to analyze program comprehension process, although the eye-movement data has been studied for decades in psychological experiments. This dissertation examines the program comprehension process by analyzing the eye-movement data. The {{results of this study suggest}} that code scanning sequences are affected by the presence of the comments and the motivations of the tasks. Programmers can chunk bigger code blocks in programs with comments than in programs without comments. Different beacon sets are identified for different tasks. The results reveal that the presence of the comments does not improve compound <b>beacon</b> <b>identification</b> efficiency. Instead, it decreases the compound <b>beacon</b> <b>identification</b> efficiency. This study demonstrates that the eye-movement data is useful to trace and analyze the program comprehension process. The findings of the dissertation may shed light on the benefits of the beacons in program comprehension for machine learning. In addition, learning and teaching computer programming languages can benefit from the findings in this study...|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} PCR assay {{with the}} ability to rapidly identify all pathogenic bacteria would have widespread medical utility. Current real-time PCR technologies cannot accomplish this task due to severe limitations in multiplexing ability. To this end, we developed a new assay system which supports very high degrees of multiplexing. We developed a new class of mismatch-tolerant “sloppy ” molecular beacons, modified them to provide an extended hybridization range, and developed a multiprobe, multimelting temperature (Tm) signa-ture approach to bacterial species <b>identification.</b> Sloppy molecular <b>beacons</b> were exceptionally versatile, {{and they were able to}} generate specific Tm values for DNA sequences that differed by as little as one nucleotide to as many as 23 polymorphisms. Combining the Tm values generated by several probe-target hybrids resulted in Tm signatures that served as highly accurate sequence identifiers. Using this method, PCR assays with as few as six sloppy molecular beacons targeting bacterial 16 S rRNA gene segments could reproducibly classify 119 different sequence types of pathogenic and commensal bacteria, representing 64 genera, into 111 Tm signature types. Blinded studies using the assay to identify the bacteria present in 270 patient-derived clinical culture...|$|R
50|$|Cospas-Sarsat is an {{international}} satellite-based search and rescue system, established by Canada, France, the United States, and Russia. These four countries jointly helped develop the 406 MHz Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB), {{an element of the}} GMDSS designed to operate with Cospas-Sarsat system. These automatic-activating EPIRBs, now required on SOLAS ships, commercial fishing vessels, and all passenger ships, are designed to transmit to alert rescue coordination centers via the satellite system from anywhere in the world. The original COSPAS/SARSAT system used polar orbiting satellites but in recent years the system has been expanded to also include 4 geostationary satellites. Newest designs incorporate GPS receivers to transmit highly accurate positions (within about 20 metres) of the distress position. The original COSPAS/SARSAT satellites could calculate EPIRB position to within about 3 nmi km by using Doppler techniques. By the end of 2010 EPIRB manufacturers may be offering AIS (automatic <b>identification</b> system) enabled <b>beacons.</b> The serviceability of these items is checked monthly and annually and they have limited battery shelf life, between two and five years using mostly lithium-type batteries. 406 MHz EPIRB's transmit a registration number which is linked to a database of information about the vessel.|$|R
40|$|Range-based IEEE 802. 15. 4 {{localization}} systems currently require {{relatively high}} anchor density for indoor deployments. It {{can therefore be}} beneficial to use external sources of transmission as additional anchors. We present methods for using WiFi beacons to improve localization accuracy of a range-based IEEE 802. 15. 4 localization system in cases where only two IEEE 802. 15. 4 anchor nodes are available. We do this by identifying WiFi beacons from RSSI traces that we dynamically sample online, and applying fingerprinting and range-based methods using the RSSI values of the identified beacons. However, because the data of the WiFi traffic is not decodable by the IEEE 802. 15. 4 devices, these RSSI measurements lack identifiers that can associate them to specific WiFi Access Points (APs). Therefore, novel methods are required for both fingerprinting and range-based approaches to allow for these additional WiFi APs {{to be used as}} anchors. We show by using real-world measurements that our <b>beacon</b> <b>identification</b> method gives a false-positive rate of only 3 %, and that if the range measurements to the IEEE 802. 15. 4 anchors are relatively accurate, {{with a standard deviation of}} 1 and 3 m, a localization accuracy improvement of 47 % and 24 % can be gained, respectively.

30|$|To provide secure {{location}} services, Liu et al. [13] {{introduce a}} suit of techniques to detect malicious beacons that supply incorrect information to sensor nodes. These techniques include a method to detect malicious beacon signals, techniques to detect replayed <b>beacon</b> signals, the <b>identification</b> of malicious <b>beacons,</b> the avoidance of false detections, and the revoking of malicious beacons. By clustering of benign location reference beacons, Wang et al. [14] propose a resilient localization scheme that is computational efficiency. In [15], robust statistical methods are proposed, including triangulation and RF-based fingerprinting, to make localization attack-tolerant. SPINE [8] is a range-based positioning system that enables verifiable multilateration and verification of positions of mobile devices for secure computation {{in the presence of}} attackers. In [16], a secure localization scheme is presented to make the location estimation of the sensor secure, by transmission of nonces at different power levels from the beacon nodes. In [17], Chen et al. propose to make each locator build a conflicting-set and then the sensor can use all conflicting sets of its neighboring locators to filter out incorrect distance measurements of its neighboring locators. The limitation of the scheme is that it only works properly when the system has no packet loss. As the attackers may drop the packets purposely, the packet loss is inevitable when the system is under a wormhole attack. The distance-consistency-based secure localization scheme proposed in [18, 19] can also tolerate the packet loss.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring and {{maintaining}} premature neonates’ oxygen saturation (SpO 2) levels within the recommended range of 90 – 95 % has proved challenging for clinicians and carers. The health {{risks associated with}} oxygen being too high or too low when these neonates are on oxygen support can prove fatal. In a series of two experiments we explore if monitoring SpO 2 can be improved by redesigning the auditory component of pulse oximeters, using novel sonification mappings. The aim {{of this research is}} to create an auditory signal that better informs clinicians and carers when SpO 2 is in or out of the recommended range. Experiment 1 examines whether participants identify range better with a novel mapping, called the Shoulder mapping, than with a log-linear control mapping. The Shoulder mapping employs increasingly large pitch differences as oxygen saturation levels move out of the recommended range into abnormal ranges. However, the Shoulder mapping does not significantly improve participants’ accuracy in identifying oxygen saturation levels over the loglinear control mapping. In Experiment 2 an intermittent reference tone or ‘beacon’ is combined with the log-linear mapping. Participants identify oxygen saturation range much more accurately when they use the LogLinear+Beacon mapping than when they use the log-linear control mapping. Although further research is required to refine the beacon and test its use in clinical settings, it offers strong potential as {{a solution to the problem}} of monitoring the oxygen saturation levels of neonates on oxygen support. The large improvement in range accuracy <b>identification</b> that the <b>beacon</b> offers suggests that this clear and distinct auditory marker could be applied in the challenging monitoring environment of neonatal inter-hospital retrieva...|$|R
40|$|Because of its {{potential}} applications, mobile localization in wireless networks has attracted much attention recently. It is essential that a mobile user {{should be able to}} know its location anytime and anywhere. In practice, however, it is not always possible to obtain an accurate location of the mobile user; the presence of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) radio signal propagation and malicious beacons could cause considerable errors in localization. Therefore, NLOS identification and the detection of malicious beacons are important issues in localization. Existing NLOS identification methods usually assume that localization involving the use of NLOS radio signals cannot be performed in a consistent manner. However, the validity of the foregoing assumption has not been properly investigated. As a result, it is questionable whether these methods can be used to identify NLOS effectively. Existing malicious <b>beacon</b> <b>identification</b> methods require the cooperation of several detecting nodes for the verification of a location claim from a target node. They all suffer from {{one or both of the}} drawbacks: (i) not able to cope with a sparse network situation, and (ii) their design being based on a particular distance measurement technique. Moreover, even if NLOS propagation and malicious beacons can be identified, the following problem could arise: if the localization systems do not use the beacons involving NLOS propagation and the malicious beacons, they may not be able to locate a mobile user because of not having enough beacons. In the first part of this thesis, we present a theoretical analysis of localization using NLOS radio signals, and show that the above-mentioned assumption would no longer be valid when the mobile user is located outside the convex hull of the underlying beacons. As a result, existing NLOS identification methods, as well as many localization approaches, could perform poorly. Extensive experiments on different wireless networks demonstrate that NLOS in localization and the localization error caused by NLOS have been greatly underestimated in previous studies. In the second part, we propose a general location verification scheme to identify malicious beacons. It employs a node-to-node approach for location estimation, and could use different measurement techniques; moreover, it supports secure location verification in sparse networks. The proposed verification scheme has been shown able to achieve satisfactory performance via extensive real world GPS-based wireless sensor network experiments. In the third part, we present a mobility enhanced localization (MEL) scheme. By introducing the user's mobility information into the localization process, the proposed MEL can work in the area where current mobile localization systems cannot locate a mobile user for not having enough beacons. Extensive real world GPS experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MEL scheme. With the proposed solutions to the above problems, we could obtain improved mobile localization.
