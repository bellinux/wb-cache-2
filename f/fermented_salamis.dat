The products used in the analysis were: Bio Uherský salám with sea salt, Bio Uherský salám with kitchen salt and conventionally produced Uherský salám. The following parameters were analyzed: slice appearance, texture, aroma and taste. The sensory analysis {{was carried out by}} 93 students, as part of practical exercises of a sensory analysis course. Samples were compared and significant differences (P < 0, 01) were found in texture, slice appearance and colour. Both salamis of organic origin were firmer, slice appearance was worse and they had untypical colour. Bio Uherský salám with sea salt and Bio Uherský salám with kitchen salt were more distinctive in taste and aroma (P < 0, 01). During the analysis no factors were found which can negatively influence the general sensory quality of products.

To detect the content of the effective substance, high-performance liquid chromatography with UV/Vis and mass spectrometry detection was employed; natamycin had been extracted from area-normalized surface layers of model salami protective casings to a mixture of methanol-water and detected with the above method. Moreover, the effective amount of natamycin in salami casings purchased from retail network was monitored, too. Practical Applications: As the practical application of the above elaborated detection method, the analyses of samples of <b>fermented</b> dry <b>salami</b> casings which were purchased from a retail network showed natamycin presence just in minimal or zero amounts.

There was no effect (P > 0. 05) of the treatments on water activity, Na content, and residual NO 3 and NO 2. Fatty acids C 18 : 2 and C 20 : 4 were reduced (P < 0. 05) during the ripening period in the Control treatment indicating possible oxidation. The use of celery resulted in lower pH values (P < 0. 05) in the salami. Reduced addition of NO 3 and NO 2 resulted in salami lighter in color (higher L* values, P < 0. 05) at the 12 th day of ripening. In conclusion, celery-based products proved to be an effective source of NO 2 and NO 3 for color development, but the low pH of the product indicates the need for better evaluation of its use in <b>fermented</b> <b>salami.</b> The RE (rosemary extract) reduced fat oxidation in salami, but this needs further evaluation...|$|R
50|$|Fermented pork {{back fat}} {{that is used}} to make salami has very high {{saturated}} fatty acid and cholesterol content, which can increase {{the risk of heart disease}} and pancreatitis. However, it has been shown that it is possible to replace the pork back fat in salami with extra virgin olive oil thereby changing the fatty acid profile of the salami. Olive oil consists of a much larger amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which allows this substitution to create a healthier product. Salami is considered slightly acidic due to lactic acid that is present. In salami where the pork back fat was substituted for extra virgin olive oil, it has shown to have a lower pH of around 5.00 compared to its original levels of around 6.35 to 6.55 making the salami more acidic. These lower pH levels are healthier for humans as higher populations of lactic acid bacteria inhibit the spread of spoilage microorganisms.There have also been cases that have showcased some of the possible health dangers of salami. An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection of a husband and wife was traced back to the consumption of dry <b>fermented</b> <b>salami</b> made with pork meat after the couple was hospitalized for bloody diarrhea. There was also an outbreak of E. coli O157 in 1994 with 17 cases all occurring from the consumption of pre-sliced salami that was processed by one company.

In vitro studies highlighted the bactericidal activities of PEOW against several food-borne strains. However the overall evaluation of their impact in real food models is the first step to determine their feasibility as ingredient. This study describes the effects of PEOW on the microbial populations of raw sausages and <b>fermented</b> <b>salami.</b> Raw sausages were produced according to local recipe to obtain a control batch and two batches with different levels of PEOW addition (75 mg/ 100 g: LL - Low Level and 150 mg/ 100 g: HL High Level). PEOW levels were based on sensory and antibacterial tests. Changes of microbial composition were assessed during a storage period of 12 days (4 °C) by the following targets: mesophilic and psycrotrophic count, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., yeasts and moulds count. The identification of the most representatives strains were based on 16 S rRNA or ITS/ 26 S rRNA gene sequencing. Similar practices were adopted for the salami production using Staphylococcus xylosus and Pediococcus pentosaceus as starters cultures. The salami were evaluated for LAB, Staphylococcus spp., yeasts and moulds during ripening period of 20 days. In sausages, the HL inclusion of PEOW reduced the growth of several microbial targets especially Staphylococcus spp., while yeasts increased. The Permutational multivariate analysis of variance and the Principal coordinate analysis suggested a clear distinction of the PEOW added sausages. The effect of phenols used as ingredient in salami also showed a relevant impact in the S. xylosus during the first part of ripening period.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{concerns}} about meat and processed meat consumption raised {{due to their}} correlation {{with the onset of}} several diseases; till, in 2015, WHO classified processed meat products carcinogenic to humans, including them in Group 1. Indeed, in these products, the use of nitrites and nitrates promotes the formation of nitrosamines that are considered harmful compounds. To address the consumer’s demand for healthier products, a solution has been identified in replacing nitrates and nitrites with natural antioxidants as food preservatives. So, 3 types of traditional <b>fermented</b> <b>salami</b> were manufactured and analyzed in this study. Group C (n= 6) was made by adding 30 ppm of nitrates; group A (n= 6) was made replacing the nitrates with a mixture of grape seed extract and olive pomace; group B (n= 6) was made using a mixture of chestnut and olive pomace as nitrates replacement. Preliminary analysis on salami were carried out for fatty acids (FA) profile, lipid and cholesterol content. Moreover, a trained panel of 8 judges performed a quantitative-descriptive sensorial analysis. Results showed that, although the addition of an oleaginous element like the mixtures, no relevant modifications were observed in the total lipid content. Similarly, the FA profile of A, B and C was equivalent with the only exception of the arachidonic FA, which resulted significantly higher in A and B salami, likely due to the presence of the olive pomace. As {{no significant differences were found}} in FA profile as well as for SFA, also the cholesterol content resulted similar for all the treatments. Concerning the sensory analysis, among the attributes (oiliness, abnormal colors, texture, color uniformity, characteristic flavor, off flavor, salty, rancid, abnormal flavor, hardiness, juiciness), only for texture and color uniformity, judges assessed significant differences, being the former lower scored in A group respect to B; while for the latter, C sausages resulted in a better score than A and B ones. In conclusion, preliminary results showed that both the mixtures had not caused any significant change on lipid-correlated attributes of salami, as well as no important sensorial attributes resulted to be affected by the replacement...|$|R

40|$|The {{microbiological}} composition plays {{a pivotal}} role in the production, final characteristics and safety of fermented foods. Such composition can be assessed by means of culture-based and molecular methods, where the latter are necessary to analyze non-culturable species. PCR-DGGE has been for several years the most applied technique in molecular microbiology: advantages include the relatively low cost and ease of use and the possibility of processing samples altogether; the method is however only semi-quantitative and the resolution power is limited to a few dominant species. Recent advancements in next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) are revolutionizing our comprehension and quantitative measurements of microbial communities. The initial approach is the same as for PCR-DGGE, i. e., the extraction of microbial DNA from food and the PCR amplification of 16 s rRNA hypervariable regions.

Laboratory investigations involved both case and food sampling. Specimens of foods sold locally and reportedly consumed by those affected were tested. Common suppliers of suspected foods were identified by cross-referencing suppliers' lists with stores frequented by those who fell ill. A case-control study involving 25 cases and 49 age-matched controls was conducted. This was followed by a comprehensive environmental investigation of the meat processing plant identified as the source of the E. coli. RESULTS: Thirty-nine outbreak-related cases occurred between April 3 and June 2, 1998. Of the 36 case specimens tested all were positive for E. coli O 157 :H 7. The case-control study identified Genoa salami as the most probable (odds ratio 8 [confidence interval 2 - 35]) source of the outbreak. Samples of Genoa salami produced by the most commonly identified supplier later tested positive for E. coli O 157 :H 7, and the pathogen matched the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern and phage type of the case specimens. INTERPRETATION: Our investigation, which led to a national recall of the brand of dry <b>fermented</b> Genoa <b>salami</b> identified as the source of the outbreak, supports an adherence to stringent manufacturing requirements for fermented meat products. A review of the Canadian standards for fermented meat processing and the effectiveness of their implementation is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Abstract: In {{the production}} of <b>fermented,</b> dry sausages (<b>salami)</b> {{it is important to}} oppress the acidification to ensure a safe and controlled processing. The acidification may be achieved by applying a starter culture containing lactic acid bacteria (LAB), chemically by e. g. glucono-deltalacton (GdL, E 575) or relying on the indigenous LAB flora. In salami meat model the acidification and LAB development with GdL in two levels, 0. 4 % and 0. 8 %, with and without starter culture were compared. The starter culture was Lyocarni RBL- 73 with Lactobacillus curvatus as the acidifier. In parallel a control without any acidifier added was followed. An initial pH decline to pH below 5. 3 at 25 °C was obtained with both GdL applications. In comparison it took approx. 17 hours for the starter culture to achieve the same pH. Furthermore it was demonstrated that GdL did not control the indigenous flora which the starter culture was capable of. Consequently, if the application of GdL is required it is recommendable to combine low amounts of GdL with a starter culture to control the processing. Key words: fermented sausages, starter culture, GdL, acidification, LA...|$|R
40|$|Biogenic amines (such as histamine) and {{nitric oxide}} (such as nitrate and nitrite) are basic {{nitrogenous}} compounds occurring in many foods. The histamine, nitrate and nitrite are key signaling molecules in numerous physiological and pathological events. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the histamine, nitrate and nitrite contents on meat products (53 Turkish styles <b>fermented</b> sausages, 19 <b>salami,</b> 16 fresh sausages and 12 past rma) of different brands obtained from retail stores in the Afyonkarahisar area of Turkey. The maximum histamine in past rma samples in the range 30. 20 - 51. 82 mg kg - 1 (mean 42. 11 mg kg - 1) and minimum histamine in fresh sausage in the range 7. 73 - 30. 68 mg kg - 1 (mean 19. 67 mg kg - 1) were found. Nevertheless maximum nitrate and nitrite in fermented sausage (mean 149. 31 mg kg - 1) and salami (mean 45. 33 mg kg - 1) samples, minimum nitrate and nitrite fresh sausage (mean 97. 84 mg kg - 1) and fermented sausage (mean 23. 49 mg kg - 1) were found. According to the results of the present study, meat products samples showed a comparable good quality from a toxicological and public health point of view...|$|R
40|$|Avaliou-se a inclusão de diferentes níveis de carne de ovelhas de descarte (animais Texel × Ile de France com idade {{superior}} a seis anos) em relação à carne suína sobre a qualidade de embutidos fermentados do tipo salame. Os embutidos foram elaborados com 0, 15, 35, 55 ou 75 % de carne da perna, paleta e pescoço das ovelhas, acrescidos de pernil suíno e 10 % de toucinho suíno. A evolução do pH e da atividade de água (a w) foi avaliada nos dias zero, três, sete e 14 após o embutimento. Após a maturação dos salames, foram determinadas, ainda, a perda de peso, a qualidade microbiológica e as características sensoriais dos embutidos prontos. A inclusão de carne ovina na formulação não alterou a evolução do pH e a w. Entretanto, influenciou (P The {{influence of}} including different proportions of meat from swine and culling ewes {{on the quality}} of <b>fermented</b> sausage type <b>salami</b> was evaluated. Five different formulations were prepared containing 0, 15, 35, 55, or 75 % of meat from leg, shoulder, and neck of the ewes, added of swine meat and 10 % of swine fat. Evolution of pH and water activity (a w) was evaluated on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 of the maturation period. After that, it was still determined the weight loss, microbiological quality, and the sensorial features of the sausages. The inclusion of sheep meat in the formulation did not changed pH and a w evolution. However, differences in final values of pH, a w, and weight loss were found (P< 0. 05). Sausages with sheep meat in the formulation had lower pH than that without sheep meat. The control sausage (0 % sheep meat) also showed lower a w and a greater weight loss than sausage with 15 % of sheep meat. All formulations attended the actual legislation about microbiological quality. In the sensorial analysis, the sausage prepared with 15 % of sheep meat in the formulation was considered better than that formulated just with swine meat in relation to color, flavor, and texture features. However, there were no differences in sensorial characteristics among sausages with sheep meat. Thus, it is possible to produce fermented sausages with until 75 % of meat from culling ewes in the formulation...|$|R
