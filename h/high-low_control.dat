The model {{is built based on}} component sub-models. Using the DEAC model developed, simulation studies {{were carried out}} under multi-evaporator operation and single-evaporator operation, respectively. Dynamic effects of the multi-evaporator operation suggested that the model developed could predicate the transient performance of the DEAC system over a wide range of operating conditions. Therefore, it {{can be used as a}} useful tool in investigating the control performance of a DEAC system. A previously developed <b>High-Low</b> <b>control</b> strategy for improved indoor humidity control was incorporated into the developed DEAC model. At the first stage, only the single-evaporator operation under the H-L control was simulated. The simulation study has produced similar results to the previously experimental results on H-L control and thus paved the way to studying applying the H-L control to a DEAC system for better indoor humidity control...|$|E
