5|$|Gannett <b>Glacier,</b> on the {{northeast}} slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single <b>glacier</b> in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50percent of its volume since 1920 with 25percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. Upper Fremont <b>Glacier</b> has been studied {{more than any other}} <b>glacier</b> in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont <b>Glacier</b> and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past several hundred years. The Upper Fremont <b>Glacier</b> and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, <b>glacier</b> caves were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth <b>glacier</b> surface. Many of these <b>glacier</b> caves were {{big enough to}} explore, like the <b>glacier</b> caves on the summit of Mount Rainier. Most of the <b>glacier</b> caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in the <b>glacier</b> were mapped and studied.|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on the crater wall above Crater <b>Glacier</b> feeding rock and ice to Crater <b>Glacier</b> below. In addition, {{there are two}} rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater <b>Glacier</b> and one north of the western lobe. Two of these rock glaciers have merged with the Crater <b>Glacier,</b> with one on the west and one on the east. The other rock <b>glacier</b> on the eastern slopes of the crater wall is very close to {{touching}} the <b>glacier.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Nubra valley {{nestled in}} the Karakorum Mountains of Ladakh houses about 600 <b>glaciers</b> of various {{dimensions}} out of which 114 <b>glaciers</b> were monitored {{in the first phase}} of study. The study of 114 <b>glaciers</b> suggests that small-sized <b>glaciers</b> outnumber the large-sized <b>glaciers.</b> Almost 52. 6 % of the studied <b>glaciers</b> are of the size less than 5 km and 31. 5 % of the total <b>glaciers</b> are between the size of 5 and 10 km. The 84 <b>glaciers</b> out of the 114 <b>glaciers</b> have been monitored on short-term basis between the time period 1989 and 2001 whereas 30 <b>glaciers</b> have been monitored on long-term basis between 1969 and 2001. The monitoring of the <b>glaciers</b> is based on the study of Survey of India topographical sheets of 1969 and satellite imageries of time series between 1989 and 2001. The monitoring of thirty <b>glaciers</b> shows that 17 <b>glaciers</b> have lost their area betwee...|$|R
25|$|Typically <b>glaciers</b> deepen their valleys {{more than}} their smaller tributaries. Therefore, when <b>glaciers</b> recede, the valleys of the {{tributary}} <b>glaciers</b> remain above the main <b>glacier's</b> depression and are called hanging valleys.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 722 {{individual}} <b>glaciers</b> are recognized in this mountain range, and these cover {{an area of}} 723.4 km2. Most of these <b>glaciers</b> are {{on the western side}} of the ranges, where 530 <b>glaciers</b> cover an area of 507.5 km2; while on the eastern side 192 <b>glaciers</b> cover an area of 215.9 km2. Most of the <b>glaciers,</b> 91 percent of the total, are classified as mountain <b>glaciers</b> (they are generally short and have extremely steep slopes); the rest are classified as valley <b>glaciers,</b> except for one ice cap.|$|R
5|$|The Crater <b>Glacier</b> (also {{known as}} Tulutson <b>Glacier)</b> is a geologically young <b>glacier</b> that {{is located on}} Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington. The <b>glacier</b> formed after the 1980 Eruption and due to its location, the body of ice grew rapidly, unknown {{to the public for}} nearly 20 years. The <b>glacier</b> once {{contained}} ice caves in the smooth ice before the 2004-2008 volcanic activity. The growth of the lava dome and volcanic eruptions from 2004 to 2008 significantly altered the appearance of the <b>glacier.</b> In the same time period, several agencies decided to put an official name on the <b>glacier</b> which, at first, was Tulutson <b>Glacier.</b> A later decision made Crater <b>Glacier</b> the official <b>glacier</b> name. Despite the volcanic activity, the <b>glacier</b> continued to advance and by mid-2008, the <b>glacier</b> completely encircled the lava domes. In addition, new glaciers (rock or ice) have formed around Crater <b>Glacier</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen <b>Glacier</b> and the Crescent <b>Glacier.</b> The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent <b>Glacier</b> is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen <b>Glacier</b> is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E
5|$|With {{the recent}} {{volcanic}} activity starting in 2004, the <b>glacier</b> lobes were pushed aside and upward by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. The surface of the <b>glacier,</b> once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater <b>Glacier</b> into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the <b>glacier</b> have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the <b>glacier</b> joined together in late May 2008 and thus the <b>glacier</b> completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater <b>Glacier</b> feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater <b>Glacier.</b> Crater <b>Glacier</b> is the only known advancing <b>glacier</b> in the contiguous United States.|$|E
50|$|An {{inventory}} of South Island <b>glaciers</b> during the 1980s indicated {{there were about}} 3,155 <b>glaciers</b> with an area {{of at least one}} hectare (2.5 acres). About a sixth of these <b>glaciers</b> covered more than 10 hectares. These include the Fox and Franz Josef <b>glaciers</b> on the West Coast, and the Tasman, Hooker, Mueller and Murchison <b>glaciers</b> in the east.|$|R
50|$|Many {{formations}} {{are probably}} <b>glaciers</b> or {{the remains of}} old <b>glaciers</b> because they look so much like <b>glaciers</b> on the Earth.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>glaciers</b> on Mount Ruapehu are {{the only}} <b>glaciers</b> in the North Island. They are all small, less than [...] in length. There are {{eighteen}} <b>glaciers</b> including one within the crater; the largest are the Mangatoetoenui, Summit Plateau and Whangaehu <b>Glaciers.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Glacier</b> retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the <b>glacier.</b> Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the <b>glacier</b> is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Image Lake is a tarn in <b>Glacier</b> Peak Wilderness, in the North Cascades of Washington, United States. The lake is {{surrounded}} by Plummer Peak to the east, a lookout point to the west, the Miners Creek drainage and <b>Glacier</b> Peak to the south, and Canyon Lake to the north. The course of the popular Miners Ridge Trail skirts the lake. <b>Glacier</b> Peak {{can be seen from}} the outlet of the lake, and the peak reflected in the lake is a popular photographic subject.|$|E
5|$|Land mammals sighted in <b>Glacier</b> Bay are: blue bears (<b>glacier),</b> moose, Sitka black-tailed deer, {{mountain}} goat, wolf, coyote, lynx, wolverine, marmots, {{land and}} river otters, weasels, ermine, mink, squirrels, beaver and red fox. Porcupines, voles, shrews, hares, and bats are also found.|$|E
5000|$|The two known {{factors that}} must be present {{in order to create}} rock <b>glaciers</b> are low ice {{velocity}} and permafrost. Most glacial rock <b>glaciers</b> are created by the recession of debris covered <b>glaciers.</b> Glacial rock <b>glaciers</b> are often found in cirque basins where rocky debris falls off the steep sides and accumulates on ice <b>glaciers.</b> As the <b>glaciers</b> shrink, their composition changes as they become increasingly covered with debris. Eventually, the glacial ice is replaced by ice cored rocks. [...] With the exception of ice-cored rock <b>glaciers,</b> rock <b>glaciers</b> are a periglacial process. This means that they are a nonglacial landform associated with cold climates, particularly with various aspects of frozen ground. Periglacial rock <b>glaciers</b> require permafrost instead of glacial ice in order to form. Instead, they are caused by continuous freezing occurring within a talus lobe.|$|R
25|$|Concurrently, in both Patagonia and Alaska, {{there are}} tidewater <b>glaciers</b> that have {{advanced}} {{for a considerable}} period, tidewater <b>glaciers</b> undergoing rapid retreat and stable tidewater <b>glaciers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Glaciology is {{the study}} of <b>glaciers</b> and ice sheets, or more {{commonly}} the cryosphere or ice and phenomena that involve ice. Glaciology groups the latter (ice sheets) as continental <b>glaciers</b> and the former (<b>glaciers)</b> as alpine <b>glaciers.</b> Although, research in the areas are similar with research undertaken into both the dynamics of ice sheets and <b>glaciers</b> the former tends to be concerned with the interaction of ice sheets with the present climate and the latter with the impact of <b>glaciers</b> on the landscape. Glaciology also has a vast array of sub-fields examining the factors and processes involved in ice sheets and <b>glaciers</b> e.g. snow hydrology and glacial geology.|$|R
5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the <b>glacier.</b> This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the <b>glacier</b> no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton <b>Glacier</b> in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell <b>Glacier</b> in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton <b>Glacier</b> remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell <b>Glacier</b> is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
5|$|On {{level ground}} again, {{they began to}} make quick progress. They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another <b>glacier</b> (later known as the Ninnis <b>Glacier)</b> far larger than the first. As with the first <b>glacier,</b> they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} <b>glacier</b> they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E
5|$|Pine Island <b>Glacier</b> (PIG) {{is a large}} ice stream, and {{the fastest}} melting <b>glacier</b> in Antarctica, {{responsible}} for about 25% of Antarctica's ice loss. The <b>glacier</b> ice streams flow west-northwest along {{the south side of}} the Hudson Mountains into Pine Island Bay, Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy (USN) air photos, 1960–66, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in association with Pine Island Bay.|$|E
40|$|Northern Tien Shan is characterised by a {{distinct}} periglacial belt that contains many rock <b>glaciers</b> with {{an area of}} 1 km² or more. To investigate the reason for their large size and variable occurrence, we analysed a representative subsample of the rock <b>glaciers</b> with respect to topographic and climatic variables. A simple permafrost model indicates that the rock <b>glaciers</b> originate in the zone where permafrost occurrence is very likely and some large rock <b>glaciers</b> flow down to elevations where permafrost is unlikely to exist outside the rock <b>glaciers</b> themselves. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that the occurrence and characteristics of the rock <b>glaciers</b> can only be partly explained by {{the characteristics of the}} contributing area (e. g. its area or the headwall height). The correlation is greater with talus-type rock <b>glaciers</b> than with moraine-type rock <b>glaciers.</b> The climate can explain the general occurrence of rock <b>glaciers</b> but not their specific characteristics. It is hypothesised that the main reason for the specific distribution and characteristics of these large rock <b>glaciers</b> relates to the interaction with polythermal <b>glaciers,</b> topographic characteristics, intensive weathering and rock avalanches triggered by seismic activity...|$|R

5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in <b>Glacier</b> Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the <b>glacier</b> bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of <b>Glacier</b> Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the <b>Glacier</b> Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} <b>glacier,</b> causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the <b>glacier,</b> with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the <b>glacier,</b> prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the <b>glacier</b> melts.|$|E
5|$|The bay has a cool wet, coastal {{temperate}} rainforest climate. Three climatic zones {{have been}} discerned in the <b>Glacier</b> Bay; the outer coast along the Gulf of Alaska, which records mild temperatures and higher precipitation. However, it experiences less snowfall, the upper <b>Glacier</b> Bay {{where it is}} much colder and heavy snowfall occurs, and the lower <b>Glacier</b> Bay, which experiences heavy rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
2500|$|Calving is an {{important}} form of ablation for <b>glaciers</b> that terminate in freshwater, also. [...] Funk and Röthlisberger determined a relationship between calving speed and water depth based on analysis of six <b>glaciers</b> that calve into lakes.

5|$|The {{first and}} largest <b>glacier</b> was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe <b>glacier,</b> which eroded the upper Merced {{watershed}} {{to an extent}} close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga <b>glacier</b> left {{at the mouth of}} Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine. This moraine was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include Medial Moraine and Bridalveil Moraine. After the Tioga <b>Glacier</b> retreated this moraine formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating a broad and flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley.|$|E

However, recent direct observations made by the SHARAD radar instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite have confirmed that at least some features are relatively pure ice, and thus, true <b>glaciers.</b> Some authors have also made claims that <b>glaciers</b> of solid carbon dioxide have formed on Mars under certain rare conditions.|$|R
