5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear <b>flippers</b> forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on <b>flippers</b> and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their <b>flippers</b> are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like <b>flippers</b> which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E
5|$|When swimming, baleen whales rely {{on their}} <b>flippers</b> for {{locomotion}} in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Flipper movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail fluke to propel themselves forward through vertical motion while using their <b>flippers</b> for steering, much like an otter. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed for stability in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the pelvic bone serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E

25|$|Skilled {{players can}} also hold {{a ball in}} place with the <b>flipper,</b> giving them more control over {{where they want to}} place the ball when they shoot it forward. This is known as trapping. This {{technique}} involves catching the ball in the corner between the base of the <b>flipper</b> and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper; the <b>flipper</b> is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward against the <b>flipper.</b> The player then chooses the moment to hit the <b>flipper</b> again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly against the <b>flipper.</b> Multi-ball games, in particular, reward trapping techniques. Usually this is done by trapping one or more balls out of play with one <b>flipper,</b> then using the other <b>flipper</b> to score points with the remaining ball or balls.|$|R
25|$|<b>Flipper</b> {{solenoids}} contain two {{coil windings}} in one package; a short, heavy gage 'power' winding {{to give the}} <b>flipper</b> its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage 'hold' winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the <b>flipper</b> up allowing the player to capture {{the ball in the}} inlane for more precise aiming. As the <b>flipper</b> nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the <b>flipper</b> disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the <b>flipper</b> up in place. If this switch fails 'open' the <b>flipper</b> will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. If it fails 'closed' the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the <b>flipper</b> at the top of its stroke.|$|R

5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} {{a high level of}} social {{interaction}} between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with <b>flippers</b> and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, <b>flippers</b> moved {{to the front of the}} body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the forelimbs of ancestral {{vertebrates}} {{have evolved}} into the front <b>flippers</b> of whales, the wings of birds, the running forelegs of dogs, deer, and horses, the short forelegs of frogs and lizards, and the grasping hands of primates including humans. The same major forearm bones (humerus, radius, and ulna) are found in fossils of lobe-finned fish such as Eusthenopteron.|$|E

5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, <b>flippers</b> and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} <b>flippers</b> on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface {{periodically}} to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds {{split from}} other caniforms 50 mya during the Eocene. Their {{evolutionary}} link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of †Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, †Puijila {{had a long}} tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of <b>flippers.</b> The lineages of Otariidae (eared seals) and Odobenidae (walrus) split almost 28 mya. Phocids (earless seals) {{are known to have}} existed for at least 15 mya, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae (monk seals) and Phocinae lineages 22 mya.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are five}} species of dolphins which reside in freshwater rivers and estuaries. They are classed in the cetacean superfamily Platanistoidea. Four species live in fresh water rivers. The fifth species, the La Plata dolphin, lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. However, it is scientifically classed {{in the river}} dolphin family rather than the oceanic dolphin family. All species have adaptations to facilitate fish catching: a long, forceps-like beak with numerous small teeth in both jaws, broad <b>flippers</b> to allow tight turns, small eyes, and unfused neck vertebrae to allow the head to move {{in relation to the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Traditional hunters {{used all}} parts of the walrus. The meat, often preserved, is an {{important}} winter nutrition source; the <b>flippers</b> are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets, and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.|$|E

5|$|In biology, {{homology}} is {{the existence}} of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats, the arms of primates, the front <b>flippers</b> of whales and the forelegs of dogs and horses are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures adapted to different purposes {{as the result of}} descent with modification from a common ancestor. Homology was explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. The term was applied to biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball {{uses the}} basic {{mechanics}} of pinball, complete {{with an assortment}} of typical pinball items including <b>flippers,</b> spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.|$|E
