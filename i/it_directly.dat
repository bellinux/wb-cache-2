5|$|Utami {{has also}} noted that the novel is a {{reflection}} of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although little of <b>it</b> <b>directly</b> reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects her own, and the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated that the {{original}} September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold <b>it</b> <b>directly</b> to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so. Although {{it is possible that the}} original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians {{sent out}} a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus.

Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to Lesbos, where, {{with the support of}} the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.|$|E

Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at <b>it</b> <b>directly</b> from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E

5|$|The Alford {{area was}} one of the largest medical {{practices}} in the United Kingdom, and in the winter months Forbes often had to travel through ten-foot snowdrifts in a converted Universal Carrier. These conditions were not entirely unfamiliar; a trip to see an uncle in St. Moritz at the age of thirteen had led to him taking up skiing and figure-skating, and winning a number of bob sled races. He did not live in Alford, but remained at Brux, appointing a medical assistant to live in the town. The farm, left {{in the hands of a}} small resident staff, quickly ran into financial troubles. To raise a large amount of money quickly, Forbes sold the practice in Alford, and returned to the farm in 1952, running <b>it</b> <b>directly</b> as a going concern from then on.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{accepted}} the document {{and moved to}} the balcony to submit <b>it</b> <b>directly</b> to the people for ratification.

This wore the patience of the few who were still in the plaza in the rain. Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms. Facing the prospect of further violence, the popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present.|$|E
