5000|$|Also, a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> {{may have}} been [...] "missing" [...] between {{bulkheads}} near the engine room, which was thought to have contributed to Andrea Dorias problems.|$|R
50|$|On 21 October 1981, S-178, {{under the}} command of Captain Third Rank V.A. Marango, was transiting on the surface at 9 kn, {{returning}} to base after two days of sound trials. The sea state was 2 (less than one-metre waves) and night time visibility was unlimited. The starboard diesel was under repair, so the propulsion plant was aligned port diesel, starboard electric motor. For convenience, the diesel mechanics and electricians had opened the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> between compartments. In addition, the cooks had opened other <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> so that they could serve dinner.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, it was {{reported}} that Danny F II had been detained at Adelaide because of defects which included holed bulkheads, defective navigation lights and radio equipment and defective <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{the second}} {{compartment}} rapidly flooded, the officers within shut the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> to prevent flooding the adjacent compartments. When the seawater flooded the battery well, {{many of the}} officers and civilians in the second compartment were killed by chlorine gas.|$|R
25|$|In September 2003, an {{expedition}} led by Carl Spencer dived into the wreck. This {{was the first}} expedition to dive Britannic where all the bottom divers were using closed circuit rebreathers (CCR). Diver Rich Stevenson found that several <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> were open. It {{has been suggested that}} this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted the doorframes. A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of U-73 that Britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b> Spencer's expedition was broadcast extensively across the world for many years by National Geographic and the UK's Channel 5.|$|R
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{subdivided}} into an eleven watertight compartments,so proportioned {{that the ship}} would float if any two adjacent compartments became flooded. The <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> throughout the ship were operated on the Stone-Lloyd system that enabled all doors to be closed instantly and simultaneously from the bridge.|$|R
50|$|During Week Six, {{recruits}} learn shipboard {{damage control}} and firefighting skills. Recruits {{will learn to}} escape smoke-filled compartments, open and close <b>watertight</b> <b>doors,</b> use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs), carry fire hoses, and learn to extinguish fires. Week Six also includes the Confidence Chamber (tear gas chamber).|$|R

5000|$|Koombana was 340 ft long between perpendiculars. She had {{a beam of}} 48 ft and a draught of 20 ft. [...] Her tonnage was [...] [...] All of her {{compartments}} were {{fitted with}} <b>watertight</b> <b>doors,</b> and she was capable of carrying 900 tons of ballast water.|$|R
25|$|Three {{types of}} doors are {{commonly}} used between compartments. A closed <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> is structurally capable of withstanding the same pressures as the watertight bulkheads they penetrate, although such doors require frequent maintenance to maintain effective seals, and must, of course, be kept closed to effectively contain flooding.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the Swimming Pool is blocked by a closed <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> along the bulkhead. It is presumably in good condition like the neighboring Turkish Baths, given the slow flooding which occurred {{in this part of}} the ship and the resilient materials used in the pool's construction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: High {{threshold}} of <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> {{makes it difficult}} for materials transporting in the cabin by ordinary equipment. So, an un-powered mechanical structure is presented by the thesis, which can cross watertight threshold easily. On the basis of this structure，an obstacle crossing vehicle is designed for materials transporting in cabins. 1...|$|R
25|$|Later, in a 1998 {{documentary}} titled Titanic: Secrets Revealed, the Discovery Channel ran model simulations {{which also}} rebutted this theory. The simulations indicated that opening Titanics <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> {{would have caused}} the ship to capsize earlier than she actually sank {{by more than one}} half hour, confirming the findings of Bedford and Hacket.|$|R
50|$|Chief gunner's mate {{on board}} the torpedo boat Winslow, for gallant and {{conspicuous}} conduct in the action at Cardenas, Cuba, May 11, 1898. Brady's energy in assisting to sustain fire, his efforts to repair the steering gear under fire, and his promptness in maintaining closed <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and hatches, was largely instrumental in saving the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Rogo {{leads the}} {{remaining}} survivors—Rosen, Martin, Nonnie, Susan, and Robin—through the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> {{and into the}} propeller shaft tunnel. They hear a noise from outside and bang on the hull to attract attention. The rescuers cut a hole through the hull, assist the sole group of six survivors from the ship, and fly them to safety.|$|R
2500|$|Exploration of Andrea Dorias impact area {{revealed}} that the Stockholms bow had ripped a much larger gash in the critical area of the large fuel tanks and watertight compartments of the Italian liner than had been thought in 1956. The question of the [...] "missing" [...] <b>watertight</b> <b>door,</b> although still unanswered, was probably moot: Andrea Doria was doomed immediately after the collision.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} damaged <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> of the firemen's tunnel, the <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. Britannic had reached her {{flooding}} limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) {{with her first}} six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising {{all the way up}} to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the Titanic disaster. (Titanic could float with her first four compartments flooded.) The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards. As the ship's angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.|$|R
50|$|The {{electromechanical}} equipment {{that supports the}} Adige-Garda Tunnel consists of grilles, <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and gates with associated control panels, and controls housed in special rooms. The gates are positioned on four intake windows. Each gate has a width of 9.50 m and {{is made up of}} two overlapping panels. The lower of the two panels is 3 m high and the upper one 5 m high.|$|R
25|$|Mallison and Chapman {{spent the}} first few hours sorting out the {{submersible}} which was almost upside down. They checked all the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> for leaks and prepared for rescue to come. To preserve oxygen {{they knew they had}} to make as little physical exertion as possible, not even speaking. They made themselves as comfortable as possible as high up as they could get to avoid the foul air that sank down.|$|R
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b> This {{theory suggests}} that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled {{on an even keel}} and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|R
25|$|Each {{engine was}} located in a {{separate}} watertight engine compartment. In case of a hull breach in that area, only one engine room would then be flooded, and the ship would still have use of the adjacent engine. In addition to this Lucania had 16 transverse watertight compartments, with <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> that could be manually closed on command from the telegraph on the bridge. She could remain afloat with any two compartments flooded.|$|R
25|$|Others {{called to}} give {{testimony}} included Phillip A. S. Franklin, Vice President of International Mercantile Marine Co., the shipping consortium headed by J. P. Morgan that controlled White Star Line. The inquiry concluded with Smith visiting Titanics sister ship Olympic in port in New York on 25 May 1912, where he interviewed {{some members of}} the crew and inspected the ship's system of <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and bulkheads, which was identical to that of Titanic.|$|R

50|$|In November 1969, she {{underwent}} a £40,000-refit at Lamonts. The tearoom was upgraded to a cafeteria/restaurant with a proper galley. The observation lounge was refurbished and additional crew cabins were provided. <b>Watertight</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted {{forward of the}} hoist and the side ramps were remodelled to better fit piers on her new service at Islay. She lost her Caley lions and was repainted in MacBrayne colours, although only briefly operated by that company.|$|R

25|$|Captain Turner of Lusitania {{was given}} a warning message twice {{on the evening of}} 6 May, and took what he felt were prudent precautions. He closed <b>watertight</b> <b>doors,</b> posted double lookouts, ordered a black-out, and had the {{lifeboats}} swung out on their davits so that they could be launched quickly if necessary. That evening a Seamen's Charities fund concert took place throughout the ship and the captain was obliged to attend the event in the first class lounge.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Olympic {{assisted}} with both the American and British inquiries into the disaster. Deputations from both inquiries inspected Olympics lifeboats, <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and bulkheads and other equipment which were identical to those on Titanic. Sea tests were performed for the British enquiry in May 1912, to establish how quickly the ship could turn two points at various speeds, to approximate {{how long it would}} have taken Titanic to turn when it sighted the iceberg.|$|R
500|$|Each {{of the two}} {{caissons}} is [...] wide, and {{can hold}} up to four [...] canal boats. <b>Watertight</b> <b>doors</b> at each end match doors located on the upper structure and lower dock pit. Due to space concerns, where a normal hinged door would dramatically reduce the useful length of the caisson, vertically rising doors were chosen. The doors are raised from a recess {{in the base of}} the caisson and powered by a hydraulic lance when docked.|$|R

50|$|Loading of {{vehicles}} onto G deck was through <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> at {{the bow and}} stern.

50|$|By {{the time}} that both captains had ordered the engines on their {{respective}} ships reversed, it was too late, and Camperdowns ram struck the starboard side of Victoria about 12 ft below the waterline and penetrated 9 ft into it. The engines were left turning astern, and this caused the ram to be withdrawn and to let in more seawater before all the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> on Victoria had been closed. Two minutes after the collision, the ships were moving apart.|$|R
40|$|The main {{findings}} of the investigation into the sinking of the passenger/Ro-Ro ferry Express Samina and specifically the ship's damage stability behaviour are outlined in this paper. In the framework of this investigation, the flooding and sinking of the ship following damage was simulated by use of NTUA-SDL's time domain simulation method and the results could be confirmed by analysis of available testimonies of survivors. Progressive flooding through open left <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> was found to be the main reason for ship's sinking...|$|R
