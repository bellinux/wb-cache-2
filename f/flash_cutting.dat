60|$|Heralded by the {{increasing}} fierceness of the squalls, sometimes by a faint {{flash of lightning}} like the signal of a lighted torch waved far away behind the clouds, the shift of wind comes at last, the crucial moment of the change from the brooding and veiled violence of the south-west gale to the sparkling, <b>flashing,</b> <b>cutting,</b> clear- eyed anger of the King's north-westerly mood. You behold another phase of his passion, a fury bejewelled with stars, mayhap bearing the crescent of the moon on its brow, shaking {{the last vestiges of}} its torn cloud-mantle in inky-black squalls, with hail and sleet descending like showers of crystals and pearls, bounding off the spars, drumming on the sails, pattering on the oilskin coats, whitening the decks of homeward-bound ships. Faint, ruddy flashes of lightning flicker in the starlight upon her mastheads. A chilly blast hums in the taut rigging, causing the ship to tremble to her very keel, and the soaked men on her decks to shiver in their wet clothes to the very marrow of their bones. Before one squall has flown over to sink in the eastern board, the edge of another peeps up already above the western horizon, racing up swift, shapeless, like a black bag full of frozen water ready to burst over your devoted head. The temper of the ruler of the ocean has changed. Each gust of the clouded mood that seemed warmed by the heat of a heart flaming with anger has its counterpart in the chilly blasts that seem blown from a breast turned to ice with a sudden revulsion of feeling. Instead of blinding your eyes and crushing your soul with a terrible apparatus of cloud and mists and seas and rain, the King of the West turns his power to contemptuous pelting of your back with icicles, to making your weary eyes water as if in grief, and your worn-out carcass quake pitifully. But each mood of the great autocrat has its own greatness, and each is hard to bear. Only the north-west phase of that mighty display is not demoralizing to the same extent, because between the hail and sleet squalls of a north-westerly gale one can see a long way ahead.|$|R

40|$|The cutting {{heads of}} the first 18 {{instruments}} in six sets of clinically used Lightspeed instruments (sizes 20 - 65) were examined in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three sets had been used by full-time faculty and discarded as follows: instrument sizes 20 - 32. 5 after 18 treated root canals; instrument sizes 35 - 47. 5 after 36 treated root canals; and instrument sizes 50 - 65 after 54 treated root canals. Three other sets had been used by a private clinician who discarded all Lightspeed instruments after preparing 20 root canals. The cutting {{heads of the}} 108 instruments were examined {{for the presence of}} surface debris, metal strips, metal <b>flash,</b> disrupted <b>cutting</b> edges, microfractures, tears, pitting and fretting and fatigue cracks. Fewer instruments ultrasonically cleaned before examination in the SEM had debris than those not cleaned before examination. The prevalence of metal strips and metal flash was similar for both groups. In contrast, microfractures and tears were more prevalent in instruments used by the full-time faculty group, who used their instruments more frequently before discarding them. Pitting and fretting occurred equally frequently in both groups whilst no fatigue cracks were noted in any of the 108 instruments. Overusage of Lightspeed instruments may predispose the flutes of the cutting heads to microfractures and clinicians should be aware of this possibility...|$|R

40|$|High speed forming is a {{traditional}} and long known process for the forming, joining and plating of blanks. The advantages are in general the high forming velocity and the possibility to handle materials, {{which could not be}} treated by conventional processes The economic criteria for this technique are single piece or small lot production, pieces too large for available presses and the avoidance of a thermal treatment. An additional advantage of the process is the strain hardening of the work piece during the process. Scope of this work was the application of pyrotechnic gas generators in a hydro forming kind of process and to extend the technology for cutting processes. Experiments are described, which use gas generator materials as a driving force in a deep drawing and a cutting process. During the work a new gas generator formulation was developed, which showed a minimal slag formation and moderate combustion temperature. Interior ballistic behaviour and combustion temperature were characterized. Materials tested were steel, stainless steel and aluminium with different thicknesses. The results show, that gas generators are a suitable mean for deep drawing applications. The performance of the gas generator process is directly comparable to the hydro forming process, but the time for the drawing cycle is much faster with the new method. The application in cutting processes showed the ability to punch more than one hole of the same geometry simultaneously with <b>flash</b> free <b>cutting</b> edge...|$|R

5000|$|Early on September 27, Typhoon Nesat {{struck the}} Philippines {{with a maximum}} 1-min {{sustained}} wind speed of 105 kn and killed four people after pinning them under a collapsed wall in Valenzuela. The typhoon pounded the Luzon region of the Philippines triggering <b>flash</b> floods, <b>cutting</b> power and halting daily activity in the capital Manila. The Philippine Stock Exchange and US embassy were forced to close due to the strong winds and heavy rains. The residents of Manila {{had no other choice}} but to wade through waist-deep floodwaters, dodging branches and flying debris as the typhoon sent surging waves as tall as palm trees over seawalls completely submerging neighborhoods. By the evening of September 27, at least 7 people were reported to be killed and most of them in metropolitan Manila, a place already battered by heavy monsoonal rains. A motorcyclist in the city reported that [...] "It's flooded everywhere. We don’t have a place to go for shelter. Even my motorcycle got filled with water". He was one of the thousands stranded by fast-rising flood in the city. Similar to Tulane University during Hurricane Katrina, the Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center moved patients from its ground floor which was flooded with neck-deep waters. Hospital generators were flooded and the building had no power once the typhoon arrived. Soldiers and police in trucks moved thousands of residents, most importantly the women and the children away from the Baseco shanty town after many houses were washed away in the storm surge and floodwaters brought by Nesat. The typhoon made landfall before dawn triggering instant response. Officials in the Albay Province said that [...] "About 112,000 people were ordered to leave their homes in five towns prone to flash floods and landslides in central Albay province. By Monday, more than 50,000 had moved to government-run evacuation centers and relatives' homes". Authorities ordered more than a hundred thousand people across the country to flee from Typhoon Nesat's rains and wind gusts. Several schools and offices were shut and thousands were stranded after flight and ferry services were completely disrupted by the fierce storm.|$|R

40|$|The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) is {{a second}} {{generation}} water Čerenkov detector using 1000 tonnes of heavy water to study neutrino astrophysics. Using deuterium neutrino reactions, SNO will measure the flux and energy spectrum of solar electron neutrinos, and will measure the flavour-blind flux of neutrinos. A nitrogen/multi-dye laser diffuser ball has been designed and installed in SNO for calibration of the electronics, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and optical parameters. The laser provides pulsed radiation at 337. 1 nm with a 600 psec width and pulse rate up to 50 Hz. The laser can be used directly or as a pump for one of four dye laser resonators, which provides five wavelength selections from 337 – 500 nm. The light is delivered to a pseudo-isotropic diffuser ball (the laserball) by a 100 μm UV-VIS fibre bundle with less than 1 nsec dispersion at 337 nm. The laserball can be deployed throughout the detector with the rope manipulator system. The laserball output is adjustable from 0. 01 to 1000 photo-electrons (PE) and has a pulsewidth of 0. 90 nsec at 386 nm and 1. 18 nsec at 337. 1 nm. A method has been developed for measuring the optical attenuation and scattering in SNO using the laserball and single photo-electron (SPE) PMT time histograms. At SPE intensity the nanosecond PMT timing {{can be used to}} separate direct and scattered light, and the extinction coefficients determined using varying path lengths from the source. A calibration function has been developed that accounts for the position and direction dependence of the response for electrons and gamma rays. The calibration function uses simplified or parameterized distributions for the Čerenkov output and detector geometry. The function is fast enough to be built in to neutrino spectrum analysis and can be used to evaluate the uncertainties in the position response. The laserball system has been tested and used to provide a PMT and electronics calibration of the detector for analysis of the airfill commissioning runs. The electronics channels were calibrated for charge pedestals and slopes, time offsets and slopes and discriminator walk (slewing). The PMT occupancies were measured and a method was developed for measuring the mean SPE gain. Finally, event reconstruction was studied for the airfill data, and a time biased reconstruction algorithm was created for <b>cutting</b> <b>flashing</b> PMT events...|$|R
