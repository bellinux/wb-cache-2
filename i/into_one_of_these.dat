5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E

Most kernels do not fit exactly <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> categories, but are rather found in between these two designs. These are called hybrid kernels. More exotic designs such as nanokernels and exokernels are available, but are seldom used for production systems. The Xen hypervisor, for example, is an exokernel.|$|E

25|$|R. C. Zaehner distinguishes three {{fundamental}} {{types of}} mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism. The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the Bhagavad Gita. The monistic type, {{which according to}} Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul, includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as Samhya and Advaita vedanta. Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two categories.|$|E
25|$|Warned by {{scouts and}} Arkansas unionists, Curtis rapidly {{concentrated}} his outlying units behind Little Sugar Creek by placing William Vandever's 700-man brigade who marched a remarkable 42 miles in 16 hours from Huntsville to Little Sugar Creek. But Curtis's right flank also {{suffered from the}} mistake of General Sigel, who sent a 360-man task force to the west, where they would miss {{the next three days}} of fighting. Sigel also withdrew a cavalry patrol from the road on which the Confederate army was advancing; however, Colonel Frederick Schaefer of the 2nd Missouri Infantry, on his own initiative, extended his patrols to cover the gap. When Van Dorn's advance guard blundered <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> patrols near Elm Springs, the Federals were alerted. Still, Sigel was so slow in evacuating Bentonville that his rear guard was nearly snared by Van Dorn on March 6 as he advanced.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-20th century {{departments}} {{which had}} been at Marischal College moved <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum (Marischal College has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council). Following extensive fundraising, a £57 million new university library (the Sir Duncan Rice Library) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012. Today, most students {{spend most of their}} time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining.

Most of the Arkansas units appeared to have bypassed the established parole camps, and possibly with the support or at least by the compliancy of their Union captors, simply crossed the river and returned home. Because {{so many of the}} Vicksburg parolees, especially from Arkansas, simply went home, Major General Pemberton requested Confederate President Davis to grant the men a thirty- to sixty-day furlough. The furloughs were not strictly adhered to so long as the soldier eventually showed up at a parole camp to be declared exchanged and returned to duty. Those who went directly home were treated {{as if they had been}} home on furlough if they eventually reported <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two parole centers. The exchange declaration reports issued by Colonel Robert Ould in Richmond for various units in the Vicksburg and Port Hudson surrenders began in September 1863 based upon men who actually reported into one of the two parole camps. Pemberton eventually coordinated with the Confederate War Department and Confederate General Kirby Smith, commanding the Department of the Trans-Mississippi to have the Arkansas Vicksburg parolee's rendezvous point established at Camden, Arkansas.|$|E

The classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear, and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853 based on water colour, but the types were more clearly defined by chemistry and physics by Harald Sioli (...) from the 1950s to the 1980s.
