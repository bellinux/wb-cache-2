5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration {{from the}} duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, and it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> {{larger than the}} similarly coloured Melithreptus honeyeaters. Subspecies albipennis with its white wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.|$|E
5|$|A mid-20th-century report {{estimated}} {{the volume of}} surface seepage into mine workings at Hull Creek was 9.53 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of streambed seepage in the area {{was estimated to be}} 17.02 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of seepage <b>is</b> <b>much</b> higher than a number of other streams in the area.|$|E
5|$|A mutant who can freeze {{objects and}} create ice. His family is unaware {{that he is}} a mutant and simply {{believes}} he is at a boarding school. After returning home, Bobby reveals to them what he actually <b>is,</b> <b>much</b> to his brother's derision. He is also Rogue's boyfriend.|$|E

60|$|Ibid. Burnet, {{speaking}} of the Earl of Clarendon's eldest son, who afterwards succeeded him, says:--His judgement was not to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> depended on, for he <b>was</b> <b>much</b> carried by vulgar prejudices, and false notions. He <b>was</b> <b>much</b> in the Queen's favour. Swift. Much, much, much.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} dolphin welfare {{advocacy}} {{groups such as}} Earth Island Institute, Surfers for Cetaceans and Dolphin Project Inc., dispute these official Japanese claims. These groups assert {{that the number of}} dolphins and porpoises killed <b>is</b> <b>much</b> higher, estimated at 25,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere <b>is</b> <b>much</b> brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|According to polls, {{about one}} out of three Poles say they own a Polish flag, and about {{one out of}} four fly it on {{national}} holidays. Such public display of patriotism <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more common in western Poland, especially in Greater Poland, than {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|E
50|$|Mecocerus wallacei {{exhibits}} a strong sexual dimorphism, as the males <b>are</b> <b>much</b> larger than females and the thread-like antennae <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{longer than the}} body.|$|R
5000|$|Blade workstation: These {{solutions}} tend to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{more expensive}} than the traditional blade PCs, and befitting their more high-end specs, they <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more capable.|$|R

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Among {{directed}} graphs, it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> {{easier to}} find incomparable pairs. For example, consider the directed cycle graphs n, with vertices 1, 2, …, n and edges from i to i + 1 (for i = 1, 2, …, n − 1) and from n to 1.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} canal {{system remains}} from the Industrial Revolution, {{with the city}} having more miles of canal than Venice, although because Birmingham <b>is</b> <b>much</b> larger than Venice the canals are less of a prominent feature {{than they are in}} Venice. Nowadays the canals are mainly used for leisure purposes, and canalside regeneration schemes such as Brindleyplace have turned the canals into tourist attractions.|$|E

50|$|Motorcycles <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less {{protected}} than cars, so any {{accident that}} might occur would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> worse, especially since frequent interchanges with complex traffic flows increase the dangers to motorcyclists.|$|R
50|$|The {{specified}} {{limits for}} polymer capacitor degradation failures <b>are</b> <b>much</b> closer than for non-solid Al-e-caps. That means, the life time behavior of polymer e-caps <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{more stable than}} for wet Al-e-caps.|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{traditional}} applications, iron {{is also used}} for protection from ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, lead, it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> stronger mechanically. The attenuation of radiation {{as a function of}} energy is shown in the graph.|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less massive {{than the}} Sun: {{estimates}} suggest {{it has only}} 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray <b>is</b> <b>much</b> greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a general}} {{perception}} that meshfree methods <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{more expensive than the}} FEM counterparts. The recent study has found however, the S-PIM and S-FEM can <b>be</b> <b>much</b> faster than the FEM counterparts.|$|R
50|$|Since {{holomorphic}} functions <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more rigid than smooth functions, {{the theories}} of smooth and complex manifolds have very different flavors: compact complex manifolds <b>are</b> <b>much</b> closer to algebraic varieties than to differentiable manifolds.|$|R
50|$|There were {{different}} definitions of what made a hime kaidō, as some detours just went around one difficult area, while others <b>were</b> <b>much</b> longer and avoided {{most of the}} dangerous routes. Because of the various definitions, the Nakasendō was {{sometimes referred to as}} a hime kaidō, because the distance <b>was</b> <b>much</b> greater and the danger <b>was</b> <b>much</b> less than that of the Tōkaidō, which started and ended at the same location.|$|R
5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> prosauropod {{material from the}} German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that {{does not belong to}} the type species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognized to be different, but was never sufficiently described.|$|E
5|$|At Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, {{the inside}} all of looking-glass, and fountains very {{pleasant}} to behold, which <b>is</b> <b>much</b> visited by strangers: it {{stands in the}} middle of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{occurs in}} {{the water of the}} Black Creek watershed, {{typically}} at concentrations of less than 0.07 milligrams per liter. Beryllium is about as common, with a concentration of less than 0.06 milligrams per liter. Strontium <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more common, with a concentration of up to 4.4 milligrams per liter.|$|E

5|$|Berkelium-247 can {{maintain}} chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron {{and in a}} fast-neutron reactor, however, its production is rather complex and thus the availability <b>is</b> <b>much</b> lower than its critical mass, which is about 75.7kg for a bare sphere, 41.2kg with a water reflector and 35.2kg with a steel reflector (30cm thickness).|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length <b>is</b> <b>much</b> larger than their diameter. Consequently, as {{expected from the}} classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Circulatory system: The osmotic {{pressure}} of the hemolymph of Theodoxus fluviatilis is 95mOsm. That <b>is</b> <b>much</b> lower value than in marine snails in the subfamily Neritinae.
