5|$|Motivated {{to prove}} his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity squad, and tallied several 40-point games. The {{following}} summer, he grew <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> (10cm) and trained rigorously. Upon earning {{a spot on the}} varsity roster, Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play. As a senior, he was selected to the McDonald's All-American Team after averaging a triple-double: 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists.|$|E
5|$|When he {{examined}} Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds {{from a single}} shotgun blast {{on the right side}} under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> across. The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.|$|E
5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E

5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to <b>four</b> <b>inches,</b> and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} oviparous, meaning these turtles produce {{offspring}} by laying eggs only {{and do not}} provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest site selection and construction. Females select nest sites based on soil temperature (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> wide and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas {{in order to avoid}} flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles will cover the nest with leaves or dirt in order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{attended}} Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. Wade {{quickly found}} {{success as a}} wide receiver on the football team, but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year. While he did not acquire much playing time during his second year, his stepbrother, Demetris McDaniel, was {{the star of the}} team. Wade grew <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in playing time, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. The following year, Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24–5 record. It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional. During this season he set school records for points (676) and steals (106) in a season. Wade has stated that his high school coach, Jack Fitzgerald, {{was one of the most}} positive influences in his life during this time. Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams (Marquette University, Illinois State, and DePaul University) due to academic problems.|$|E

5000|$|Three {{ships of}} this class were {{commissioned}} in 1916-17 as [...] "esploratori", but one (Carlo Alberto Racchia) {{was lost in}} the Black Sea in 1920. In destroyer terms in the early 1920s, the ships of this class were powerful vessels, displacing 2,300 tons and armed with eight <b>four</b> <b>inch</b> guns in single mounts, 450 millimetres (17.7) inch torpedoes, depth charges and mines. Four of the eight guns were mounted along the ships sides, reducing a broadside to six. In 1942-43, the remaining ship in the class had its <b>four</b> beam <b>four</b> <b>inch</b> guns removed and its anti-aircraft weaponry was strengthened to eight 20 millimetre machine guns and depth charge capacity was also increased.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Abby {{bypassed}} Barbados {{a tropical}} depression, {{which resulted in}} minimal effects. Maximum sustained winds on Barbados were reported at 23mph (57km/h), while gusts were recorded up to 37mph (60km/h). There are no other effects known on Barbados. St. Lucia had borne {{the brunt of the}} storm when Hurricane Abby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. Rainfall on the island totaled at 6.80in (172.7mm). Tropical storm force winds were recorded on the island for the passage of Hurricane Abby on July 10, though there were no hurricane force winds reported. In addition, a roof collapsed in on a house, killing six of the residents living there. The passage of Hurricane Abby also resulted in $435,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) of damage on St. Lucia. Martinique was near the path of Hurricane Abby, which resulted in some effects. The Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Fort-de-France recorded rainfall at nearly three inches (76.2mm), while rain in another village was measured at nearly <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> (101.2mm). Winds on Martinique were also at least tropical storm force during the passage of Hurricane Abby. However, wind gusts on Martinique were around 75mph (120km/h), greater than that which was observed on St. Lucia. There were also damaged roads and bridges, mainly due to landslides. The island nation of Dominica was also affected by Hurricane Abby. Hurricane Abby produced nearly sixin (152.4mm) of rain on the island. Winds were also similar to those that were measured on Barbados. Hurricane Abby left about $65,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage to Dominica.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport. At 07:15, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, {{arriving}} at the passenger security checkpoint {{a few minutes later}} at 07:18. Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a hand wand. The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. Hani Hanjour checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35. Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who also set off the metal detector's alarm. The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm. As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket. Utility knives up to <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as carry-on items. The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by Argenbright Security, under contract with United Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment, which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Guinness World Records lists the world's largest (aggregate) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 15inches (38cm) wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime (17.91mm in diameter) have been observed. Snowflakes encapsulated in rime form balls known as graupel.|$|E

5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E
