5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Various mostly {{unofficial}} memorials {{were set up}} on the western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side of the border. After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E

25|$|An {{archaeology}} of the senses, including archaeological optics, {{emphasizes that}} the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective.

25|$|The {{demolition}} {{of a house}} for military purposes is often undertaken <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> to conventional civilian demolitions. In peacetime situations, demolition is merely the first stage {{in a process that}} is usually intended to clear the ground for subsequent re-use (for instance, replacing an old building with a newer one or decommissioning an old industrial building). It is undertaken with extensive preparations, such as stripping the property of items of value, removing hazardous materials such as glass and asbestos insulation, and preparing the structure by removing features that might impede the demolition (such as internal partitions).|$|E

25|$|Other animals {{also have}} receptors {{to sense the}} world around them, with degrees of {{capability}} varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other mammals while some animals may lack {{one or more of}} the traditional five senses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields, and detect water pressure and currents.|$|E
25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes {{up in the morning}} and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E
25|$|Responding to its sentimental public, Argentine film {{at times}} returns to {{subjects}} of the heart. David Lipszyc's grainy portrait of depression-era Argentina, El astillero ("The Shipyard", 2000) was a hit with critics, Paula Hernandez's touching ode to immigrants, Inheritance (2001), {{has become something of}} a sleeper, Adolfo Aristarain's Common Places (2002) follows an elderly professor into retirement, Cleopatra (2003), Eduardo Mignona's tale of an unlikely friendship, received numerous awards, as did Carlos Sorín's touching El perro ("The Dog", 2004). Emotional negativity, a staple for filmmakers anywhere, was explored in Mario Sabato's India Pravile (2003), Francisco D'Intino's La esperanza (2005) and Ariel Rotter's El otro ("The Other", 2007) each deals with mid-life crises <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> The pronounced sentimentality of the average Argentine was also the subject of Robert Duvall's 2002 Assassination Tango, a deceptively simple crime drama that shows that still waters do, indeed, run deep.|$|E

This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written {{they were kind of}} transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of this paper: Results of {{the study}} of wear {{phenomena}} of cascade spinning rolls during stone wool production process are described. Design/methodology/approach: The study were based on direct process observations, chemical analysis and temperature measurements of basalt lava, metallographic examinations of the spinning rolls deposits. Findings: It was showed that the deposits of spinning rolls are worn <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>way,</b> depending on the roll position in rolls cascade. Predominant wear phenomena are high temperature erosion, molten basalt lava (molten salt) corrosion, high temperature corrosion-oxidation, high temperature metal-ceramic abrasion wear, thermal fatigue of the working surface of spinning rolls. Research limitations/implications: The mechanisms of high temperature erosion demands further investigations and detailed studies. Practical implications: The wear resistance of basalt lava spinning rolls can be increased. Originality/value: The mechanisms of surface layer wear of basalt lava spinning rolls were determined...|$|R
