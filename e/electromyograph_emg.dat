2500|$|Biofeedback {{is often}} used to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of relaxation training, because it feeds back information to the chronic headache sufferer about the [...] "body's (biological) current state". One of the most common biofeedback tests is the <b>Electromyograph</b> (<b>EMG),</b> which evaluates the “electrical activity” produced by muscles. Biofeedback also can measure electrical brain activity through a test called the Electroencephalograph (EEG). Another test, called the thermograph, measures skin temperature, because when a person is relaxed they have increased blood flow and a higher temperature. Another method is BVP biofeedback training, which improves chronic headaches by teaching a patient how to regulate and decrease arterial pulse amplitudes by restricting the arteries. When tense, a person's sweat gland activity increases, which is measured by electrodermograph testing of the hands. Biofeedback methods have been proven to work. A study involving fifteen treatment sessions found that biofeedback was [...] "successful in reducing both frequency and severity of headache at discharge and over time". Biofeedback allows headache sufferers to identify problems and then seek to reduce them.|$|E

We have been developing a powered exoskeleton {{that is supposed}} to be used in case of a nuclear hazard. Conventional powered exoskeletons typically use <b>electromyographs</b> (<b>EMG),</b> force switches, or force sensors on the wear's feet. Unfortunately, the former suffers from the decline in measuring accuracy or slips of EMG sensor by sweating. The force-switch-based assist control method has a difficulty in speedy assist control of walk because it needs a few steps of a walk for the recognition. The force-sensorbased assist control method realizes a rapid assist control but the assistive motion is defined beforehand in general. We propose a new approach for power assist controller based on user motion prediction using 9 axis motion sensor. The motion sensor detects the angle and angular velocity of the wear's limb and estimates the appropriate angle of the powered attachment according to the estimated motion.

50|$|From {{the time}} of Henneman and his {{discovery}} of size principle, many {{studies have been done}} to see if his theory holds up to the results of multiple experiments. An experiment of the quadriceps femoris found that motor units are in fact recruited in an orderly manner according to the size principle. The study looked at average motor unit size and firing rate in relationships with force productions of the quadriceps femoris by using a clinical <b>electromyograph</b> (<b>EMG).</b> Results showed the size of motor units increased linearly with increased force production, and firing rate remained constant to 30% maximum force and then increased with greater generation of force. When viewing motor unit potential during muscle contraction on an EMG, as the force generated increases, the amplitude (strength) and frequency (firing rate) increases. The motor units are being recruited in an order from slow, low force to fast, high force.|$|E
5000|$|A Kegel perineometer or vaginal {{manometer}} is {{an instrument}} for measuring the strength of voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles. Arnold Kegel (1894-1981) was the gynecologist who invented the Kegel Perineometer (used for measuring vaginal air pressure) and Kegel exercises (squeezing of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor). This followed the observation that muscles of the pelvic floor inevitably weakened following the trauma of childbirth. [...] Ascertaining the air pressure inside the vagina by insertion of a perineometer, while requesting the woman to squeeze as hard as possible, indicates whether or not she would benefit from strengthening the vaginal muscles using the Kegel exercises. More modern <b>electromyograph</b> (<b>EMG)</b> perineometers, which measure electrical activity in the pelvic floor muscles, may be more effective in this purpose. [...] Assessment of pelvic floor strength during gynaecological examination may help to identify women with fascial defects of the pelvic floor, as well as those at risk of genital prolapse or urinary incontinence. Both the Kegel perineometer and a digital examination are effective and concordant in their results in this assessment.|$|E

To ascertain possible mechanisms, intraspinal microstimulation {{was used}} to examine the lumbar spinal cord motor output of four groups of chronic spinal cats: untrained cats with unmodified-fibroblasts graft (Op-control) or NTF graft and locomotor-trained cats with unmodified-fibroblasts graft (Trained) or NTF graft (Combination). Forces generated via intraspinal microstimulation at different hindlimb positions were recorded and interpolated, generating representations of force patterns at the paw. <b>Electromyographs</b> (<b>EMGs)</b> of hindlimb muscles, medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, and biceps femoris posterior, were also collected to examine relationships between activated muscles and force pattern types. The same four force pattern types obtained in spinal-intact cats were found in chronic spinal cats. Proportions of force patterns in spinal cats differed significantly from those in intact cats, but no significant differences in proportions were observed among individual spinal groups (Op-control, NTF, Trained, and Combination). However, the proportions of force patterns differed significantly between trained (Trained and Combination) and untrained groups (Op-control and NTF). Thus the frequency of expression of some response types was modified by injury {{and to a lesser extent}} by training. Force pattern laminar distribution differed in spinal cats compared with intact, with more responses obtained dorsally (0 – 1, 000 μm) and fewer ventrally (3, 200 – 5, 200 μm). EMG analysis demonstrated that muscle activity highly predicted some force pattern types and was independent of hindlimb position.

In monkeys generating isometric ramp-and-hold wrist torques, pairs of cortical cells were recorded simultaneously with independent electrodes and corticomotoneuronal (“CM”) cells {{were identified by}} their postspike effects on target forelimb muscles in spike-triggered averages (SpTAs) of <b>electromyographs</b> (<b>EMGs).</b> The response patterns of the cells were determined in response-aligned averages and their synaptic interactions were identified by cross-correlograms of action potentials. The possibility that synchronized firing between cortical cells could mediate spike-correlated effects in the SpTA of EMG was examined in several ways. Sixty-two pairs consisted of one CM cell and a non-CM cell; 15 of these had correlogram peaks of the same magnitude as that of other pairs, but the synchrony peaks did not mediate any postspike effect from the non-CM cell. Twelve pairs of simultaneously recorded CM cells were cross-correlated. Half had features (usually synchrony peaks) in their cross-correlograms and the cells of these pairs also shared some target muscles in common. The other half had flat correlograms and, {{in most of these}} pairs, the CM cells affected different muscles. The latter group included pairs of CM cells that facilitated synergistic muscles.

The {{purposes of this study}} were to examine the between-limbs difference in reflex contraction latency of the hamstring muscles in patients with unilateral ACLD and to investigate its relationship with instability and function. Fifty patients with arthroscopically diagnosed unilateral ACLD were measured bilaterally for reflex hamstring contraction latency (RHCL), and 20 normal volunteers were similarly tested. The subjects were measured in a position of single-limb full weight-bearing with the knee flexed 30 degrees. An anteriorly directed shear force was applied to the tibia, and surface <b>electromyographs</b> (<b>EMGs)</b> recorded the activity of the hamstrings in response to the applied force. The latency of contraction was defined as the time from initial tibial movement, identified by accelerometry, to the onset of increased hamstring EMG activity. Both legs were tested and a between-limbs difference was computed. A significant difference in RHCL was found between the limb with ACLD and the control limb. The mean RHCL of the limb with ACLD was nearly double that of the unaffected limb, for a significant mean between-limbs difference (p < 0. 05). The mean between-limbs difference for the control subjects was not statistically significant. The conclusion is that patients with ACLD have an increased RHCL of the injured leg. As the RHCL is dependent on proprioceptive activity around the joint, it {{can be used as a}} measure of proprioceptive ability. The loss of the neurophysiological protective reflex involving the anterior cruciate ligament and hamstrings in patients with ACLD is likely to be a contributory factor in the decreased joint stability experienced by these patients...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{reports in the}} literature, {{using a variety of}} techniques, {{indicating}} that hormonally induced movements of the uterus {{play a major role in}} the reproduction process. The purpose of this study was to explore some of these phenomena by measuring electro-myographical responses from the uterus of intact and ovariectomized ewes both before and during their normal breeding season. Six healthy non-pregnant Romney ewes of about 50 kg body weight were selected for the investigations which were carried out between September 1987 and February 1988. Electrodes, usually in groups of three, were surgically implanted at preselected sites (cervix, uterine body, uterine horn, oviduct) on the reproductive tract of the ewes, leads plugged into a universal AC amplifier, and the output recorded on a four channel ink writing chart recorder. Four of the six ewes were ovariectomized at the time of implantation of the electrodes. Indwelling silastic catheters were inserted into the external jugular veins of these ewes to enable oxytocin to be injected without disturbing the animal. All ewes were housed individually indoors in pens that allowed them to move freely during recording sessions. Recordings began about 10 days after surgery had been carried out. The <b>electromyographs</b> (<b>emgs)</b> were described using generally accepted terms such as the presence of spikes, their amplitude, the presence of bursts and of episodes of activity, whether electrical activity was co-ordinated or unco-ordinated, and the direction of propagation of the activity. A motility index (MI) was derived as a method of measuring electrical activity of the uterus over prolonged periods of time. During the anoestrous period in both intact and ovariectomized ewes an emg pattern of myoelectrical complexes characterised by alternating phases of coordinated bursts of electrical activity and quiescent periods were observed. This basic pattern of activity, and responsiveness to uterine stimulants such as oxytocin and Glandin N (a PGF 2 α analogue), was greater in the intact ewes as compared to the ovariectomized ewes at this time. Although such a difference could be anticipated, a clear answer as to whether it is a general phenomenon, or whether seasonal differences exist, could not be determined because of the limitations in design of this study. A distinct pattern of emg activity was also identified during different phases of the oestrous cycle in the ewe during the natural breeding season. This pattern could be mimicked by administration of the exogenous steroid hormones oestrogen and progesterone in the ovariectomized ewes. Four days after daily oestradiol- 17 b injections (50 μg. s. c.) the emgs of the ovariectomized ewes showed a marked increase in amplitude and in burst frequency and a considerably increased response to oxytocin and Glandin N. When this was followed by progesterone administration (50 mg. s. c), even with oestrogen injections continuing, inhibition of activity and reduced responsiveness to oxytocin and Glandin N was equally marked. Withdrawal of progesterone, but with continuing oestrogen administration, resulted in a recovery from the inhibition and a response that was even greater than before the progesterone had been given. This suggests both an inhibiting and a potentiating action of progesterone on uterine electrical activity, a finding which adds some support to Csapo's classical withdrawal of the 'progesterone block' as one of the pre-requisites for initiation of normal parturition in sheep. While oestrogen has a clear role to play as a stimulator of electrical activity it also seems capable of exhibiting a biphasic response with a period of depressed activity occurring before the positive stimulus occurs. Whether this is a function of dose or some other factor could not be established in this study. Its potentiating effect on the action of both oxytocin and Glandin N in these experiments adds further significance to the attention that should be paid to the reproductive status of the animal when clinical use is made of these substances. The direction of propagation of action potentials recorded in these studies depended on the general level of emg activity. When this was low the direction of propagation was cervico-tubal, when high, the proportion of action potentials is in both directions from the tubal end of the uterus. A clear understanding of such a mechanism, and its significance, must await further study...|$|R

It plays a particularly important role in motor situations when the take-off power is combined with the velocity of movement. The core aim of this study was to establish and analyse the fundamental kinematic, dynamic and electromyographic parameters which generate the results of selected take-off power tests. The experimental procedure involved two elite female triple jumpers. According to Bosco’s protocol the following tests were selected: squat jump, countermovement jump and drop jump – 25 cm. The following were analysed: jump height, take-off time, flight time, take-off velocity, maximum take-off force, angle velocity of the ankle, knee and hip joints, force impulse and duration of the eccentric and concen ric phases of take-off. The 3 D-kinematic analysis of jumps was based on a system of nine SMART-e 600 video-cameras (BTS Bioengineering), with a 60 Hz frequency and a 768 x 576 pixel resolution. The kinematic parameters were processed using the BTS SMART Suite programme. Dynamic parameters were established by means of two separate force-plat forms, namely Kistler, Type 9286 A. The analysis of the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the following muscles: m. erector spinae, m. gluteus maximus, m. rectus femoris, m. vastus medialis, m. vastus lateralis, m. biceps femoris, m. tibialis anterior and m. gastrocnemius medialis was made using a 16 -channel <b>electromyograph</b> (BTS Pocket <b>EMG,</b> MYOLAB). The research showed that the jump height (h) as a criterion of explosive power was generated by: the velocity of take-off, flight time, force impulse in the concentric phase and optimal knee joint angle.

In the first phase of the take-off action, the trunk extensors (m. erector spinae) and hip extensors (m. gluteus maximus) are activated.

Twelve female and 12 male subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four conditions: frontalis EMG biofeedback; frontalis, forearm extensor and masseter biofeedback; frontalis, forearm extensor and semispinalis/splenius biofeedback; and a no‐feedback (instructions only) condition. EMG and heart rate were monitored during 3 training sessions. Although reliable decreases in EMG and heart rate were obtained, no differential effect of single‐ versus multiple‐muscle biofeedback was observed; nor, indeed, were differences between biofeedback and no‐feedback apparent. A second experiment was conducted to determine whether EMG and heart rate reductions reflected a general relaxation response or were simply due to the effects of adaptation. Twenty‐four female subjects were randomly assigned to either a frontalis EMG biofeedback, a no‐feedback or an adaptation control condition. Results indicated that decreases in frontalis EMG levels were due to the instructions to relax whereas heart rate decreases were attributable to adaptation. Equivalence between biofeedback and no‐feedback conditions was again apparent. It was concluded that this finding raises serious questions about the presumed critical role of the feedback signal in EMG biofeedback. Copyrigh...|$|E

Regarding spatial and temporal gait parameters, the individuals achieved an increase in stride length with the use of the experimental ankle-foot orthosis in comparison with the use of a polypropylene ankle-foot orthosis. [Conclusion] The results of the present study demonstrate that individuals with hemiparesis achieved an improvement in the stance and mid-stance phases of gait with the use of the experimental ankle-foot orthosis...|$|E
40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) {{over the}} human motor cortex evokes multiple descending volleys possibly through activation of different {{elements within the}} brain. We have investigated whether such elements can be distinguished spatially. Using a figure of eight coil, TMS was delivered over multiple scalp sites during a low level voluntary contraction of the left first dorsal interosseous muscle. At near-threshold intensity, early or late surface <b>electromyograph</b> (<b>EMG)</b> components (relative to anodal response latency) could be preferentially evoked with the coil aligned in a medio-lateral (ML), antero-posterior (AP), or postero-anterior (PA) orientation. The optimal location of the earliest component with ML coil orientation was 8 mm medial and 5 mm anterior compared to a later component with AP orientation. The optimal location for the same latency EMG component mapped using two different coil orientations (AP and ML) was not significantly different. The optimal location of two different late components, one obtained with AP {{and the other with}} PA coil orientations, was similar. It is argued that the earliest TMS-evoked component results from direct activation of corticospinal cell axons while later components result from activation of these cells trans-synaptically (indirectly), and that consequently there is a substantial spatial separation between these activation sites...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, two simple {{non-invasive}} tests, sympathetic skin response (SSR) and RR interval variation (RRIV) {{have been}} used to assess autonomic function (Wang et al., 1994; Drory et al., 1995; Chassande et al., 1996; Bordet et al., 1996; Spitzer et al., 1997). Their easy performance by an electromyographic (EMG) machine and successful clinical correlation (Shahani et al., 1990) have made them routine in autonomic assessment in several EMG laboratories. More recently QT dispersion on electrocardiogram (ECG) has been shown to have increased in patients with diabetic neuropathy and several autonomic dysfunctions (Wei et al., 1995; Lengyel et al., 1997; Langen et al., 1997; Axelrod et al., 1997). In order to evaluate the diagnostic value of the RR interval variation, sympathetic skin response and QT dispersion combined, we performed the three tests on a group of 37 patients with several peripheral neuropathies with and without clinical signs of dysautonomia. All patients were studied using an <b>electromyograph</b> (<b>EMG).</b> The results of the SSR, RRIV and QT dispersion combined have shown abnormal values in all patients with neuropathy and clinical dysautonomia and in some patients without clinical signs of dysautonomia, suggesting a subclinical autonomic dysfunction. The principal finding {{of this study is that}} the evaluation of the RRIV, SSR and QT dispersion combined may contribute to the assessment of dysautonomia in patients with somatic neuropathy and that they may be currently performed by an electromyograph...|$|E
40|$|A novel Neuropredictive Teleoperation (NPT) Scheme is presented. The design {{results from}} two key ideas: the {{exploitation}} of the measured or estimated neural input to the human arm or its <b>electromyograph</b> (<b>EMG)</b> as the system input and the employment of a predictor of the arm movement, based on this neural signal and an arm model, to compensate for time delays in the system. Although a multitude of such models, as well as measuring devices for the neural signals and the EMG, have been proposed, current telemanipulator research has only been considering highly simplified arm models. In the present design, the bilateral constraint that the master and slave are simultaneously compliant to each other's state (equal positions and forces) is abandoned, thus obtaining a ""simple to analyze"" succession of only locally controlled modules, and a robustness to time delays of up to 500 ms. The proposed designs were inspired by well established physiological evidence that the brain, rather than controlling the movement on-line, ""programs"" the arm with an action plan of a complete movement, which is then executed largely in open loop, regulated only by local reflex loops. As {{a model of the}} human arm the well-established Stark model is employed, whose mathematical representation is modified to make it suitable for an engineering application. The proposed scheme is however valid for any arm model. BIBO-stability and passivity results for a variety of local control laws are reported. Simulation results and comparisons with ""traditional"" designs also highlight the advantages of the proposed design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Temporal {{whitening}} {{of individual}} surface <b>electromyograph</b> (<b>EMG)</b> waveforms and spatial combination of multiple recording sites have separately {{been demonstrated to}} improve the performance of EMG amplitude estimation. This investigation combined these two techniques by first whitening, then combining the data from multiple EMG recording sites to form an EMG amplitude estimate. A phenomenological mathematical model of multiple sites of the surface EMG waveform, with analytic solution for an optimal amplitude estimate, is presented. Experimental surface EMG waveforms were then sampled from multiple sites during nonfatiguing, constant-force, isometric contractions of the biceps or triceps muscles, over the range of 1 & 75 % maximum voluntary contraction. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was computed from each amplitude estimate (deviations about the mean value of the estimate were considered as noise). Results showed that SNR performance: 1) increased {{with the number of}} EMG sites, 2) was a function of the sampling frequency, 3) was predominantly invariant to various methods of determining spatial uncorrelation filters, 4) was not sensitive to the intersite correlations of the electrode configuration investigated, and 5) was best at lower levels of contraction. A moving average root mean square estimator (245 -ms window) provided an average f standard deviation (AfSD) SNR of 10. 7 f 3. 3 for single site unwhitened recordings. Temporal whitening and four combined sites improved the AfSD SNR to 24. 6 f 10. 4. On one subject, eight whitened combined sites were achieved, providing an AfSD SNR of 35. 0 f 13. 4. I...|$|E
