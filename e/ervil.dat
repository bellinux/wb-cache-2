25|$|One of LeBaron's daughters, Lillian Chynoweth, related {{an account}} {{of some of these}} killings in the film The God Makers II. Chynoweth {{discussed}} the murder of her husband, her brother-in-law and his 8-year-old daughter by her half brothers on 27 June, the 144th anniversary of the death of Joseph Smith. She stated that their names were “on the list to be atoned for” because her father believed that they were “traitors to God’s cause.” Not explicitly named in the film, this list was <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron's ‘‘The Book of the New Covenants’’. Chynoweth added that if anything happened to her, the “Mormon” church would be responsible. Shortly after the interview, according to the film, she was found dead in her home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.|$|E

Before his death in prison, LeBaron wrote a document which he called The Book of the New Covenants. This document listed {{a number of people who}} had been disloyal and [...] "deserved to die."

2500|$|LaLanne {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, the son of Jennie (née Garaig; 1882–1973) and Jean/John LaLanne (1881–1939), French {{immigrants}} from Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Both entered the U.S. in the 1880s as young children at the Port of New Orleans. LaLanne had two older brothers, <b>Ervil,</b> who died in childhood (1906–1911), and Norman (1908–2005), who nicknamed him [...] "Jack". He grew up in Bakersfield, California and later moved {{with his family to}} Berkeley, California circa 1928. In 1939, his father {{died at the age of}} 58 in a San Francisco hospital, which LaLanne attributed to [...] "coronary thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver". In his book The Jack LaLanne Way to Vibrant Health, LaLanne wrote that as a boy he was addicted to sugar and junk food. He had violent episodes directed against himself and others, describing himself as [...] "a miserable goddamn kid ... it was like hell".|$|E
50|$|When she {{was three}} years old, Rena Chynoweth’s parents were {{converted}} to the Mormon fundamentalist Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times, based in Colonia LeBaron in northern Mexico. The Chynoweths moved to Colonia LeBaron to join {{the rest of the}} polygamist sect, which was at the time led by Joel LeBaron. Joel’s leadership was soon challenged by his younger brother, <b>Ervil,</b> who believed that he was the ‘One Mighty and Strong’ chosen by God to lead the Latter-day Saints. The Chynoweths followed <b>Ervil</b> when he eventually broke away from Joel’s church. The Chynoweths, especially young Rena, were devout followers of <b>Ervil.</b> <b>Ervil</b> proposed to Rena when she was only 16. In a proxy interview with Doris Hanson in 2009, Rena claimed that <b>Ervil</b> told her she would go to hell if she did not accept the proposal. As she believed <b>Ervil</b> to be a true prophet she did not doubt this, so she accepted the proposal. She became his thirteenth wife and had two children by him.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, the {{brothers}} split over {{leadership of the}} Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times, and <b>Ervil</b> started the Church of the First Born of the Lamb of God in San Diego, California. That year, <b>Ervil</b> ordered the murder of Joel in Mexico. Leadership of the Baja California church passed to the youngest LeBaron brother, Verlan, whom <b>Ervil</b> tried to have killed over the next decade. [...] In 1974, <b>Ervil</b> was tried and convicted in Mexico for Joel's murder. His conviction was overturned on a technicality; some have alleged this was {{as a result of}} a bribe. [...] Ervil's followers subsequently raided Los Molinos in an effort to kill Verlan-- who was in Nicaragua—but the town was destroyed and two men were killed.|$|E
50|$|By 1962, <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron was the Presiding Patriarch of {{the church}} and number two in {{authority}} to Joel LeBaron. By 1967 he was teaching that he, not Joel, was the proper head {{of the church}}. Joel and other leaders of the church denounced <b>Ervil</b> and released him from his position.|$|E

5000|$|In August 1972, <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron and his {{followers}} established the rival Church of the First Born of the Lamb of God. <b>Ervil</b> began teaching {{his followers}} {{that he was the}} [...] "One Mighty and Strong" [...] prophesied of in the Doctrine and Covenants, and he prophesied that [...] "Joel will be put to death". On 20 August 1972, Joel LeBaron {{was shot in the head}} by one of Ervil's followers, becoming one of the victims of the <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron murders (in which members of the Church of the Lamb of God committed dozens of assassinations of both members of its parent LeBaron sect and of other Mormon fundamentalist groups).|$|E
50|$|In 1972, <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron {{established}} the rival Church of the Lamb of God and began teaching his followers that {{in accordance with}} the doctrine of blood atonement, Joel had to be executed for his sins. On 20 August 1972, in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, one of Ervil's followers Daniel Jordan (who was married to one of their nieces) shot Joel LeBaron in the head while Joel's young son was asleep in a car in the driveway. <b>Ervil</b> was tried and convicted in Mexico for Joel's murder, but the conviction was overturned. <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron was eventually convicted in Utah for ordering the killing of rival Mormon fundamentalist leader Rulon C. Allred. Joel LeBaron was succeeded as president of the church by his brother Verlan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ervil</b> LeBaron {{also ordered}} {{the murders of}} {{members of his own}} family and those of his supporters. His 10th wife, Vonda White, was convicted and {{sentenced to life in prison}} for the murder of Dean Grover Vest, one of LeBaron's henchmen, who had {{attempted}} to leave the church. Vonda White is also said to have killed Noemi Zarate Chynoweth, the plural wife of Ervil's father-in-law through his wife, Lorna Chynoweth. Noemi had been critical of <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron's practices and snubbed him at her wedding to Bud Chynoweth. According to witnesses, Thelma Chynoweth (Bud Chynoweth's first wife who was Lorna's mother and Noemi's sister-wife) helped kill Noemi. <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron has also been linked to the death of his own 17-year-old daughter Rebecca, who was pregnant with her second child and hoped to leave the group; it is alleged that his stepson Eddie Marston and brother-in-law Duane Chynoweth strangled her in April 1977.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ervil</b> soon {{organised}} {{his followers}} {{into a new}} church, the Church of the Lamb of God. Its members were known as the ‘Lambs of God’. <b>Ervil</b> used the doctrine of blood atonement to justify the murders of other polygamist leaders who he believed were enemies of his church, and therefore, enemies of God. One of his prime targets was Doctor Rulon Clark Allred, leader of the Apostolic United Brethren. As one of Ervil’s most devout and “prettiest” followers the nineteen-year-old Chynoweth, along with Ramona Marston, were chosen {{to carry out the}} murder of Allred.|$|E
50|$|Lillian Chynoweth’s {{description}} of the “blood atonement” administered by the followers of <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron is briefly described in Jon Krakauer’s book Under the Banner of Heaven. Although not explicitly named in the film The God Makers II, the list that Chynoweth referred to was called The Book of the New Covenants, and was written by <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron {{before his death in}} prison. The document contained a list of individuals that LeBaron believed deserved to die. Upon receipt of the list by several of his sons, they proceeded to administer this punishment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ervil</b> LeBaron's {{attention}} was also focused on rival polygamous leaders. In April 1975, {{he ordered the}} killing of Bob Simons, a polygamist who sought to minister to Native Americans. [...] In 1977, LeBaron ordered the killing of Rulon C. Allred, leader of the Apostolic United Brethren, another Mormon fundamentalist sect. <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron's 13th wife, Rena Chynoweth, carried out the murder with another woman, Ramona Marston. Although Rena Chynoweth was tried and acquitted for Allred's murder, she confessed in her memoir, The Blood Covenant (1990). She also described her experiences in LeBaron's group, which she characterized as using mind control and fear to control its followers.|$|E
5000|$|On June 1, 1979, <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron was apprehended {{by police}} in Mexico and extradited to the United States, {{where he was}} convicted of having ordered Allred's death. In 1980, he was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah, where he died on August 16, 1981. [...] Ervil's brother Verlan (whom <b>Ervil</b> had tried to murder) died in an auto accident in Mexico City two days after Ervil's body was discovered in his cell. In an October 2012 interview with Vice Magazine, Verlan LeBaron's grandson Brent LeBaron stated that at least some in the LeBaron family believe that this may not have been a coincidence.|$|E
50|$|Joel Franklin LeBaron (June 9, 1923 - August 20, 1972) was a Mormon {{fundamentalist}} {{leader in}} northern Mexico. He {{was murdered by}} a member or members of a rival church which was headed by his brother <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron.|$|E
50|$|Dorothy Allred {{was born}} to Mormon {{fundamentalist}} leader Rulon C. Allred and his fourth plural wife. She was the 28th of her father's 48 children. In 1977, her father was murdered by agents of rival polygamist leader <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron.|$|E
50|$|Chynoweth later remarried. She {{claims to}} have been {{controlled}} by <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron through fear. She now works to help children who have suffered from involvement in polygamy. She strongly supported the actions of Texas during the YFZ Ranch raid.|$|E
5000|$|A power {{struggle}} ensued between {{the sons of}} Alma Dayer LeBaron. [...] A younger son, <b>Ervil,</b> founded his own church, the Church of the Lamb of God, in 1972 in San Diego, California, and later that year ordered {{the murder of his}} brother Joel, claiming justification based on the doctrine of blood atonement. Ervil's hit list would eventually reach the hundreds and include John F. Kennedy and the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Besides Joel, he would succeed in murdering his pregnant daughter Rebecca and Rulon C. Allred, the President of the Apostolic United Brethren, another key polygamist group. Rulon Allred was Irene's mother's brother, {{and one of the reasons}} <b>Ervil</b> had him killed was so he could kill Verlan at Rulon's funeral.|$|E
50|$|Banking on Heaven is a {{documentary}} film which exposes the largest polygamous enclave in the United States (located in Colorado City, Arizona) and its leader, Warren Jeffs. Banking on Heaven was written, produced, and narrated by Laurie Allen, who escaped a similar polygamous sect at age sixteen (her uncle was <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron).|$|E
50|$|After Joel's death, Verlan {{was tapped}} for {{leadership}} of the Church of the Firstborn, so <b>Ervil</b> added Irene's family to his hit list. To escape the death threats, Irene and her children were forced to move to Nicaragua, where they lived in huts without electricity or indoor plumbing, battled ticks and jungle insects, and were infected by intestinal worms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ervil</b> Morrell LeBaron (February 22, 1925 [...] - [...] August 15, 1981) was {{the leader}} of a {{polygamous}} Mormon fundamentalist group who ordered the killings of many of his opponents, using the religious doctrine of blood atonement to justify the murders. He was {{sentenced to life in prison}} for orchestrating the murder of an opponent, and died there.|$|E
50|$|The Righteous Branch was {{organized}} on April 6, 1978, by Gerald Wilbur Peterson Sr. (born October 8, 1917 in Lusk, Wyoming, died January 1981). Peterson claimed that after Rulon C. Allred, the President of the Priesthood of the Apostolic United Brethren, {{was murdered in}} May 1977 by followers of <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron, Allred appeared to him and instructed him to preside over the keys of the priesthood.|$|E
5000|$|Schmidt {{had five}} {{children}} with LeBaron, the first being born just before her sixteenth birthday. At age 23, Schmidt {{escaped from the}} fundamentalist sect and moved back up to Southern Utah with her five children. Self described as [...] "naive and uneducated", Schmidt eventually graduated high school and then college. During her marriage to LeBaron, Schmidt was sister-wife of fellow author Irene Spencer and sister-in-law to <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron, Rena Chynoweth and Joel LeBaron.|$|E
50|$|Vicia ervilia, {{known as}} <b>ervil</b> or bitter vetch, {{is an ancient}} grain legume crop of the Mediterranean region. Besides the English names, other common names include: gavdaneh (Persian), kersannah (Arabic), yero (Spanish), rovi (Greek), and burçak (Turkish). The {{nutritional}} value of the grain for ruminant cattle has guaranteed the continued cultivation of V. ervilia in Morocco, Spain and Turkey. The crop is easy to cultivate and harvest and can be grown on very shallow, alkaline soils.|$|E
50|$|In 1955, Joel LeBaron {{and two of}} his {{brothers}} established the Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times in Salt Lake City, Utah with Joel as President of the Church. Upon returning to northern Mexico, their parents and most {{of the members of the}} LeBaron family joined the new church. In 1967, Joel's brother <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron was removed from leadership in the church when he began to preach that he, and not Joel, was the proper leader of the church.|$|E
5000|$|When Alma died in 1951, {{he passed}} the {{leadership}} of the community on to his son Joel LeBaron. Joel eventually incorporated the community as the Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times in Salt Lake City, Utah. [...] Joel's younger brother, <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron, was his second in command {{during the early years of}} the church's existence. The group ultimately numbered around 30 families who lived in both Utah and a community called [...] "Los Molinos" [...] on the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|LeBaron's seven sons with Maud McDonald {{included}} Benjamin Teasdale LeBaron, Ross Wesley LeBaron, Alma Dayer LeBaron Jr., Floren LeBaron, Verlan LeBaron, Joel F. LeBaron and <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron. At various times, {{seven of}} them would believe himself to fulfill the premillennial demi-messianic priesthood office or offices such as the One Mighty and Strong, the Presiding Patriarch in All the World, according to a professed Right of the Firstborn (equating to Joseph Smith Jr.'s mantle {{as leader of the}} early Latter Day Saint Council of Fifty).|$|E
5000|$|The living {{conditions}} in Nicaragua nearly broke Irene, but she finally left Verlan in 1978 when, despite the family's abject poverty, {{he married a}} 10th wife, Priscilla. [...] After seeking spiritual advice outside of the polygamist community, she was convinced to return to Verlan in 1980. One year later, on August 16, 1981, Verlan died in an automobile accident. His brother <b>Ervil,</b> had died 2 days prior in the Utah State Penitentiary, where he was {{serving a life sentence}} for the murder of Rulon Allred.|$|E
50|$|Lillian LeBaron Chynoweth relates her {{experiences}} {{living in a}} polygamous fundamentalist group. Chynoweth, identified in the film as “Lillian, Former Mormon Fundamentalist,” {{was the daughter of}} <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron. LeBaron was the leader and prophet of the Church of the Lamb of God, although the name of the church is not identified in the film and is instead referred to by Chynoweth as the “Mormon Church.” Chynoweth states that the group was sincere in practicing “all aspects of Mormonism” and describes her father as controlling every aspect of their lives through revelation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ervil</b> LeBaron, {{the leader}} and prophet of the Church of the Lamb of God, {{initiated}} {{a series of}} killings which ultimately resulted in his being {{sentenced to life in}} prison.

5000|$|Rulon Clark Allred (March 29, 1906 [...] - [...] May 10, 1977) was a homeopath and {{chiropractor}} in Salt Lake City and {{the leader}} of what is now the Apostolic United Brethren, a breakaway sect of polygamous Mormon fundamentalists in Utah, Colorado, and Arizona, United States. This fundamentalist offshoot often called [...] "The Allred Group" [...] has recently come into the Hollywood spotlight with the release of the hit Reality TV series Sister Wives aired in 2010. Rulon was murdered on the orders of <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron, the head of a rival polygamous sect.|$|E
5000|$|Soon thereafter, various LeBarons {{declared}} that their family was possessed of especial priesthood keys of authority to a pre-millennial demi-messianic office or offices, in the restored earthly kingdom of God, with their ultimate leader said to possess this Right of the Firstborn becoming variously titled {{for example the}} One Mighty and Strong, the Presiding Patriarch in All the World, and so forth, the LeBarons' believing him the rightful heir of Joseph Smith Jr.'s mantle {{as leader of the}} early Latter Day Saints' Council of Fifty (via early Latter Day Saint Council of Fifty member Benjamin F. Johnson). On 21 September 1955, Joel LeBaron and his brothers Ross and Floren visited Salt Lake City, Utah, and there organized the Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times; Joel was ordained President of the Church, with Floren as first counselor in the First Presidency and Ross as head patriarch. Shortly thereafter, Joel reported being visited by nineteen former prophets, including Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and Joseph Smith. In early 1956, the LeBaron brothers returned to Chihuahua. Their father Alma and brother <b>Ervil</b> became the fourth and fifth members of the new church; their mother Maud also eventually joined. Several months later, <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron published a pamphlet titled [...] "Priesthood Expounded", which became a foundational text for the order.|$|E
50|$|Owen Arthur Allred (January 14, 1914 - February 14, 2005) was {{the leader}} of the Apostolic United Brethren, a Mormon {{fundamentalist}} polygamist group centered in Bluffdale, Utah.

He had eight wives, twenty-three children and over two hundred grandchildren. In 1942, he was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) when he married his second wife. After his death, he was succeeded by J. LaMoine Jensen.|$|E
50|$|The {{shooting}} of Rulon C. Allred by Rena Chynoweth on May 10, 1977 (under {{the direction of}} <b>Ervil</b> LeBaron), brought the AUB into the spotlight. Allred was succeeded by his brother, Owen A. Allred, who died in February 2005 {{and was replaced by}} his appointed successor, J. LaMoine Jenson. Jenson died in September 2014 after a battle with colon cancer, and was replaced by his appointed successor, Lynn A.
