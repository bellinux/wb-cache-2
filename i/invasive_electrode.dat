Even though oxygen plays {{a crucial role}} in body function and cancer biology, methods of measuring oxygen level in tissue are all limited. The current gold standard relies on an <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> for only single-point reading at a time. The photoacoustic lifetime imaging (PALI) approach overcomes these major limitations by applying photoacoustic probing to oxygen-sensitive optical transient absorption. The capability of assessing oxygen distribution is demonstrated by imaging tumor hypoxia in a small animal model, and monitoring changes of tissue oxygen induced by external modulations. Proposed applications of this imaging technique includes imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) and activatable probes for molecular imaging...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Neural {{prostheses}} {{have received}} considerable attention {{due to their}} potential to dramatically {{improve the quality of}} life of severely disabled patients. Cortically-controlled prostheses are able to translate neural activity from cerebral cortex into control signals for guiding computer cursors or prosthetic limbs. Non-invasive and <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> techniques can be used to measure neural activity, with the latter promising considerably higher levels of performance and therefore functionality to patients. We review here some of our recent experimental and computational work aimed at establishing a principled design methodology to increase electrodebased cortical prosthesis performance to near theoretical limits. Studies discussed include translating unprecedentedly brief periods of “plan ” activity into high information rate (6. 5 bits/s) control signals, improving decode algorithms and optimizing visual target locations for further performance increases, and recording from chronically implanted arrays in freely behaving monkeys to characterize neuron stability. Taken together, these results should substantially increase the clinical viability of cortical prostheses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Biomagnetic {{measurements}} are increasingly popular as functional imaging techniques for the non-invasive assessment of electrically active tissue. Although most currently available magnetometers utilise only {{one component of}} the vector magnetic field, some studies have suggested the possibility of obtaining additional information from recordings of the full magnetic field vector. Three projection techniques were applied to different biomagnetic signals for analysis of the three orthogonal com-ponents of the vector magnetic field. Vector magnetic fields obtained from fetal cardiac activity were projected into evenly spaced directions around a unit sphere. The vector magnetic field recorded from multiple intestinal current sources with independent temporal frequencies was then projected. Finally, an external reference signal from an <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> was used to project the recorded vector magnetic fields due to gastric electrical activity, in each case, {{it was found that}} the information obtained by examination of the projected magnetic field vectors gave superior ctinicat insight to that obtained by anatysis of any single magnetic field component...|$|E

The needle is placed on the promontory wall of the middle ear and the round window. Non-invasive, or extratympanic (ET), electrodes have the advantage of not causing pain or discomfort to the patient.

30|$|The event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{which are}} measured {{by means of}} electroencephalography (EEG) is the measured brain response of testee with a specific stimuli (Cahn and Polich 2006; Dietrich and Kanso 2010). Since the EEG monitoring collects electrical impulse data from the electrodes placed on the scalp, it should be totally non-invasive in most cases except for an inevitable <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> for specific application. Moreover, the monitoring process is silent so that the auditory disturbance is reduced to a very subtle level and is tolerant to subject movement. Owing to the numerous advantages, EEG is widely adopted as the analysis tool for brain activity, especially on children testees. Nevertheless, the traditional output of the EEG monitoring manifests as waveforms, so that the analysis of them is unintuitive and usually relies on the experiential judgements of the EEG providers. In recent years, more and more research focus is concentrated on the analysis of EEG data, but almost all of such work focuses on the average performance of similar testees, which may lead to the loss of information about each distinct testee (Alexander-Bloch et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2008; Meunier et al. 2009). In this experiment, we attempt to apply the proposed method on the signed multilayer network generated from the EEG data to explore the functional performance of the regions of brain. We compare the detected result with a standard empirical brain functional region division to find a surprising match between clinical experience and graph data mining (Power et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Most motor tasks {{require the}} {{simultaneous}} coordination of multiple muscles. That coordination is poorly understood {{in part because}} there is no noninvasive means of isolating a single muscle's contribution to the resultant endpoint force. The contribution of a single motor unit to isometric tasks can, however, be characterized using the spike-triggered averaging (STA) technique, applied to a single motor unit's spike train. We propose that a technique analogous to STA, which we call electromyogram (EMG) -weighted averaging (EWA), can be applied to surface EMGs to extract muscle mechanical action from the natural endpoint force fluctuations generated during steady isometric contraction. We demonstrate this technique on simultaneous recordings of fingertip force and surface EMG from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and extensor indicis (EI) of humans. The EWA direction was approximately the same across a wide range of fingertip force directions, and the average EWA direction was consistent with mechanical action direction of these muscles estimated from cadaveric and imaging data: the EWA directions were 193 ± 2 ° for the FDI and 71 ± 5 ° for the EI (95 % confidence). EWA transient behavior also appears to capture temporal characteristics of muscle force fluctuations with peak force time and general waveform shape {{similar to that of the}} associated spike-triggered averages from single motor units. The EWA may provide a means of empirically characterizing the complex transformation between muscle force and endpoint force without the need for <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> recordings or complex anatomical measurements of musculoskeletal geometry...|$|E
40|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex forms {{a sheet of}} neurons organized into a network of interconnected modules that is highly expanded in humans and presumably enables our most refined sensory and cognitive abilities. The links of this network form a fundamental aspect of its organization, {{and a great deal}} of research is focusing on understanding how information flows within and between different regions. However, an often-overlooked element of this connectivity regards a causal, hierarchical structure of regions, whereby certain nodes of the cortical network may exert greater influence over the others. While this is difficult to ascertain non-invasively, patients undergoing <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> monitoring for epilepsy provide a unique window into this aspect of cortical organization. In this review, we highlight the potential for corticocortical evoked potential (CCEP) mapping to directly measure neuronal propagation across large-scale brain networks with spatio-temporal resolution that is superior to traditional neuroimaging methods. We first introduce effective connectivity and discuss the mechanisms underlying CCEP generation. Next, we highlight how CCEP mapping has begun to provide insight into the neural basis of non-invasive imaging signals. Finally, we present a novel approach to perturbing and measuring brain network function during cognitive processing. The direct measurement of CCEPs in response to electrical stimulation represents a potentially powerful clinical and basic science tool for probing the large-scale networks of the human {{cerebral cortex}}. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Experimental. OBJECTIVES: Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal genital nerves (DGN) suppresses involuntary detrusor contractions (IDCs) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (DO). The feasibility of minimal <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> implantation near the DGN {{and the effectiveness of}} conditional stimulation to suppress IDCs at different amplitudes in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with DO were studied. SETTING: Radboud University Nijmegen MC, The Netherlands. METHODS: In eight healthy volunteers, a needle electrode was inserted from both a medial and lateral-to-midline site {{at the level of the}} pubic bone. Electrode insertion was guided by the genito-anal reflex (GAR) evoked by electrical stimulation and by sensation to this stimulation. In eight SCI patients with DO, the bladder was repeatedly filled and emptied partially in between. Conditional stimulation using a needle electrode was applied when an IDC was observed at urodynamics. Different amplitudes were used during each filling. Control cystometry was carried out before electrode insertion and after stimulation. RESULTS: The lateral implant approach was preferred, as it was easier to manoeuvre the needle along the pubic bone and fixate the needle. In SCI patients, the electrode was positioned successfully, and IDCs were suppressed (range 1 - 6 IDC suppressions) with conditional stimulation at maximum tolerable amplitude, except for one patient. Stimulation was less effective at lower amplitudes. Stimulation lowered the intensity of bladder sensations concomitant with IDC. CONCLUSION: The lateral-to-midline implant approach, in combination with GAR and sensation to stimulation, is feasible for electrode implantation near the DGN in SCI patients. Conditional stimulation effectively suppresses IDCs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a registration and tracking technique to integrate cardiac X-ray images and cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired from a combined X-ray and MR interventional suite (XMR). Optical tracking {{is used to}} determine the transformation matrices relating MR image coordinates and X-ray image coordinates. Calibration of X-ray projection geometry and tracking of the X-ray C-arm and table enable three-dimensional (3 -D) reconstruction of vessel centerlines and catheters from bi-plane X-ray views. We can, therefore, combine single X-ray projection images with registered projection MR images from a volume acquisition, and we can also display 3 -D reconstructions of catheters within a 3 -D or multi-slice MR volume. Registration errors were assessed using phantom experiments. Errors in the combined projection images (two-dimensional target registration error – TRE) were found to be 2. 4 to 4. 2 mm, and the errors in the integrated volume representation (3 -D TRE) were found to be 4. 6 to 5. 1 mm. These errors are clinically acceptable for alignment of images of the great vessels and the chambers of the heart. Results are shown for two patients. The first involves overlay of a catheter used for invasive pressure measurements on an MR volume that provides anatomical context. The second involves overlay of <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> catheters (including a basket catheter) on a tagged MR volume in order to relate electrophysiology to myocardial motion in a patient with an arrhythmia. Visual assessment of these results suggests the errors were of a similar magnitude to those obtained in the phantom measurements.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the organisation and functioning of the human visual system using the non-invasive functional imaging modality magnetoencephalography (MEG). Chapters one and two provide an introduction to the ‘human visual system and magnetoencephalographic methodologies. These chapters subsequently describe the methods by which MEG can be used to measure neuronal activity from the visual cortex. Chapter three describes {{the development and implementation of}} novel analytical tools; including beamforming based analyses, spectrographic movies and an optimisation of group imaging methods. Chapter four focuses on the use of established and contemporary analytical tools in the investigation of visual function. This is initiated with an investigation of visually evoked and induced responses; covering visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and event related synchronisation/desynchronisation (ERS/ERD). Chapter five describes the employment of novel methods in the investigation of cortical contrast response and demonstrates distinct contrast response functions in striate and extra-striate regions of visual cortex. Chapter six use synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) to investigate the phenomena of visual cortical gamma oscillations in response to various visual stimuli; concluding that pattern is central to its generation and that it increases in amplitude linearly as a function of stimulus contrast, consistent with results from <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> studies in the macaque monkey. Chapter seven describes the use of driven visual stimuli and tuned SAM methods in a pilot study of retinotopic mapping using MEG; finding that activity in the primary visual cortex can be distinguished in four quadrants and two eccentricities of the visual field. Chapter eight is a novel implementation of the SAM beamforming method in the investigation of a subject with migraine visual aura; the method reveals desynchronisation of the alpha and gamma frequency bands in occipital and temporal regions contralateral to observed visual abnormalities.

40|$|Abstract — For {{as many as}} 30 % of {{epilepsy}} patients, seizures {{are poorly}} controlled with medication alone. For some of these patients surgery may be an option: the brain region responsible for seizure onset may be removed surgically. However, this requires accurate delineation of the seizure onset region. Currently, {{the key to making}} this determination is seizure EEG. Therefore, EEG recordings must continue until enough seizures are obtained to determine the onset region; this may take about 5 days to several weeks. In some cases these recordings must be done using <b>invasive</b> <b>electrodes,</b> a procedure that includes substantial risk, discomfort and cost. In this paper, techniques are developed that use periods of intracranial non-seizure (“rest”) EEG to localize epileptogenic networks. Analysis of intracranial EEG (recorded by surface and/or depth electrodes) of 6 epileptic patients shows that certain EEG channels and hence cortical regions are consistently more synchronous (“hypersynchronous”) compared to others. It is shown that hypersynchrony seems to strongly correlate with the seizure onset zone; this phenomenon may in the long term allow to determine the seizure onset area(s) from non-seizure EEG, which in turn would enable shorter hospitalizations or even avoidance of semi-chronic implantations all-together.

40|$|Following recent developments, most brain imaging {{modalities}} (MR, CT, SPECT, PET) can nowadays {{be registered}} and integrated {{in a manner}} almost simple enough for routine use. By design though, these modalities are still not able to match the principles and near real-time capabilities of the much simpler (but of lower spatial resolution) EEG, thus the need to integrate it as well, along with - for some patients - the more accurate invasive electrophysiology measurements taken directly in contact with brain structures. A standard control CT (or MR) is routinely performed after the implantation of <b>invasive</b> <b>electrodes.</b> After registration with the other modalities, the initial estimates of the electrodes' locations extracted from the CT (or MR) are iteratively improved by using a geometrical model of the etectrodes' arrangement (grids, strips, etc.) and other optional constraints (morphology, etc.). Unlike the direct 3 D pointing of each electrode in the surgical suite - which can still act as a complementary approach this technique estimates the most likely location of the electrodes during monitoring and can also deal with non critical arrangements (internal strips, depth electrodes, etc.).

40|$|Optical imaging of {{neuronal}} activity offers {{new possibilities}} for understanding brain physiology. The predominant methods in neuroscience for measuring electrical activity require electrodes {{inserted into the}} tissue. Such methods, however, provide limited spatial information and are invasive. Optical methods are less physically invasive and offer the possibility for simultaneously imaging the activity of many neurons. In this thesis one- and two-photon fluorescence microscopy techniques were applied to several in vivo and in vitro mammalian preparations. ^ Using one-photon absorption fluorescence microscopy and gradient index (GRIN) lens optics, cortical electrical activity in response to electric stimulation was resolved in three-dimensions at high-speed in the primary somatosensory cortex of the mouse in vivo using voltage-sensitive dyes. Imaging at depths up to 150 μm below the cortex surface, {{it was possible to}} resolve depth-dependent patterns of neuronal activity in response to cortical and thalamic electric stimulation. The patterns of activity were consistent with known cortical cellular architecture. ^ In a qualitatively different set of experiments, one-photon fluorescence microscopy via voltage-sensitive dyes was successfully employed to image an in vitro preparation of the perfused rat brainstem during the process of respiratory rhythmogenesis. Imaging results yielded insights into the spatial organization of the central respiratory rhythm generation region in the ventrolateral medulla. ^ A multifocal two-photon scanning microscope was constructed, and design and operation principles are described. Utilizing the novel device, anatomical and functional two-photon imaging via potentiometric dyes and calcium dyes is described, and the results of in vivo versus in vitro imaging are compared. Anatomical imaging results used either functional probe background fluorescence or green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Spectroscopic experiments measuring the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, Σ 2 of various fluorophores are described as well. ^ Utilizing single-beam two-photon microscopy, action potentials were recorded optically from individual (∼ 1 μm) nerve terminals of the intact mouse neurohypophysis, in a single sweep. Single-trial recordings of action potentials exhibited signal-to-noise ratios ∼ 5 and fractional fluorescence changes of up to ∼ 10 %. These results represent the first single-trial optical recording of action potentials from individual nerve terminals in an intact mammalian preparation using 180 ° detection, and may serve as an alternative to <b>invasive</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays for studying neuronal systems in vivo. ...|$|E

Micromachining technologies were established to fabricate implantable devices able to provide a man-machine interface to the nervous system in patients with degenerative diseases or amputee limbs. The present work focuses on peripheral nervous system (PNS) applications {{in the form of}} peripheral invasive neural interfaces. Even if recognized as one key component for establishing a functional electrical connection with nerves and muscles, <b>invasive</b> <b>electrodes</b> show electrical instabil-ity due to the foreign body response. Aim of this work was to investigate dierent strategies elaborated to surface-functionalize implantable polyimide sheets for PNS applications, in particular for neural interfaces based on thin lm technology (tf-LIFEs and TIMEs). Cross-linkable vinyl groups were introduced on the polyimide surface in order to obtain an increase in surface roughness and to create a substrate endowed with structure-reactivity for thiol-containing amino acids or peptides (able to promote neural migration, growth and dierentiation). Samples' surfaces, rstly characterized by means of atomic force microscopy and static contact angle mesurements, were subsequently treated with L-cysteine and Rhodamine-B conjugated cysteine and characterized using ninhydrin col-orimetric analysis, SEM microanalysis and image analysis with Matlab.

40|$|Brain-Computer {{interface}} technologies mean {{to create}} new communication channels between our mind and our environment, independent of the motor system, by detecting and classifying self regulation of local brain activity. BCIs can provide patients with severe paralysis a means to communicate and to live more independent lives. There has been a growing interest in using invasive recordings for BCI to improve the signal quality. This also potentially gives access to new control strategies previously inaccessible by non-invasive methods. However, before surgery, the best implantation site needs to be determined. The blood-oxygen-level dependent signal changes measured with fMRI {{have been shown to}} agree well spatially with those found with <b>invasive</b> <b>electrodes,</b> and are the best option for pre-surgical localization.

A group of healthy subjects were instructed to move their attention between three (two peripheral and one central) spatial target regions while keeping their gaze fixated at the center. The activated regions were first located and thereafter the subjects were given real-time feedback based on the activity in these regions. All subjects managed to regulate local brain areas without training, which suggests that visuospatial attention is a promising new target for intracranial BCI.

Six attributes with three levels each were defined and used to generate choice sets with treatment scenarios. Patients were asked to choose the scenario that they preferred most. Objectives: To determine the utility weights for treatment characteristics as well as the overall preference for the three types of neural prostheses (NP), that is Brindley, rhizotomy-free Brindley, and pudendal nerve stimulation. Earlier studies have revealed the importance of restoration of bladder function, but no studies have been performed to determine the importance of NP features. Setting: Two academic affiliated medical systems’ SCI outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation programs, Cleveland, OH. Methods: CBC analysis followed by multinomial logit modeling. Individual part-worth utilities were estimated using hierarchical Bayes. Results: Side effects had the greatest significant impact on subject choices, followed by the effectiveness on continence and voiding. NPs with rhizotomy-free sacral root stimulation were preferred (45 % first choice) over pudendal afferent nerve stimulation (39 % second choice) and sacral root stimulation with rhizotomy (53 % third choice).

40|$|The {{number of}} people in risk of {{developing}} a neurodegenerative disease increases as the life expectancy grows due to medical advances. Multiple techniques have been developed to improve patient’s condition, from pharmacological to <b>invasive</b> <b>electrodes</b> approaches, but no definite cure has yet been discovered. In this work Optical Neural Stimulation (ONS) has been studied. ONS stimulates noninvasively the outer regions of the brain, mainly the neocortex. The relationship between the stimulation parameters and the therapeutic response is not totally clear. In order to find optimal ONS parameters to treat a particular neurodegenerative disease, mathematical modeling is necessary. Neural networks models have been employed to study the neural spiking activity change induced by ONS. Healthy and pathological neocortical networks have been considered to study the required stimulation to restore the normal activity. The network consisted of a group of interconnected neurons, which were assigned 2 D spatial coordinates. The optical stimulation spatial profile was assumed to be Gaussian. The stimulation effects were modeled as synaptic current increases in the affected neurons, proportional to the stimulation fluence. Pathological networks were defined as the healthy ones with some neurons being inactivated, which presented no synaptic conductance. Neurons’ electrical activity was also studied in the frequency domain, focusing specially on the changes of the spectral bands corresponding to brain waves. The complete model could be used to determine the optimal ONS parameters in order to achieve the specific neural spiking patterns or the required local neural activity increase to treat particular neurodegenerative pathologies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Irreversible {{electroporation}} (IRE) is {{a promising}} technique for the focal treatment of pathologic tissues, which involves placing minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>electrodes</b> within the targeted region. However, the {{knowledge about the}} therapeutic efficacy and immune reactions in response to IRE remains in its infancy. METHODS: In this work, to detect whether tumor ablation with IRE could trigger the immunologic response, we developed an osteosarcoma rat model and applied IRE directly to ablate the tumor. In the experiment, 118 SD rats were randomized into 4 groups: the control, sham operation, surgical resection, and IRE groups. Another 28 rats without tumor cell implantation served as the normal non-tumor-bearing group. We analyzed the changes in T lymphocyte subsets, sIL- 2 R and IL- 10 levels in the peripheral blood one day before operation, {{as well as at}} 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after the operation. Moreover, splenocytes were assayed for IFN-γ and IL- 4 production using intracellular cytokine staining one day before the operation, as well as at 7 and 21 days after operation. RESULTS: We found that direct IRE completely ablated the tumor cells. A significant increase in peripheral lymphocytes, especially CD 3 (+) and CD 4 (+) cells, as well as an increased ratio of CD 4 (+) /CD 8 (+) were detectable 7 days after operation in both the IRE and surgical resection groups. Compared with the surgical resection group, the IRE group exhibited a stronger cellular immune response. The sIL- 2 R level of the peripheral blood in the IRE group decreased with time and was significantly different from that in the surgical resection group. Moreover, ablation with IRE significantly increased the percentage of IFN-γ-positive splenocytes. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that IRE could not only locally destroy the tumor but also change the status of cellular immunity in osteosarcoma-bearing rats. This provides experimental evidence for the clinical application of IRE in osteosarcoma treatment...|$|R

A new R-peak detection algorithm based on the Discrete-Time Continuous Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) is proposed as a first step in reducing the overall computational complexity of [1], while increasing detection quality of the maternal R-peak detection...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{millimeter}} {{waves are}} being employed for telecomm, radar, and imaging applications. To {{date in the}} U. S, however, very few investigations {{on the impact of}} this radiation on biological systems at the cellular level have been undertaken. In the beginning, to examine the impact of millimeter waves on cellular processes, researchers discovered that cell membrane depolarization may be triggered by low levels of integrated power at these high frequencies. Such a situation could be used to advantage in the direct stimulation of neuronal cells for applications in neuroprosthetics and diagnosing or treating neurological disorders. An experimental system was set up to directly monitor cell response on exposure to continuous-wave, fixed-frequency, millimeter-wave radiation at low and modest power levels (0. 1 to 100 safe exposure standards) between 50 and 100 GHz. Two immortalized cell lines derived from lung and neuronal tissue were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) that locates {{on the inside of the}} cell membrane lipid bi-layer. Oxonol dye was added to the cell medium. When membrane depolarization occurs, the oxonal bound to the outer wall of the lipid bi-layer can penetrate close to the inner wall where the GFP resides. Under fluorescent excitation (488 nm), the normally green GFP (520 nm) optical signal quenches and gives rise to a red output when the oxonol comes close enough to the GFP to excite a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with an output at 620 nm. The presence of a strong FRET signature upon exposures of 30 seconds to 2 minutes at 5 - 10 milliwatts per square centimeter RF power at 50 GHz, followed by a return to the normal 520 -nm GFP signal after a few minutes indicating repolarization of the membrane, indicates that low levels of RF energy may be able to trigger non-destructive membrane depolarization without direct cell contact. Such a mechanism could be used to stimulate neuronal cells in the cortex without the need for <b>invasive</b> <b>electrodes</b> as millimeter waves penetrate skin and bone on the order of 15 mm in depth. Although 50 GHz could not readily penetrate from the outer skull to the center of the cortex, implants on the outer skull or even on the scalp could reach the outer layer of the cerebral cortex where substantial benefit could be realized from such non-contact type excitation...|$|R
40|$|We {{tried to}} {{investigate}} the incidence and the clinical profile of intractable epilepsy with hippocampal atrophy and ictal onset zones located in areas other than the hippocampus (extra-medial-temporal epilepsy; EMTE). We included patients who had hippocampal atrophy confirmed by MRI but with extra-medial-temporal ictal onset zones as verified by <b>invasive</b> intracranial <b>electrodes</b> or video-EEG monitoring. The case histories, interictal EEG, ictal semiology, other MRI findings in addition to hippocampal atrophy, and results of ictal SPECT and PET scans were evaluated. Results were {{compared with those of}} surgically proven medial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal atrophy recruited during the same period. 8. 5 % of the intractable epilepsy patients with hippocampal atrophy had extra-medial temporal epileptogenic zones. A history of encephalitis and hemiconvulsion-hemiparesis were significantly common in the EMTE group. Most of the interictal EEGs of EMTE patients showed extratemporal irritative zones. MRI, ictal SPECT, and FDG-PET seemed to be helpful at localizing the true epileptogenic zones. The predominant EMTE seizure type was focal motor seizure with secondary generalization. Some portion of intractable epilepsy patients with hippocampal atrophy had extra-medial-temporal epileptogenic foci and careful analysis of semiology and neuroimagings could yield clues to correct diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fetal {{heart rate}} (FHR) {{monitoring}} {{is currently the}} primary methodology for antenatal determination of fetal well-being. Currently, the FHR can be detected with ultrasonography, but the additional information from fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) is only available via an <b>invasive</b> scalp <b>electrode.</b> A cost effective noninvasive monitoring through standard ECG electrodes could be used on nearly every patient {{in lieu of the}} ultrasound monitors. In this method, a number of electrodes are positioned on the abdomen of the mother to collect, simultaneously, various combinations of the signals including the heartbeats of the mother and the fetus. For accurate fetal heart-rate estimation, a clean FECG must be extracted from the collected mixtures. It is well known that this can be achieved using blind source separation (BSS) techniques. In this paper, the performance of the Mermaid algorithm, which is based on minimizing Renyi’s mutual information, is evaluated on this problem of great practical importance. The effectiveness and data efficiency of Mermaid and its superiority over alternative information theoretic BSS algorithms are illustrated using artificially mixed ECG signals as well as fetal heart rate estimates in real ECG mixtures...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} studies have been {{conducted}} {{over the past two decades}} to determine if decreased optic nerve blood flow has a role in the etiology of glaucomatous nerve damage. Five basic methods have been employed in examining blood flow. <b>Invasive</b> studies, utilizing <b>electrodes</b> placed in the optic nerve head, represent one of the first attempts to measure blood flow. More recently, the methodologies have included axoplasmic flow analysis, microspheres, radioactive tracers such as iodoantipyrine, and laser doppler measurements. The results of these studies are inconclusive and frequently contradictory. When the studies are grouped by methodology, only the iodoantipyrine data are consistent. While each of the experimental techniques has limitations, iodoantipyrine appears to have better resolution than either invasive studies or microspheres...|$|R
40|$|Vagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) is {{a treatment for}} refractory epilepsy and depression. Previous studies using <b>invasive</b> recording <b>electrodes</b> showed that VNS induces laryngeal motor-evoked potentials (LMEPs) through the co-activation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and subsequent contractions of the laryngeal muscles. The present study investigates the feasibility of recording LMEPs in chronically VNS-implanted rats, using a minimally-invasive technique, to assess effective current delivery to the nerve and to determine optimal VNS output currents for vagal fiber activation. Three weeks after VNS electrode implantation, signals were recorded using an electromyography (EMG) electrode in {{the proximity of the}} laryngeal muscles and a reference electrode on the skull. The VNS output current was gradually ramped up from 0. 1 to 1. 0 mA in 0. 1 mA steps. In 13 / 27 rats, typical LMEPs were recorded at low VNS output currents (median 0. 3 mA, IQR 0. 2 - 0. 3 mA). In 11 / 27 rats, significantly higher output currents were required to evoke electrophysiological responses (median 0. 7 mA, IQR 0. 5 - 0. 7 mA, p < 0. 001). The latencies of these responses deviated significantly from LMEPs (p < 0. 05). In 3 / 27 rats, no electrophysiological responses to simulation were recorded. Minimally invasive LMEP recordings are feasible to assess effective current delivery to the vagus nerve. Furthermore, our results suggest that low output currents are sufficient to activate vagal fibers...|$|R
40|$|Phantom limb pain (PLP) {{is a type}} of neuropathic pain {{syndrome}} {{that has}} evoked much interest in scientific and clinical fields. The condition is often intractable and severely debilitating. Though there are anecdotal reports in the literature of successful management of individual cases with brain and spinal cord stimulation, it has not been possible to develop a system of management that is consistently successful, mainly due to the paucity of basic neurophysiological data about PLP and its pathways in the central nervous system (CNS). Functional imaging offers a way of collecting information about the basic mechanisms and pathways of PLP from patients without the excessive risk of more <b>invasive</b> penetrating <b>electrode</b> studies or the questionable reliability of animal data. There have been very few studies that have looked at the direct effect of CNS stimulation on regional brain activation and correlation with the pain state. We describe two cases of PLP that have been satisfactorily treated with CNS stimulation (motor cortex and then periventricular gray in one and spinal cord in the other) and have been subjected to single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies when in pain and then during stimulation with recorded pain relief. We found that regardless of the site of stimulation in the CNS, pain relief is associated with blood flow changes in similar areas of the brain, mainly the parietal and cingulate cortex and also in the thalamic nuclei and the central gray matter. Further studies of this kind should reveal more about the complex mechanisms of PLP and other forms of neuropathic pain...|$|R

Purpose. To evaluate the clinical utility of dense array electroencephalography (dEEG) for detecting and localizing interictal spikes in temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods. Simultaneous invasive and noninvasive recordings were performed across two different groups. (1) The first group underwent both noninvasive recording with 128 channels of (scalp) dEEG and <b>invasive</b> sphenoidal <b>electrode</b> recording. (2) The second group underwent both noninvasive recording with 256 channels of (scalp) dEEG and invasive intracranial EEG (icEEG) involving coverage with grids and strips over the lateral and mesial temporal lobe. A noninvasive to noninvasive comparison was made comparing the overall spike detection rate of the dEEG to that of conventional 10 / 20 EEG. A noninvasive to invasive comparison was made comparing the spike detection rate of dEEG to that of conventional 10 / 20 EEG plus sphenoidal electrodes. And finally, a noninvasive to invasive evaluation measuring the source localization ability of the dEEG using the icEEG as validation. Results. In the 128 -channel dEEG study (1), 90. 4 % of the interictal spikes detected by the dEEG were not detected in the 10 / 20 montage. 91 % of the dEEG-detected spikes were accurately localized to the medial temporal lobe. In the 256 -channel dEEG study (2), 218 of 519 interictal spikes (42 %) were detected by dEEG. 85 % of these spikes were accuratel...|$|R
