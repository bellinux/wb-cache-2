500|$|The {{film was}} shot in bright, primary colors rather than the {{black-and-white}} of the director's previous features, but it retained his usual languid pacing. Jarmusch characterized the color choice as [...] "intuitive". He deliberately chose a cool color palette, eschewing yellows and oranges and using only sporadic dashes of red (as in the Japanese couple's ubiquitous suitcase). This motif of flashes of red was later described by Suzanne Scott of Reverse Shot as [...] "giving {{the impression of a}} failed attempt to grab a bit of Elvis’s glamor and try <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> size, only to inevitably discover that it looks cartoonish out of context". Stills from the film as well as on-location shots of the actors and the film crew by photographer Masayoshi Sukita were published to accompany the film as the photo collection Mystery Train: A Film by Jim Jarmusch.|$|E
500|$|... "Pride & Joy" [...] was {{launched}} in 2003 {{as a part of}} Marvel's Tsunami imprint, the goal of which was to attract new readers, particularly young readers and the manga audience. Marvel editorial staff agreed to it immediately, prompting Wizard Magazine to name the series as [...] "one of the best original concept from Marvel in thirty years." [...] The imprint was unsuccessful, and [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] (and the series Runaways that continued it) was {{one of the very few}} series from that imprint to continue being published and to do well in sales. Writer Brian K. Vaughan has claimed that he had only planned to create [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] to be set for six months (six issues), but because of the popularity of the series and new ideas from Vaughan, Marvel decided to continue issuing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a monthly basis. The character of Catherine Wilder was originally designed to look like singer-songwriter Sade.|$|E
500|$|Mao's father, Mao Yichang, {{had been}} born in Shaoshanchong to a family of poverty before {{undergoing}} an arranged marriage to Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, when he was fifteen years old. While Yichang had received two years of schooling and could read and write, conversely Qimei was illiterate. Serving for several years in the regional Xiang Army, Yichang saved up his wages and on leaving the army used these to pay off his family's debts and purchase the lands that his father had sold. By the time of Zedong's birth, Yichang owned two-and-a-half acres of rice paddy, which would have been considered a substantial amount {{by the standards of the}} region. Through frugal living and hard work, over the coming years he was able to purchase a further acre and employ two farm laborers, with his farm encompassing a cow shed, a grain storage hut, a pigsty, and a small mill. Expanding the family's wealth, Yichang purchased mortgages on other peasants' land, thus becoming their landlord, while also purchasing the grain from the poorest farmers in the village before selling <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a profit at the county seat of Xiangtan. In doing so, he amassed a fortune of two to three thousand Chinese silver dollars at a time when the majority of China's peasantry continued to live in poverty. This being the case, Mao biographer Philip Short could assert that the Mao family were [...] "comfortably off" [...] by the standards of the period.|$|E

2500|$|To {{help with}} cradle cap, parents can gently massage their baby's scalp with their fingers or a soft brush {{to loosen the}} scales. They may want to shampoo the baby's hair more {{frequently}} (no {{more than once a}} day), and after shampooing gently brush the baby's scalp with a soft brush or a terrycloth towel. Oil remedies can be used by rubbing a small amount of pure, plant-derived oil (coconut oil, pure olive oil, almond oil) on the baby's scalp and leaving <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, gently comb out the flakes with a fine tooth comb or brush. Be sure to wash out all of the oil to avoid making the cradle cap worse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first three}} verses {{of the song}} depict a {{different}} character, each seemingly at a spiritual malaise {{in their attempts to}} attain wealth or advance their position. In the opening verse, Harrison sings of a man preoccupied with his financial losses on the stock market. The next character is a speculator who intends to purchase [...] "the promised land" [...] with his South African Krugerrand, and then develop and sell <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a profit. In the third verse, a film actor aspires to achieve stardom in the form of [...] "a shining city on a hill", yet the starring roles he seeks merely bury his sense of individuality. According to theologian Dale Allison, the lyrics suggest that Harrison pities the first of these three individuals yet has only contempt for the speculator.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, {{and we are going to}} keep the pressure on and keep <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
