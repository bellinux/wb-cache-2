500|$|... "Red House" [...] is a {{moderately}} slow blues, which music writers Tom Wheeler and Joe Gore describe as having [...] "the twelve-bar structure, the lyrics, the accompaniment, and the arrangement [...] {{are more or}} less conventional". [...] The song is notated in 12/8 time in the key of B with a tempo of 66 beats per minute (although Hendrix <b>fingered</b> <b>the</b> song in the key of B, he usually tuned his guitar one-half step and sometimes one step lower, resulting in a lower pitch). [...] The song opens with a diminished seventh chord frequently found in blues songs, including the intros to the Robert Johnson songs [...] "Dead Shrimp Blues", [...] "Kind Hearted Woman", and [...] "32-20 Blues". [...] After the four-bar intro, Redding and Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell come in while Hendrix solos up to the vocal at bar thirteen. [...] After two twelve-bar vocal sections, Hendrix solos for twelve bars, then finishes up with another vocal section.|$|E
2500|$|Brig. Gen. Donald Harvel, board {{president}} of the first investigation into the crash, <b>fingered</b> <b>the</b> [...] "unidentified contrails" [...] during the last 17 seconds of flight as indications of engine troubles. [...] Harvel has become {{a critic of the}} aircraft since his retirement and states that his retirement was placed on hold for two years in order to silence him from speaking publicly about his concerns about the aircraft's safety. [...] The actual causes of the crash may never be known because US military aircraft destroyed the wreckage and black box recorder. [...] Former USAF chief V-22 systems engineer Eric Braganca stated that the V-22's engines normally emit puffs of smoke and the data recorders showed that the engines were operating normally at that time.|$|E
2500|$|On June 17, Nixon's Plumbers {{were caught}} burglarizing the DNC {{offices in the}} Watergate. On June 23, DCI Helms was ordered by the White House to wave the FBI off using {{national}} security as a pretext. The new DCI, Walters, another Nixon hack, called the {{acting director of the}} FBI and told him to drop the investigation as ordered. On June 26, Nixon's counsel John Dean ordered DCI Walters to pay the plumbers untraceable hush money. The CIA was {{the only part of the}} government that had the power to make off the book payments, but it could only be done on the orders of the CI, or, if he was out of the country, the DCI. The Acting Director of the FBI started breaking ranks. He demanded the CIA produce a signed document attesting to the national security threat of the investigation. Jim McCord's lawyer contacted the CIA informing them that McCord had been offered a Presidential pardon if he <b>fingered</b> <b>the</b> CIA, testifying that the break-in had been an operation of the CIA. Nixon had long been frustrated by what he saw as a liberal infection inside the CIA, and had been trying for years to tear the CIA out by its roots. McCord wrote [...] "If [...] Helms goes (takes the fall) and the Watergate operation is laid at the CIA's feet, where it does not belong, every tree in the forest will fall. It will be a scorched desert." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{arms were}} short and stout with very large hands. There were no skin folds on the wrists, though a {{scalloped}} fringe of skin was present from the elbows to {{just below the}} discs on <b>the</b> fourth <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> were all relatively short with large flattened discs on the tips. The discs on the second, third, and fourth <b>fingers</b> were about <b>the</b> same diameter as the tympana. Small protrusions known as tubercles were present {{on the underside of}} the hands. On <b>the</b> first <b>finger,</b> <b>the</b> tubercles on the tipmost joints were elliptical in shape. On the second and third <b>fingers,</b> <b>the</b> tubercles below <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> joints (subarticular tubercles) were smaller than that on <b>the</b> fourth <b>fingers.</b> Therewere no tubercles on the palms of the hands though elongated flat tubercles were present behind the bases of <b>the</b> inner <b>fingers</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "thumbs"). Numerous small and round tubercles were also present in between the joints of <b>the</b> <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> were more or less fully webbed.|$|R

50|$|A second {{common cause}} of negligent {{discharges}} is when the gun-handler places their <b>finger</b> on <b>the</b> trigger before they have decided to shoot. With <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> so positioned, many activities may cause <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> to compress <b>the</b> trigger unintentionally. For example, if one attempts to holster <b>the</b> firearm with <b>finger</b> on trigger, <b>the</b> holster edge will drive <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> onto <b>the</b> trigger, and discharge is likely. If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with <b>finger</b> on trigger, <b>the</b> grasping motion of both hands will likely cause <b>the</b> trigger <b>finger</b> to compress <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R
40|$|In a robot {{having a}} gripper {{including}} {{a pair of}} fingers and a drive motor for driving <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> toward and away from one another while <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> remain parallel to each other, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> consist of finger pads, which interface with a handle on an object to be grasped, and a shank, which attaches <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> to <b>the</b> robot gripper. <b>The</b> double-V <b>finger</b> has two orthogonal V-grooves forming {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pads and recessed cruciform. <b>The</b> double-V <b>finger</b> is used with a handle on the object to be grasped which is the negative of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pads. <b>The</b> handle face consists of V-shaped pads capped with a rectangular cruciform.

If <b>the</b> index <b>finger</b> of <b>the</b> right hand is pointed forward, <b>the</b> middle <b>finger</b> bent inward at a right angle to it, and the thumb placed at a right angle to both, <b>the</b> three <b>fingers</b> indicate <b>the</b> relative directions of the x-, y-, and z-axes in a right-handed system.

40|$|Viscous fingers {{have been}} {{produced}} in the lifting Hele-Shaw cell (LHSC), with concentric circular grooves etched onto the lower plate. The invading fluid (air) enters the defending newtonian fluid-olive oil, as fingers proceeding radially inwards towards <b>the</b> centre. <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> are interrupted at the circular groove, and reform as secondary <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> effect of the grooves is to speed up <b>the</b> <b>fingering</b> process considerably and <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> now reach <b>the</b> centre much faster. We explain this by comparing the variation with time, in velocity of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> in <b>the</b> normal LHSC and the grooved cells. In the normal lifting HS cell <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> move fastest on initial formation and slow down later. Since in case of the grooved plate, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> reform and receive a boost in their speed each time they encounter a groove, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> proceed to <b>the</b> centre faster.
