5|$|A {{period of}} {{increasing}} trouble and decline {{began with the}} reign of Commodus. Commodus' assassination in 192 triggered the Year of the Five Emperors, of which Septimius Severus emerged victorious. The assassination of Alexander Severus in 235 led to the Crisis of the Third Century in which 26 men were declared emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty-year time span. It {{was not until the}} reign of Diocletian that the <b>empire</b> was fully stabilized with the introduction of the Tetrarchy, which saw four emperors rule the <b>empire</b> at once. This arrangement was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to a civil war that was finally ended by Constantine the Great, who defeated his rivals and became the sole ruler of the <b>empire</b> in 324. Constantine subsequently established a second capital city in Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople. It remained the capital of the east until its demise. Constantine also adopted Christianity which later became the official state religion of the <b>empire.</b> Following the death of Theodosius I in 395, the <b>empire</b> was permanently divided between the West and the East. The dominion of the Western Roman <b>Empire</b> was gradually eroded by abuses of power, civil wars, barbarian migrations and invasions, military reforms and economic depression. The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths and again in 455 by the Vandals accelerated the Western Empire's decay, while the deposition of the emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 by Odoacer, is generally accepted to mark the end of the <b>empire</b> in the west. However, Augustulus was never recognized by his Eastern colleague, and separate rule in the Western part of the <b>empire</b> only ceased to exist upon the death of Julius Nepos, in 480. The Eastern Roman <b>Empire</b> (in modern historiography called the Byzantine <b>Empire)</b> endured for another millennium as one of the leading powers in the world alongside its arch-rival the Sassanid <b>Empire,</b> which had inherited a centuries-old Roman-Persian conflict from its predecessor the Parthians. It eventually fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman <b>Empire,</b> the Byzantine <b>Empire</b> was the sole {{successor}} of the Roman <b>Empire.</b> Charlemagne's imperial coronation in 800 put strain on Western relations with the Byzantine <b>Empire</b> ruled from Constantinople. When Otto I became emperor in February 962, there was contention between him and the Byzantine <b>Empire,</b> and this issue revived in 967 between Otto and Nikephoros II Phokas over the dominion of Italy. On 25 December 967, Pope John XIII anointed Otto II as Otto I's co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Baltimore, <b>Empire</b> Simba headed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to take on another load of scrap iron for the UK. After making her way to Halifax by early February, she sailed on 9 February {{as a part of}} Convoy HX-108, but dropped out and joined up with Convoy SC-22, a slower convoy that had left Halifax a day earlier. Off the Northern Ireland coast, the convoy escorts broke off and <b>Empire</b> Simba and three other ships sailed into the Irish Sea. Headed to her {{destination}} of Port Talbot, <b>Empire</b> Simba was {{at the back of the}} line of the four ships. At 1300 hrs on 1 March, a Heinkel He 111 bomber of Kampfgeschwader 27, Luftwaffe attacked the column, and had a near miss on <b>Empire</b> Simba. The force of the explosion shattered the main water injection pipe in the engine room, flooding her engine room and leaving the ship dead in the water. The German bomber, with smoke trailing from it after being hit by bullets from one of <b>Empire</b> Simbas two Hotchkiss Mark I machine guns, headed off for Ireland. There were no towing vessels immediately available for <b>Empire</b> Simba, so as darkness approached, <b>Empire</b> Simbas crew abandoned the ship for the escorting trawler. Taking the ship's two machine guns, the chronometer, and some personal belongings, the crew were landed at Milford Haven. <b>Empire</b> Simba was saved and towed into Birkenhead, where the officers rejoined with their erstwhile ship. During an overnight bombing raid on the night of 12/13 March, German bombers parachuted land mines on Birkenhead. One landed on <b>Empire</b> Simba and exploded, causing significant damage to the ship.|$|E

30|$|All <b>empires</b> try to {{take the}} {{possession}} of colonies of other <b>empires</b> and control them. The imperialistic competition gradually brings about a decrease in the power of weaker <b>empires</b> and an increase in the power of more powerful ones. This competition is modelled by just picking some (usually one) of the weakest colonies of the weakest <b>empires</b> and making a competition among all <b>empires</b> to possess this colonies.|$|R

5|$|By mid-August 1941, <b>Empire</b> Simba, with a {{completely}} new crew, had been repaired enough to set out in a Liverpool – Freetown convoy, but evidently returned to Liverpool the same day. After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, <b>Empire</b> Simba {{had to return to}} port with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to collide with another convoy ship, <b>Empire</b> Scott, and on 1 August <b>Empire</b> Simba straggled and dropped out of the convoy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} both sides had exhausted their human and material resources. Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war. The Muslim forces swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian <b>Empire</b> and deprived the Byzantine <b>Empire</b> of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and North Africa. Over the following centuries, half the Byzantine <b>Empire</b> and the entire Sasanian <b>Empire</b> came under Muslim rule.|$|E

5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in the <b>empire,</b> was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} of the <b>Empire</b> was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the <b>Empire</b> around Italy and Rome but other parts of the <b>Empire</b> were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The <b>Empire</b> in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman <b>Empire</b> and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.|$|E
5|$|Constantine the Great {{effectively}} {{became the}} emperor {{of the whole}} of the Roman <b>Empire</b> in September 324. Two months later, he laid out the plans for a new, Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the <b>empire,</b> the city was named Nova Roma; most called it Constantinople, a name that persisted into the 20th century. On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the Roman <b>Empire,</b> which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) <b>Empire.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1828 {{with the}} Treaty of Turkmenchay to the October Revolution in 1917, Eastern Armenia {{was part of}} the Russian <b>Empire</b> and partly {{confined}} to the borders of the Erivan Governorate. After the October Revolution, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin's government announced that minorities in the <b>empire</b> could pursue a course of self-determination. Following the collapse of the <b>empire,</b> in May 1918 Armenia, and its neighbors Azerbaijan and Georgia, declared their independence from Russian rule and each established their respective republics. After the near-annihilation of the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide and the subsequent Turkish-Armenian War, the historic Armenian area in the Ottoman <b>Empire</b> was overrun with despair and devastation.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{knowledge}} about Sogdia is somewhat hazy {{during the period}} of the Parthian <b>Empire</b> (247 BC – 224 AD) in Persia. The subsequent Sasanian <b>Empire</b> of Persia conquered and incorporated Sogdia as a satrapy in 260, an inscription dating to the reign of Shapur I noting that its limits formed the northeastern Sasanian borderlands with the Kushan <b>Empire.</b> However, by the 5th century the region was captured by the rival Hephthalite <b>Empire.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1204 the Byzantine {{capital of}} Constantinople was sacked and {{occupied}} by the Fourth Crusaders, an important moment of the Christian East–West Schism. The Byzantine <b>Empire,</b> already weakened by misrule, was left divided and in chaos. Taking advantage of the situation, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum began seizing territory in Western Asia Minor, until the Nicaean <b>Empire</b> was able to repulse the Seljuk Turks from the remaining territories still under Roman rule. Eventually Constantinople was re-taken from the Latin <b>Empire</b> in 1261 by the Nicaean <b>Empire.</b> However {{the position of the}} Byzantine <b>Empire</b> in the European continent remained uncertain due to the presence of the rival kingdoms of the Despotate of Epirus, Serbia and the Second Bulgarian <b>Empire.</b> This, combined with the reduced power of the Sultanate of Rum (Byzantium's chief rival in Asia) led to the removal of troops from Asia Minor to maintain Byzantium's grip on Thrace. However the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum was by no means a blessing to the <b>Empire</b> as nobles known as ghazis began setting up their fiefdoms, {{at the expense of the}} Byzantine <b>Empire.</b> While many Turkish beys participated in the conquest of Byzantine and Seljuk territory, the territories under the control of one such Bey named Osman I posed the greatest threat to Nicaea and to Constantinople.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhile {{economic}} {{historians have}} {{stressed the importance}} of price competition in the protection market, theorists of conflictual activity have argued against the extrapolation of this form of competition in the protection market and favored competition through the quantity of conflictual effort. We purport to show the relevance of price competition in the protection market by focusing on the competition between <b>empires.</b> By distinguishing absolute and differential protection rents, we first define coercive rivalry and price competition among <b>empires</b> and then establish three types of <b>empires,</b> namely early <b>empires</b> of domination, territorial <b>empires</b> and merchant <b>empires.</b> <b>Empires</b> are structured on the basis of two types of hierarchies: "top-down" and "bottom-up" that determine their protection costs. We systematically study the impact of asymmetrical protection costs on price competition in the light of Bertrand equilibria. We provide an economic rationale for the use of violence throughout history in conformity with the findings of economic historians...|$|R
