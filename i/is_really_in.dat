5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{convenient}} site {{is often the}} arm, especially the veins {{on the back of}} the hand, or the median cubital vein at the elbow, but any identifiable vein can be used. Often it is necessary to use a tourniquet which restricts the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge. Once the needle is in place, it is common to draw back slightly on the syringe to aspirate blood, thus verifying that the needle <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> a vein. The tourniquet should be removed before injecting to prevent extravasation of the medication.|$|E
25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young people look forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her wonder at the change in her life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if she <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> love – with a complete stranger. Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This will also help him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds and he looks forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E

500|$|... "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna before the Hard Candy project started. The song {{has a sense of}} mystery and starts off softly and slowly with a piano introduction. It then becomes fast and melancholy, with Madonna singing: [...] "Your eyes are full of surprises/ They cannot predict my fate". The trip hop {{inspired}} [...] "Voices" [...] is the last track of the album, consisting of unresolved chords and sweeping strings, as the lyrics question who <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> control: [...] "Are you walking the dog?/ Is the dog walking you?" ...|$|E
500|$|Downes, who voices the Master Chief, is a {{disc jockey}} and voice actor {{who had never}} played video games before Halo. Downes' only {{previous}} experience with video game voice work was a small part for [...] During production of Halo, Martin O'Donnell, Bungie's music director, recommended Downes for {{the part of the}} Chief based on his experience working on Septerra. Downes never interviewed for the part, describing his acceptance as [...] "a phone call". For years Downes never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events and believed that the Master Chief is left masked because [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the eye of the player".|$|E
500|$|Also at WonderCon, {{a poster}} {{based on the}} season was made available, with art by Mike McKone. It {{features}} Johnson, her pose an homage to a well-known Secret Warriors cover depicting the comic version of the character, with other main characters paired behind her (Coulson and Price, the latter because [...] "she really {{was a big part}} of the first half of the season and...her death is the thing [...] drives Coulson", according to Bell; Fitz and Simmons; Hunter and Morse; May and Garner / Lash; and Mack and Elena Rodriguez). Lincoln is featured on his own, so as not to [...] "take a super strong female character [...] and reduce her to being a part of a relationship where she won't be fulfilled until she finds her man", as are Ward / Hive and Malick, the latter with the symbol of the former upon him: [...] "We have told you who Ward's become, and Hive is the person that Malick <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> a relationship with. So the fact that reflection is on him or in him or around him is pretty potent," [...] explained Bell.|$|E

2500|$|In the Cold War {{submarine}} film Crimson Tide, in {{a moment}} of crisis, the USS Alabama executive officer (played by Denzel Washington) gives a pep talk to his young radioman, urging him to repair the ship's radio by referring to Kirk's telling Scotty they need [...] "more power". The Trek fandom of Noel, a recurring character on the sitcom Frasier, plays a role in several episodes, including [...] "Star Mitzvah," [...] in which he deceives Frasier into believing a speech is written in Hebrew when it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the Klingon language.|$|E
2500|$|Remington Steele's {{premise is}} that Laura Holt, a {{licensed}} private detective played by Stephanie Zimbalist, opened a detective agency under her own name but found potential clients refused to hire a woman, no matter how qualified. To solve the problem, Laura invents a fictitious male superior she names Remington Steele. Through {{a series of events}} in the first episode, [...] "License to Steele," [...] Pierce Brosnan's character, a former thief and con man (whose real name even he proves not to know, and is never revealed), assumes the identity of Remington Steele. Behind the scenes, a power struggle ensues between Laura and Steele as to who <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> charge, while the two carry on a casual romantic relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Indigenous rights {{organization}} Survival International has raised concerns that some measures {{to mitigate the}} problem of climate change affect the survival of tribal people as much as climate change. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has expressed similar concerns. Stephen Corry, director of Survival International, explains that [...] "projects that victimise the people and harm the environment cannot be promoted or marketed as green projects". Survival International calls {{attention to the fact}} that these people, who least contribute to the problem of climate change, are already the most affected by it; and that we must seek solutions that involve indigenous people. Andrew E. Miller, human rights campaigner at Amazon Watch, said, [...] "Many indigenous peoples, understandably, are skeptical that the latest silver bullet <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> their interest. In fact, serious concerns have arisen that implementation of REDD [...] could counteract fundamental indigenous rights, in the same way that countless conservation schemes have limited local subsistence activities and led to displacement around the world." [...] Similar criticism came out of the climate justice network Climate Justice Now!.|$|E
