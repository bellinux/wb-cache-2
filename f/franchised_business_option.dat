40|$|<b>Franchise</b> <b>businesses</b> {{are popular}} both in {{practice}} and, as a result, in academic study. In particular, much {{research has been}} devoted to <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> survivability. This thesis discovers and examines key determinants that have influences on <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> survivability in Indonesian <b>franchise</b> <b>businesses</b> in the restaurant and retail sectors. This research produces a <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> survivability model that is based on previous research and theories. The researcher performs confirmatory factor analysis structural equation modelling (CFA-SEM) to test and analyse the relationships between the five key determinants which are: trust; commitment; dispute risk management; relationship satisfaction; and <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> survivability. Based on the empirical analysis, the research reveals that trust and commitment as key determinants do not have significant influences on relationship satisfaction. The other key determinant, dispute risk management, has a significant influence on relationship satisfaction. This research also reveals that relationship satisfaction has significant influence on <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> survivability. This study made a contribution to knowledge by building a salient model of key determinants to enhance business survivability within the context of Indonesian <b>franchise</b> <b>businesses</b> in the restaurant and retail sectors. Furthermore, this thesis also closes some gaps in previous research into <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> survivability. Another unique contribution made by this research is that the author looked at the issue of survivability from both perspectives of franchisors and franchisees, whilst previous research has predominantly performed analysis from the perspective of only one of the partners in <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> arrangements. Therefore, it provides a holistic analysis on key determinants that have influences in enhancing <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> survivability in the Indonesian restaurant and retail sectors...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there are}} more than 150 local and {{international}} <b>franchise</b> <b>businesses</b> operating in Jordan. <b>Franchise</b> <b>business</b> in Jordan has been a crucial investment market contributing to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and developing its economic growth and trade. Nevertheless, legal challenges to the investors which have existed may hinder them from opening up a <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> in Jordan. One of these challenges is the lack of specific legal framework regulating <b>franchise</b> <b>business.</b> Jordanian legal system does not have specific legislation to regulate the franchise agreement (which is known as the “license agreement” in Jordan) between a franchiser and a franchisee. The lack of specific legislation may deter or at least slow down the progress of foreign and local investors in setting up <b>franchise</b> <b>businesses</b> in Jordan, as they could not reasonably anticipate the relevant laws and regulatory enforcement s relating to franchise. Therefore, this paper examines the current laws and regulations governing <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> in Jordan. The paper concludes that existing laws affecting franchise in Jordan fail to address comprehensively the legal aspects of franchise. Thus, there is a dire need for specific legal framework to govern <b>franchise</b> <b>business</b> in Jordan...|$|R
