5|$|On January 17, 2013, Keef was sued by Washington, D.C.-based {{promotion}} company Team Major for $75,000 for {{a missed}} show. According to the firm, Keef {{was supposed to}} perform at the IndigO2 Arena in London on December 29, 2012 but never showed. Neither Keef nor his label has given any kind of response {{as to why he}} missed the date. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> lawsuit and the court sided with Team Major, ordering Keef to pay $230,019 to Team Major by default.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur gave {{immunity}} to Shiro Ishii {{and other members}} of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including Princes Chichibu, Asaka, Takeda, Higashikuni and Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary. In doing so, <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.|$|E

5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the king's meaning, but Prince Ludwig did not show by any change of {{expression}} that the shot had struck him in a vulnerable spot; nor, upon the other hand, did <b>he</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> insinuation. There was only sorrow in his voice when he replied.|$|R

50|$|The {{management}} task {{is slowly}} taking over Christoffer's time and life, {{and as a}} consequence, <b>he</b> <b>ignores</b> <b>the</b> needs of himself and his wife.

5|$|Madhoji Bhonsle, {{also known}} as Appa Saheb, {{consolidated}} his power in Nagpur after {{the murder of his}} cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1915, Mackay was {{involved}} in the Battle of Lone Pine. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> first Turkish trench, taking a direct line to his objective. Firing from the hip, he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible {{for the rest of the}} party to join Mackay. The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack. When Lieutenant Jack Massie was sent to relieve Mackay during the night, Mackay refused to leave the post.|$|E
25|$|However, Peter's legal {{advocacy}} {{had suffered}} a comprehensive defeat, with serious consequences for his reputation. He returned to England. In his later accounts of the issue, <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> political and economic issues, portraying it entirely as a failed attempt to remedy the moral abuses of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter.|$|E

25|$|Tadić invoked his {{constitutional}} powers of Commander-in-Chief of the Military of Serbia and dismissed the Chief of the General Staff Zdravko Ponoš on 30 December 2008. Ponoš made public accusations against the Defence Minister Dragan Šutanovac in the media. It was {{also revealed that}} <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> minister and has not submitted a single report in a year.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} {{commander}} of the garrison of Tartu. He learned Estonian and showed great tolerance for Estonian nationalism when in autumn 1990 <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> orders (as {{commander of the}} garrison of Tartu, for some reason) {{to shut down the}} Estonian television and parliament. In 1990, his air division was withdrawn from Estonia and Dudayev resigned from the Soviet military.|$|E
25|$|From 18 July to 28 August 1940, {{aware that}} {{applicants}} {{were in danger}} if they stayed behind, Sugihara decided to grant visas on his own. <b>He</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> requirements and issued ten-day visas to Jews for transit through Japan, in violation of his orders. Given his inferior post {{and the culture of}} the Japanese Foreign Service bureaucracy, this was an unusual act of disobedience. He spoke to Soviet officials who agreed to let the Jews travel through the country via the Trans-Siberian Railway at five times the standard ticket price.|$|E

25|$|However, Gustav Trolle {{was deemed}} a traitor to the country, and Gustav Vasa could not {{reinstate}} him. Instead <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> papal bull {{and took it}} upon himself to install Magnus without papal acceptance. Before long, however, Johannes Magnus rebelled by declaring his discontent with the Lutheran teachings spread by the brothers Olaus and Laurentius Petri, under the supervision of King Gustav Vasa. The King then sent him off to Russia as a diplomat in 1526. Johannes Magnus was careful not to return home during that time, realizing that he was unwanted. Gustav Vasa appointed a new archbishop, Laurentius Petri, in 1531, and Johannes realized that his time as archbishop was over.|$|E
25|$|Local {{fishermen}} {{complained to}} municipal authorities that Hotelito Desconocido's construction was illegal and that Murzilli's plans were not legally approved. However, municipal officials reportedly {{told them that}} the investment brought by the construction was big for Tomatlán. The group decided to establish a working relationship with Hotelito Desconocido; they allowed the construction to continue because they believed that Hotelito Desconocido would bring new jobs to Tomatlán. The hotel ownership was eventually passed down to another Italian national, Giuliano Gasparotto. The group of fishermen stated that once Gasparotto was in charge of Hotelito Desconocido, <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> previous concessions and stopped compensating fishermen MXN$10,000 for every day they could not fish in the sea.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 the International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine {{was set up}} to {{establish}} whether the famine existed and its cause. Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, however <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> request. While the commission was organized along judicial lines, it had no judicial power to compel witnesses to attend or testify. However Tottle's book was examined during the Brussels sitting of the commission, held between May 23–27, 1988, with testimony from various expert witnesses. The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the famine on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.|$|E

50|$|Judicial {{oversight}} {{is provided}} by Judge Philip Pepperleigh, a staunch Conservative, has {{sat on the bench}} of the Mariposa Court House for years since emigrating from the Maritimes. Sometimes, it seems more like judicial oversight when <b>he</b> <b>ignores</b> <b>the</b> arguments of Macartney, the prosecuting (i.e., Crown) attorney. For example, Pepperleigh acquitted his own son for hitting a prominent Liberal and fined publican Josh Smith for not opening his bar after hours to accommodate His Honour.|$|R

25|$|Inslaw's initial filing {{claimed that}} the {{contract}} disputes arose because the DOJ officials who administered the contract were biased against Inslaw. The filing specifically mentioned Promis project manager, C. Madison Brewer, and Associate Attorney General, D. Lowell Jensen. Brewer had previously been Inslaw's general counsel, but according to Inslaw had been terminated for cause. Inslaw claimed that Brewer's dismissal caused him to be unreasonably biased against Inslaw and owner William Hamilton. Jensen {{was a member of}} the project oversight committee at the time of the contract. He had helped to develop another competing case management software system several years earlier, and Inslaw claimed that this led him to be prejudiced against Promis, so that <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> unreasonable bias of Brewer.|$|E
25|$|Busch's No. 51 {{was parked}} on lap 99 by NASCAR after Busch drove away from track workers that were tending to his car, which {{had run out}} of gas and crashed on the back straightaway after being {{accident}}ally spun out by Jamie McMurray. He had been leading the race before the accident and soon the medical assistance arrived. Busch exited the car but realized that his fuel tank was not completely empty and tried to drive it to the garage for repairs. As a medical bag was dragged with the car and slipped off NASCAR ordered Kurt to stop his car for the medical assistance but Busch did not put his helmet back on after he exited the car and could not hear any orders over the radio. His car ran out of gas just in turn 4 and NASCAR officials picked him up and parked the No. 51 team {{for the remainder of the}} race. Busch said goodbye to his team members since he was to drive the No. 78 car for a multi-year deal after the race and when asked about the incident, Busch said that <b>he</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> order because he did not have his helmet on and could not hear his crew chief's order to stop. NASCAR investigation that week proved that this appeal was true and therefore they did not penalize Busch any further after the parking.|$|E

25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And <b>he</b> <b>ignores</b> <b>the</b> wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|R
