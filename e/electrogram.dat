40|$|Accurate {{identification}} of pulmonary vein (PV) potentials during segmental ostial ablation for PV isolation {{is very important}} to completely isolate the PVs and also to avoid unnecessary applications of radiofrequency energy. A prior post hoc analysis of unipolar and bipolar <b>electrograms</b> recorded from successful and unsuccessful ablation sites demonstrated that unipolar <b>electrograms</b> recorded at successful sites {{were more likely to have}} a rapid intrinsic deflection, larger amplitude, and earlier activation than <b>electrograms</b> recorded at unsuccessful sites. Moreover, unipolar <b>electrograms</b> recorded from the ablation and circular ostial mapping catheters were almost identical at successful sites. Based on these observations, a prospective, randomized study was conducted to test whether unipolar and bipolar <b>electrograms</b> would facilitate the ablation procedure when compared to bipolar <b>electrograms</b> alone during PV isolation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). In 44 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF, 114 PVs were randomized to segmental ostial ablation guided by unipolar and bipolar <b>electrograms</b> (61) or by bipolar <b>electrograms</b> only (53). Segmental ostial ablation guided by unipolar and bipolar <b>electrograms</b> was associated with a ∼ 20 – 30 % decrease in the procedure and fluoroscopy times necessary for isolation of a PV and also in the duration of radiofrequency energy application required for complete isolation of a PV. Although the sample size was not sufficient to detect a 5 % change, the success rate for complete electrical isolation and the risk of symptomatic PV stenosis were similar between the 2 groups. Online analysis of unipolar <b>electrograms</b> facilitated the PV isolation procedure and was incremental to the analysis of bipolar <b>electrograms</b> alone. However, because segmental ostial ablation has only modest efficacy in achieving long-term freedom from recurrent AF, alternative ablation strategies that may or may not target PVs will eventually evolve.

40|$|Background: Some {{supraventricular}} tachycardias {{could be}} ablated from the non-coronary sinus of Valsalva (NSV).

Methods and Results: A quantitative analysis of the NSV <b>electrograms</b> was performed in 5 patients with tachycardias arising from near the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the His-bundle region, and in 20 control subjects. In another 7 control subjects, the NSV <b>electrograms</b> were compared with those recorded at the left and right sinus of Valsalva (LSV and RSV). The NSV <b>electrograms</b> during sinus rhythm had a larger atrial amplitude than ventricular amplitude, and the ratio of the atrial amplitude to the ventricular amplitude was usually > 1, which was apparently different from the LSV and RSV <b>electrograms.</b> A tiny but distinct His-bundle deflection was sometimes recorded at the NSV during sinus rhythm while it was not during the tachycardia.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Electrograms</b> {{exhibit a}} wide variety of morphologies during atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF). The basis of these time courses, however, is not completely understood. In this study, data from computer models were studied to relate features of the signals to the underlying dynamics and tissue substrate. METHODS AND RESULTS: A computer model of entire human atria with a gross fiber architecture based on histology and membrane kinetics based on the Courtemanche et al. atrial model was developed to simulate paced activation and simulated AF. Unipolar <b>electrograms</b> were computed using a current source approximation at 256 sites in right atrium, to simulate a mapping array. The results show the following: (1) In a homogeneous and isotropic tissue, the presence of highly asymmetric <b>electrograms</b> is rare (< 2 %), although there is a marked variability in amplitude and symmetry. (2) The introduction of anisotropy increases this variability in symmetry and amplitude of the, <b>electrograms</b> especially for propagation across fibers. The percentage of highly asymmetric <b>electrograms</b> increases to 12 % to 15 % for anisotropy ratios greater than 3 : 1. (3) Multiphasic and fractionated <b>electrograms</b> are rarely seen in the model with uniform properties but are more common (15 %- 17 %) in a model including regions with abrupt changes in conductivity. Beat-to-beat variations in the occurrence of multiphasic signals are possible with fixed anatomic heterogeneity, due to beat-to-beat variations {{in the direction of the}} wavefront relative to the heterogeneity.
