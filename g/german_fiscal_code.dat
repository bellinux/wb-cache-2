Unfortunately, in the last ten years, the Romanian <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Code</b> has been amended several times. The old <b>fiscal</b> <b>code</b> is in force since 2003 and suffered throughout this period no less than 150 amendments. The unanimous opinion of the experts was that there was a clear need of a new code. The paper analyzes the changes brought by the <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Code</b> starting with 2016 and its implications on the activity of business operators and on the state budget for the next period of time. It seems that some of the changes will not have the desired effect on the state budget and, generally, on the economy. </p...|$|R

Good provision of such principles shall be achieved only by provision of Standards by Resolution and published in the Official Monitor. The current Romanian <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Code</b> is structured by 10 titles, each with its chapters, regulating the following taxes and duties:tax on profit, tax on income,tax on micro-companies income,tax on income obtained in Romania by non-residents,tax on representation, value added tax,excises, local tax and duties...|$|R

40|$|Currently fiscal {{policies}} in Germany {{seem to be}} in a very comfortable position and the German Debt Brake is regarded as an institutional precondition for this success and has been exported to the Euro area in the guise of the Fiscal Compact. In this paper we scrutinize <b>German</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies and its new national and European institutional constraints from a macroeconomic perspective. We start by reiterating the requirements for fiscal policies of member countries in a currency union like the Euro area from a Post-Keynesian perspective and examine <b>German</b> <b>fiscal</b> {{policies in}} the period from 1999 until 2007 against this theoretical background. We then turn to <b>German</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies during the Great Recession, the German Debt Brake, the Fiscal Compact and future perspectives, and analyse the associated problems and risks. Finally, we discuss alternative scenarios which could avoid the deflationary pressures of the German Debt Brake and the Fiscal Compact on domestic demand and contribute to internally rebalancing the Euro area...|$|R

40|$|The legal {{solutions}} adapted in {{the penal}} and <b>fiscal</b> <b>code</b> concerning proceedings by police penal orders are an innovative regulation in the penal and fiscal matters adapted {{for the first}} time in this area of the Polish law. An analysis of the regulations allows to arrive at the conclusion that proceedings by police penal orders can be conducted only in the case of fiscal violations where there occurs no doubt as to the violating party and the circumstances of the act and the act can be classified as punishable with a fine no larger than double the value of the minimum monthly wages. In principle, fines in such proceedings are imposed by the financial investigating organ, and if any legal provisions stipulate so, also by a non-financial investigating organ. The appropriate investigating organ can conduct proceedings by police penal orders only if such proceedings are permissible, i. e. all the necessary particular conditions are met. The provisions of the penal and <b>fiscal</b> <b>code</b> mention two types of penal fines. The first one, cash fine, is issued to the penalized party after a direct payment of the imposed penalty to the investigating organ or its representative. The second type, loan fine is delivered on acknowledgement to the penalized party. A cash penalty can be imposed on individuals temporarily visiting the territory of the Republic of Poland as well as permanent residents of Poland temporarily leaving its territory. The regulations of the penal and <b>fiscal</b> <b>code</b> in the studies scope still, however, raise some doubts. However, one should emphasise that the draft amendment of the penal and <b>fiscal</b> <b>code</b> due to enter into force in the second half of the present year takes into consideration most of the modifications postulated by the doctrine.

40|$|In 2009, new debt {{restrictions}} in the Grundgesetz (the German constitution) and in federal legislation passed both chambers of the German parliament by two-thirds majorities, imposing a more rigid debt regime on federal and Länder (states) fiscal policies than previous constitutional provisions entailed.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the notion of}} tax evasion in Rwanda. It looks at the role of tax administration and <b>fiscal</b> <b>codes</b> in Rwanda {{in the implementation of}} tax anti-evasion measures in the country. The tax administration and <b>fiscal</b> <b>codes</b> provide opportunities for the Rwandan people to realize a tax evasion free society {{not only because of the}} tax administration departments in place to curb tax evasion, the types of taxes, the measures of collection, but also the reasonable fiscal procedure process in tax payment and also in allowing the taxpayer participation in the tax assessment process, an essential component of co-operative taxpayer attitudes for potential tax revenue collections to thrive. However, this thesis scrutinizes the reality in Rwanda for the extent to which tax administration and tax laws have gone to achieve the goal of curbing tax evasion. Tax administration measures and <b>fiscal</b> <b>code</b> provisions in place, can not be said to be perfect as at times it is foreign ideas imported into Rwanda, which must be adopted often as a conditionality to that much needed development assistance. This in light of the persistent institutionalized corruption existing in Rwanda, and the reality of public participation in the tax assessment process given the Rwandan culture of evading taxes, makes the anti-evasion process inadequate in Rwanda, thus further "watering down" the sufficiency of the tax law and tax administration as a previously perceived usable strategy for curbing tax evasion. The thesis argues therefore that the tax administration and <b>fiscal</b> <b>codes</b> in curbing tax evasion are limited by existence of these realities unless modifications are made in the implementation of measures against tax evasion in Rwanda...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{empirical}} {{estimates of}} the risk-sharing and redistributive properties of fiscal equalization among {{the states of the}} <b>German</b> federation. <b>Fiscal</b> equalization serves the dual role of insuring regional income against asymmetric revenue shocks (i. e., short-run income differences), and decreasing long-run differences by redistributing tax revenues among states. In our empirical study, we evaluate the performance of the <b>German</b> <b>fiscal</b> system between 1970 and 2006. We find that tax revenue sharing and the fiscal equalization mechanism (Länderfinanzausgleich) together lead to a redistribution of 36. 9 percent of state income, with a contribution of 5. 5 percent by the Länderfinanzausgleich, for the period 1970 to 1994. After the full integration of East German states into the mechanism in 1995, redistributive effects drop to about 35 percent.

With respect to the insurance effect of the <b>German</b> <b>fiscal</b> system, our results indicate that the federal fiscal system offsets 47 percent of an asymmetric shock to state per-capita incomes. This effect has significantly decreased after the inclusion of the East German states in 1995.
