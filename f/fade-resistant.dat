2500|$|In 1958, new Standard model {{retained}} most specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including PAF humbucker pickups, a maple top, and a tune-o-matic {{bridge with}} a stop tailpiece or Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. The gold color used since 1952 {{was replaced by}} a cherry-red version of the Sunburst finish long used on Gibson's flat-top and archtop acoustic and hollow electric guitars. Since the maple cap was now visible, tops were made either with a solid [...] "plaintop" [...] piece of maple or two bookmatched pieces of figured (curly or quilted) maple. To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul Standard. Specifications during 1958–60 varied from year to year and also from guitar to guitar. Typical 1958 Les Paul Standard necks had a thicker neck, thinner frets and lower fret height, which changed during the course of 1959 to develop into typical 1960 necks with a thinner cross-section and wider, higher frets. The cherry dye used on the 1958–59 models faded rapidly from ultraviolet light exposure, so in early 1960 Gibson switched to a new, <b>fade-resistant</b> formulation which was also less translucent and slightly more orange; this is sometimes called the [...] "tomato soup burst." [...] Original production of the Standards lasted from 1958 to early 1961. Only about 1,700 of these early models were made and have subsequently become highly valuable.The 1958–60 Standard is one of the highest priced vintage guitar models on the market, ranked at # on the 2011 Top 25 published by Vintage Guitar, and worth between $225,000 and $375,000.|$|E
5000|$|The Signo line of gel pens uses [...] "uni Super-ink", an {{archival quality}} ink that is {{water-proof}} and <b>fade-resistant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Semi-metallic {{materials}} - synthetics {{mixed with}} varying proportions of flaked metals. These are harder than non-metallic pads, more <b>fade-resistant</b> and longer lasting, {{but at the}} cost of increased wear to the rotor/drum which then must be replaced sooner. They also require more actuating force than non-metallic pads in order to generate braking torque.|$|E
50|$|Custom-printed tile murals can be {{produced}} using digital images for kitchen splashbacks, wall displays, and flooring. Digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated. Custom tile printing uses {{a variety of techniques}} including dye sublimation and ceramic-type laser toners. The latter technique can yield <b>fade-resistant</b> custom tiles which are suitable for long term exterior exposure.|$|E
50|$|Elegant {{refinements}} and luxurious roominess {{made the}} 1978 Fleetwood Brougham a superb luxury sedan. Electronic Level Control replaced the previous Automatic Level Control to maintain proper poise automatically for varied driving situations. 1978 Cadillacs used matched-mounted tires and wheels to reduce rolling resistance. Cadillac engineers retuned body mounts and structure for a smoother, quieter, ride. For straight, <b>fade-resistant</b> stopping power, four-wheel disc brakes were standard. From the handsome new grille to the distinctive new tail lamps, the 1978 Fleetwood Brougham was {{as efficient as}} it was beautiful.|$|E
50|$|Pink LEDs can be {{produced}} using two methods, either with a blue LED using two phosphors (yellow for the first phosphor, and red, orange, or pink for the second), or by placing a pink dye {{on top of a}} white LED. Color shifting was a common issue with early pink LEDs, where the red, orange, or pink phosphors or dyes faded over time, causing the pink color to eventually shift towards white or blue. These issues have been mitigated by the more recent introduction of more <b>fade-resistant</b> phosphors.|$|E
50|$|Because ALPS {{had little}} name {{recognition}} among United States consumers, {{because it could}} not interest other major printer manufacturers in its system, {{and because it is}} considerably slower than most ink-jet systems, the MicroDry system never achieved wide acceptance despite its ability to produce clear, waterproof, <b>fade-resistant</b> hardcopy. It has found a niche market in certain types of plotters used in the signage industry, as well as an extremely loyal following among those who understand its capabilities. ALPS does continued to produce mechanisms for use in plotters, as well as supplies, and had pledged to continue doing so for {{as long as there is}} a significant demand.|$|E
50|$|Changes to Continental GT include 35 kg {{reduction}} in kerb weight due primarily to optimisation of suspension and cooling system components, {{increased use of}} aluminium parts in suspension, revised Servotronic power steering for improved feel and feedback, optional <b>fade-resistant</b> carbon ceramic brakes provide improved brake feel (only available on 20-inch wheels), new, more upright front grille and larger lower air intakes give improved airflow to aid engine cooling; chromed headlamp bezels, two new exterior paint colours (Cumbrian Green and Granite), two new leather hide colours (Newmarket Tan and Cumbrian Green), new low-friction dampers, new 'Sport Traction' mode for the Bosch 8.1 ESP system, Bentley 'B' brake pedal.|$|E
50|$|Besides its {{original}} association with Iris prints, the word giclée {{has come to}} be associated with other types of inkjet printing including processes that use <b>fade-resistant,</b> archival inks (pigment-based), and archival substrates primarily produced on Canon, Epson, HP and other large-format printers. These printers use the CMYK color process but may have multiple cartridges for variations of each color based on the CcMmYK color model (such as light magenta and light cyan inks in addition to regular magenta and cyan); this increases the apparent resolution and color gamut and allows smoother gradient transitions. A wide variety of substrates is available, including various textures and finishes such as matte photo paper, watercolor paper, cotton canvas, or artist textured vinyl.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{the owner}} of an Oversize Load often must hire a Pilot Car (flag or escort car) before the Load can be moved on a public roadway [...] An Oversize Load may exceed one or all normal vehicle {{dimensions}} of weight, height, length, width and/or extend beyond the commonly-recognized perimeter of the Load vehicle. All Pilot Cars in an individual state must be uniformly identified with required durable, <b>fade-resistant</b> yellow OVERSIZE LOAD sign (on rooftop or the car’s position bumper) and amber flashing or rotating lights that are visible 360° and at least 100 ft away. Those Pilot Cars may legally operate ahead of, behind or in any position relative to the Load that ensures the safe movement of the Load vehicle and all assisting Pilot, Police and Utility vehicles that are necessary for the move.|$|E
50|$|The {{certified}} Pilot Car Operator protects people, {{vehicles and}} property by several actions. The simple {{presence of a}} Pilot Car warns other drivers and pedestrians. The Lead (front position) Pilot Car often has a calibrated High Pole (and depending upon the state, a durable, <b>fade-resistant</b> yellow sign) bolted to its front bumper. The High Pole is designed to collide with overpasses, power lines and tree branches that may be above the lane in which the Pilot Car and the Load are operating. The Lead Pilot Car Operator transmits radio messages to the Load and other necessary vehicles of overhead obstructions or road conditions that require the Load to alter its path or stop. Finally, a Pilot Car Operator may park the Pilot Car just off the roadway and direct traffic with a reversible Slow/Stop sign or orange flags while wearing a bright vest and hard hat.|$|E
50|$|Fine art digital inkjet {{printing}} is printing {{from a computer}} image file directly to an inkjet printer as a final output. It evolved from digital proofing technology from Kodak, 3M, and other major manufacturers, with artists and other printers trying to adapt these dedicated prepress proofing machines to fine-art printing. There was experimentation with many {{of these types of}} printers, the most notable being the IRIS printer, initially adapted to fine-art printing by programmer David Coons, and adopted for fine-art work by Graham Nash at his Nash Editions printing company in 1991. Initially, these printers were limited to glossy papers, but the IRIS Graphics printer allowed the use of a variety of papers that included traditional and non-traditional media. The IRIS printer was the standard for fine art digital printmaking for many years, and is still in use today, but has been superseded by large-format printers from other manufacturers such as Epson and HP that use <b>fade-resistant,</b> archival inks (pigment-based, as well as newer solvent-based inks), and archival substrates specifically designed for fine-art printing.|$|E
50|$|Iris {{printers}} {{have also}} been used since the late 1980s as final output digital printing devices {{in the production of}} fine art reproductions on various media, including paper, canvas, silk, linen and other textiles. There were many printers, photographers, artists, and engineers who saw the merit in using this industrial proof printer as a way to produce high-resolution color accurate reproductions. Color engineer David Coons used the 3024 at the Walt Disney Company to print images from Disney’s new computer 3D animation system. He also wrote software to print works created on desktop computers such as Sally Larsen 1989 Transformer series, and a 1990 photo exhibition for Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Nash was so impressed with the quality of the Iris prints, he purchased his own Iris Graphics 3047 ink-jet printer for $126,000 to print further editions of his work and eventually set up Nash Editions, a digital reproduction company based on the Iris printer. There were many problems with adapting the Iris printer to fine art printing including modifying the machines to take heavy paper stock and dealing with the poorly <b>fade-resistant</b> (fugitive) nature of the inks.|$|E
