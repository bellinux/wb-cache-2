40|$|Abstract. Although the {{addition}} of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> to mineral aggregates at asphalt production plants has become mandatory for use in all asphalt concrete mixtures, the consequences of such additives at asphalt binder- mineral aggregate contact in the hot bin have shown a great effect on the consistency properties of the resulting asphalt mastics as {{compared to that of}} a neat asphalt binder. Considering that many highway agencies in developing countries still use asphalt binders consistency properties to verify material specifications for acceptance and construction practices control to build sustainable highways, it is eminent that asphalt mastic other than neat asphalt binder should provide pertinent information for consistency characterization of the neat asphalt binder in question. Fundamental consistency properties of asphalt binder containing <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> to a conventional No. 70 asphalt binder (Penetration Grade) designed to meet the JTG F 40 - 2004 specification of China were investigated. <b>Hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> was dry mixed with neat asphalt binder at <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> to binder ratio’s ranging from 0. 0 to 1. 5 in ratio increments of 0. 3 % by weight of asphalt.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{improved}} mechanistic procedures for design, maintenance, and rehabilitation of highway and airport pavements {{has been recognized}} for many years. Mechanistic methods {{are based on the}} principles of mechanics in contrast to the particular purpose and empirical procedures that are often used. The objective of this study is the development of Mechanistic-Empirical design method by the implementation of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> effect in the proposed pavement section. Enhancing the paving material performance-related properties during design is an important step to minimize the efforts, pavement layers’ thicknesses and cost as well as develop the serviceability and design life. This can be done by modifiers, and one of the effective modification materials is the <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime.</b> Accordingly, the advantages of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> in the resistance to fatigue cracking and permanent deformation are utilized as main factors in the adopted Mechanistic-Empirical approach of this study. To achieve the objective of this study, three types of asphalt concrete mixtures that represent the pavement asphaltic courses (Wearing, Leveling and Base) of the asphalt concrete layer were produced and evaluated. As mineral filler materials, ordinary limestone dust and <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> were used in this study. Five different <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> percentages were selected, namely 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 and 3 percent as partial replacement of limestone dust filler by total weight of aggregate besides a control mixture without <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime.</b> For the <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> modified mix design, the introducing of lime into the mixtures was done by adding dry <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> by total aggregate weight following the normal procedure for adding mineral filler. The experimental programme conducted in this study comprises of four main steps. Firstly, evaluate the effect of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> (HL) on asphalt cement physical properties. Penetration and the softening point (ring and ball) tests were conducted to study the influence of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> on asphalt cement consistency and stiffness. Secondly, the design of asphalt concrete mixtures following Marshall design procedure. The use of Marshall apparatus is to obtain the optimum asphalt content in specific values of stability, air void and density for control and <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> modified mixes. This method also covers the evaluation of mixtures’ resistance to plastic flow (Marshall stability and flow). Thirdly, determine and evaluate the control and <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> modified Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement mechanical responses to the two major distresses (fatigue cracking and rutting) that generally occurred in the pavement. In particular, these distresses could give an indication of failure criteria in the mechanistic-empirical design process. Finally, evaluation of pavement mixtures resistance to moisture damage regarding the effect of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime.</b> The determined optimum asphalt contents by Marshall design procedure as related to the effect of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> were used in preparing further mixes specimens with different geometry and size for fatigue and rutting tests.

The addition of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> to asphalt has shown to be beneficial with an improvement in the Theological properties of the binder, as well as resistance to permanent deformation (rutting) and fatigue cracking of asphalt concrete mixtures. The addition of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> produces a filler effect where the result is a stiffening of the asphalt mixture, thus improving the resistance to permanent deformation. The fatigue characteristics of the asphalt mixtures did not worsen from this stiffening effect, but were either improved or similar. The Superpave Performance Grade was not significantly indicative of the filler effects induced by the <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime.</b> However, evaluation of the physical properties, G*/sin 5 and G*sin 5 were indicative of significant filler effects induced by the <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime.</b> Creep properties, stiffness and m-value showed no substantial change with the addition of lime. The use of 10 to 20 % mass concentration of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> can effectively improve the rutting resistance of the unaged and aged binder with little practical effect on the low temperature and fatigue properties. The filler effects produced through the addition of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> to the asphalt yielded asphalt mixtures less susceptible to rutting. In most cases, the fatigue life of the asphalt mixtures improved as well. The reference modulus and creep compliance of the asphalt mixtures with lime had shown to have greater fatigue life. In most cases, Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) mixtures with lime showed greater resistance to rutting, as well as greater fatigue life. The filler effects from the <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime,</b> as well as the stone-on-stone contact and stiffening from the mastic (two characteristics of SMA mixtures) improved these properties. The addition of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> to asphalt improved the G*/sin 5 and G*sin 8 of the asphalt binders. The use of these asphalt binders in asphalt concrete mixtures increased the resistance to rutting and fatigue life.

The objective of this research is to evaluate and compare the stripping performance of unmodified and rubber-polymer modified binder mixes with and without anti-stripping additives in Superpave mix design (AASHTO TP 4) procedure. The study investigates four different dense graded Superpave HMA mixes. The first mixture was a control specimen that contained no <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> and unmodified binder.

30|$|If {{quicklime}} is used, {{it immediately}} hydrates (i.e., chemically combines with water) and releases heat. Soils are dried, because water {{present in the}} soil participates in this reaction, and because the heat generated can evaporate additional moisture. The <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> produced by these initial reactions will subsequently react with clay particles. These subsequent reactions will slowly produce additional drying because they reduce the soil’s moisture holding capacity. If <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> or <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> slurry is used instead of quicklime, drying occurs only through the chemical changes in the soil that reduce its capacity to hold water and increase its stability. After initial mixing, the calcium ions (Ca 2 +) from <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> migrate {{to the surface of}} the clay particles and displace water and other ions.

This research focus on how different types and contents of aggregates affect properties of mastics and asphalt mixtures, and their performance considering the viscoelastic nature of the asphalt material. Five different types of aggregates and <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> were used for sample fabrication together with two different binders. Several different tests were performed to the aggregates separately. Viscoelastic properties for both mastics and hot mix asphalt mixtures were characterized. In addition, the mixtures produced with those aggregates were also evaluated for rutting and fatigue performances using the APA and UTM- 25 kN machines. Among the studies conducted in this research work are: restricted zone, a controversial concept and its redundancy; rutting potential of mixtures with different coarse and fine angularities; the stiffening potential of binders provided by different fillers; the stiffening provided by different contents of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime</b> to asphalt concrete mixtures and fatigue and rutting potential of mixtures with different contents of <b>hydrated</b> <b>lime.</b> The results indicate that the restricted zone should not be a criterion for the selection of mixture gradations, that angularity somewhat affects the rutting potential of asphalt concrete mixtures, that fillers of different materials provide different gain in stiffness for binders and that this improvement is binder dependent.
