2500|$|Coronary {{catheterization}} {{is one of}} {{the several}} cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures. Specifically, coronary catheterization is a visually interpreted test performed to recognize occlusion, stenosis, restenosis, thrombosis or aneurysmal enlargement of the coronary artery lumens; <b>heart</b> <b>chamber</b> size; heart muscle contraction performance; and some aspects of heart valve function. Important internal heart and lung blood pressures, not measurable from outside the body, can be accurately measured during the test. The relevant problems that the test deals with most commonly occur as a result of advanced atherosclerosis – [...] atheroma activity within the wall of the coronary arteries. Less frequently, valvular, heart muscle, or arrhythmia issues are the primary focus of the test.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the severity of}} mitral stenosis is the simultaneous left and right <b>heart</b> <b>chamber</b> catheterization. The right heart catheterization (commonly known as Swan-Ganz catheterization) gives the physician the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which {{is a reflection of}} the left atrial pressure. [...] The left heart catheterization, on the other hand, gives the pressure in the left ventricle. [...] By simultaneously taking these pressures, it is possible to determine the gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during ventricular diastole, which is a marker for the severity of mitral stenosis. [...] This method of evaluating mitral stenosis tends to overestimate the degree of mitral stenosis, however, because of the time lag in the pressure tracings seen on the right-heart catheterization and the slow Y descent seen on the wedge tracings. [...] If a trans-septal puncture is made during right heart catheterization, however, the pressure gradient can accurately quantify the severity of mitral stenosis.|$|E

50|$|A {{ventricle}} {{is one of}} {{two large}} chambers in the heart that collect and expel blood received from an atrium towards the peripheral beds within the body and lungs. The atrium (an adjacent/upper <b>heart</b> <b>chamber</b> that is smaller than a ventricle) primes the pump. Interventricular means between the ventricles (for example the interventricular septum), while intraventricular means within one ventricle (for example an intraventricular block).|$|E
50|$|Patients often {{present with}} {{increased}} {{thickness of the}} wall of the main <b>heart</b> <b>chamber,</b> the left ventricle.

Low ECG signals such as QRS complexes are widely considered a marker of cardiac amyloidosis.|$|E
50|$|Specification {{of cardiac}} {{precursor}} cells: The lateral plate mesoderm delaminates to form two layers: the dorsal somatic (parietal) mesoderm and the ventral splanchnic (visceral) mesoderm.

50|$|Angiography or {{arteriography}} is {{a medical}} imaging technique used to visualize the inside, or lumen, of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries, veins, and the <b>heart</b> <b>chambers.</b> This is traditionally done by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy.|$|R
50|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} heart disease in all cats. It is hereditary in the Maine Coon and American Shorthair, and likely the Persian. The disease causes thickening of the left <b>heart</b> <b>chamber,</b> which can in some instances lead to sudden death. It tends to affect males and mid to old-aged individuals. Reported incidence rate in Persians is 6.5%. Unlike PKD which can be detected even in very young cats, heart tests for HCM {{have to be done}} regularly in order to effective track and/or remove affected individuals and their offspring from the breeding pool.|$|E

50|$|When {{performing}} TMR {{a qualified}} cardiac surgeon delivers a precise laser therapy (either with a Holmium:YAG laser or CO2), {{directly to the}} target area(s) of the heart muscle. When performed as a primary therapy, it is done through a small incision between the ribs (thoracotomy) with the patient under general anesthesia. Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) can also be performed as a secondary procedure in patients that have ischemic heart disease with areas of the heart that cannot be bypassed. The precise laser therapy is delivered to create small channels into the <b>heart</b> <b>chamber.</b> During a typical procedure, approximately 10 -50 channels are made in each targeted region of the heart muscle.|$|E
50|$|Vascular endothelial cells {{line the}} entire circulatory system, {{from the heart}} to the {{smallest}} capillaries. These cells have unique functions in vascular biology.
