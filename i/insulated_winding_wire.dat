40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} Swedish manufacturers of <b>insulated</b> <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and the market forces surrounding the industry between 1945 and 1980. As part of the chain of subcontractors, the winding wire industry was linked to all three major electro-technical manufacturers of the time, ASEA, Electrolux and LM Ericsson. The Wallenberg Group’s initiatives to create boundaries for what the manufacturers were to produce also came to influence manufacturers of winding wire and their subsequent focus on high- and low voltage current products and systems respectively. Increasing sales of electro-technical products that became the norm in industry {{as well as in}} private homes after 1945 to a great extent created the demand for winding wire. In response to an increasing demand for winding wire Ernst Dahrén developed the family company in Jonslund, a predominantly rural area that lacked job opportunities. The specialisation of winding wire manufacturing enabled the company to carefully select loyal employees who accepted lower wages and were willing to work in three shifts, thereby creating a competitive advantage for the company. Product pricing was governed by the prices of copper and aluminium as well as costs and discounts for the rod wire used in the production of winding wire. Together with Ernst Dahrén’s entrepreneurial and patriarchal leadership style which highly influenced the company culture, the family’s tendency to re-invest profits became an important foundation for the company’s autonomy and expansion until its acquisition by the ASEA in 1973...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{the massive}} {{adoption}} of electronic converters to supply induction motors leads to critical problems during the normal operation. One {{of the most}} investigated problem is the unexpected early failure of the stator winding insulation. When the motors are supplied by electronic converters, the stator insulating system could be subjected to overvoltages due to resonance and reflection phenomena. If these overvoltages exceed the partial discharges inception voltage, partial discharge activity incepts. The erosion of the enamel used to <b>insulate</b> the stator <b>winding</b> <b>wires,</b> due {{to the presence of}} partial discharges, leads to the degradation of the dielectric characteristics of the insulating system and to a total breakdown conditions in the short-medium term. This test campaign aimed at the investigation of the unipolar pulses voltage waveforms role on the degradation of Type I stator winding insulation systems...|$|R

5000|$|Halfwound strings, ground wound strings, or {{pressure}} wound strings are a {{cross between}} roundwound and flatwound. Such strings are usually made by <b>winding</b> round <b>wire</b> around a round or hex core first, then polishing, grinding (thus the name, ground wound) or pressing the exterior part of the winding until it is practically flat. This results in the flat, comfortable playing feel of flatwounds, along with less squeaking, with a brightness generally between roundwounds and flatwounds. The polishing process removes {{almost half of the}} <b>winding</b> <b>wire's</b> mass; thus, to compensate for it, manufacturers use <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> of a heavier gauge. Because of the extra manufacturing process involved they are normally more expensive than roundwounds, but less than flatwounds.|$|R

50|$|When {{looking at}} the <b>insulated</b> <b>winding</b> space {{graphically}} and the required number of windings at a given wire diameter, {{it can be said}} that considering the space requirements for the winding nozzle (required groove width: about 3*0.548=1.6 mm) only 38 windings can be introduced into the winding space of the stator slot.|$|R

The layer is formed {{in such a manner}} that the thermal resistance between the layer and the units is small relative to the resistance of the wire between end windings and the point. An electrically-conducting connection is provided between the layer and electronic components (7, 8). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The electrically-conducting layer is applied to thermally-conducting and electrically-insulating substrates and cooling units (11, 13). USE - Used in an electromagnetic actuator e. g. solenoid and valve drive. ADVANTAGE - The contact point connects the <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> to the electrically-conducting layer, thus contacting the windings with electronic components in a simple and reliable manner, and achieving thermal isolation of the windings from the electronic components, and hence avoiding entry of harmful heat from the windings to the components. The device reduces the spatial range between the electronic components and the machine, thereby providing a compact structure. The device provides improved electromagnetic compatibility and eliminates the need for plugging and connecting units of housing parts and the components for electromagnetic filtering, thus reducing the cost of the device...|$|R

However, the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> has a rounded square {{cross-section}} {{that has a}} shallower profile (in cross-section) when tightly wound. This makes for more comfortable playing, and decreased wear for frets and fretboards (this makes them a popular choice for fretless instruments). Squeaking sounds due to fingers sliding along the strings are also decreased significantly. Flatwound strings also have a longer playable life because of smaller grooves for dirt and oil to build up in.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{the usual}} {{practice}} for power transformers to have a 5 volt <b>insulated</b> <b>winding</b> for rectifier filaments, and a 6.3 volt winding {{for all the other}} heaters; virtually all valves with 5V filament are rectifiers with cathode connected to heater, in practice full-wave (usable as half-wave by strapping both anodes together), e.g. GZ34. For lower-voltage lower-power requirements, rectifiers with 6.3V heaters and insulated cathodes such as the EZ80 were used, connected to the common filament supply. There is no special nomenclature for EHT rectifiers for cathode-ray tubes; the EY51 and EY86 were rated at 17kV with an average current of 350 microamps. The GY501 is another example (31kV at 1.7mA and used the rare B9D base). In practice most [...] "xY" [...] half-wave rectifiers are EHT types; {{but there are plenty of}} exceptions.|$|R
