5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of <b>electronic</b> <b>driver</b> aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E

Its aerodynamic performance was poor and resulted in unwieldy handling, whilst the Lola engineers failed to extract the potential power of the Ferrari V12 engine, instead finding that its torque was limited in low and medium-speed corners.

2500|$|The {{development}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>driver</b> aids began during the 1980s. Lotus {{began to develop}} a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1982 on the 91. By 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for [...] This resulted in cars that were previously dependent on electronic aids becoming very [...] "twitchy" [...] and difficult to drive (particularly the Williams FW16).

In the early 1990s, teams started introducing <b>electronic</b> <b>driver</b> aids, whose use spread rapidly. Active suspension, (pioneered by Lotus in 1987), semi-automatic gearboxes (Ferrari in 1989), and traction control (Williams in 1991) became essential to compete. Some of these technologies were borrowed from contemporary road cars. Others were primarily developed for the track and later {{made their way to the}} showroom. All enabled cars to reach higher and higher speeds, provided the teams were willing to spend the money. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids in 1994. However, many observers felt that the ban on driver aids was a ban in name only as the FIA did not have the technology or the methods to eliminate these features from competition. Even this controversy did not diminish the pleasure British fans of the sport felt in 1992, when Nigel Mansell finally won the title, after a decade of trying, nor French fans in [...] when Alain Prost took his 4th Championship, both drivers piloting Williams cars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED) and {{the field}} {{emission}} display (FED) have many things in common, mainly they are both technologies that realize a thin, flat display with CRT-like qualities of fast response time and high efficiency, brightness and contrast ratio. The market direction for both technologies is the large-screen, HDTV. Both technologies rely on controlling an array of electron beams to write an image on a phosphor-coated anode. Both technologies require an evacuated glass envelope supported by multiple spacers distributed throughout the display. Both are ultimately based on field emission concepts, but major differences in the emitter structure lead to significant differences in <b>electronic</b> <b>drivers</b> and display operation.

5000|$|Turkey {{implemented}} the first smart card driver's license system in 1987. Turkey {{had a high}} level of road accidents and decided to develop and use digital tachograph devices on heavy vehicles, instead of the existing mechanical ones, to reduce speed violations.

A professional driver is required to insert his driver's license into a digital tachograph before starting to drive. The tachograph unit records speed violations for each driver and gives a printed report. The driving hours for each driver are also being monitored and reported.

These 2 ̆ 2 small format 2 ̆ 2 displays {{can be found}} primarily in cell phones and PDAs which are devices that have particularly stringent power requirements. At the same time, the displays are increasing in resolution with every generation. This is creating demand for new LCD display technologies. The predominant amorphous thin film transistor technology is no longer feasible in the new high resolution small format screens {{due to the fact}} that the displays require too many connections to the driver and the aperture ratios do not allow high density displays. New technologies such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) displays continue to shrink in size and increase in resolution.
