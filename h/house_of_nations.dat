In 1928, the building was reopened as Haus Vaterland, based on an idea by Leo Kronau, who had visited Coney Island in New York and wanted to emulate the international attractions in the amusement parks there and improve on Berlin's own imitation, Lunapark. He persuaded the Kempinski family, who had a 65-year track record of success as restaurateurs in Berlin, to convert Haus Potsdam into a Haus der Nationen (<b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>nations),</b> and became its first artistic director, arranging entertainment to suit the flavour {{of each of the}} gastronomic units.|$|E
50|$|Jiang has {{proposed}} a trilateral parliament system for China, which would consist <b>of</b> three <b>houses,</b> each representing the three kinds of legitimacy discussed in Criticism of New Confucianism. “The three are the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Exemplary Persons (Tongru Yuan), also called the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Ru or the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Confucian Tradition, which represents sacred legitimacy; the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> the People (Shumin Yuan), which represents popular legitimacy; and the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Nation</b> (Guoti Yuan), which represents cultural legitimacy.” The Confucian scholars in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Exemplary Persons are elected by recommendations and nominations. Representatives from Daoism, Buddhism, Islam, Tibetan or even Christianity are also present in the House. The members in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> People are elected by universal suffrage. The members in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nation</b> are chosen by hereditary criteria and by assignment. Each house possesses real parliamentary power, and the bill must be accepted by at least two house, in order for it to become a law. In a way, this produces a {{system of checks and}} balances to guarantee that the best decision is reached, and that no party is overly dominant. All in all, the constitutional framework is supposed to endorse the Way of the Humane Authority. It has more dimensions of political legitimacy than liberal democracy, where only the people’s will is reflected in the consent of the government.|$|R
