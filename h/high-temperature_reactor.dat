The three loops will be thermally coupled through an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) and a secondary heat exchanger (SHX). Research topics to be addressed include the characterization and performance evaluation of candidate compact heat exchangers such as printed circuit heat exchangers (PCHEs) at prototypical operating conditions. Each loop will also include an interchangeable high-temperature test section that can be customized to address specific research issues associated with each working fluid. This paper also discusses needs and challenges associated with advanced instrumentation for the multi-loop facility, which could be further applied to advanced <b>high-temperature</b> <b>reactors.</b> Based on its relevance to advanced reactor systems, the new facility has been named the Advanced Reactor Technology Integral System Test (ARTIST) facility. A preliminary design configuration of the ARTIST facility will be presented with the required design and operating characteristics of the various components.

40|$|Advanced reactor systems, such as <b>High-Temperature</b> <b>Reactors</b> (HTR) {{can deliver}} heat in various forms. Assuming steam as the {{probably}} closest application, such reactors can achieve attractive steam conditions (> 600 °C).
