50|$|A key {{application}} for HMDs is training and simulation, allowing to virtually place a trainee {{in a situation}} that is either too expensive or too dangerous to replicate in real-life. Training with HMDs covers a wide range of applications from driving, welding and spray painting, flight and vehicle simulators, <b>dismounted</b> <b>soldier</b> training, medical procedure training, and more. However, a number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of certain types of head-mounted displays, and these issues must be resolved before optimal training and simulation is feasible.|$|E

This work follows our previous studies on the type (e. g. size) of displays required by <b>dismounted</b> <b>soldiers</b> to process video feed from UAVs. Sixteen former infantry soldiers with no experience using UAV video feed participated. Four displays were examined in two scenarios (urban and rural) and in three different task domains (interpretation, orientation and response). Performance and subjective data were collected.

The most consistent trend marks the smallest display (personal digital assistant- PDA) to be unsuitable for this type of tasks...|$|R

50|$|The Jack human {{simulation}} {{system was}} {{developed at the}} Center for Human Modeling and Simulation at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1980s & 1990s. Conceived as an ergonomic assessment and virtual human prototyping system for NASA space shuttle development, it soon gathered funding from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army for <b>dismounted</b> <b>soldier</b> simulation, from the U.S. Air Force for maintenance simulation, and from various other government and corporate users for their own applications. In 1996 the software was spun off into a privately held company and is now sold as an ergonomic human simulation toolkit (called Tecnomatix Jack) by Siemens. The {{research and development of}} the Jack system have led to such standards as H-anim and MPEG4 Body Animation Parameters.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas A. Furness III {{was one of}} {{the first}} to develop the use of VR for {{military}} training when, in 1982, he presented the Air Force with a working model of his virtual flight simulator the Visually Coupled Airborne Systems Simulator (VCASS). The second phase of his project, which he called the [...] "Super Cockpit", was even more advanced, with high resolution graphics (for the time) and a responsive display. Furness III is often credited as a pioneer in virtual reality for this research. The Ministry of Defense in the United Kingdom has been using VR in military training since the 1980s. The United States military announced the <b>Dismounted</b> <b>Soldier</b> Training System in 2012. It was cited as the first fully immersive military VR training system.|$|E
5000|$|Land Warrior was {{the first}} U.S. Army soldier network system {{to be used in}} combat since the {{networked}} soldier concept began in 1989. 229 Land Warrior ensembles were deployed by the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment to Iraq from May 2007 to June 2008. A Stryker Brigade later deployed with the system to Afghanistan, and Land Warrior remained in use until spring 2012. The Army built upon Land Warrior with the Ground Soldier System (GSS) as its successor, an advanced <b>dismounted</b> <b>soldier</b> integrated situational awareness system that entered technology development in February 2009. GSS Increment 1 was renamed Nett Warrior in June 2010 after Medal of Honor recipient Robert B. Nett (although the term [...] "Nett" [...] has frequently been misinterpreted as a reflection of its tactical networking features). Nett Warrior was first demonstrated in spring 2011, which then was essentially the 10-pound Land Warrior ensemble with some enhanced additional software. Later iterations focused on a hand-held solution that integrated a commercial hand-held screen device with the Rifleman radio, simplifying the system and decreasing weight to 3 lb. Nett Warrior utilizes enhanced smartphones, using different models over the course of its development including the Motorola Atrix, Samsung Galaxy Note I, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMission-critical {{military}} operations with <b>dismounted</b> <b>soldiers</b> are frequently characterized by high battlefield dynamics. In such scenarios a mobility model can manage soldiers' movements dynamically especially under enemy attacks. This paper presents a Group Mobility Model simulating realistic soldier and leader battlefield behaviors. Our model analyzes communication between {{a group of}} <b>dismounted</b> <b>soldiers</b> deployed in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) and their leader under several perturbation factors (e. g., noise and enemies attacks) which affect movements and topology connectivity. Results show that the dismounted soldiers' collective movement improves the capacity of communication channels, whereas noise uncertainty may dramatically destroy the network. Moreover, the enemy's presence, another disorder parameter, changes qualitatively and quantitatively the army's wireless communication topology. Enemy numbers decrease almost linearly the throughput at the sink node (commander). A discussion of results follows, using distributions of path lifetimes, path lengths, packet delivery and group sizes in the communication soldiers' network...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in human behavior modeling for military applications is dealing with all factors that can influence behavior and performance. In a military context, behavior and performance {{are influenced by the}} task at hand, the internal (cognitive and physiological) and external (climate, terrain, threat, equipment, etc.) state. Modeling the behavioral effects of all these factors in a centralized manner would lead to a complex rule-base that is difficult to maintain or expand. To better cope with this complexity we have developed the Capability-based Human-performance Architecture for Operational Simulation (CHAOS). CHAOS is a multi-agent system for human behavior modeling that is based on pandemonium theory. Every agent in CHAOS represents a specific part of behavior, such as Â‘reaction to threatÂ’ or Â‘performing a patrol taskÂ’. These agents are competing over a limited set of resources that represent human capabilities. By combining the element of competition with multiple limited resources, CHAOS allows us to model stress, strain and multi-tasking in an intuitive manner. The CHAOS architecture is currently used in firefighter and <b>dismounted</b> <b>soldier</b> simulations and has shown itself to be suitable for human behavior and performance modeling.

Various methods of computing and displaying shadows exist. This report presents a simple method that is based on bounding volumes. The method provides the rapid generation of shadows.

40|$|Realistic {{interaction}} in 3 D Virtual Environments (VEs) gives Soldiers a greater task focus (e. g. train as you fight), {{instead of focusing}} on the interface or learning training behaviors unrelated to the task. Full-body interfaces include all training interactions, such as navigation, team communication, firing and manipulating weapons, and other relevant domain tasks. For VEs that deal with training and simulation, appropriate interaction mechanisms are critical to providing realistic and immersive experiences that closely mimic real world activities being taught as the computer interface becomes invisible to the user. In particular, <b>dismounted</b> <b>Soldier</b> training requires a VE experience that closely resembles the real world; {{not only in terms of}} visual fidelity, but also in terms of the actions Soldiers need to perform. In this paper, we present a prototype system for <b>dismounted</b> <b>Soldier</b> training, where users can navigate through a virtual environment using natural full body motions. Soldiers can run, jump, crouch, and turn in the VE while still holding their weapon by simply using their bodies, mimicking the motions they would normally do in the real world. Our system makes use of video game console motion controllers including the Microsoft Kinect, Playstation Move, and Nintendo Wiimote, combined with the Unity 3 D game engine to support untethered interaction. Our system makes use of a set of heuristic recognition rules that recognize various actions taken from the Kinectâ€™s depth image 3 D skeleton representation. These rules support seamless transitions between realisti...|$|E
