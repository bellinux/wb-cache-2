50|$|The clue {{instructed}} {{teams to}} travel to Sokolniki Park and search for {{a woman with a}} Shetland Pony to receive their next clue. There, they encountered the Speed Bump and the Detour. For their Speed Bump, Andrew & Dan had to learn and perform a traditional Russian dance to the satisfaction of a choreographer before they could continue racing. The Detour was a choice between Ride the Rails or Ride the Lines. In Ride the Rails, teams had to travel by the Moscow Metro from Sokolniki to Ulitsa 1905 Goda, where they could pick up a samosa from a marked snack stand. The wrapper then directed them to go to Kitay-Gorod and give the samosa to a babushka near the statue of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Slavyanskaya Square, who would give them their next clue. In Ride the Lines, teams had to travel by trolleybus from Sokolniki to Krasnoselskaya Station to find a <b>key</b> <b>maker</b> who would give them a key. The keytag directed them to Rizhskaya Station, where their key would open up a locker. At the end of both Detours, teams received a photo of the VDNKh Metro Station and were told to search the grounds of the station to find their next clue. This clue sent teams to travel by foot to the Pit Stop at the main entrance of VDNKh Park.|$|E

3000|$|... scRNA-seq {{data may}} be useful for {{understanding}} dynamic cellular processes, such as development, reprogramming, differentiation, and disease progression. The underlying premise is that a collection of single-cells will most likely contain cells at different stages during a dynamic process (e.g. differentiation) and profiling their gene expression will allow for the reconstruction of cascades of gene expression changes placing cells in a pseudotemporal order. Pseudotemporal ordering applies machine learning methods to scRNA-seq data to reconstruct cells’ trajectories as they undergo a dynamic biological process. Different algorithms have been implemented for inferring pseudotemporal ordering of single-cells. The first step performed by most temporal ordering algorithms is a dimension reduction such as PCA. For scRNA-seq data, as for bulk RNA-seq, the number of variables or dimensions corresponds {{to the number of}} genes. After dimension reduction, if there is prior knowledge of the <b>key</b> <b>maker</b> genes driving the transition between states, methods such as Wanderlust [82] will use graph-based trajectory detection algorithms to order cells along a path. The key marker genes selected for defining a path’s distance may be previously known genes (e.g. genes known to be involved in a differentiation process) or differentially expressed genes. Single-cells may be clustered into subpopulations before temporal ordering.|$|E
