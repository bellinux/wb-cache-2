40|$|We {{investigate}} quantum corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space M in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type II string theories, {{with particular}} emphasis on instanton effects from Euclidean NS 5 -branes. Based on the consistency of D- and NS 5 -instanton corrections, we determine the topology of the hypermultiplet moduli space at fixed string coupling, as previewed in arXiv: 1009. 3026. On the type IIB side, we compute corrections from (p,k) -fivebrane instantons to the metric on M (specifically, the correction to the complex contact structure on its twistor space Z) by applying S-duality to the D-instanton sum. For <b>fixed</b> fivebrane <b>charge</b> <b>k,</b> the corrections can be written as a non-Gaussian theta series, whose summand for k= 1 reduces to the topological A-model amplitude. By mirror symmetry, instanton corrections induced from the chiral type IIA NS 5 -brane are similarly governed by the wave function of the topological B-model. In {{the course of this}} investigation we clarify charge quantization for coherent sheaves and find hitherto unnoticed corrections to the Heisenberg, monodromy and S-duality actions on M, {{as well as to the}} mirror map for Ramond-Ramond fields and D-brane charges.

The rejection rates for the different <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> distributions, have been calculated by using a standard nanofiltration (NF) model based on the extended Nernst-Planck equation, the local electroneutrality condition and a modified Donnan equation including both steric and electrostatic effects and have been compared with the rejection rate obtained for a homogeneous distribution with the same average <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> concentration.

These formulations are useful in approaching a number of managerial problems in areas such as facility location, production planning or manpower planning.;As <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> problems become large, various methods of obtaining the optimal solution have excessive computational requirements. As a result, a number of methods have been developed for obtaining good but not necessarily optimal solutions.

40|$|Presents {{information}} {{and analysis of}} the network tariffs applicable to household electricity consumers in the southern and eastern states of Australia covered by the National Energy Market. Executive summary: This report presents {{information and}} analysis of the network tariffs applicable to household electricity consumers in the southern and eastern states of Australia covered by the National Energy Market (NEM). The paper is the first of four papers focused on network tariffs from the perspective of households. Key findings include: 	A range of network tariff structures are used throughout the NEM. Inclining block rate tariffs (with small price increments) and two-part tariffs are common. 	The most expensive network tariff in Australia is almost four times higher than the least expensive. 	The average network charge to households in Victoria is about a third of that elsewhere in the NEM 	The gap between least expensive and most expensive network tariff has doubled over the last seven years. 	Network service providers in Queensland have the highest charges and also the greater proportion of their <b>charge</b> is <b>fixed.</b> The Queensland distributors and Ausnet Services in Victoria have increased their <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> significantly recently. In the 2015 / 16 year (not covered in this report Citipower and Powercor have both increased their <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> significantly). 	Network service providers are typically increasing <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> more quickly than variable charges. 	The international comparison shows that network tariffs in Britain are generally much lower than anywhere in Australia. The average network charge in Denmark and New Zealand is roughly comparable to those in Victoria, the lowest network cost jurisdiction in the NEM. 	The proportion of revenue recovered from <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> charged to most consumers in the NEM is higher than that in Britain, Denmark and New Zealand. Some distributors in Victoria have relatively smaller <b>fixed</b> <b>charges,</b> while those in Queensland and Essential Energy in New South Wales have <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> that are much higher than those found elsewhere. In NZ, network tariffs with higher <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> apply to households with high levels of consumption (> 9 MWh per year) ...|$|R
40|$|The Poisson-Boltzmann equation, {{which was}} derived by Shockley in his {{treatment}} of the p-n semiconductor junction at equilibrium, is applied to <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> ionic membranes. The <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> in ionic membranes play the same role as “doping” ions in semiconductors, the major {{difference between the two}} systems being that in the former the mobile particles are ions while in the latter the particles are electrons and phenomenological particles, “holes. ” An important consequence of spatial gradients of <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> is the presence of space charge regions which give rise to an intrinsic electric field and potential. These quantities are established first for the single “lattice” thus providing a continuous treatment of the Donnan equilibrium invoked by Teorell-Meyer-Sievers in their treatment of <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> membranes. It is shown further that when a positive and negative membrane are juxtaposed, the space charge region in the “junction” so formed provides a mechanism for the storage of electrical energy. Thus while the system is basically a “conductor” the presence of transition regions of <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> give rise to the additional property of capacitance. Experimental data are presented on ionic and p-n junctions. The implications of this mechanism for the physical basis of capacitance in biological cells are discussed...|$|R
