5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be <b>held</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E

The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the University of California, San Diego) was attended by over 1,000 delegates, submitting 141 scientific papers. This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be <b>held</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> university, due to size limitations.|$|E

5|$|The French king, Henry II, {{proposed}} to unite France and Scotland by marrying the young queen to his three-year-old son, the Dauphin Francis.

5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird.

Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was <b>held</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> 25° angle below horizontal.
