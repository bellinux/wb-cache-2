40|$|CAFE ("Conditional Access for Europe") is {{an ongoing}} project in the European Community's ESPRIT program. The goal of CAFE is to develop {{innovative}} systems for conditional access, and in particular, digital payment systems. An important aspect of CAFE is high security of all parties concerned, with the least possible requirements that {{they are forced to}} trust other parties (so-called multi-party security). This should give legal certainty to everybody at all times. Moreover, both the electronic money issuer and the individual users are less dependent on the tamper-resistance of devices than in usual digital payment systems. Since CAFE aims at the market of small everyday payments that is currently dominated by cash, payments are offline, and privacy is an important issue. The basic devices used in CAFE are so-called <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets,</b> whose outlook is quite similar to pocket calculators or PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant).

40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} NetPay, a micro-payment protocol characterized by off-line processing, customer anonymity and relatively high performance and security using one-way hashing functions for encryption. In our NetPay prototypes {{we have identified}} three kinds of <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets</b> to store e-coins – a server-side wallet, client-side wallet application, and cookie-based wallet cache. We describe the motivation for NetPay and describe the three kinds of ewallets and their design. We report on prototype implementations of these wallets and end-user perceptions of their use. ...|$|R

Cryptographic protocols protect the exchange of money between the smart card and the machine. No connection to a bank is needed. The holder of the card may use it even if not the owner. Examples are Proton, Geldkarte, Chipknip and Moneo. The German Geldkarte is also used to validate customer age at vending machines for cigarettes.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{comparative}} ethnographic study of everyday life of young professionals in London, Los Angeles, and Tokyo, we conducted a detailed survey of wallets and their contents, through photographs, interviews, diary studies, and observation. Despite prominent differences in culture and lifestyle, there were remarkable similarities across all three sites {{in terms of what}} wallets contained and how they were used. Individuals arrived at similar (if imperfect) solutions to common problems of temptation management and access control, identity management and partitioning, and collecting tokens of affiliation and history. Our findings suggest that future <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets</b> (e-wallets), whether physical devices or distributed functionalities, will be able to capitalize on these existing patterns, solve some of the existing problems, and encounter new challenges. Furthermore, they frame the potential value of e-wallets in a broader context than traditional concerns over privacy, security, and efficiency.

40|$|Abstract The {{problems}} of authentication and identification have received wide interest in cryptographic research. However, {{there has been}} no satisfactory solution for the problem of authentication by a human recipient who does not use any trusted computational device. The problem of authentication arises for example in the context of smart-card-human interaction, in particular in the context of <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets.</b> The problem of identification is very common in communication over insecure networks. This paper introduces visual authentication and visual identification methods, which are authentication and identification methods for human users based on visual cryptography. These methods are very natural and easy to use, and can be implemented using very common &quot;low tech &quot; technology. The methods we suggest are efficient in the sense that a single transparency can be used for several authentications or for several identifications. The security of these methods is rigorously analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{ventures and}} {{financial}} institutions have proposed and are relying upon smartcards and other security processors {{as a method}} for storing and transacting electronic currency. As users begin to accept <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets</b> as a viable option for storing their assets, the security community has placed these devices under closer scrutiny. The idea of using computational faults to break tamper resistant cryptographic devices has been recently highlighted in several publications. Biham and Shamir named this form of attack Differential Fault Analysis (DFA). This paper summarizes the existing research on DFA, describes and analyzes a differential attack on RC 5 that requires only 32 unique faults per partial round, and introduces a practical implementation for mounting such an attack. 1 Introduction The origins of the threat model behind Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) {{can be traced back}} to Anderson and Kuhn's paper on tamper resistance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an extension {{to the current}} Java security model called the &quot;Gateway &quot; and why {{it was necessary to}} create it. This model allows secure applications, such as those used in electronic commerce, to safely exchange data and interoperate without compromising each individual application's security. The Gateway uses digital signatures to enable application programming interfaces to authenticate their caller. JavaSoft is using the Gateway to create a new integrated open platform for financial applications called Java Electronic Commerce Framework. The JECF will be the foundation for <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets,</b> point of sale terminals, electronic merchant servers and other financial software. The Gateway model can also be used for access control in many multiple application environments that require trusted interaction between applications from multiple vendors. These applications include browsers, servers, operating systems, medical systems and smartcards. 1. Electronic Commerce in Java Sun Microsystems Inc.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{signature}} scheme is proposed. It consists of two phases. The first phase is performed off-line, before the message to be signed is even known. The second on-line phase is performed once the message to be signed is known, and {{is supposed to be}} very fast. A method for constructing such on-line/off-line signature schemes is presented. The method uses one-time signature schemes, which are very fast, for the on-line signing. An ordinary signature scheme is used for the off-line stage. In a practical implementation of our scheme, we use a variant of Rabin's signature scheme (based on factoring) and DES. In the on-line phase, all we use is a moderate amount of DES computation and a single modular multiplication. We stress that the costly modular exponentiation operation is performed off-line. This implementation is ideally suited for <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets</b> or smart cards. A preliminary version appeared in the proceedings of Crypto 89.

40|$|We {{consider}} the k-payment problem: given a total budget of N units, represent this budget {{as a set}} of coins, so that any k exact payment requests of total value at most N can be made using k disjoint subsets of the coins. The goal is to minimize the number of coins for any given N and k The actual payments are made on-line, namely without knowing all payment requests in advance. Our motivation is electronic cash, where each coin is a long bit sequence, and typical <b>electronic</b> <b>wallets</b> have only limited storage capacity. The k-payment problem has additional applications in other resource-sharing scenarios. Our results include a complete characterization of the k-payment problem as follows. First, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a given set of coins to solve the problem. Using this characterization, we prove that the number of coins in any solution to the k-payment problem is at least kHN=k, where Hn denotes the nth element in the harmonic series.
