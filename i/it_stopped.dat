5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that <b>it</b> <b>stopped,</b> leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E

The UK suspended its budgetary aid programme in 2012, freezing a £21million donation. The US has also frozen some of its military aid programme for Rwanda, although <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> short of suspending aid altogether.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to run down the hill, where <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E

5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal {{beds in the}} watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Suleiman {{went to war}} for {{the last}} time. The siege of Szigetvár was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle—Zrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes. More than 20,000 Turks had fallen during the attacks {{and almost all of}} Zrinski's 2,300 man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day. Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> the Ottoman push to Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683.|$|E
5|$|Khaplu Palace {{was built}} in 1840 by the Yabgo Raja Daulat Ali Khan of Khaplu after the Dogra of Kashmir who {{captured}} the region decided to move the seat of government from the old fort. The site of the palace was chosen by rolling a large stone down from a nearby cliff; <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> at the Doqsai village, and the palace was built there. The earlier fort was located near {{the location of the}} present-day palace. Khaplu Palace replaced the former fort as the royal residence after its completion. According to Jane E. Duncan, the people of Khaplu used to live inside this fort and were not allowed to build their homes outside its premises. This practice was changed after Maharaja of Kashmir took control of the area, resulting in a cessation of conflict among neighbouring rulers.|$|E

He left some of his luggage there, telling the manageress that he would be away for about eight days, and travelled the next day to Liverpool, where he took a room at the London and North Western Hotel on Lime Street. He bought a ticket to Ireland and took the SS Munster to Dublin via Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). <b>It</b> <b>stopped</b> at Holyhead in Anglesey, where an immigration official challenged Lody. His American travel documents proved sufficient to demonstrate his bona fides, and he proceeded on his way.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1942, Heydrich {{planned to}} meet Hitler in Berlin. German {{documents}} suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German-occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground. Heydrich {{would have to}} pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libeň, was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrich's car slowed, Gabčík took aim with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Instead of ordering his driver to speed away, Heydrich called his car to halt and attempted to confront the attackers. Kubiš then threw a bomb (a converted anti-tank mine) {{at the rear of}} the car as <b>it</b> <b>stopped.</b> The explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš.|$|E
5|$|R.C.

R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine army {{retreated from}} the Sofia Valley towards Ihtiman where <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> for the night. The rumours that the Bulgarians had barred the nearby {{mountain}} routes stirred commotion among {{the soldiers and}} {{on the following day}} the retreat continued in growing disorder. When the Bulgarians under Samuil and probably Roman saw that, they rushed to the enemy camp and the retreat turned to flight. The Byzantine advance guard managed to squeeze through slopes which were not yet taken by the Bulgarian attackers. The rest of the army was surrounded by the Bulgarians. Only the elite Armenian unit from the infantry managed to break out with heavy casualties and to lead their Emperor to safety through secondary routes. Enormous numbers of Byzantine soldiers perished in the battle; the rest were captured along with the Imperial insignia.|$|E
5|$|The Sleaford Navigation was a 12.5 mile (20.1km) {{canalisation}} of the River Slea in Lincolnshire, England, {{which opened}} in 1794. It ran from a junction with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill {{to the town of}} Sleaford through seven locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> short of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. The coming of the railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was blocked by a sluice.|$|E

Bell, an ex-slave, established the Afro-American Sentinel in 1892. In 1893 George F. Franklin started publishing the Enterprise, later published by Thomas P. Mahammitt and edited by his wife, Ella Mahammitt. It was the longest lived {{of any of the}} early African-American newspapers published in Omaha. The best known and most widely read of all African-American newspapers in the city was the Omaha Monitor, established in 1915, edited and published by Reverend John Albert Williams. <b>It</b> <b>stopped</b> publishing in 1929.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can.

5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until <b>it</b> <b>stopped</b> completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E
