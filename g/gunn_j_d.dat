40|$|AbstractPhotoconductance (PC) {{measurements}} of the diffused-region recombination-current pre-factor <b>J</b> 0 <b>d</b> make the approximation of excess-carrier Δn density uniformity. That is, from the front illuminated surface to the rear the Δn is constant. Kane and Swanson outlined acceptable sample parameters such that the error caused by this approximation is small when performing transient <b>J</b> 0 <b>d</b> measurements. For quasi-steady state (QSS) PC measurements, where there is generation, the uniform carrier-density approximation leads to a larger <b>J</b> 0 <b>d</b> under-estimation compared to the transient approach. We avoid this approximation by numerically solving the <b>J</b> 0 <b>d</b> accounting for depthwise generation, recombination and carrier diffusion in the quasi-neutral bulk that occurs during a QSS PC measurement. We demonstrate {{the application of the}} technique to samples with surface-diffusion sheet resistances 10 – 140 Ω/sq., formed by etch back, and a sample where the surface passivation degrades with damp heat exposure. We find, for the samples tested, the direct application of the Kane and Swanson method: i) under-estimates the <b>J</b> 0 <b>d</b> by 2 % to 8 % when the sample bulk is lightly doped (boron doping of 1. 3 × 1014 cm- 3), and ii) under-estimates the <b>J</b> 0 <b>d</b> by 10 % to 80 % when the wafer is moderately doped (phosphorus doping of 1. 5 × 1015 cm- 3), for samples with <b>J</b> 0 <b>d</b> 350 to 2200 fA/cm 2; compared with an experimental uncertainty of 6 %.

Thinopyrum distichum (2 n = 4 x = 28; J 1 dJ 1 dJ 2 dJ 2 d) is a hardy, salt-tolerant {{maritime}} wheatgrass {{indigenous to}} southern Africa. In order to transfer its salt-tolerance to cultivated cereals, the Thinopyrum chromosomes involved {{must first be}} characterized with molecular markers. Thinopyrum distichum chromosomes 2 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d,</b> 3 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d,</b> 4 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> and 5 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> have previously {{been found to be}} major determinants of salt-tolerance. A genotype panel consisting of two triticale/Th. distichum allopolyploids, two Th. distichum/ 2 *triticale doubled-haploids, eight triticale addition-lines (for chromosomes 2 J 1 d; 2 J 1 dβ; 3 J 1 d; 3 J 1 dL; 4 J 1 d; 4 J 2 d; 5 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> and 7 <b>J</b> 2 <b>d,</b> respectively) and two triticale translocation-lines (involving chromosome arms 3 J 1 dS and 3 J 1 dL, respectively) were used for fluorescence-based, semi-automated AFLP-analyses {{and to a lesser extent}} for EST-SSR microsatellite marker-development, to identify molecular markers specific to the critical Th. distichum chromosomes. Thirteen EST-SSR primer pairs produced four putative Th. distichum-specific microsatellite-markers, one of which was specific for critical chromosome 5 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d.</b> AFLP-analysis with 60 selective EcoRI/MseI and 18 Sse 8387 I/MseI primer combinations produced 159 AFLP-fragments specific for Th. distichum. These included seven putative markers for chromosome 2 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d,</b> 15 for 3 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d,</b> one marker for 4 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> and two for 5 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d.</b> A salt-tolerance experiment was done to determine which chromosome 2 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> and 3 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> regions may carry genes for salt-tolerance. Plants were selected that had a monosomic addition of a chromosome 2 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> variant (either the complete chromosome or a modified version referred to as 2 J 1 dβ) in addition to one of four chromosome 3 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> variants (the complete 3 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> chromosome; a 3 J 1 dL-telosome; a 3 J 1 dS-translocation or a 3 J 1 dL-translocation). The results suggested that Th. distichum chromosome-arms 2 J 1 dL and 3 J 1 dS are probably involved in salt-tolerance. A group of 93 trigeneric (Triticum/Secale/Thinopyrum) F 2 secondary hybrids were then analyzed in order to: (i) Evaluate some (ten) of the newly developed putative AFLP-markers; and (ii) attempt to find translocations, telosomes or substitutions involving the critical Thinopyrum chromosomes. Five (50 %) of the ten putative AFLP-markers could be reproduced, but only four proved to be chromosome-specific. It was also possible to assign hese four markers to chromosome arms: E 32 M 49. 118 (2 J 1 dS); E 41 M 49. 103 (2 J 1 dS); E 35 M 49. 137 (3 J 1 d); and E 41 M 49. 188 (3 J 1 dL). The selective primer combination that produced marker E 41 M 49. 103 (2 J 1 dS), also amplified a fragment of the same size on chromosome 4 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d.</b> These markers will be useful for further mapping and selection of the salt-tolerance genes. The fact that only four of the ten putative AFLP-markers evaluated proved to be repeatable implies that the remaining untested markers need to be confirmed against larger genotype panels as well. Probable reasons for the relatively low frequency of markers that turned out to be reliable are discussed. The marker-association study also revealed that visual examination of all electropherograms produced by AFLP-fragment analysis is necessary to correctly identify all AFLP-fragments. Use of the AFLP- and STS-/SCAR-markers in conjunction with the group of 93 F 2 secondary hybrids showed that 18 of these probably carried a 3 J 1 dL-translocation. Several hybrids possibly had translocations involving the 4 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> and 5 <b>J</b> 1 <b>d</b> chromosomes. However, these results need to be confirmed. Various hybrids also appeared to have critical Th. distichum substitutions, although this still requires further confirmation. The identified plant material could prove useful for further characterization of salt-tolerance in Thinopyrum, and its eventual utilization in cereal crops...|$|R

The final failure of the side ligaments happened because of shear lip formation. The tunneled region is characterized by a flat, fibrous fracture surface. In this paper, the experiments of [5] (corresponding to 5 m/s impact speed) are analyzed using a plane strain, dynamic finite element procedure. The Gurson constitutive model that accounts for the ductile failure mechanisms of micro-void nucleation, growth and coalescence is employed. The time at which incipient failure was observed near the notch tip in this computation, and the value of the dynamic J-integral, <b>J</b> <b>d,</b> at this time, compare reasonably well with experiments.
