[...] The civil parish has its own parish council, giving it some limited local government autonomy {{from that of the}} wider Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, and including the status as a statutory consultee on local planning applications. The council comprises 14 locally elected members, councillor Ann Tindall is the parish chairman 2017-2018 and is consulted in planning applications that affect the area through the Shaw and Royton Area Committee of Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council. Shaw and Crompton Community Council, a separate body, meets at least four times per year and is designed to allow local people to put forward their priorities for the area in which they live, suggest improvements and <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>say</b> on how services are run on a local basis.

[...] He further stated that [...] "The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks." [...] To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech, [...] "the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees." [...] Nicholas C. Pano noted that [...] " [...] pronouncements , at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned, had made the policies of de-Stalinization, peaceful coexistence, and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system." [...] Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries, the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew [...] "the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA, {{while at the same time}} demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union." [...] "Thus," [...] the Albanian account continues, [...] "the Khrushchev revisionist group, consistent in its line, cut off all relations with socialist Albania at a time when it maintained contacts with and was drawing ever closer to the most reactionary regimes of the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson and Christie's {{prospectus}} describes its reviewers as [...] "the HISTORIANS of the Republic of Letters" [...] Literary scholar Paul Keen {{has described}} the Republic of Letters as a vision of society in which [...] "all rational individuals could <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>say,</b> and in which an increasingly enlightened reading public {{would be able to}} judge the merit of different arguments for themselves". The practical goal of the Analytical Review was to facilitate this society by summarizing serious new and foreign publications in great depth so that intelligent readers might form their own opinions. This aim was embodied in its initial title: The Analytical Review; or, History of Literature, domestic and foreign, on an enlarged plan. Containing Scientific Abstracts of important and interesting Works, published in English; a general account of such as are of less consequence, with short characters; Notices, or Reviews of valuable foreign Books; Criticism on New pieces of Music and Works of Art; and the Literary Intelligence of Europe, etc. The periodical sought to avoid ephemeral works and to review only [...] "standard works which add to the stock of human knowledge and will live beyond a day". Johnson and Christie also intended to eschew editorializing and to avoid shaping the tastes of the public. Scrupulous attention to this point was meant to bring the reviewed work into the foreground and not the reviewer (a goal shared by many eighteenth-century journals). An early review, for example, criticized historian Edward Gibbon for [...] "so frequently and unnecessarily obtruding his particular prejudices on the eye of his readers". All editors signed their reviews with initials (sometimes not their own) rather than with their names. This practice was meant to prevent the appearance of collusion between the reviewers and the authors reviewed, although this did not succeed in practice. It was also intended to prevent any unethical puffing, or false advertising, of friends' or one's own books; nevertheless, both Henry Fuseli and Mary Wollstonecraft reviewed their own books for the journal.|$|E

Much of the movement's democratic process occurs in [...] "working groups," [...] where any protester is able to <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>say.</b> Important decisions are often made at General assemblies, which can themselves be informed by the findings of multiple working groups. Decisions are made using the consensus model of participatory democracy. This often features the use of hand signals to increase participation and operating with discussion facilitators rather than leaders – a system that can be traced in part to the Quaker movement several centuries ago, to participatory democracy in ancient Athens, and to the spokescouncils of the 1999 anti-globalization movement.|$|E

2500|$|Time is {{allocated}} for {{discussion of the}} annual budget after it is tabled by the Minister of Finance; however, most MPs spend {{much of the time}} questioning the government on other issues. Shad contends that although about 20 days are given for discussion of the budget, [...] "the budget debate is used to hit the government on the head about everything else other than the budget. From potholes to education policy to illegal immigrants." [...] If Parliament votes to reject the budget, it is taken as a vote of no-confidence, forcing the government out of office. The government will then either have to reform itself with a new cabinet and possibly new Prime Minister, or call for a general election. As a result, Shad states that [...] "MPs may criticize, they may <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>say</b> but the government will have its way" [...] {{when it comes to the}} budget.|$|E
