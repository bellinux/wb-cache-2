25|$|Carbohydrate antigens on {{the surface}} of cells can be used as targets for immunotherapy. GD2 is a {{ganglioside}} found {{on the surface}} of many types of cancer cell including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, liposarcoma, <b>fibrosarcoma,</b> leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas. It is not usually expressed {{on the surface of}} normal tissues, making it a good target for immunotherapy. As of 2014, clinical trials were underway.|$|E
40|$|Fifteen <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> surgically excised from presumed {{sites of}} {{injection}} in dogs, and 10 canine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> excised from sites not used for injection were histologically and immuno-histochemically compared with 20 feline post-vaccinal fibro-sarcomas. Canine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> from presumed injection sites were of grade I (3), of grade II (4) and grade III (8). Two <b>fibrosarcomas</b> from non-injection sites were of grade I, four of grade II {{and four of}} grade III. Feline samples were classified as grade I (2), grade II (4) and grade III (14). All <b>fibrosarcomas</b> from presumed injection sites of both species showed lympho-cytic inflammatory infiltration located at the tumour periph-ery, while two canine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> from non-injection sites showed perivascular inflammatory infiltration within the neo-plasm. All samples were immunohistochemically examined for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin and des-min expression. All tumours were positive for vimentin. Ten canine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> from presumed injection sites and all feline samples contained cells consistent with a myofibroblastic immunophenotype. Aluminium deposits were detected in eight canine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> from presumed injection sites and 11 feline post-vaccinal <b>fibrosarcomas</b> by the aurintricarboxylic acid method. The present study identifies distinct similarities between canine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> from presumed injection sites and feline post-vaccinal <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> suggesting the possi-bility {{of the development of}} post-injection sarcomas not only in cats, but also in dogs...|$|R
40|$|Verapamil had {{previously}} been shown to increase cellular melphalan uptake and cytotoxicity in <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> and increased the area under the blood concentration versus time curve (AUC) for melphalan in CBA mice. Verapamil (10 mg kg- 1 i. p.) {{had no effect on}} the fractional distribution of cardiac output (FDCO), measured with 86 Rb-rubidium chloride, to subcutaneous <b>fibrosarcomas.</b> 14 C-Melphalan uptake by FS 13 <b>fibrosarcomas</b> was increased 60 min after verapamil (10 mg kg- 1 i. p.), but not after lower doses which did not affect the AUC. Flunarizine (5 mg kg- 1 i. p.) also had no effect on FDCO to FS 13 <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> and tended to increase 14 C-melphalan content of blood and the <b>fibrosarcomas</b> and to promote growth delay by melphalan. Alcohol increased FDCO to FS 13 <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> maximally at a 1 : 20 dilution in saline, but had no effect on 14 C-melphalan uptake or growth delay. Thus, melphalan cytotoxicity correlated with tumour melphalan uptake, and both followed changes in the AUC for melphalan but not changes in FDCO. In these murine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> melphalan uptake and cytotoxicity were not limited by blood flow. In subcutaneous human melanoma HX 46 xenografts, verapamil had no effect on the FDCO, nor on 14 C-melphalan uptake, and did not affect blood 14 C-melphalan levels, suggesting absence of effects on the AUC and on cellular uptake. Alcohol did not increase the FDCO to HX 46 xenografts, providing evidence for a different vascular supply...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Point {{mutations}} within ras proto-oncogenes, particularly {{within the}} mutational hot-spot codons 12, 13 and 61, are frequently detected in human malignancies {{and in different}} types of experimentally-induced tumours in animals. So far {{little is known about}} ras mutations in naturally occurring canine <b>fibrosarcomas</b> or K-ras mutations in canine melanomas. To elucidate whether ras mutations exist in these naturally occurring tumours in dogs, in the present study we screened 13 canine <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> 2 feline <b>fibrosarcomas</b> and 11 canine melanomas for point mutations, particularly within the mutational hot-spots, making this the first study to investigate a large number of canine <b>fibrosarcomas.</b> None of the samples showed a K- or N-ras hot spot mutation. Thus, our data strongly suggest that ras mutations at the hot-spot loci are very rare and do not {{play a major role in}} the pathogenesis of the spontaneously occurring canine tumour...|$|R
25|$|The {{theory of}} an anti-tumoral {{response}} {{of the immune system}} in vivo was recognized by the physician William B. Coley. In 1968, Dr. Gale A Granger from the University of California, Irvine, reported a cytotoxic factor produced by lymphocytes and named it lymphotoxin (LT). Credit for this discovery is shared by Dr. Nancy H. Ruddle from Yale University, who reported the same activity in a series of back-to-back articles published in the same month. Subsequently, in 1975 Dr. Lloyd J. Old from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, reported another cytotoxic factor produced by macrophages and named it tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both factors were described based on their ability to kill mouse <b>fibrosarcoma</b> L-929 cells. These concepts were extended to systemic disease in 1981, when Ian A. Clark, from the Australian National University, in collaboration with Elizabeth Carswell in Dr. Old's group, working with pre-sequencing era data, reasoned that excessive production of TNF causes malaria disease and endotoxin poisoning.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY-An {{antiserum}} {{obtained by}} the immunization of C 57 BL/HeDp mice with a pool of C 3 Hf/Dp 7, 12 -dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) -induced <b>fibrosarcomas</b> ex-erted a specific cytotoxic activity in vitro on C 57 BL/HeDp chemically induced lymphosarcomas.

2500|$|Inflammation in the subcutis {{following}} vaccination {{is considered}} to be a risk factor in the development of VAS, and vaccines containing aluminum were found to produce more inflammation. [...] Furthermore, particles of aluminum adjuvant have been discovered in tumor macrophages. In addition, individual genetic characteristics can also contribute to these injection-site sarcomas. [...] The incidence of VAS is between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 vaccinated cats and has been found to be dose-dependent. [...] The time from vaccination to tumor formation varies from three months to eleven years. [...] <b>Fibrosarcoma</b> is the most common VAS; other types include rhabdomyosarcoma, myxosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma.|$|E
2500|$|The first Raf gene, v-Raf {{was found}} in 1983. It was {{isolated}} from the murine retrovirus bearing the number 3611. It was soon demonstrated to be capable to transform rodent fibroblasts to cancerous cell lines, so this gene was given the name Virus-induced Rapidly Accelerated <b>Fibrosarcoma</b> (V-RAF). A year later, another transforming gene {{was found in}} the avian retrovirus MH2, named v-Mil - {{that turned out to be}} highly similar to v-Raf. Researchers were able to demonstrate that these genes encode enzymes that have serine-threonine kinase activity. Normal cellular homologs of v-Raf and v-Mil were soon found in both the mouse and chicken genome (hence the name c-Raf for the normal cellular Raf gene), and it became clear that these too had a role in regulating growth and cell division. Now we know that c-Raf is a principal component of the first described mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: ERK1/2 signaling. It acts as a MAP3 kinase, initiating the entire kinase cascade. Subsequent experiments showed that the normal, cellular Raf genes can also mutate to become oncogenes, by [...] "overdriving" [...] MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity. In fact, vertebrate genomes contain multiple Raf genes. Several years later after the discovery of c-Raf, two further related kinases were described: A-Raf and [...] B-Raf. The latter became the focus of research in recent years, since a large portion of human tumors carry oncogenic 'driver' mutations in the B-Raf gene. These mutations induce an uncontrolled, high activity of Raf enzymes. Thus diagnostic and therapeutic interest in Raf kinases reached a new peak in the recent years.|$|E

40|$|In the BPV 1. 69 line of {{transgenic}} mice, the bovine papillomavirus type 1 genome elicits both benign dermal fibroblastic proliferation (fibromatoses) and malignant <b>fibrosarcomas.</b> Because these lesions arise {{only with}} time, nonviral factors {{appear to be}} involved. We have karyotyped several primary tumors {{as well as a}} series of low-passage cell lines derived both from fibromatoses and from <b>fibrosarcomas.</b> The <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> but not the preneoplastic fibromatoses, show consistent abnormalities of one or both of two chromosomes, chromosome 8 (trisomy or duplication) and chromosome 14 (monosomy or translocation). The chromosomal abnormalities are not a direct consequence of the viral integration, which we have mapped to chromosome 15 by in situ hybridization. These results suggest that transgenic mice can be used to study the role(s) of cytogenetic changes in tumorigenesis and may direct the search for genes involved in tumor progression...|$|R

50|$|In infants, <b>fibrosarcoma</b> (often termed {{congenital}} infantile <b>fibrosarcoma)</b> {{is usually}} congenital. Infants presenting with this <b>fibrosarcoma</b> usually {{do so in}} the first two years of their life. Cytogenetically, congenital infantile <b>fibrosarcoma</b> is characterized by the majority of cases having a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 15 (notated as t(12;15)(p13;q25)) that results in formation of the fusion gene, ETV6-NTRK3, plus individual cases exhibiting trisomy for chromosomes 8, 11, 17, or 20. The histology, association with the ETV6-NRTK3 fusion gene as well as certain chromosome trisomies, and the distribution of markers for cell type (i.e. cyclin D1 and Beta-catenin) within this tumor are similar to those found in the cellular form of mesoblastic nephroma. Indeed, mesoblastic nephroma and congenital infantile sarcoma appear to be the same disease with the exception that mesoblastic lymphoma originates in the kidney whereas congenital infantile sarcoma originates in non-renal tissues.|$|E

50|$|In older {{dogs and}} cats tumors are a common occurrence, and may involve any or {{multiple}} body systems: skin, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal tract, urogentital tract, reproductive tract, cardiovascular system, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, the spleen and the lining of body cavities. Common skin tumors include lipomas, mast cell tumors, melanomas, squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> and histiocytomas. Skin tumors are removed through either simple excisions or through excisions needing reconstructive plastic surgery. Common oral tumors include melanomas, <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> squamous cell carcinomas, which are removed with as much surrounding tissue as possible, including parts of the mandible and maxilla.

40|$|Aging is {{the single}} most common risk factor for cancer. Peripheral and marrow-derived stem cells are long lived and are {{candidate}} cells for the cancer-initiating cell. Repeated rounds of replication are likely required for accumulation of the necessary genetic mutations. Based on the facts that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) transform with higher frequency than other cell types, and tumors in aged C 57 BL/ 6 mice are frequently <b>fibrosarcomas,</b> we used a genetically tagged bone marrow (BM) transplant model to show that aged mice develop MSC-derived <b>fibrosarcomas.</b> We further show that, with aging, MSCs spontaneously transform in culture and, when placed into our mouse model, recapitulated the naturally occurring <b>fibrosarcomas</b> of the aged mice with gene expression changes and p 53 mutation similar to the in vivo model. Spontaneously transformed MSCs contribute directly to the tumor, tumor vasculature, and tumor adipose tissue, recruit additional host BM-derived cells (BMDC) to the area, and fuse with the host BMDC. Unfused transformed MSCs act as the cancer stem cell and are able to form tumors in successive mice, whereas fusion restores a nonmalignant phenotype. These data suggest that MSCs may {{play a key role in}} age-related tumors, and fusion with host cells restores a nonmalignant phenotype, thereby providing a mechanism for regulating tumor cell activity...|$|R
