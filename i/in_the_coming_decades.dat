5|$|Kenilworth {{remained}} a ruin during the 18th and 19th centuries, still {{used as a}} farm but increasingly also popular as a tourist attraction. The first guidebook to the castle, A Concise history and description of Kenilworth Castle, was printed in 1777 with many later editions following <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decades,</b> pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} coastguard {{used some}} of the fortifications as bases to combat smuggling. Calshot was a good location for interception vessels to lie in wait and, {{by the middle of}} the century, two officers and forty-two men were stationed there; Sandown Castle in Kent was also used by the coastguard for anti-smuggling operations. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decades</b> some forts were declared obsolete and put to new uses; Portland was disarmed after the war and converted into a private house. Gravesend was superseded by the New Tavern Fort and demolished in 1844. Meanwhile, the ruins of Netley Castle were transformed into a Gothic-styled house from 1826 onwards.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time castles were {{becoming}} tourist attractions for the first time. By the 1740s Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's narwhal horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks. The first guidebook to Kenilworth Castle followed in 1777 with many later editions following <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decades.</b> By the 1780s and 1790s visitors were beginning to progress as far as Chepstow, where an attractive female guide escorted tourists around the ruins {{as part of the}} popular Wye Tour. In Scotland Blair Castle became a popular attraction on account of its landscaped gardens, as did Stirling Castle with its romantic connections. Caernarfon in North Wales appealed to many visitors, especially artists. Irish castles proved less popular, partially because contemporary tourists regarded the country as being somewhat backward and the ruins therefore failed to provide the necessary romantic contrast with modern life.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873, one of them being the {{beautiful}} Love among the Ruins, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed {{it to be an}} oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a number of large pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first Briar Rose series, Laus Veneris, the Golden Stairs, the Pygmalion series, and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years. These years also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that dinosaurs were {{the ancestors of}} birds was first suggested in 1868 by Thomas Henry Huxley. After the work of Gerhard Heilmann in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned {{in favor of the}} idea of their being descendants of generalized thecodonts, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of clavicles in dinosaurs. However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused wishbone, which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; they had been found as early as 1924 in Oviraptor, but misidentified as an interclavicle. In the 1970s, John Ostrom revived the dinosaur–bird theory, which gained momentum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decades</b> with the advent of cladistic analysis, and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. Of particular note have been the fossils of the Yixian Formation, where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.|$|E

5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decades</b> are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E

40|$|Numerous space-borne X-band Synthetic Aperture Radars (X-SAR) {{systems will}} be {{launched}} by European agencies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>decade</b> commencing this year.

This will incur relatively little incremental cost because they have already been funded. X-SAR measurements are especially beneficial over land where rainfall is difficult to measure by means of microwave radiometers that depend on scattering by frozen hydrometeors associated with that rain.
