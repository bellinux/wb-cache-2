The first axis focuses on improving the competitiveness of the <b>farm</b> <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>sector</b> through support for restructuring, development and innovation. The second one concerns the improvement of the environment and the countryside through support for land management as well as helping to fight climate change. Such projects could for example concern preserving water quality, sustainable land management, planting trees to prevent erosion and floods. The third axis concerns improving {{the quality of life in}} rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity. The policy also provides support to the Leader rural development methodology, under which Local Action Groups design and carry out local development strategies for their area.

40|$|A new {{alternative}} landuse, developed, and proven technically {{and economically}} feasible will create {{changes to the}} landscape. If the new landuse is widely accepted there will be widespread landscape changes – NEW LANDSCAPES. As a landuse, Agroforestry is relatively new in New Zealand. It {{can be defined as}} <b>farming</b> <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> activities consciously combined vertically and/or temporally on the same piece of land. The development of this concept has been the result of changes within both the <b>farming</b> <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>sectors.</b> Over the last decade the Agroforestry concept has been developed through the investigation and implementation of the Forest-Farm system, by a team of scientists, from the New Zealand Forest Research Institute and Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. This Forest-Farm system, has alternative management options which involve the integration primarily of Pinus radiata, pasture, sheep and cattle. Woodstock, a joint Lands and Survey and New Zealand Forest Service project is being developed to investigate and demonstrate the Forest-Farm concept, as a commercial enterprise within Hawkes Bay. As a demonstration Agroforestry landscape, Woodstock will become a significant visual resource, expressing change in the fundamental landuse - landform relationship. Landmanagers, and the general community will respond to this change in accordance to their different needs and values. The Landscape Architect's role is to predict, compare and evaluate visual implications before implementation. There should be no excuse for unanticipated, illogical and incompatible surprises. There should be no reason for the different needs and values of the regions small grower, and community not to be satisfied. If the researched Agroforestry options available have limitations in fitting in requirements of both the site and people, then other options within the system will need to be investigated. Design opportunities need to be recognised within the Agroforestry system, so its management will produce a logical, harmoniously integrated landscape...|$|R
40|$|AbstractToday‘s Europe faces {{profound}} structural transformations as {{identified in}} the Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular the transition towards a green, low carbon and resource efficient economy, the demographic ageing of our society and rapid technological advances. Transforming the economy along these paths will increase competitiveness and provide important sources of growth and jobs, as well as addressing economic and social needs. The apparition of agriculture about ten thousand years ago, is considered the first great economic revolution in human history. With it begins a new history, completely different from that which preceded it. Its spreading across the globe changed the relationship between man and nature. Through the invention of agriculture, man has begun to create necessary food products, increasing efficiency of the invested effort and reducing the chaos that marked his existence, there have emerged and have increased human settlements, cultivated land, domestic animals and, on this basis, {{a new way of}} life emerged. [12]The agricultural sector of rural development satisfies an economic way of reasoning which turns out to be insufficient to enable rural areas to apprehend the new issues of territorial cohesion. In order to contribute to Lisbon and Gšteborg objectives, rural development strategies should focus on innovation and transfer of knowledge and good practices, thanks interregional cooperation. The objectives of the EU rural development policy - also known as the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – focus on the enhancement of the social and economic cohesion, on the improvement of competitiveness in <b>farming</b> <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>sectors,</b> <b>and</b> on the amelioration of the environment aiming at landscape conservation and sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{theoretical}} and empirical studies estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of <b>farm</b> <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> activities, <b>and</b> suggest that the potential for carbon uptake in agricultural soils and forest lands {{is much greater than}} current rates. Following a discussion of the estimated current emissions and carbon sequestration by the agricultural <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>sectors,</b> this report presents a brief overview of the available estimates from USDA and EPA carbon mitigation studies, and then discusses some of the limitations of the available data and modeling results. This report is organized into four parts, including a brief overview of the agriculture <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>sectors</b> within the broader climate change debate, as well as various data and information on potential for carbon storage <b>and</b> mitigation from <b>farming</b> <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> activities...|$|R
40|$|In February 2014, EPIC {{conducted}} a two day workshop using scenario planning methodology {{to examine the}} future of the sheep industry in Scotland with a time horizon of 2040. A wide range of participants were given the role of scenario planners, tasked with engaging in strategic thinking through a series of carefully crafted exercises that resulted in the creation of four scenarios set in 2040. The focal question addressed was ‘What will the Scottish sheep industry look like in 2040 and how resilient will it be to livestock disease?’ EPIC scenario planning workshops have created a new space for dialogue amongst a diverse group of sheep industry participants. These include representatives from the Scottish sheep retail <b>sector,</b> <b>farming,</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>and</b> wildlife <b>sectors,</b> veterinarians, epidemiologists, social scientists and Scottish Government policy makers. This exercise has facilitated social learning enabling stakeholders to build strategic partnerships by sharing experiences, understanding one another’s constraints and exchanging knowledge. Information-rich narratives based on important drivers of change (demand, Government prioritisation and technological innovation) for the Scottish sheep industry have been developed. Consideration of disease risk and transmission in each scenario helped to identify potential future vulnerabilities in disease control, surveillance and contingency planning. Strategies that could be implemented today to address these future vulnerabilities were developed. Key questions for policy makers have been framed which consider what actions might be taken now to mitigate future threats or optimise future opportunities, considering issues such as the role of cooperative approaches for disease control and maximising abattoir- based surveillance. EPIC is using these scenarios to determine how drivers of change {{will have an impact on}} industry demographics and the risks of disease introduction and disease spread as well as disease control strategies. Modelling disease incursion will help EPIC scientists understand how the risks of exotic pathogens are altered in different futures. This will improve future tools for disease outbreak prevention and management...|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} an Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data study of Swedish data over 1993 - 2004, it is {{concluded}} that startups in the agricultural <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>sector</b> may cause startups in the remaining sectors of the Swedish economy.

The agricultural <b>and</b> <b>forestry</b> small-business <b>sector</b> is therefore a very {{important factor in the}} quest to reduce unemployment and to increase the economic growth in Sweden. Another important finding, outside of the main purpose of this paper, is that the per capita propensity to start a new firm is significantly higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. Consequently, people in rural areas are more entrepreneurial per capita (in the context of starting new firms) compared to the population living in urban areas. A substantially high fraction of the rural population faces the forced option of unemployment or self-employment. However, fortunately, a disproportionally high share of the rural population chooses the latter alternative...|$|R
