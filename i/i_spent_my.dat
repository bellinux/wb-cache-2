5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>my</b> time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

500|$|Jean MacCurdy {{said that}} How <b>I</b> <b>Spent</b> <b>My</b> Vacation {{makes fun of}} summer {{vacations}} by mocking [...] "the boredom of summer {{and some of those}} horrible car trips" [...] (an issue that was first explored in National Lampoon's Vacation). [...] In the film, the Hampton family car trip is very taxing for Plucky Duck; he is disgusted by the family and is nearly killed by an escaped lunatic that the family mistakes for a hitchhiker (He happens to be a caricature of Jason Voorhees). [...] The film's fictional theme park, [...] "HappyWorldLand", is a spoof of Disneyland. The film also parodies the THX logo and Deep Note when Fowlmouth and Shirley are at the movie theater.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of How <b>I</b> <b>Spent</b> <b>My</b> Vacation was the parody of film, popular culture, and celebrities. Videos for Kids noted that the film makes fun of [...] "California culture and youth" [...] with the use of celebrity caricatures, such as those of Roseanne Barr, Johnny Carson, Arsenio Hall, David Letterman, Jay Leno, Oprah Winfrey, and Sylvester Stallone. [...] The film makes fun of other cartoon characters, such [...] as those of Superman, The Simpsons, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Beavis and Butthead, and The Little Mermaid. [...] Babs and Buster's travels down the river are a parody of the film Deliverance.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Bugs Bunny {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Warner Bros. was planning {{the release of}} How <b>I</b> <b>Spent</b> <b>My</b> Vacation, then {{referred to as a}} [...] "Tiny Toon Adventures home video". Plans for the film began before Tiny Toon Adventures premiered on television. [...] Warner Bros. discussed with executive producer Steven Spielberg whether the film should be released in theaters, but Spielberg insisted on a direct-to-video release. [...] Spielberg said that he wanted to make the film a direct-to-video release because [...] "animated features are ideally suited for the repeat viewing," [...] a factor he found important to the genre's appeal to those watching animated films at home. In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, executive in charge of production Jean MacCurdy did not specify the budget of the film, but stated that it was far more costly than episodes of Tiny Toon Adventures. [...] According to Hal Erickson's Television Cartoon Shows: an Illustrated Encyclopedia, the budget of the average Tiny Toon Adventures episode was approximately $350,000.|$|E

500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>my</b> time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E
500|$|Despite this, much of Scully's work on {{the show}} also {{received}} critical praise. Scully won five Primetime Emmy Awards {{for his work on}} The Simpsons, while Entertainment Weekly cited [...] "How <b>I</b> <b>Spent</b> <b>My</b> Strummer Vacation" [...] as the show's 22nd best episode. Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode a positive review, something he also did for [...] "Behind the Laughter" [...] and [...] "Trilogy of Error", which aired during season 12. He called the latter: [...] "one extremely enjoyable misadventure. The Simpsons may have peaked in the '90s, but that doesn't mean the eight years since haven't delivered their share of quality episodes. This was one of them." [...] Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully, and that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book that blaming a single show runner for what some perceive as the lowering quality of the show [...] "is unfair." [...] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, [...] "Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{stressed}} [...] "patience" [...] {{to begin}} the 1988 season, saying, [...] "We can't just go from the bottom to the top in the snap of a finger... Have patience and stick with the Birds and root for the Birds." [...] After the Orioles lost six consecutive games {{to begin the}} 1988 season, Ripken was fired. Several years later, he said, [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} accept. I had been in the organization. I had worked my way up to the big leagues. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>my</b> life with the Orioles." [...] The move [...] "hurt" [...] and [...] "bothered" [...] Cal Jr., but he worked through it and remained with the team for 13 more seasons, the rest of his career. Billy switched his number from 3 to 7, saying, [...] "I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it." [...] After Hall of Famer Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, the Orioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the longest losing streak to start a season. He finished his managerial record with a record of 68 wins and 101 losses.|$|E
