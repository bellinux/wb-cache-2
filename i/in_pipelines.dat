2500|$|Natural gas is {{typically}} produced {{in association with}} oil from wells. [...] Wells can also be drilled into geological formations that have mostly gas and very little oil. [...] In the infancy of the oil industry, any natural gas produced from oil wells was burned off. Later, states passed [...] conservation laws which required the gas to be captured and transported <b>in</b> <b>pipelines</b> for useful purposes. [...] In order to prevent any gaps in the natural gas regulation when natural gas flows in interstate commerce, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act of 1938. [...] That law required that companies must obtain from the Federal Power Commission (FPC) a [...] "certificate of public convenience and necessity" [...] (certificate) before making any sale for resale natural gas in interstate commerce. The FPC set the maximum prices charged for gas sold under a certificate. For example, if gas flowed from a well in Texas through a pipeline to New York where it was sold to a gas distribution company, the sale by the pipeline to the distributor would need a certificate. [...] The final sale to retail customers were exempt from the law. [...] Although the Natural Gas Act regulated both the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce, the [...] "production and gathering" [...] of gas was exempt from federal regulation, although potentially subject to state control. [...] Production means bringing the gas {{out of the ground}} to a pipe {{at the top of the}} wellhead. [...] Gathering refers to the flow of gas through low pressure lines to the center of a gas field where the gas is treated and compressed to bring it up to the high pressures used in long-distance pipelines.|$|E
