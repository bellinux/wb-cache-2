60|$|The army {{accordingly}} halted, and {{the necessary}} arrangements {{were made for}} the review. The first thing was to ascertain the numbers of the troops; and as the soldiers were too numerous to be counted, Xerxes determined to measure the mighty mass as so much bulk, and then ascertain the numbers by a computation. They made the measure itself in the following manner: They counted off, first, ten thousand men, and brought them together in a compact circular mass, {{in the middle of}} the plain, and then marked a line upon the ground inclosing them. Upon this line, thus determined, they built a stone wall, about four feet high, with openings on opposite sides of it, by which men might enter and go out. When the wall was built, soldiers were sent into the inclosure--just as corn would be poured by a husbandman into a wooden peck--until it was full. The mass thus required to fill the inclosure was deemed and taken to be ten thousand men. This was the first filling of the measure. These men were then ordered to retire, and a <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> was introduced, and so on until the whole army was measured. The inclosure was filled one hundred and seventy times with the foot soldiers before the process was completed, indicating, as the total amount of the infantry of the army, a force of one million seven hundred thousand men. This enumeration, it must be remembered, included the land forces alone.|$|E

The place where Rollo was looking was about the middle of the sky; that is, about midway between the horizon and the zenith.[5] While Rollo was looking at this break, which seemed, while he looked at it, to {{brighten}} up and open more and more, he saw suddenly, to his utter amazement, a large green tree burst into view in the midst of it, and then disappear again a moment afterwards as a <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> of cloudy vapor drifted over. Rollo was perfectly bewildered with astonishment. To see a green tree, clear and distinct in form and bright with the beams of the sun which just at that instant caught upon it, breaking out to view suddenly high up among the clouds of the sky, seemed truly an astonishing spectacle. Rollo had scarcely recovered from the first emotion of his surprise before the clouds parted again, wider than before, and brought into view, first a large mass of foliage, which formed the termination of a grove of trees; then a portion of a smooth, green field, with a flock of sheep feeding upon it, clinging apparently to the steep slope like flies to a wall; and finally a house, with a little blue smoke curling from the chimney. Rollo was perfectly beside himself with astonishment and delight at this spectacle; and he determined immediately to go and ask his uncle to come and see.|$|E

6000|$|But {{the seeming}} {{submission}} of the North was fallacious. The Danes had reintroduced into Britain a <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> of incoherent barbarism, {{which could not}} thus readily coalesce. The Scandinavian leaven in the population had put back the shadow on the dial of England some three centuries. Æthelstan, Eadward's son, found himself obliged to give his sister in marriage to Sihtric or Sigtrig, Danish king of the Yorkshire Northumbrians, which probably marks a recognition of his vassal's equality. Soon after, however, Sihtric died, and Æthelstan made himself first king of all England by adding Northumbria to his own immediate dominions. Then [...] "he bowed to himself all the kings who were in this island; first, Howel, king of the West Welsh; and Constantine, king of Scots; and Owen, king of Gwent [South Wales]; and Ealdred, son of Ealdulf of Bamborough; and with pledge and with oaths sware they peace, and forsook every kind of heathendom." [...] In the West, he drove the Welsh from Exeter, which they had till then occupied {{in common with the}} English, and fixed their boundary at the Tamar. But once more the pretended vassals rebelled. Constantine, king of Scots, threw off his allegiance, and Æthelstan thereupon [...] "went into Scotland, both with a land host and a ship host, and harried a mickle deal of it." [...] In 937, the feudatories made a final and united effort to throw off the West Saxon yoke. The Scots, the Strathclyde Welsh, the people of Wales and Cornwall, the lords of Bamborough, and the Danes throughout the North and East, all rose together in a great league against their over-lord. Anlaf, king of the Dublin Danes, came over from Ireland to aid them, with a large body of wickings. The confederates met the West Saxon fyrd or levy at an unknown spot named Brunanburh, where Æthelstan overthrew them in a crushing defeat, which forms the subject of a fine war-song, inserted in full in the English Chronicle.[1] Three years later Æthelstan died, as his father had died before him, undisputed over-lord of all Britain, and immediate king of the whole Teutonic portion.|$|E

40|$|To ensure {{comparability}} among leaf <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> measurements it {{is important}} to handle the leaves in a standardized manner. In the present work constraints of a commonly used method to achieve full turgor, storage between damp paper towels, were investigated. After overnight rehydration in a saturated atmosphere, the <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> of leaves of 14 species was measured, and the leaves were stored between paper towels (two treatments: moist and wet) at 4 °C. Their mass was measured after 24, 48, and 72 h. Leaf <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> increased during the first 24 h of storage between moist paper towels by an average of 1. 8 %, between wet towels by 3. 3 %. Among the species, the increase of leaf <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> between moist towels correlated with the species' desiccation propensity, indicating that it was rehydration from water loss during initial handling. On the other hand, between wet towels the <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> increase was associated with the species' leaf tissue structure, and it continued to increase beyond 24 h, indicating that the increase was a result of water penetration into the leaf air spaces. It is concluded that storage between moist paper towels results in reliable values of leaf <b>fresh</b> <b>mass,</b> and that desiccated leaves rehydrate well between moist towels. However, care has to be taken to avoid too wet conditions as they may lead to erroneously high <b>fresh</b> <b>mass</b> values, especially in species with large air spaces.

The root and peel extracts were characterized by large mass fractions of inulin (60. 1 and 46. 8 g per 100 g of <b>fresh</b> <b>mass,</b> respectively), predominantly with degree of polymerization {{in the range from}} 3 to 10, while phenolics, determined as caffeoylquinic acids, made up 0. 5 and 1. 7 g per 100 g of <b>fresh</b> <b>mass,</b> respectively. The leaf and seed extracts had decidedly lower mass frac-tions of inulin (1. 7 and 3. 2 g per 100 g of <b>fresh</b> <b>mass,</b> respectively) and higher mass frac-tions of phenolics (9. 6 and 4. 22 g per 100 g of <b>fresh</b> <b>mass,</b> respectively) recognized as caffeoylquinic acids, chicoric acid and quercetin glucuronide. The biological properties of a non-inulin fraction from each extract were determined on Wistar rats fed with diets rich in fructose and saturated fat, as a model of metabolic changes related to westernization of human eating habits. The diets contained the same amount of inulin (6 %) with various phenolic fractions. Some changes were noted in the microbial enzymatic activity of the caecum after feeding for 4 weeks with the diet containing the highest mass fraction of phenolics (0. 208 %), derived from the mixture of peel and seed extracts (decreased activit...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse {{production}} of vegetables {{is widely used}} throughout the world. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations in these closed environments can increase net photosynthesis and yield. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of atmospheric CO 2 enrichment and water supply on the growth of potted bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants, cultivated under controlled environmental conditions. CO 2 was applied daily, and its distribution was monitored above plant rows through micro pipes located at 3. 0 m height. A drip irrigation system with one dripper per plant was used to irrigate the plants. Different volumes of irrigation water, representing fractions of the water volume (Vet) consumed by pot plants growing under no water stress conditions (0. 5 Vet, 0. 65 Vet, 1. 0 Vet, and 1. 35 Vet) with four replications, were evaluated under four different CO 2 levels (atmospheric concentration of 367, 600, 800, and 1000 mmol mol- 1). Total <b>fresh</b> fruit <b>mass,</b> average number of fruits, and water use efficiency were recorded. For the water deficit treatments, the greatest <b>fresh</b> fruit <b>mass</b> was obtained for the highest CO 2 level environment. However, for treatments that received water volumes equal or greater than the evapotranspiration rate, the greatest total <b>fresh</b> fruit <b>mass</b> was observed at the 600 mmol mol- 1 of CO 2 environment. The yield increase due to CO 2 was represented by increase in fruit weight and not in fruit number. Water use efficiency increased in relation to the amount of water applied and it was highest at 600 mmol mol- 1 CO 2 concentration. 200...|$|R
40|$|Friable callus of Melastoma malabathricum {{could be}} induced from the leaf explants on MS medium {{supplemented}} with 1 mg L - 1 N 6 -benzylaminopurine (BA) + 6 mg L - 1 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Continuous subculturing of the friable calluses on the callus induction medium {{could increase the}} callus biomass at every 4 weeks subculture cycle. The production of callus biomass became stable with a growth index of 10 or more after the tenth subculture cycles. The cell suspension culture of M. malabathricum was initially established by culturing the leaf-derived friable callus in the liquid callus induction medium. The cells subsequently grew healthily and maintained well in MS liquid medium supplemented with 0. 25 mg L - 1 BA and 0. 5 mg L - 1 NAA. The growth kinetics of M. malabathricum cells followed a general growth pattern of a sigmoid curve. However, browning occurred when the cultures reached the highest <b>fresh</b> cell <b>mass.</b> In order to maintain healthy cultures, subculturing {{had to be done}} before browning occurred. After nine days of culture, cell inoculums of 0. 75 and 1. 0 g could produce <b>fresh</b> cell <b>mass</b> of 5. 560 and 5. 147 g, respectively. On the 15 th day, cell cultures with initial inoculums of 0. 25 and 0. 5 g produced <b>fresh</b> cell <b>mass</b> of 5. 416 and 6. 150 g, respectively with cell mass increased of 22 and 15 fold, respectively. To maintain the cultures, an initial inoculum of 0. 25 to 0. 5 g of cells could be used and subcultured between 9 and 15 days after initial inoculation...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum {{from the}} right of high {{productive}} potential and large resistance on the water stress can make up the alternative plant for maize silage, especially in regions about the shortages of falls and large concentration of cattle breeding. The valuation of yielding of maize and sorghum by different ways of tillage of soil and sowing (the traditional tillage of the soil and sowing and direct sowing) and different methods of fertilization (traditional projective fertilization and starter fertilization together with sowing) was the aim of investigations. Field trials were conducted in 2008 - 2011 in Didactic-Experimental Station in Swadzim that belongs to the Poznań University of Life Sciences. It was shown that the direct sowing reduced the yields of <b>fresh</b> and dry <b>mass</b> both of the whole plants and stems, leaves and ears/panicles compared with the traditional sowing. The yield of both <b>fresh</b> and dry <b>mass</b> of the whole maize plants, {{as well as its}} vegetative components were significantly lower when compared with analogous sorghum yields. However, the generative organs (ears and panicles) <b>fresh</b> and dry <b>mass</b> yields were observed to be inverse...|$|R
