5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus {{infection}} and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs {{during periods of}} severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E
40|$|The {{integrity}} of all organisms to injury is conserved through intricate mechanisms of response, but none {{more so than}} the immune system of the mammals. The complexity and potency of these mechanisms make them both difficult and intriguing to dissect, but more importantly, the study of the immune system can be of benefit both therapeutically and diagnostically in a range of human diseases. While much have been learnt by studying how the immune system works in both immune and nonimmune diseases in humans and animals, the study of <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> gives an unique opportunity to study the consequences of an immune system inept to work. In this thesis I will present the work done by my colleagues and myself on innate, inflammatory and regulatory immune mechanisms in Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), an immunodeficiency named more in keeping with the usual definition of "variable" than "common", but with manifestations highlighting important principles of our current understanding of the immune system. In this introduction I will first briefly outline the normal human immune response before exploring parts of particular interest to my thesis. Thereafter, I will give a brief overview over <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> before examining the particular features of CVID in depth...|$|R
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In <b>humans,</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|R

5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV) is {{the virus}} that – when the {{infection}} is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> is an X-linked {{condition}} arising from mutations of the gamma subunit of the interleukin- 2 receptor (IL- 2 Rgamma). The IL- 2 Rgamma protein is one chain of the heterotrimeric (alpha, beta, gamma) IL- 2 receptor, but also participates {{in the formation of the}} IL- 4, 7, 9, and 15 receptor complexes. The diagnosis of X-linked SCID is usually relatively simple due to the distinctive immunological presentation; IL- 2 Rgamma-deficient patients typically lacking mature T lymphocytes (T-B+). However, it is becoming clear that this merely represents one extreme of a potential range of clinical presentations. We describe here a novel mutation of the human IL- 2 Rgamma chain (R 222 C) resulting in an unusual immunological phenotype. Although clinically immunodeficient, this patient has normal numbers of peripheral T and B cells, responds normally to mitogenic stimuli, and unusually, has a normal thymus gland. This IL- 2 Rgamma mutation is distinctive in that the protein is sufficiently stable to be expressed at the cell surface. While the T cell receptor repertoire appears complete, suggesting normal T cell differentiation occurs, patient T cells demonstrate a reduced ability to bind IL- 2 and this appears sufficient to cause a deficiency in their ability to participate in antigenic responses. Early clinical recognition of this phenotype is critical as a delay in diagnosis may result in a fatal infection...|$|R
5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV) is a {{lentivirus}} (a {{subgroup of}} retrovirus) that causes HIV infection {{and over time}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E
40|$|The interleukin-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) {{family are}} {{involved}} in regulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) signalling pathways. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune response {{that are responsible for}} sensing pathogens and initiating immunity, while IL- 1 {{is one of the key}} cytokines that mediates inflammation. As such, IL- 1 /TLR signalling pathways and the IRAK family are critical in anti-pathogen responses, inflammation and autoimmunity. The family comprises of four members, IRAK- 1, IRAK- 2, IRAK-M (IRAK- 3) and IRAK- 4, and has a role in both positive and negative regulation of signal transduction. While it was once thought that the family displayed some redundancy, each member of the family is emerging as a distinct and vital contributor to IL- 1 /TLR signalling mechanisms. Knockout mouse studies have explored the relative contribution of each of the IRAKs in IL- 1 /TLR signalling, while the recent generation of kinase-inactive knock-in IRAK- 4 mice have revealed which of IRAK- 4 functions require its kinase activity. IRAK- 2, previously thought of as a pseudokinase, has recently been proposed to have kinase activity that is essential for TLR signalling. Not surprisingly given their critical role in IL- 1 /TLR signalling, the IRAK family members have been implicated in certain disease models including <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> Thus the potential targeting of these essential protein kinases therapeutically is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of Ig-secreting cells (ISCs) from memory B cells requires interactions between antigen-specific (Ag-specific) B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells. This process must be strictly regulated to ensure sufficient humoral immunity while avoiding production of pathogenic autoantibodies. BAFF, {{a member of}} the TNF family, is a key regulator of B cell homeostasis. BAFF exerts its effect by binding to three receptors — transmembrane activator of and CAML interactor (TACI), B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R). To elucidate the contribution of BAFF to the differentiation of B cells into ISCs, we tracked the fate of human memory B cells stimulated with BAFF or CD 40 L. BAFF and CD 40 L significantly increased the overall number of surviving B cells. This was achieved via distinct mechanisms. CD 40 L induced proliferation of nondifferentiated blasts, while BAFF prevented apoptosis of ISCs without enhancing proliferation. The altered responsiveness of activated memory B cells to CD 40 L and BAFF correlated with changes in surface phenotype such that expression of CD 40 and BAFF-R were reduced on ISCs while BCMA was induced. These results suggest BAFF may enhance humoral immunity in vivo by promoting survival of ISCs via a BCMA-dependent mechanism. These findings have wide-ranging implications for the treatment of <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> as well as autoimmune diseases...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The genetic {{analysis}} of <b>human</b> primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> has defined {{the contribution of}} specific cell populations and molecular pathways in the host defense against infection. Disseminated infection caused by bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines is an early manifestation of primary immunodeficiencies, such as severe combined immunodeficiency. In many affected persons, the cause of disseminated BCG disease is unexplained. METHODS We evaluated an infant presenting with features of severe immunodeficiency, including early-onset disseminated BCG disease, who required hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. We also studied two otherwise healthy subjects {{with a history of}} disseminated but curable BCG disease in childhood. We characterized the monocyte and dendritic-cell compartments in these three subjects and sequenced candidate genes in which mutations could plausibly confer susceptibility to BCG disease. RESULTS We detected two distinct disease-causing mutations affecting interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF 8). Both K 108 E and T 80 A mutations impair IRF 8 transcriptional activity by disrupting the interaction between IRF 8 and DNA. The K 108 E variant was associated with an autosomal recessive severe immunodeficiency with a complete lack of circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. The T 80 A variant was associated with an autosomal dominant, milder immunodeficiency and a selective depletion of CD 11 c+CD 1 c+ circulating dendritic cells. CONCLUSIONS These findings define a class of <b>human</b> primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> that affect the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. They also show that human IRF 8 is critical for the development of monocytes and dendritic cells and for antimycobacterial immunity. (Funded by the Medical Research Council and others. ...|$|R
