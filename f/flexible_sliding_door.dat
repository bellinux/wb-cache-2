50|$|Although {{the war had}} impeded Day’s {{ambition}} to become a furniture designer, his fortunes changed in 1948 when he and Clive Latimer won First Prize in the Storage Section of the International Competition for Low-Cost Furniture Design organised by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Their ingenious concept {{for a range of}} multi-purpose storage units fabricated from a tube of pre-formed moulded plywood received international acclaim. Although never mass-produced, a set of prototypes made by Heal & Son in 1949 demonstrated the principles behind the design. Supported on tubular aluminium legs, the cabinets were compact and <b>flexible,</b> with <b>sliding</b> <b>doors,</b> interchangeable shelf and drawer fittings and a writing desk with a drop-down flap.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{operator}} (or <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> opener or automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> operator) is {{a device}} that operates a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> for pedestrian use. It opens the door automatically, waits, then closes it.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{contain a}} motor and {{activation}} system to open them. These are called <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> operators. Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are {{commonly found in}} offices and shop entrances. These doors contain a magnetic locking mechanism that automatically unlocks during emergencies.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{is a type}} of door {{which opens}} {{horizontally}} by sliding, usually parallel to a wall. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several types of <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> such as pocket doors, Arcadia doors, and bypass <b>doors.</b> <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly used as shower doors, glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuel tank}} access door was {{installed}} {{on the right side}} for all versions sold internationally, however, for the LHD models, and the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was on the right side, care needed to be taken to avoid opening the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> when fuel was being added to the fuel tank. An interlock prevented the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> from opening too far when the fuel filler door was open.|$|R
25|$|Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{are open}} and closed either by power, spring, or by a sensor. This {{eliminates}} the need for a person to open or close a door by turning a doorknob or pressing up against a bar on the <b>door</b> itself. Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly found at entrance and exits of supermarkets, department stores, and airport terminals. In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt co-invented the automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

50|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> the edge of the driver's door was extended rearward six inches (152 mm), as {{it was not possible to}} create a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> with the current body shell. When the Windstar was being designed in the early 1990s, Ford claimed that a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was not noted as a key feature indicated by focus groups; also at that time, minivans with that feature had sold very poorly.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} used {{to operate}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> is called <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> gear. There are two standard types, top hung or bottom rolling systems. Both types {{do not have a}} perfect seal. To reduce air- and smoke-tightness and sound insulation, brush seals are commonly used.|$|R
50|$|A single {{compartment}} (with toilets) at the no.1 end of {{the carriage}} was reserved for ladies; {{at the opposite end}} of each car three compartments were reserved for smokers, with brass spitoons recessed into the floor. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted at every third compartment along the hallway, with an additional <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> to separate the five non-smoking from the single ladies' compartment. The partitions fitted with <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were full-height and fitted with luggage racks overhanging the seats, while partitions between back-to-back seats were lower.|$|R

50|$|Opens {{normally}} like {{a traditional}} van <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but unlike most <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> where the track ison {{the exterior of}} the vehicle, this type has it inside and {{on the side of the}} door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> past the trailing edge of the car. However, this design is very unusual and can only be found on the Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on {{the exterior of the}} car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal hinge <b>door.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> of the EK wagon is also electric-powered.|$|R

50|$|A typical ryokan has a {{relatively}} large entrance hall, with couches and chairs where guests can sit and talk; a modernized ryokan often has a television in the hall as well. Guest rooms are constructed using traditional Japanese methods: flooring is tatami, and <b>doors</b> are <b>sliding</b> <b>doors.</b> Even if the inn uses hinged doors for security, it usually opens into a small entranceway where guests can take off their shoes before stepping onto the tatami floor, which would be separated by a <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b> Many ryokan rooms also feature a porch or balcony, also set off with a <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
