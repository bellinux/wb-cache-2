5|$|On 20 December, Canadian forces {{tried again}} and The Royal Canadian Regiment {{attacked}} Cider Crossroads at noon. This time, Vokes {{was determined that}} the operation would be successful, with armoured forces of the Three Rivers Regiment moving to the start lines well before 07:00. Due to shortages of fuel and poor weather, <b>H-Hour</b> was postponed until 14:15. When <b>H-Hour</b> came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the Cider Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective. However, German forces had already evacuated The Gully, falling back {{to prepare for a}} strong defence of Ortona, with elements of the powerful 1st Parachute Division firmly entrenched in the town.|$|E
5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; {{but there would be}} no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that {{he would be able to}} correctly locate the beaches. <b>H-Hour</b> was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not be available in the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough.|$|E
25|$|The RHQ command {{group had}} landed on King Beach about 2 hours after <b>H-Hour,</b> {{and spent the}} night in a shell crater.|$|E
25|$|At 23:49, flotillas of LCAs {{moved off}} from LSIs Karanja, Viceroy of India, and Marnix van Suit Aldegonde to land 11 Brigade {{well on the}} Apple beaches. There was some delay off these westernmost beaches, late in the night of 7 November, as a small French convoy appeared, distracting the minesweepers guiding the LCAs to the beaches. Still, the flotillas {{continued}} toward the objective and A Green flight beached at <b>H-Hour</b> (01:00). A White flight touched down at <b>H-hour</b> + 8 minutes. Some delay and confusion, and damage to landing craft, {{was caused by the}} unexpected shallowness of water and sandbars. Although periscope observations had been carried out, no reconnaissance parties had landed on the beaches to determine local conditions.|$|E
25|$|Their {{mission was}} to provide {{supporting}} small-arms fire and to clear mines and obstacles {{in advance of the}} assault craft. The Canadian landing craft then followed to form up with craft from other Canadian Flotillas. <b>H-hour</b> was set for 7.25, and after a delay of twenty minutes for a more favourable tide in the Juno sector, Prince Davids landing craft started their hour-long trip to the beaches.|$|E
25|$|The brigade {{experienced}} considerable {{problems during}} the landings, with losses of landing craft and hard fire-fights {{going on to}} establish a firm hold. A and C Troops of 218th Bty, less two guns each, landed at Queen White and Queen Red respectively, 45 minutes after <b>H-Hour,</b> when the beach was still under heavy fire. The Battery and A Troop commanders and the regimental medical officer were all wounded but carried on. The remaining guns of these Troops were landed, and the whole battery was in position five hours after <b>H-Hour.</b> By then, Lt-Col Armstrong had arrived {{and set up the}} AA command post on the beach. 220th Battery arrived late, found its intended positions to be still in enemy hands and could not begin landing until the following day (D+1) on Juno beach. Some of the AA gun detachments already ashore on Sword were involved in 'mopping up' isolated German strongpoints. Total casualties for the regiment on D-Day were one officer wounded and evacuated, one other rank killed, five wounded and one missing.|$|E
25|$|The {{date for}} the invasion, Saturday, 10 July, {{occurred}} {{in the second quarter}} of the moon. This was not an ideal phase of the moon where the Navy was concerned; complete darkness would have been preferred. Although the landing ships of the assault forces approached Sicily in a brilliant waxing moon, which would not set until the vessels had stopped in their lowering positions, the LCAs made their approach to the coast in darkness. <b>H-Hour</b> was fixed at 02:45, almost two hours before first light.|$|E
25|$|On Jig Sector, H Trp's recce party landed 15 {{minutes after}} <b>H-Hour</b> and had got four guns ashore by 14.40, {{together}} with two triple 20mm mountings of B Trp 320 Bty. But fighting {{was still going}} on around Le Hamel and rough seas meant that further unloading was delayed. J Troop got three guns ashore (one towed gun being drowned) but the LCT carrying {{the rest of the}} Troop suffered an engine failure and could not land until D + 3 (9 June). By the end of D-Day, 395 Bty had 9 Bofors and two 20mm mountings ashore, covering the beach exits, where men of H Trp had helped the Royal Engineers to clear mines.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} <b>H-Hour</b> was set {{at midnight}} of the 11th. Led by Maj Sheonan Singh, the first stick of forty Paras were inserted in the first flight of two Mi-8s. The formation, led by Wg Cdr Sapre and Sqn Ldr Vinayraj as number two, approached the drop zone in low visibility observing complete black-out. The flights had only their formation lights—situated {{on top of the}} tail boom—switched on. These were turned off as the flight entered its short finals. Because of this complete blackout, the direction of approach of the first flights was missed by the Tigers. The two helicopters therefore entered the landing ground unopposed. However, as the commandos disgorged and moved to take defensive positions, they were pinned down by sustained fire from the Tiger positions. Both Sapre and Vinayraj's flight came under fire as they took off on full power, but did not suffer any hits. Under heavy fire, the paras were unable to mark the drop-zone in time for the next stick. As the second flight approached the dropzone, the pilots Flt Lt V Prakash and Sqn Ldr Duraiswami could identify the flashes of small arms fire and grenades. However, added to this, the tracers from the SLAF gunship detailed for the diversionary attack were also identified as groundfire. The pilots, unable to identify the dropzone after considerable efforts, aborted the mission. The paras on the ground were by this time nearly completely encircled by the Tigers.|$|E
25|$|The next day, four U.S. {{military}} personnel were {{stopped at a}} roadblock around 9:00 PM outside PDF headquarters in the El Chorrillo neighborhood of Panama City. Marine Captain Richard E. Hadded, Navy Lieutenant Michael J. Wilson, Army Captain Barry L. Rainwater, and Marine First Lieutenant Robert Paz had left the Fort Clayton military base and {{were on their way}} to have dinner at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Panama City. The U.S. Department of Defense reported that the servicemen had been unarmed, in a private vehicle and that they attempted to flee only after their vehicle was surrounded by an angry crowd of civilians and PDF troops. The PDF asserted later that the Americans were armed and on a reconnaissance mission. The PDF opened fire and Lieutenant Paz was fatally wounded by a round that entered the rear of the vehicle and struck him in the back. Captain Hadded, the driver of the vehicle, was also wounded in the foot. Paz was rushed to Gorgas Army Hospital but died of his wounds. He received the Purple Heart posthumously. According to U.S. military sources, a U.S. Naval officer and his wife witnessed the incident and were detained by Panamanian Defense Force soldiers. While in police custody, they were assaulted by the PDF. The U.S. Naval officer spent two weeks in hospital recovering from the beating. PDF soldiers sexually threatened his wife. The next day, President Bush ordered the execution of the Panama invasion plan; the military set <b>H-Hour</b> as 0100 on 20 December.|$|E
25|$|Bravo and Charlie {{companies}} of 1st Battalion 5th SFG crossed the Kuwait border at <b>H-Hour</b> with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges {{to clear a}} path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of Nukyab, Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA 534 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab serching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites. Bravo company set out for the central town of Ar Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. whilst waiting, the reconnaissance team fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (whom were clearing suspected east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove {{into the middle of the}} firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.|$|E
500|$|... and [...] The force {{arrived at}} Dekays Bay before dawn on 2 January 1944 {{to find the}} shore {{obscured}} by low hanging clouds and drizzling rain. Admiral Barbey postponed <b>H-Hour</b> from 06:50 to 07:05 to provide more light for the naval bombardment, and then to 07:25 to allow the landing craft more time to form up. The destroyers fired 1,725 5-inch rounds, while rocket-equipped LCIs fired 624 4.5-inch rockets. There was no concurrent aerial bombardment, but Fifth Air Force B-24 Liberators, B-25 Mitchells and A-20 Havocs bombed Saidor airstrip later that morning.|$|E
500|$|The new offensive, {{which opened}} on 5 September 1943 with the 7th Division landing at Nadzab by air and 9th Division landing at Lae from the ships of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force, saw the rapid capture of Lae. While the 7th Division {{moved up the}} Markham and Ramu Valleys, the 9th Division made another landing at Scarlet Beach near Finschhafen. The timing of the landing was contentious, with Barbey, who feared air attack, wanting to land at night while Herring held out for a dawn landing, {{threatening}} to take the issue to General MacArthur. Eventually Berryman managed to persuade Herring to accept a compromise <b>H-hour</b> in the darkness before dawn. The U.S. Naval Historian Samuel Eliot Morison noted: [...] "The Australians proved to be right; 'Uncle Dan's' outfit was not prepared for a neat night landing. The usual SNAFU developed." [...] But Berryman saw Herring as being uncooperative, and his intransigence {{as a sign of}} battle weariness.|$|E
500|$|The {{landings}} {{were scheduled}} to start at 06:30, [...] "H-Hour", on a flooding tide, preceded by a 40-minute naval and 30-minute aerial bombardment of the beach defenses, with the DD tanks arriving five minutes before <b>H-Hour.</b> The infantry were organized into specially equipped assault sections, 32 men strong, one section to a landing craft, with each section assigned specific objectives in reducing the beach defenses. Immediately behind the first landings the Special Engineer Task Force was to land with the mission of clearing and marking lanes through the beach obstacles. This would allow the larger ships of the follow-up landings to get through safely at high tide. The landing of artillery support was scheduled to start at H+90 minutes while the main buildup of vehicles was to start at H+180 minutes. At H+195 minutes two further Regimental Combat Teams, the 115th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division and the 18th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division were to land, with the 26th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division to be landed on the orders of the V Corps commander.|$|E
500|$|<b>H-Hour</b> for {{the landing}} at Gold {{was set at}} 07:25 on King sector (50 minutes later than in the American landings, because of {{differences}} in the tide). The first wave on King was the 5th East Yorkshires and 6th Green Howards of 69th Brigade, assisted by amphibious DD tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards. The 7th Green Howards landed at 08:20. The original plan called for the 38 DD tanks to be launched from their landing craft tank (LCTs) about [...] out. Due to extremely choppy seas, they decided to run the tanks directly onto the beach. Infantry, engineers, and DD tanks arrived almost simultaneously. Units disembarking onto the beach immediately came under fire from the casemated 88mm gun at La Rivière, and the infantry were forced to take cover behind the sea wall. The gun was taken out when a flail tank of the Westminster Dragoons fired a charge directly into its aperture. The 5th East Yorkshires, supported by several tanks, {{spent the rest of}} the morning clearing out the heavily fortified houses of La Rivière, at the loss of 90 men, including six officers.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Canadian Engineers {{continued}} {{assembling the}} Bailey bridge {{throughout the night}} and 12 hours after <b>H-Hour,</b> traffic was rolling across the IJssel. [...] This allowed Phase 2 of the operation to proceed and soon troops of 146th Brigade and tanks of the Ontario Regiment were moving up to 56th Brigade's positions. [...] There was relatively little resistance in the morning, although the South Wales Borderers had to beat back a counterattack near the Railway Junction. [...] In the late morning the British advanced towards a large Enka BV factory complex in the eastern area of the city where a battalion of the 346th Infantry and troops of the 46th Festungs Machine Gun Battalion {{had set up a}} strong point. [...] The Germans had moved in from Oosterbeek that morning and had thus escaped the earlier bombardments. [...] The 4th Battalion The Lincolnshire Regiment were tasked to clear the complex, although the Germans – being relatively fresh – were able to offer some resistance. [...] With support from the tanks of the Ontario Regiment, and the 79th Division the Germans were eventually overwhelmed in a battle which lasted most of the day. [...] By the evening of 13 April most of the resistance in the city had broken and the 147th Brigade were preparing to cross into Arnhem.|$|E
2500|$|On Sword, the CO of G Troop landed 45 {{minutes after}} <b>H-Hour</b> {{and because the}} recce parties of H and I Trps were delayed, he reconnoitred {{positions}} {{for the whole of}} 322 Bty.

2500|$|The LCA type {{was confronted}} with many {{challenges}} on D-Day; some presented by the Neptune plan, some by the enemy defences, and others by the weather. The initial seaborne assault on the Normandy coast broke with previous Allied practice, {{in that it was}} made in daylight. The invasion could occur 6 June because the date satisfied certain preliminary requirements. Of particular concern to landing craft, <b>H-Hour</b> was fixed forty minutes after nautical twilight. <b>H-Hour</b> was also fixed for three hours before high-water mark. The tide in the English Channel rises from west to east (high water in Utah area occurs approximately 40 minutes before it occurs in the Sword area), and so some difference in <b>H-Hour</b> were planned among the assault areas in order to provide the initial assault landing craft the full advantage of a rising tide. Among the many variable concerns to be considered by the planners was whether to land below, among, or above the line of Element 'C' obstacles. The sea conditions at many places along the coast (6' waves and [...] currents) were just at the outside operational limit of the LCA. The setting of the Transportation Area [...] from shore presented an additional complication for LCAs operating in the Western Task Force Area in these condition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the actual}} landing at Lebidos Bay, the Italians went ashore at <b>H-Hour</b> minus six in a diversionary attack on nearby Doganbey Island. [...] This was {{followed}} by the main landing force led U.S. Marines along with the French and Greek troops. After securing the beach-head and setting up a defensive perimeter, the landing force was re-embarked onto the amphibious shipping off-shore, concluding Exercise Longstep.|$|E
2500|$|... 394 Battery landed two guns on King Sector of Gold Beach by 08.45 (75 {{minutes after}} <b>H-Hour).</b> The first of E Trp's Crusaders bogged down and its engine was flooded, but the gun {{remained}} manned although the Mk I Bofors it was towing was 'drowned'. The rest of E Trp had been diverted. F Trp's recce party beached at 09.15, but its first Crusader, towing a Mk I Bofors, did not arrive until 17.00, {{and the remainder}} at 20.30.|$|E
2500|$|Somers next {{participated in}} the {{invasion}} of Normandy as a convoy escort and, in August, the Southern France invasion, providing naval gunfire support as well as serving in the anti-submarine screen. [...] On 15 August 1944, four hours before <b>H-Hour,</b> D-Day, along the French Riviera, Somers encountered and sank the German corvette UJ6081 and the sloop SG21 at the Battle of Port Cros. Following this action, she moved inshore to give gunfire support to the invasion. For two days she bombarded enemy strongpoints off the coast near Toulon with 5inch (127mm) shells and then exchanged fire with enemy shore batteries east of Marseilles. Although Somers sustained many hits during this action, she emerged the victor.|$|E
2500|$|Cyril Falls, the 36th (Ulster) Division historian, {{wrote in}} 1922 that at {{conferences}} and in questionnaires {{there was some}} criticism of <b>H-Hour</b> being a few minutes too early and that the creeping barrage had moved too quickly but that the troops had kept up, which contributed {{to the success of}} the attack. The mine explosions had guaranteed the capture of the front system up to the red line and had thoroughly demoralised the Germans further back; the tanks had been useful and had prevented some casualties but were not essential {{to the success of the}} attack. All regimental officers praised the rear-area services for their prompt arrival on the ridge with supplies, stores and equipment. The infantry judged the new platoon structure introduced in February 1917 with SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, to have turned platoons into [...] "...a little self-sufficing force, an army in miniature....", some of which had been led with great tactical skill.|$|E
2500|$|The two South African brigades {{advanced}} with 40mm Bofors guns {{marking the}} lines of advance between the respective battalions and the first objectives on the Corps objective line called [...] "Oxalic" [...] were occupied by the Natal Mounted Rifles at 2350. [...] The Cape Town Highlanders were the last battalion to reach their individual unit objectives on Oxalic – and were established on Miteiriya Ridge by 0800 the following morning. [...] The fact that the 1st and 10th Armoured Divisions had not broken through into the open areas west of the line as originally planned, meant that Montgomery had to change his orders – moving to an attritional World War I type of battle, which Montgomery in a semblance of a novelty – dubbed [...] "Crumbling Actions." [...] By the evening of 26 October (as from the <b>H-Hour</b> on the 23rd), the South Africans had suffered 600 casualties, as compared to 2,000 in the 51st Division, 1,000 Australians and a similar number of New Zealanders.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June, the {{battalion}} {{carried out a}} detailed reconnaissance of Point 5140. It disclosed that the enemy had put in place seven sangars on the peak; two {{on the top and}} five towards the east. Joshi, decided to attack Point 5140 with Bravo Company, under the command of Lieutenant Sanjeev Singh Jamwal, and Delta Company, under the command of Lieutenant Vikram Batra, from two sides; East and South. At the Hump Complex, the two officers, Jamwal and Batra, received their briefing about the mission from Joshi. During the briefing, Jamwal chose the words [...] "Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!" [...] to be the success signal for his company whilst Batra chose the words [...] "Yeh Dil Mange More!" [...] (This heart wants more! — from a popular advertising slogan of Pepsi [...] ) as his success signal for his company. D-Day was set for 19 June, and <b>H-Hour</b> (the time at which an assault begins) at 2030.|$|E
2500|$|On the 19 October 1944, Sigourney shelled Red and White Beaches {{to cover}} {{underwater}} demolition teams reconnoitering the landing sites near Dulag and Tacloban. She and Cony (DD-508) {{remained in the}} area while the remainder of TG77.2 withdrew to the south to cover the approaches to the Leyte Gulf through Surigao Strait. The two destroyers fired night harassing and interdiction fire on beaches, roads, and installations. On the 20th, they bombarded the beaches until <b>H-hour</b> and then provided call-fire support until the 24th when word was received from the Commander, 7th Fleet, {{to prepare for a}} night engagement. Sigourney, Aulick (DD-569), and Welles (DD-628) were in the van as Attack Section 2 of DesDiv [...] "X-Ray" [...] which would screen the battle line consisting of six battleships. In the screening position, they did not take part in the torpedo attacks on the Japanese fleet launched by other American destroyers. On 29 October, Sigourney withdrew from Leyte and returned to Seeadler Harbor, arriving on 3 November.|$|E
2500|$|Operation Lightfoot {{started at}} 2140 on 23 October with a five-hour fire plan, {{the start of}} which {{signified}} <b>H-Hour</b> for the infantry assault.

They were also allocated a mobile element of the 8th Royal Tanks. The divisional artillery, reinforced by three troops from X Corps was to fire a fire-plan of timed concentrations – using smoke on the intermediate and final objectives to cover re-organisation and to help with direction finding.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approach}} to Gold area {{was to be}} no easy matter for the LCAs scheduled to make <b>H-Hour</b> at 07:25. The assembly of the flotillas proved difficult, with the seas running higher than in other landing areas. The timing schedule was upset by the tide, which was driven in-shore by a strong north-westerly wind, with water levels running 30 minutes earlier than normal. After the assault, 2,500 obstacles were counted that the Germans had emplaced on this coastal front of [...] It proved almost impossible for engineers and beach obstacle clearance parties to make lanes through these barriers until the tide fell. For much of the morning, Germans in fortified resistance nests directed a withering fire on to flights of LCAs touching down on the beach, which added to the troubles of the assault units. At approximately 09:50, approaching the shore side town of Asnelles, five of the LCAs transporting No.47 Royal Marine Commando ashore blew up mines or were wrecked on beach obstacles {{with the loss of}} more than a fifth of the Commando before they reached the beach.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the front}} of FR 5 the {{reinforced}} II Battalion was to a narrow-front attack straight down Hill 145 and just before <b>H-Hour</b> the battalion was squeezed into every patch of cover up Hill 145 from the Transfeld Crater.

Twenty minutes before zero hour, torrential rain began and high winds sprang up. Each man carried three smoke candles to form a smoke screen but they were soaked by the rain; the ground was covered in {{waterlogged}} shell-holes and became much muddier, causing to the infantry to lag behind the creeping barrage. In the XIX Corps attack, the 15th (Scottish) Division attacked with [...] who were forced back after reaching Gallipoli. The 61st (2nd South Midland) Division troops was stopped about [...] short of Schuler Farm. After losing {{about a third of the}} men and half of their officers, the survivors fell back to the start line.

The 48th (South Midland) Division was to advance [...] with the 143rd Brigade on the right flank and the 144th Brigade on the left. The first objective of the 143rd Brigade was the trench from Winnipeg and Springfield and the second objective the south end of the Wilhemstellung. The creeping barrage and the overhead barrage by 64 machine-guns would lift twelve minutes after <b>H-Hour</b> and move at [...] in twelve minutes, then accelerate to [...] every eight minutes. The higher ground beyond was to be bombarded by smoke shell, shrapnel and gas for three hours.

Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of the guys on the boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach. [...] "They were dropping all those bombs on the place where we were going in" [...] and his company had to disembark [...] "without getting bombed by our own guys". [...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if {{he knew that he was}} the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was actually going to be the first ashore. [...] Besides, I was too scared to think about it". Afterwards, he was hailed in a Pentagon press release as [...] "the first GI to invade Europe". The Baltimore Sun said of Schroeder afterwards, [...] "when his boot touched French soil, it was a great moment in history". He earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during World War II, in addition to numerous other decorations.|$|E
50|$|The terms D-Day and <b>H-Hour</b> {{are used}} {{for the day and}} hour on which a combat attack or {{operation}} is to be initiated.
