LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH HYPOTHESES Many scholars agree on the role played by a limited number of strategic relationships in order to achieve and maintain competitive advantages in domestic and international markets (Diericks, Cool, 1989; Morgan, Hunt, 1999; <b>Dyer,</b> <b>Sing,</b> 1996) and underline the critical role of trust in implementing lasting relationships among economic actors (Morgan, Hunt, 1994; Hakansson, Snehota, 1995). Indeed, these relationships require highly specific learning processes and idiosyncratic investments that will appear risky unless high commitment of participants, collaborative climate and trust reduce the chance of failure (Geyskens, Steenkamp, Kumar, 1998; Jap, 1999). Regarding trust, a number of topics are often debated in the marketing literature: the interpersonal...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of electric dipole moments (EDM) for fundamental particles signals time-reversal symmetry (T) violation accompanied by violation of parity (P); only upper limits {{have been established}} to date.

The neutron is an attractive system for an EDM search, both because it is neu- tral and because a neutron EDM would be relatively easier to interpret than the comparable quantity for a nucleus or even an atom.

40|$|Publisher's copy made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the publisherIt has been suggested that the appropriate length of insertion for double-lumen tubes can be estimated by external measurement. This study examined the accuracy of external measurement in estimating the actual length of insertion required in 130 patients. It also examined the relationship between the length inserted and the patient’s height in 126 patients and their weight in 125 patients. Although there was a fair correlation between the measured external length and the final inserted length (r= 0. 61), the 95 % confidence intervals of slope and intercept allowed a large variation and the prediction was too wide to be clinically useful. Height was reasonably well correlated with the final length (r= 0. 51) but an equally wide 95 % confidence interval rendered it of little clinical value. There was no correlation between weight and final tube length. It is concluded that external measurement alone is not adequate to predict a clinically acceptable position of the double-lumen tube. R.

40|$|The {{provision}} of care is an increasingly pressing {{issue in the}} Global North. With an ageing population and policies encouraging women into the labour market, {{there is a growing}} need for workers to undertake paid caring. This poses important and urgent questions about the social organisation of labour markets. Care work typically is low paid and undertaken in precarious, informal, or temporary situations. Many posts are filled by economic migrants, raising concerns about a care deficit in sending countries. In this paper we examine the 'caring work' undertaken by migrant workers in a West London hospital. We employ a twofold characterisation of caring work. Like other bottom-end service sector work, this work is characterised by the face-to-face 'emotional labour'. However, it also requires 'body work': close and often intimate physical contact between carers and those they care for. We argue that both of these aspects are important in understanding how caring work is constructed as poorly regarded and low paid. We show how these features play out in particular ways for migrant workers employed in such caring work.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between UT-Battelle, LLC and Southwire Company was to jointly develop a low cost, commercially viable, water-repellant {{anti-icing}} coating system for high voltage transmission lines. Icing of power lines and other structures caused by freezing rain events occurs annually in the United States, and leads to severe and prolonged power outages. These outages cause untold economic and personal distress for many American families and businesses. Researchers at the Department of Energy <b>s</b> <b>Oak</b> Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee have previously developed a set of superhydrophobic coatings with remarkable anti-icing properties that could potentially be sprayed or painted onto high-tension power lines and pylons. These coatings drastically reduce ice accumulation on these structures during freezing rain events. The project involved obtaining technical input, supplies and test high voltage cables from Southwire, along with the joint development of anti-icing coating techniques, which {{would result in a}} commercial license agreement between Southwire and ORNL, and potentially other companies requiring water repellent anti-icing coatings...|$|R
