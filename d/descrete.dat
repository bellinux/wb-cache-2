40|$|An element {{having the}} {{mechanism}} of timevarying threshold has been proposed by S. Aida and denoted as an IMICTRON. Several applications of the IMICTRON have already been discussed. The most distinguishing property of the IMICTRON is its time-varying threshold level with a function of reintegration, which {{makes it possible to}} realize a fuzzy logic, such as required for the dynamic visual-pattern-recognition network discussed here. The other method using the time-varying threshold is named the Varishold method, which is an abbreviation of the variable threshold method. In this system, the threshold is applied in a <b>descrete</b> time, whose level is variable in each sampling time.

Here KGl is a canonical compactification of the general linear group.

The method is based on the A*-search algorithm and needs no essential off-line computations. The algorithm works in an implicitly <b>descrete</b> configuration space.

The reliability of this method is confirmed by the model data sampled randomly on a sinusoidal process, and by the data measured in the cylinder of a motored diesel engine having a direct injection system. Furthermore, it is clearly shown that the spectrum in the frequency range higher than the Nyquist frequency defined by the mean data rate can be analyzed by this method, {{and that it is}} not necessary to change the range of frequency analysis despite a little variation of mean sampling rate...|$|E

40|$|A linearizing {{operator}} or projection is {{a device}} which converts nonlinear information into linear form. A well-known {{example of a}} linearizing projection is the Shapley value, both in the <b>descrete</b> case (Shapley, 1953) and the continuous case (Aumann and Shapley, 1974). A linearizing projection usually satisfies certain axioms of rationality which insure {{that it is the}} "unique, fair" allocation or distribution. Thus it is an admiriable bookkeeping device because bookkeeping must be linear. In Ruckle (1982) a first attempt was made to treat the Aumann-Shapley theory of values in the setting of functionals defined in an arbitrary Banach space E. This paper continues the effort begun in Ruckle (1982) by constructing three global theories of linearizing projections (or x 0 -value). These theories are called "global" because they refer to spaces of functionals which are defined on the entire Banach space E.

These experiments show that microtubule protein is present in oocytes of all sizes assayed and that the amount is simply related to the volume of the oocyte. In the largest oocytes microtubule protein constitutes 1 % of the soluble protein and this amount does not change on maturation and fertilization. These results show that the changes occurring in the oocyte on maturation which allow the cytoplasm to support microtubule polymerization occur {{as a result of a}} modification of the pre-existing microtubule protein, not from protein synthesis de novo.
