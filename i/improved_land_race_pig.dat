40|$|Aspects of the {{pathophysiological}} {{responses of}} weaner pigs fed raw and cracked-soaked and cooked Nigerian M. pruriens seed meals were investigated using twenty-five large white x <b>land</b> <b>race</b> weaner <b>pigs</b> with weights ranging from 17 to 22 kg in a 56 days (8 weeks) experiment. Raw Mucuna meal (RMM) and cracked soaked and cooked meal (CSCM) {{were incorporated into}} weaner pigs diets at 15 % and 20, 30 and 40 %levels respectively and tested against a control diet with 0 % Mucuna meal. The results revealed that raw Nigerian Mucuna seeds is poisonous to pigs at 15 % dietary inclusion level and significantly (P< 0. 5) affected the hematological and serum biochemical indices of the pigs. It resulted in 40 % mortality among this group with dead animals manifesting lung collapse, emaciation serous atrophy of fat and enlarged urinary bladder at post-mortem. Preheated Mucuna seed meal, however proved safe for pigs at different dietary inclusion levels but did not improve most of the hematological and serum biochemical parameters measured. Pigs fed Mucuna bean diets had significantly (P< 0. 05) elevated levels of serum albumin, cholesterol, creatinine and polymorphs but decreased levels of eosinophils and monocytes {{when compared with the}} control group. At 15 % dietary level of raw seed, the pigs had statistically similar total serum protein, serum calcium, K +, HCO 3 -, total white blood cell and lymphocytes but significantly (P< 0. 05) increased hemoglobin concentration when compared with the control. Increasing the dietary levels of the preheated seeds also resulted in reduced weight gains among the pigs. This study therefore suggests that raw Mucuna bean is poisonous to weaner pigs but relatively safe after preheats treatment. However, changes in hematological and serum biochemical parameters indicated poor nutrient utilization and muscle damage among pigs receiving higher levels of preheated seeds...|$|R

40|$|RAPD {{profiles}} {{were used}} to identify the extent of diversity among 54 accessions of mung bean that included both <b>improved</b> and local <b>land</b> <b>races.</b> Out of the 40 primers screened, seven primers generated 174 amplification products {{with an average of}} 24. 85 bands per primer. The RAPD profiles were analysed for Jaccard’s similarity coefficients that was found to be in the range from 0 to 0. 48, indicating the presence of wide range of genetic diversity at molecular level. Cluster analysis was carried out based on distances (1 -similarity coefficient) using neighbour-joining method in Free Tree package. The dendrogram resolved all the accessions into two major clusters, I (with 11 accessions) and II (with 43 accessions). However, the cluster was further divided into four subclusters (II A with six, II B with nine, II C with 15 and II D with 13 accessions). The distribution of the accessions in different clusters and subclusters appeares to be related to their performance in field conditions for 10 morphological traits that were scored. This study indicated that the RAPD profiles provide an easy and simple technique for preliminary genetic diversity assessment of mung bean accessions that may reflect morphological trait differences among them.

The phytochemistry of Ontario ginseng <b>land</b> <b>races</b> was characterized using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a diode array detector (DAD), evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD), or mass spectrometry (MS) to assess ginsenoside and monosaccharide content. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used successfully as a metabolomic tool to distinguish Ontario ginseng <b>land</b> <b>races</b> and ginseng species.

Modern varieties of wheat are bred in {{the conditions of}} conventional (high imput) farming. That is why the organic farmers asked about the suitability of <b>land</b> <b>races</b> of soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or different species like emmer wheat grown in the past (Triticum dicoccum SCHUEBL). The paper results {{from the study of}} fourty <b>land</b> <b>races,</b> two intermediate and ten modern varieties of soft wheat in comparison to ten <b>land</b> <b>races</b> of emmer wheat at two locations in the Czech Republic. We evaluated tuft shape, length of plant, length and width of flag leaf, length and density of spike and awnedness. The modern varieties of soft wheat are characterised by a high level of uniformity. Their tuft shape is erect or semi-erect and length of plant is 60 - 70 cm, it does not rise the weed competitiveness. On the other hand, they have a medium or long flag leaf whose width is narrow or medium. Length of spike is medium or long. On the other hand, emmer wheat <b>land</b> <b>races</b> have the same tuft shape as forgoing modern varieties. Length of plant (89 - 119 cm) is the positive aspect of the weed competitiveness. Their flag leaf is narrow, but it is compesated by its length. The spike is shorter than the spike of modern varieties of soft wheat, but it is effectivelly compensated by an increased density. Intermediate wheat <b>land</b> <b>races</b> are characterised by looselly spreading tuft shape which puts the weeds down, but on the other hand, it favours the mildew because of the microclimate of soil. Its flag leaf is very short and narrow. Length of spike is medium and it is lax dense. The group of <b>land</b> <b>races</b> of soft wheat is characterised by a high diversity.

The mean values were used for plotting the accessions in agraph. All accessions were grouped into eight distinct groups, which differed amongst themselves. Group II was thelargest comprising 25 accessions followed by Group V having 13 accessions with moderate grain yield and fodder yield. Group VI consisted of 3 accessions with high yield and medium fodder yield besides moderate 1000 grain weight andear head compactness. Group VIII had 3 accessions classified into medium grain yield with high fodder yield consistingof compact ear head and bold grains. <b>Land</b> <b>races</b> are the primitive cultivars which are selected and cultivated by farmersfor many generations. <b>Land</b> <b>races</b> have more genetic diversity, wider adaptability and high degree of resistance to bioticand abiotic stresses and even respond to selection for high yield.
