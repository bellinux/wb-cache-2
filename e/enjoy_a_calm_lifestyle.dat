50|$|Following the French Revolution's Reign of Terror, society {{settled into}} <b>a</b> <b>calmer</b> <b>lifestyle</b> in which {{miniature}} and portrait paintings became popular. Mayer painted portraits {{of women and}} children, family scenes, self-portraits and miniatures of her father. She attained a degree of success, exhibited Self-Portrait of Citizenness Mayer Pointing to a Sketch for a Portrait of Her Mother, and exhibited at every salon thereafter. At the 1801 salon she exhibited Self-Portrait with Artist's Father: He Points to a Bust of Raphael, Inviting Her to Take This Celebrated Painter as a Model. Sensitive to the viewpoint of women artists, Mayer had her work presented as the student of Greuze and Suvee {{so that they would}} be more acceptable to the public. She worked in Jacques-Louis David's studio in 1801 and adopted a direct and simple style under his tutelage, but still depicted sentimental scenes.|$|R
50|$|Cosmopolitan and flourishing, Alexandria {{possessed a}} varied {{population}} of Greeks, Egyptians and other Oriental peoples, including a sizable minority of Jews, {{who had their}} own city quarter. Periodic conflicts occurred between Jews and ethnic Greeks. According toStrabo, Alexandria had been inhabited during Polybius' lifetime by local Egyptians, foreign mercenaries and the tribe of the Alexandrians, whose origin and customs Polybius identified as Greek. The city <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> political history under the Ptolemies. It passed, {{with the rest of}} Egypt, into Roman hands in 30 BC, and became the second city of the Roman Empire.|$|R

5000|$|Her {{family moved}} to Syria when she was six months old and she grew up between the two countries. She spent a long period in the US after 1982, when an Islamist {{uprising}} in Syria was being violently put down. [...] She realized she was gay when she was 15 and it terrified her. After planning to attend Agnes Scott College in Atlanta, Georgia, {{she decided not to}} attend because she was troubled by the number of open lesbians on campus. She came out at 26 and returned to Syria to <b>enjoy</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> life. There she taught English until the uprising closed classes.|$|R
60|$|Neither {{were the}} women only his consulters; the grave merchants, who were anxious for many ventures at sea, {{applied to the}} boy for his opinion of their security, and they looked upon his opinion to be as safe as the {{insurance}} office for ships. If he but told them, though the ship was just set sail, and a tempest rose just after on the ocean, {{that it would have}} a successful voyage, gain the port designed, and return home safe laden with the exchange of traffic and merchandize, they dismissed all their fears, banished all their cares, set their hearts at ease, and, safe in his opinion, <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> of mind amidst a storm of weather.|$|R
50|$|Breslich <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> {{relatively}} <b>calm</b> {{expansion of}} the new college, overseeing {{the construction of the}} Music Building (now Kulas Hall). He worked hard to establish a common campus out of the predominantly German Wallace south campus and the Baldwin University north campus. His wife brought many of the campus traditions and fight songs of the University of Wisconsin-Madison to the new campus, many of which lasted until the mid-20th century.|$|R

25|$|Gee <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> {{relatively}} <b>calm</b> {{tenure at}} Vanderbilt compared to Brown. He was generally well liked by faculty and students, demonstrated by his high student approval ratings. In 2005, when Gee's approval saw a comparatively sharp drop, it still stood at 88.4%. During his tenure, Vanderbilt saw {{a dramatic increase}} in student applications— more than 50% in six years—and a rise in the SAT scores of incoming freshmen. Under his tenure, the university completed a $1.25 billion fundraising campaign two years ahead of schedule.|$|R
50|$|Halcyon Days (1996) is a {{collaborative}} album by the ambient musicians Steve Roach, Stephen Kent and Kenneth Newby. This album {{was recorded in}} the period from December 17 to 28, 1995.

They go on to record, in amusingly bad style, songs about terriers but discover to Gerry's frustration that the recording engineer is yet another of Cookie's ex-boyfriends (Steven Porter). Sherri Ann and Christy have entered into a partnership (It is unknown if either Leslie has died or if he has gotten divorced from Sherri Ann.) and publish a magazine for lesbian owners of purebred dogs, called American Bitch. Harlan fulfills his dreams and becomes a ventriloquist, entertaining sparse crowds with a honky tonk song and dance number. Stefan and Scott {{are in the process}} of designing a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs appearing in scenes, with appropriate costume, from famous classic films, such as Gone with the Wind and Casablanca (and McMillan and Wife, for some reason.) Hamilton and Meg Swan have given Beatrice away, allowing them to <b>enjoy</b> <b>a</b> <b>calmer,</b> more loving partnership as well as a new dog (a pug) named Kipper, that they claim enjoys watching them make love. The closing shot is of the Pug attempting to have sex with the therapist's leg.|$|R
50|$|Padua then <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> {{period of}} <b>calm</b> and prosperity: the {{basilica}} {{of the saint}} was begun; and the Paduans became masters of Vicenza. The University of Padua (the second university in Italy, after Bologna) was founded in 1222, and as it flourished in the 13th century, Padua outpaced Bologna, where no effort {{had been made to}} expand the revival of classical precedents beyond the field of jurisprudence, to become a center of early humanist researches, with a first-hand knowledge of Roman poets that was unrivalled in Italy or beyond the Alps.|$|R
500|$|Before resigning, Rutherford's {{government}} had called a Royal Commission into the Alberta and Great Waterways affair, and this commission had not {{reported by the}} time that Sifton took office. [...] Between that and the proroguing of the legislature, the new Premier <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> that lasted until November 10, when the legislature reconvened. [...] Conservative leader Edward Michener attacked the government's speech from the throne for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office. [...] In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach in his own party on the railway question. [...] Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of [...] "pioneer" [...] railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's emptier areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres. [...] Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A be built. [...] Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a [...] "responsible company". [...] These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.|$|R
50|$|From 1515-1519, Zahir ud-Din Muhammad Babur <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> {{relatively}} <b>calm</b> {{period when}} he returned to Kabul in the aftermath of his defeat at the Battle of Ghazdewan and loss of Transoxiana to the Uzbeks. But all that came to an end, when he had troubles with the Pashtuns who are various mountain tribes {{on either side of the}} current Pakistan-Afghanistan border, which had previously yielded an imperfect obedience or none to the throne of Kabul. The Pashtuns have never been subdued or conquered per se but only restrained. Baburs’ predecessors like Alexander the Great, Mahmud Ghazni, Muhammad Ghori, Genghis Khan and Timur Lane all either managed to only restrain the Pashtuns for a while or did not bother them at all in order to avoid a bloody and needless confrontation. But Babur had no choice as he had to confront the people in his immediate territory.He too had to make alliances and give autonomy to the Pathans in order to maintain peace.|$|R

The artist who principally painted portraits of priests or monks, led such <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> and pious <b>lifestyle</b> that he was given the nickname De Heilige or The Holy One. He married Maria Catharina van der Boven, the daughter of a lawyer, in 1726. This marriage produced no issue. He was successful as an artist, and able to buy a house on the prestigious Meir in Antwerp and assemble a large collection of Flemish and Dutch masters there.|$|R

When Jackie gets involved in a petty crime of robbery, he propels himself into the world of DNA Hackers, Shylocks (Loan Sharks) and Gang Fights.

40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{and sustaining}} planning strategy is globally important for metropolitan areas. Sustainable planning addresses {{the development of}} strategies to reduce the use of resources, increase economic efficiency and improve integration of social aspects (e. g. pedestrian friendly environments, well balanced public and private transport modes, efficient street networks; land use, movement economy; access for all to jobs, retail, services, healthcare, culture, and leisure). In order to reduce urban sprawl, numerous authors recommend {{going back to the}} concept of compact cities. However, policies favoring the compact city concept turned out to be less efficient than expected. Indeed, a large number of households choosing these areas reject urban density since they prefer living in individual houses surrounded by <b>a</b> garden and <b>enjoy</b> <b>a</b> green and <b>calm</b> environment. Hence, instead of rejecting urban sprawl it seems more reasonable to find solutions for better managing the dynamic aspects of cities, in order to reduce traffic costs and pollution, and to avoid undermining natural and agricultural resources. Frankhauser (2004) first proposed reflections onto what extent planning concepts referring to fractal geometry could be of interest for reducing negative impacts of urban sprawl. In a recent research project, financed by the French Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea in the framework of the PREDIT research program, a planning concept was developed concretizing this basi...|$|R
