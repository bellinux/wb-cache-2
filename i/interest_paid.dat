5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross {{resigned}} late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was {{directly related to the}} dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with tuberculosis. On February19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).|$|E

25|$|This also {{explains}} why a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage {{with the same}} APR would have different monthly payments and a different total amount of <b>interest</b> <b>paid.</b> There are many more periods over which to spread the principal, which makes the payment smaller, but there are just as many periods over which to charge interest at the same rate, which makes {{the total amount of}} <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> much greater. For example, $100,000 mortgaged (without fees, since they add into the calculation in a different way) over 15 years costs a total of $193,429.80 (interest is 93.430% of principal), but over 30 years, costs a total of $315,925.20 (interest is 215.925% of principal).|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} on corporate bonds and government bonds is usually payable twice yearly.

25|$|Effective annual {{interest}} or yield may be calculated or applied differently {{depending on the}} circumstances, and the definition should be studied carefully. For example, a bank may refer to the yield on a loan portfolio after expected losses as its effective yield and include income from other fees, meaning that the <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> by each borrower may differ substantially from the bank's effective yield.|$|E

But it has no net impact on the banks' profits. Banking, optimistic borrowers, imperfect competition...|$|R

50|$|Telenet was an American {{commercial}} {{packet switched}} network which went into service in 1974. It was the first packet-switched network service that was available to the general public. Various commercial and government <b>interests</b> <b>paid</b> monthly fees for dedicated lines connecting their computers and local networks to this backbone network. Free public dialup access to Telenet, for those who wished to access these systems, was provided in hundreds of cities throughout the United States.|$|R
25|$|Adjustable rate mortgages, {{like other}} types of mortgage, usually allow the {{borrower}} to prepay principal (or capital) early without penalty. Early payments of part of the principal will reduce {{the total cost of}} the loan (total <b>interest</b> <b>paid),</b> but will not shorten the amount of time needed to pay off the loan like other loan types. Upon each recasting, the new fully indexed interest rate is applied to the remaining principal to end within the remaining term schedule.|$|E
25|$|DIRT is deducted {{at source}} by {{financial}} institutions From 1 January 2014, DIRT is charged at 41% (was 33% in 2013) for payments made annually or more frequently. The tax is deducted {{by the bank}} or other deposit-taker before the interest is paid to you. DIRT will be charged at 36% (in 2013, lower rates in previous years) for payments made less frequently.This higher D.I.R.T. rate has been abolished, as and from the 1st January 2014, and the D.I.R.T. rate of 41% applies to any <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> or credited on these deposits on or after the 1st January 2014.|$|E

The cost of <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> on loans during construction is not included. The largest cost is that associated with constructing the two new lock complexes—one each on the Atlantic and Pacific sides—with estimated costs of US$1.11 billion and US$1.03 billion each, plus a US$590 million provision for possible contingencies during their construction.|$|E

25|$|When {{the crisis}} loomed, {{one way to}} try to avert it was to simply start {{reducing}} the <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> on discretionary and demand deposits. But such a move would have hurt the Medici name, and so it was undertaken too late. The bank's heavy leverage of their deposits meant that setbacks could be quite sudden. The fact that it {{seems to have been a}} common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when bad loans were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, {{there has been a}} high degree of <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is transformational leadership, which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is transactional leadership, which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.|$|E
25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the <b>interest</b> <b>paid</b> on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E
