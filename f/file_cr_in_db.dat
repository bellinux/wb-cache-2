Kriging and cokriging were used to predict the spatial distribution of <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> the topsoils and subsoils. Paired-samples t test and spatial distribution maps were used to compare the <b>Cr</b> concentrations <b>in</b> topsoils and subsoils. The mean <b>Cr</b> concentration <b>in</b> ZJG topsoils was significantly higher than that in ZJG subsoils and the mean <b>Cr</b> concentration <b>in</b> CS topsoils showed no significant difference from that in CS subsoils. The <b>Cr</b> concentrations <b>in</b> topsoils were higher than those in subsoils over most of the area of ZJG and part of CS, suggesting that Cr accumulation had occurred in these areas and extrinsic factors have an important role controlling the distribution of <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> topsoils. Semivariogram/cross-semivariogram was used to evaluate soil Cr spatial variability. The <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> ZJG topsoils, ZJG subsoils, and CS topsoils had moderate spatial dependence and the <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> CS subsoils had strong spatial dependence. <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> ZJG subsoils had longer effective range than <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> ZJG topsoils, suggesting that the anthropogenic factors affecting <b>Cr</b> distribution <b>in</b> ZJG topsoils; and <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> CS topsoils had longer effective range than <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> CS subsoils, indicating that soil formation may be the major explanation for the decrease in the variation of <b>Cr</b> <b>in</b> topsoils.

40|$|The mutant sigA allele of Bacillus subtilis DB 1005 was {{confirmed}} to be temperature sensitive (ts) and transferable among strains of B. subtilis by chromosomal transformation and gene conversion. This ts sigA allele had a pleiotropic effect on gene expression of DB 1005. The induction of certain heat shock proteins <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 1005 was markedly less significant than that {{observed in the}} wild-type strain (DB 2) under heat stress. In contrast, some proteins required for coping with oxidative stress and glucose starvation were induced abruptly <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 1005 but not <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 2. Heat induction of the groEL gene in vivo at both transcription and translation levels was much lower <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 1005 than <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 2. Besides, the putative sigma A-type promoter from the groESL operon of B. subtilis {{was able to be}} transcribed by the reconstituted sigma A RNA polymerase in vitro at both 37 and 49 degrees C. These results strongly suggest that the expression of the groEL gene of B. subtilis under heat stress is regulated at least in part by sigma A at the level of transcription. Our results also showed that DB 1005 did not respond too differently from the wild type to ethanol stress, except after a relatively long exposure...|$|R

40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} (CR), {{a nutritional}} intervention of reduced energy intake but with adequate nutrition, {{has been shown}} to extend healthspan and lifespan in rodent and primate models. Accumulating data from observational and randomized clinical trials indicate that <b>CR</b> <b>in</b> humans results in some of the same metabolic and molecular adaptations that have been shown to improve health and retard the accumulation of molecular damage in animal models of longevity. <b>In</b> particular, moderate <b>CR</b> <b>in</b> humans ameliorates multiple metabolic and hormonal factors that are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality. In this paper, we will discuss the effects of <b>CR</b> <b>in</b> non-obese humans on these physiological parameters. Special emphasis is committed to recent clinical intervention trials that have investigated the feasibility and effects of <b>CR</b> <b>in</b> young and middle-aged men and women on parameters of energy metabolism and metabolic risk factors of age-associated disease in great detail. Additionally, data from individuals who are either naturally exposed to CR or those who are self-practicing this dietary intervention allows us to speculate on longer-term effects of more severe <b>CR</b> <b>in</b> humans...|$|R
