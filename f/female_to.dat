5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the <b>female</b> <b>to</b> mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the <b>female</b> <b>to</b> fertilize the egg.|$|E
25|$|In {{neonatal}} life, gonadal steroids {{influence the}} development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For instance, they determine the ability of <b>females</b> <b>to</b> exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and <b>females</b> <b>to</b> display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.|$|R

5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by the female. The female will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold the female and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the <b>female</b> <b>to</b> solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following copulation.|$|E

When groups of wildebeest join together, the <b>female</b> <b>to</b> male ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting.|$|E

5|$|Males attract mates by {{constructing}} specially-shaped tunnels {{in which}} they sing. Mating {{takes place in the}} male's burrow; the male may widen a tunnel {{to make room for the}} <b>female</b> <b>to</b> mount, though in some species mating is tail-to-tail. Females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially-dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus Neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the <b>female</b> <b>to</b> show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E

5000|$|M. australica is a gregarious ectoparasitoid {{and when}} the female oviposits on a host she {{releases}} a pheromone which attracts other <b>females</b> <b>to</b> that site. All of the progeny resulting form a mating are laid on the same host and they develop together, consuming the host's tissues and eventually killing it. The newly mature <b>females</b> move <b>to</b> the original oviposition site and release a pheromone which induces nearby <b>females</b> <b>to</b> co-operate in forming a group, called a [...] "chewing circle", which chews through the cuticle of the host allowing the adult wasps to escape. The adults, however are solitary and after mating the males die and the <b>females</b> move <b>to</b> a new host.|$|R
