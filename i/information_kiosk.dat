40|$|Public <b>information</b> <b>kiosks</b> are {{becoming}} more and more common. However, their user interfaces are still based on simple button interfaces, which may be implemented with physical buttons or with virtual buttons drawn on a touchscreen. We have implemented a multimodal kiosk prototype that is based on touch and speech input. This paper describes an evaluation in which 23 users compared five area selection techniques for touchscreens. These techniques are based on selection time, touch pressure and direct manipulation. The results show that pressure-sensitive techniques offer a possible alternative to the other selection techniques, but require careful designing. Our time-based technique was the most intuitive and the direct manipulation technique was understood well after an initial learning phase.
