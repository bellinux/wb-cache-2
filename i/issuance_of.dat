30|$|Besides {{the effect}} on the pure {{decision}} of issuing versus not issuing, we analyze which instruments banks choose to respond to liquidity needs. If the decision on the instrument follows the pecking order, banks would only issue debt instruments to minimize the cost of asymmetric information and, therefore, the liquidity and growth variables would only be significant for debt issuances. If the decision on the instruments follows the trade-off theory, we should observe significant coefficients in all financial instruments because the banks have to combine the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> all types of financial instruments to maintain the same proportion of each component. This result could be consistent with the fulfillment of capital regulation, if banks issue both hybrid and capital instruments to keep their regulatory capital levels constant. Nonetheless, if the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> eligible capital instruments are meant to fulfill capital regulation at the lowest possible cost, we could observe <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt and hybrid instruments only, but not capital instruments.|$|R
30|$|The {{transition}} of Spanish banks {{to a business}} model more dependent on market financing has enabled them to decouple {{the evolution of the}} loan activity from the capacity to collect deposits. The high demand of international markets for financial products issued by Spanish banks enabled and fueled the high demand for loans with the consequent growth of banks’ balance sheets during the years prior to the crisis. In this study we find that the financial development and the access of banks to financial markets has increased the vulnerability of the banking sector, not only to shocks in the financial markets (Almazán et al. 2015) but to deterioration in the capital meant to absorb losses. More concretely, we find that banks with higher expansion in their balance sheets finance their liquidity needs with <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt instruments. At the same time, we find that the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt are correlated with the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments because hybrids were the instrument used by banks to comply with the higher regulatory capital requirements derived from the expansion of the (risk-weighted) assets.|$|R

3000|$|... 1. Low Capital is a dummy {{variable}} {{that takes the}} value of one if the bank has a Basel capital ratio below 10 % and zero otherwise. Banks closer to the regulatory limit {{are less likely to}} finance their growth based only on debt issuances compared with banks with a capital buffer over the minimum because this financing would deteriorate their capital ratio even more. In this case, we expect that the coefficient of this variable will be negative for the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt and/or positive for the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> instruments considered regulatory capital. If the pecking order holds, we should observe a positive and statistically significant sign only in hybrid issuances, whereas the statistical significance of both hybrid and capital instruments would support the trade-off theory.|$|R
