The work {{is aimed at}} {{studying}} the phenology and ecology of the warble and breeze flies of marals in the Mountain Altai and at the development of measures of struggle with them. For {{the first time the}} questions of the ecology and phenology of the breeze and warble flies of the marals, their spreading have been studied. The method of the phenological prognosis of the flies development rate has been developed. The scheme of the calculation of the economic loss sum to be caused by the flies to the maral farming has been offered. For the first time, the episootologic situation on the <b>hypodermatosis</b> and pharyngomyosis of the marals in the Mountain Altai has been studied. The optimal terms of performance of the anti-flies measures with the application of the synthetic pyretroides and parasitocides of the wide spectre of action have been determined. The Instructions 'About Measures on Prophylactic and Therapy of Animal Entomosis' and the recommendations 'The Fly Invasion of Marals of Altai, their Prophylactic and Therapy' have been developedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
