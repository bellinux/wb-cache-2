40|$|The use of chirped {{long period}} {{gratings}} (CLPGs) for monitoring the flow, {{the direction of}} the flow and the subsequent cure of an epoxy resin is presented. The asymmetric properties of the CLPG and its sensitivity to refractive index changes were exploited to facilitate the measurement of {{the direction of the}} flow. The performances of a continuously chirped LPG (CCLPG) and a step chirped LPG (SCLPG) were compared, with the CCLPG showing improved spatial resolution. The CCLPG and SCLPG were also used to monitor changes in the refractive index of the resin during cure, with the results showing close agreement with measurements undertaken simultaneously using a fibre optic <b>Fresnel</b> <b>refractometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe cure {{monitoring}} of composite parts {{is an important}} key to optimize the industrial curing cycles. In this study, it is proposed to monitor the cure of a thermosetting resin by a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>refractometer.</b> The measurements are first compared to dielectric analyses and predictions of a thermo-kinetic model that uses parameters from the literature. Under isothermal conditions, {{the results show that}} the Fresnel power can be directly exploited to obtain qualitatively the degree of conversion. This is also demonstrated in anisothermal conditions by correcting the Fresnel signal from its temperature dependence. If the initial degree of conversion is known, its quantitative assessment is achieved using the Fresnel and temperature measurements. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 54 : 626 - 635, 2014.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the process and}} technique used to fabricate reproducible optical fibre long period gratings (LPG) of various types. It explores {{how they can be}} exploited for use as highly selective and sensitive sensors. A versatile method for fabricating LPG sensors has been demonstrated. The single system has the capability of fabricating LPGs of different configurations, such as uniform period, those operating at the phase matching turning point (PMTP), as well as phase shifted and chirped. LPGs were characterised for their sensitivities to temperature, axial strain and surrounding refractive index. The gratings at the PMTP were found to show higher sensitivities to external influences. Novel sensing configurations that exploit the properties of LPGs were also constructed. An LPG coated with a molecularly imprinted ceramic coating was demonstrated to offer a selective method for porphyrin detection. A composite nanoscale of a titanium oxide (TiO 2) matrix and 5, 10, 15, 20 Tetrakis-(N-methyl-piridinium 4 - yl) - 21 H, 23 H-porphine tertakis (p-toluenesulfonate) [TMPyP] porphyrin template film was deposited on the LPG via liquid phase deposition. Attempts to rebind porphyrins to the matrix were carried out. The LPGs transmission spectrum exhibited a higher sensitivity to the target TMPyP template than it did to other, structurally similar porphyrins, showing high selectivity. A continuously chirped long period grating (CCLPG) sensor for monitoring directional flow and cure of an epoxy resin is also presented. The asymmetric properties of the CCLPG were exploited to facilitate the measurement of the direction of the flow. The CCLPG was also used to monitor changes in the refractive index of the resin during its cure, showing close agreement with a fibre optic <b>Fresnel</b> <b>refractometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{research}} conducted on in situ process monitoring (cure and flow) of resin transfer molded {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} composites using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG), etched bare fiber optic sensors and <b>Fresnel</b> <b>refractometers.</b> In this direction, a laboratory scale resin transfer molding (RTM) apparatus was used with the capability of visually monitoring the resin filling process as well as embedding fiber optic sensors. Both FBG and etched fiber sensors are embedded into glass fiber rein-forcements in the RTM mold, and are used to monitor the flow front during the resin injec-tion and subsequently the cure cycle. Moreover, the cure cycle of the resin system utilized in this work is studied using an in-house developed <b>Fresnel</b> based <b>refractometer.</b> The data gathered from corresponding cure monitoring experiments have been compared with the results of polymer extraction experiments and excellent correlation between the results was observed. The embedded FBG sensors also allow the determination of mechanical stresses or loads on the in- service composite parts, through interrogating these sensors. This process is referred to as Structural Health Monitoring, which is not considered within the scope of this thesis work...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a long period}} grating (LPG) based sensor is {{investigated}} as a possible alternative to current process monitoring sensors used {{in the manufacture of}} composites to monitor cure. An LPG is demonstrated as a means of monitoring the cure of a UVcured epoxy resin. The wavelength shift of the attenuation bands were measured during the cure of the resin and compared with measurements made using a fibre optic <b>Fresnel</b> based <b>refractometer.</b> The results showed a good correlation (6 x 10 - 3 rius) and illustrate the potential of the techniques for non-invasive composite material cure monitoring. Alternative fibre grating methods; a chirped LPG sensor, an in-fire Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a tilted fibre Bragg grating sensor, are also presented to demonstrate the versatility of grating based sensors for flow, high sensitivity refractive index and multi-parameter sensing, respectively. Demonstrations of LPG sensors in industrial applications are also presented and highlight the technical issues of integrating such devices in composite components and composite manufacturing processes.
