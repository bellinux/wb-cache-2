40|$|In {{electric}} vehicle, {{battery is}} <b>the</b> main source <b>of</b> energy for tractive power. It is technically known as “Rechargeable Electrical Energy Storage System (<b>REESS).</b> <b>The</b> durability and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>REESS</b> is mainly {{based on its}} charging rate, <b>discharging</b> rate, Depth <b>of</b> <b>Discharge</b> (DOD) and operating temperature. For a given <b>REESS</b> <b>the</b> charging rate, Discharging rate at conditional temperature and DOD are the main characteristics which are constant. <b>The</b> operating temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>REESS</b> can be effectively controlled by optimized design of ventilation systems and enhanced energy efficient electric components. During charging and discharging, REESS temperature rises due to its internal resistance. Rapid charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>of</b> REESS leads to rise in its temperature beyond its safe operating limit. The maximum efficiency coupled with design intended life of REESS shall be attained when it is operated at <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> 100 C to 45 °C. The cell (which is the individual building block <b>of</b> <b>REESS)</b> temperature across <b>the</b> battery pack has to be maintained uniformly. Uneven cell temperatures cause improper charging and discharging and reduction in its capacity and life. The following issues are currently, 	One particular cell temperature reaches to its cut back temperature, during high speed drive.

The thesis concerns all <b>the</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debt, from <b>the</b> proposal <b>of</b> permission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debt until its accomplishment. The thesis focuses on relevant legal regulation and case law. I also present <b>the</b> institute <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> debt of {{husband and wife}} which is quite often used without any legal support. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The Chapter One deals with <b>the</b> proposal <b>of</b> permission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debt. It examines particularly the subjects who are authorized to submit it and possible decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court including the reasons for its dismissal.
