40|$|In lizards, femoral gland {{secretions}} {{of males}} {{can have an}} important role in intraspecific communication. However, the chemosensory responses of lizards to specific compounds found in femoral secretions have been little studied. Steroids are the most abundant compounds in secretions, which have been shown to have a signalling function. However, other type of compounds might also be important. In this paper, we explored the role of alcohols in communication of <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> Podarcis hispanica. We studied chemosensory behaviour, by measuring tongue flick rates, to test whether lizards could recognize several alcohols that are naturally found in femoral secretions. Results showed that lizards can discriminate and show chemosensory responses of different magnitude to different alcohols. The existence of high responses to alcohols suggest that, in addition to steroids, alcohols may also have a signalling function in femoral secretions of male P. hispanica lizards...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{importance}} of chemoreception in sexual selection of lizards, only a few studies have examined the composition of chemical signals, and it is unknown whether and how chemicals provide honest information. Chemical signals might be honest if there were a trade-off between sexual advertisement and the immune system. Here, we show that proportions of cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol in femoral secretions of male <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis hispanica) were related to their T-cell-mediated immune response. Thus, only males with a good immune system may allocate higher amounts of this chemical to signalling. Furthermore, females selected scents of males with higher proportions of cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol and lower proportions of cholesterol. Thus, females might base their mate choice on the males' quality as indicated by the composition of their chemical signals...|$|R

40|$|Many animals use {{chemical}} {{signals in}} sexual selection, {{but it is}} not clear how these sexual traits might have evolved to signal honestly male condition. It is possible that there is a trade-off between maintaining the immune system and the elaboration of ornaments. We experimentally challenged the immune system of male <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> Podarcis hispanica, with a bacterial antigen (lipopolysaccharide), without pathogenic effects, to explore whether the immune activation affected chemical ornaments. Immune activation resulted in decreased proportions of a major chemical in femoral secretions (cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol = provitamin D 3) known to be selected in scent of males by females and which active form (vitamin D) has a variety of important effects on immune system function. This result suggests the existence of a potential trade-off between physiological regulation of the immune system and the allocation of essential nutrients (vitamins) to sexual chemical ornaments in male lizards...|$|R
40|$|Sexual signals can be {{evolutionarily}} stable if {{they are}} honest and condition dependent or costly to the signaler. One possible cost is {{the existence of a}} trade-off between maintaining the immune system and the elaboration of ornaments. We experimentally challenged the immune system of male <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> Podarcis hispanica, with a bacterial antigen (lipopolysaccharide) without pathogenic effects to explore whether the immune activation affected sexually dimorphic visual ornaments. Ventrolateral coloration changed in all males, but immune activation affected some characteristics of coloration of experimental males (i. e., challenged males failed to increase brightness and medium wavelengths over time as control males did, and the proportion of yellow pigments decreased after the immune activation) but not others (i. e., proportion of blue, green and red pigments changed equally in all males). Results suggested the existence of a trade-off between physiological regulation of the immune system and the allocation of essential compounds (probably carotenoids) to sexual ornaments. We suggest that this trade-off may allow one to honestly signal individual male quality via characteristics of coloration in lizards, which may have an important role in both intra- and intersexual selection processes...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the factors causing {{variation}} in behavioural plasticity and the interplay between personality and plasticity. Habituation to predators is a special case of behavioural plasticity. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of boldness, exploration and sociability traits on the habituation ability of <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> considering exposure and sex effects. Individual boldness was consistent across several non-habituation contexts, but it did not significantly affect habituation. Exploration had a strong direct effect on habituation, with more exploratory individuals being able to habituate faster than less exploratory ones, probably because of their ability to assess risk better. Individual variation in habituation was also affected by sociability, but this was an indirect effect mediated by exposure to the predator. Less social individuals avoided refuges with conspecific cues, increasing exposure to the predator and eventually habituation. Finally, the direct effects of sex (females habituated faster than males) were opposite to its indirect effects through exposure. We conclude that risk assessment, instead of the proactivity–reactivity gradient usually considered in the literature, can affect behavioural plasticity through complex interactions between direct and indirect effects, including exploratory behaviour, degree of exposure to the predator and sex, which represent novel mechanisms generating inter-individual variation in plasticity...|$|R

40|$|Intraspecific {{variations}} in coloration {{may represent a}} compromise between selection for intraspecific communication and selection for thermoregulation and predator avoidance. <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> Podarcis hispanica, exhibit substantial levels of intraspecific variation that cannot be necessarily attributed to genetic differences. We compared {{variations in}} coloration and habitat use of three phenotypically distinct populations of P. hispanica in Central Spain. Results suggested that differences in coloration {{may be related to}} habitat characteristics and climatic conditions. Thus, lizards from populations with colder temperatures were darker and larger, which may favor thermoregulation. Lizards that lived in habitats with more vegetation and darker granite rocks showed a dark brown to black dorsal coloration. In contrast, lizards from habitats with gypsum and light sandy soil without vegetation or large rocks had a brighter yellow to green dorsal coloration. These differences may increase crypsis to predators in each habitat. There were also differences in the characteristics and relative importance of sexual visual signals (i. e., ventrolateral coloration and number of lateral blue spots) and chemical signals (i. e., number of femoral pores) that might increase efficiency of communication in each environment. Natural selection for traits that allow a better thermoregulation, predator avoidance, and communication might lead to population divergence.

40|$|In some lizards, female mate {{choice is}} {{influenced}} by chemicals secreted by males, e. g., via the femoral glands. Secretions of the femoral glands are under direct androgenic control and vary seasonally with androgen production. However, whether increased testosterone (T) levels affect the concentration and chemical composition of secretions or their attractiveness to females is unknown. We manipulated T levels of male <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> Podarcis hispanica, with silastic implants. Differential tongue-flick rates indicated that females detected and discriminated between femoral secretions of control and T-implanted males based on chemical cues alone. Females showed greater responses to secretions of T-males, which might suggest that T increased the concentration of chemical signals. Further analyses by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry indicated that T supplementation induced qualitative changes in lipid composition of femoral secretions. T-males had decreased relative proportions of cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol in secretions, which {{might be related to}} the negative effects of T on the immune system and on lipid metabolism. However, experiments of choice of males’ scent showed that females neither preferred nor avoided the scent marks of T-males but preferred males that maintained higher proportions of cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol in secretions, independently of the experimental manipulation. Thus, because this steroid is negatively affected by T, there might be trade-offs among increasing T levels to increase the production of chemical secretions, maintain metabolism, and attract females...|$|R
40|$|Many {{animals can}} {{recognize}} chemical cues of predators and show defensive responses, but antipredatory {{behavior can be}} costly and should be modulated depending {{on the level of}} risk posed by each predatory species. Recognition ability may be innate, {{but it is not clear}} whether there might also be local adaptation to predation pressure levels or some learning component. We examined the chemosensory ability of naïve and adult <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> Podarcis hispanicus, to detect chemical cues of two closely related Coronella snake species in two localities within the same continuous population. Lizards in each locality are sympatric with only one of the two snake species. Our results showed an innate chemosensory discrimination of predatory snake cues, as both adult lizards and captive reared naïve hatchlings, which had not had any previous experience with the snake cues, had short latencies to the first tongue-flick, increased tongue-flick responses, and active escape behavior from the scent of either of the two snake species. Moreover, adult lizards, but not naïve hatchlings, showed differential responses to the two different snake species, with higher responses to the snake species that is sympatric in each locality. This strongly suggests that there is a learning component acquired through previous lifetime experiences that may increase accuracy of the discrimination of the sympatric snake. Therefore, through learning of local conditions, lizards may modulate their innate antipredatory responses to the risk level posed by each snake species.

50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> varies {{considerably}} {{in size and}} colouring across its range. It is a fairly small, slender, somewhat flattened species with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) averaging 50 - 70 mm and a tail {{twice as long as}} its body. The background colour is usually grey or brown but is occasionally greenish. Most individuals have three narrow longitudinal stripes, one along the spine and the other two more distinct and on either side. Sometimes these are broken up into a series of streaks or marks. Some males instead have a reticulated (netlike) pattern and others are more uniform in colour. The throat is pale with a scattering of small spots, particularly near the sides, and the belly is usually whitish but may be pink, orange, red or buff. Young lizards may have blue tails.|$|E
50|$|Podarcis liolepis (Columbretes wall lizard or Catalan wall lizard) is {{very similar}} to the other lizards in the Podarcis genus.

The underside is a much lighter cream or beige with sometimes a reddish tint. Adults grow 15-20 cm in length from the nose to tip of the tail. Body length can be a little as one third of the total body length, the tail making up the other two thirds.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Rock {{through which}} the path passes {{is one of the}} richest in Gibraltar for flora and fauna. The start of the path is {{relatively}} sparsely vegetated and includes species such as White Asparagus, Common Asphodel, Germander and Esparto Grass. Its later sections proceed through dense vegetation that is typical of Mediterranean maquis shrubland - a widespread biome in southern Europe that consists of densely growing evergreen shrubs adapted to resist droughts. The trees along the path are predominantly olives. These have all grown since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) when the Upper Rock's original woodland was felled by the British garrison to serve as fuel. It is thought that the present arboreal flora of Gibraltar is the result of seeds being brought onto the Rock by birds. The maquis flora includes dense knots of creepers such as smilax, December clematis, pipe fine and black bryony, while ferns such as southern polypody and the rusty-back fern exploit the shade provided by the canopy. Many species of aromatic herbs and flowers also grow alongside the path, including purple Jerusalem sage and bee orchids. The fauna includes various species of birds that are adapted to life in the maquis, including the Sardinian warbler, wren and woodcock. Barbary partridges {{can be seen in the}} more open areas adjoining the path.

40|$|Sexual signals used in {{intraspecific}} communication {{are expected}} to evolve to maximize efficacy under a given climatic condition. Thus, chemical secretions of lizards might evolve in the evolutionary time to ensure that signals are perfectly tuned to local humidity and temperature conditions affecting their volatility and therefore their persistence and transmission through the environment. We tested experimentally whether interpopulational altitudinal differences in chemical composition of femoral gland secretions of male <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis hispanicus) have evolved to maximize efficacy of chemical signals in different environmental conditions. Chemical analyses first showed that the characteristics of chemical signals of male lizards differed between two populations inhabiting environments with different climatic conditions {{in spite of the}} fact that these two populations are closely related genetically. We also examined experimentally whether the temporal attenuation of the chemical stimuli depended on simulated climatic conditions. Thus, we used tongue-flick essays to test whether female lizards were able to detect male scent marks maintained under different conditions of temperature and humidity by chemosensory cues alone. Chemosensory tests showed that chemical signals of males had a lower efficacy (i. e. detectability and persistence) when temperature and dryness increase, but that these effects were more detrimental for signals of the highest elevation population, which occupies naturally colder and more humid environments. We suggest that the abiotic environment may cause a selective pressure on the form and expression of sexual chemical signals. Therefore, interpopulational differences in chemical profiles of femoral secretions of male P. hispanicus lizards may reflect adaptation to maximize the efficacy of the chemical signal in different climates...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> Podarcis hispanica forms part of {{a species}} complex with several morphologically and genetically {{distinct}} types and populations, {{which may or may}} not be reproductively isolated. We analyzed whether female mate choice based on males’ chemical signals may contribute to a current pre-mating reproductive isolation between two distinct populations of P. hispanica from central Spain. We experimentally examined whether females choose to establish territories on areas scent-marked by males of their own population, versus areas marked by males of the other population. Results showed that females did not prefer scent-marks of males from their own population. In contrast, females seemed to attend mostly to among-individual variation in males’ pheromones that did not differ between populations. Finally, to test for strong premating reproductive isolation, we staged intersexual encounters between males and females. The population of origin of males and females did not affect the probability nor the duration of copulations. We suggest that the different environmental conditions in each population might be selecting for different morphologies and different chemical signals of males that maximize efficiency of communication in each environment. However, females in both populations based mate choice on a similar condition-dependent signal of males. Thus, male signals and female mate choice criteria could be precluding premating reproductive isolation between these phenotypically “distinct” populations [Current Zoology 59 (2) : 210 – 220, 2013]...|$|E

40|$|Chemical signals can be {{the basis}} of {{interspecific}} recognition and speciation in many animals. The Columbretes Islands wall lizard, Podarcis atrata is very close genetically to the mainland <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> Podarcis hispanica. However, a previous study suggested that chemosensory interspecific recognition would avoid reproductive interactions and hybridization between these two species. These results suggested that chemicals used in intraspecific communication might differ in composition and/or proportions between these two species. In this paper, we used gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to characterize the chemical composition of the lipophilic fraction from femoral gland secretions of male P. atrata and P. hispanica. The analysis showed that chemicals found in femoral secretions varied in composition and proportions between species and between populations. Seven steroids and two unidentified waxy esters, were exclusive of P. atrata lizards from the islands. In contrast, nine steroids and other six compounds were only found in mainland P. hispanica. There were also differences in proportions of shared compounds between species. Moreover, all these differences were higher between P. atrata and P. hispanica than between any population of P. hispanica. Chemical differences might be consequence of genetic differences, but they could also be explained by adaptation to different habitats with different climatic conditions or diet resources. Compounds that are specific of each species, or differences in the pattern of compounds, could explain species recognition. Therefore, these results of chemical composition and previous studies of chemosensory recognition reinforce the fact that the genetic differences between P. hispanica and P. atrata may result in an effective reproductive isolation between these two taxa...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{signals are}} {{important}} for mate and species recognition. If variation in chemical signals occurs between populations of the same species, these differences could later preclude mating between populations and lead to speciation. In the <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard,</b> Podarcis hispanica, the lipophilic fraction of femoral secretions of males is mainly a mix of steroids and fatty acids. Among steroids, the most abundant compounds are cholesterol and cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol, which are implicated in intraspecific communication and sexual selection. Interpopulational differences in chemical signals of males, {{and in response to}} these chemicals, could contribute to reproductive isolation between populations, which would explain the known genetic differences between these populations. Chemical analyses indicated that five distinct populations of this lizard from Madrid (Central Spain) differed in the proportions of two steroids (cholesterol and cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol) in femoral secretions. Moreover, lizards discriminated and had high chemosensory responses (i. e., high tongue-flick rates) to these steroids, but showed interpopulational differences. Lizards from populations with cold temperatures and high relative humidity (i. e., northern Madrid) elicited higher responses to these steroids, whereas the converse occurred for lizards from populations occupying dry and hot habitats (i. e., southern Madrid). Interestingly, the magnitude of the chemosensory responses to cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol in each population mirrored the abundance of this compound in secretions of males of that population. These results suggest that the importance of cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol in males’ secretions might be lower for lizards from the southern populations. These differences in the relative importance of chemical signals could explain reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation between populations of this lizard...|$|E
40|$|Recent genetic {{works have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>Iberian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> Podarcis hispanicus (Steindachner, 1870) sensu lato is a species complex. Several forms have already been elevated to species rank and linked to available nomina, but at least three still have to be formally named, including the western Iberian forms currently designated as Podarcis hispanicus “type 1 A”, “type 1 B” and “type 2 ”. The aim of the present work is to assign a valid nomen to these taxa. Using multivariate analyses, we first checked that the morphological differences reported in Portugal between type 1 and type 2 are main- tained over their distribution range. We then investigated phenotypic differentiation between type 1 A and type 1 B, which were found to be so similar that identification based on phenotype is currently not advisable. We propose to treat type 1 and type 2 as distinct species because of their level of genetic and phenotypic divergence, large area of distribution and ample evidence for reduced or absent introgression in contact zones. We maintain type 1 A and 1 B as subspecies for the time being, pending further analyses of their contact zone. The valid nomen for “Podarcis hispanica type 1 (sensu lato) ” is Lacerta muralis guadarramae Boscá, 1916 which becomes Podarcis guadarramae (Boscá, 1916). Lineage type 1 A is here described as a new taxon: P. guadarramae lusitanicus ssp. nov., inhabiting northern Portugal and northwestern Spain. The type 1 B lineage corresponds to the nominotypical subspecies that inhabits Spain, mostly the Central Iberian Mountains.
