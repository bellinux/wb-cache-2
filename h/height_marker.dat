At 1325 hours on November 16 the German air force began a series of heavy strikes against the division's positions, with over 100 Ju-87 and ME-109 sorties. Colonel Kulakov had established his observation post {{in the midst of his}} division's forward defense line in the northern portion of the Voikov factory. At 1330 hours he was killed along with two other officers standing nearby by a bomb blast, with a fourth officer wounded. Unaware of his fate, the People's Commissariat of Defense issued a decree the following day promoting Kulakov to the rank of Major General. On May 16, 1944, Kulakov was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his outstanding performance in the Kerch-Eltigen Operation, along with a captain and a sergeant-major of his division who were also killed during its course.

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of an {{accurate}} computation and incorporation of coloured noise in radar altimeter data when computing a regional quasi-geoid model using least-squares techniques. Our test area comprises the Southern North Sea including the Netherlands, Belgium, and parts of France, Germany, and the UK. We perform the study by modelling the disturbing potential with spherical radial base functions. To that end, we use the traditional remove-compute-restore procedure with a recent GRACE/GOCE static gravity field model. Apart from radar altimeter data, we use terrestrial, airborne, and shipboard gravity data. Radar altimeter sea surface heights are corrected for the instantaneous dynamic topography and used {{in the form of}} along-track quasi-geoid height differences. Noise in these data are estimated using repeat-track and post-fit residual analysis techniques and then modelled as an auto regressive moving average process. Quasi-geoid models are computed with and without taking the modelled coloured noise into account. The difference between them is used as a measure of {{the impact of}} coloured noise in radar altimeter along-track quasi-geoid height differences on the estimated quasi-geoid model. The impact strongly depends on the availability of shipboard gravity data. If no such data are available, the impact may attain values exceeding 10 centimetres in particular areas. In case shipboard gravity data are used, the impact is reduced, though it still attains values of several centimetres. We use geometric quasi-geoid heights from GPS/levelling data at <b>height</b> <b>markers</b> as control data to analyse the quality of the quasi-geoid models. The quasi-geoid model computed using a model of the coloured noise in radar altimeter along-track quasi-geoid height differences shows in some areas a significant improvement over a model that assumes white noise in these data. However, the interpretation in other areas remains a challenge due to the limited quality of the control data. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{primary source}} of {{measurement}} error in gait analysis is soft tissue artefact. Hip and knee angle measurements, used regularly to guide clinical decisions, are particularly affected due to pervasive soft tissue on the femur. However, despite several studies of thigh marker artefact it remains unclear how lateral thigh <b>marker</b> <b>height</b> affects results using the popular Plug-in Gait model. We compared Plug-in Gait hip and knee joint angles for ten healthy subjects estimated using a proximal- and distal-third thigh marker placement and found significant differences. Relative to the distal marker, the proximal marker produced 37 % less varus-valgus range and 50 % less hip rotation range, suggesting that it produced less soft-tissue artefact in knee axis estimates. Knee flexion was also significantly affected due to knee centre displacement. Based on {{an analysis of the}} Plug-in Gait knee axis definition and two different numerical optimization of the thigh rotation offset parameter, we show that the proximal marker reduced sensitivity to soft-tissue artefact by decreasing collinearity between the points defining the femoral frontal plane and reducing anteroposterior movement between the knee and thigh markers.

To investigate the genetic background of these quantitative phenotypes, {{we performed a}} linkage genome scan in the extended pedigrees of the Framingham Heart Study. Two variance-components approaches (SOLAR and MERLIN-VC) and one regression method (MERLIN-REGRESS) were applied to the data. Results Evidence for linkage to BMI was found on chromosomes 16 and 6 with maximum LOD scores of 3. 2 and 2. 7, respectively. For <b>height,</b> all <b>markers</b> showing a LOD score greater than 1 in our analysis correspond to previously reported linkage regions, including chromosome 6 q with a maximum LOD score of 2. 45 and chromosomes 9, 12, 14, 18, and 22.

40|$|Economic {{development}} and environmental contamination are inextricably linked. Development generally improves welfare, however the increasing economic activity leads to {{increasing amounts of}} environmental contamination. The changes that economic activities cause in the environment can act as stressors with effects on health and human capital. If the benefits from increased economic activity cannot outweigh the costs to human health, then it is not truly development (Meier and Rauch 2005). Tens of thousands of chemicals are currently used in industrial processes, with hundreds being introduced every year, the vast majority with unknown effects. Effects can result from one contaminant alone or the interaction of contaminants, both chemical and biological (Roy et al. 2011). Because of the already immense and growing variety of contaminants arising from economic activities and their unknown and interactive effects with each other, biological contaminants and behavior, new methods are needed to describe the effects of environmental contamination on human health (Paustenbach 2001).

40|$|Background. Although muscle {{strength}} and mass are highly correlated, {{the relationship between}} direct measures of low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and strength in association with mortality has not been examined. Methods. Total mortality rates were examined in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study in 2292 participants (aged 70 â€“ 79 years, 51. 6 % women, and 38. 8 % black). Knee extension strength was measured with isokinetic dynamometry, grip strength with isometric dynamometry. Thigh muscle area was measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, and leg and arm lean soft tissue mass were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Both strength and muscle size were assessed as in gender-specific Cox proportional hazards models, with age, race, comorbidities, smoking status, level of physical activity, fat area by CT or fat mass by DXA, <b>height,</b> and <b>markers</b> of inflammation, including interleukin- 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-a considered as potential confounders. Results. There were 286 deaths over an average of 4. 9 (standard deviation 0. 9) years of follow-up. Both quadriceps and grip strength were strongly related to mortality.

40|$|Microsatellite markers {{are used}} for loss-of-heterozygosity, allelic {{imbalance}} and clonality analyses in cancers. Usually, tumor DNA is compared to corresponding normal DNA. However, normal DNA is not always available and can display aberrant allele ratios due to copy number variations in the genome. Moreover, stutter peaks may complicate the analysis. To use microsatellite markers for diagnosis of recurrent bladder cancer, we aimed to select markers without stutter peaks and a constant ratio between alleles, thereby avoiding {{the need for a}} control DNA sample. We investigated 49 microsatellite markers with tri- and tetranucleotide repeats in regions commonly lost in bladder cancer. Based on analysis of 50 blood DNAs the 12 best performing markers were selected with few stutter peaks and a constant ratio between peaks <b>heights.</b> Per <b>marker</b> upper and lower cut off values for allele ratios were determined.

40|$|In women raised insulin {{levels are}} {{associated}} with low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and high androgen levels, which are in turn linked to infertility. Since insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are major health problems for South Asians living in western countries we predicted that British Pakistani women would have low SHBG and raised androgen levels compared to European women. Given low birth weights in Pakistan, and known links between low birth weight and insulin resistance in later life, we also predicted that immigrant women, born in Pakistan, would have lower levels of SHBG {{and higher levels of}} androgens than British-born British Pakistani women. We assessed SHBG, testosterone and free androgen index (FAI) from a single serum sample taken on day 9 - 11 of the menstrual cycle from 20 - 40 year old women living in the UK, 30 immigrants from Pakistan, 30 British-born British Pakistani women and 25 British-born women of European origin.

40|$|Sorghum {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a potential energy crop. However, it has been traditionally bred for grain yield and forage quality, not traits related to bioenergy production. To develop tools for genetic improvement of bioenergy-related traits such as <b>height,</b> genetic <b>markers</b> associated with these traits have first to be identified. Association mapping has been extensively used in humans and in some crop plants for this purpose. However, genome-wide association mapping using the whole association panel is costly and time-consuming. A variation of this method called pool-based genome-wide association mapping has been extensively used in humans. In this variation, pools of individuals with contrasting phenotypes, instead of the whole panel, are screened with genetic markers and polymorphic markers are confirmed by screening the individuals in the pools. Here, we identified several new simple sequence repeats (SSR) <b>markers</b> associated with <b>height</b> using this pool-based genome-wide association mapping in sorghum. After screening the tall and short pools of sorghum accessions from the sorghum Mini Core collection developed at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics with 703 SSR markers, we have identified four markers that are closely associated with sorghum height on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9. Comparison with published maps indicates that all four markers are clustered with markers previously mapped to height or height-related traits and with candidate genes involved in regulating plant height such as FtsZ, Ugt, and GA 2 -oxidase.

After reviewing previous evidence, we present a conceptual framework that highlights data limitations and methodological {{problems associated with the}} study of this topic. We present estimates of the associations between height and a range of outcomes, including schooling, employment, earnings, health and cognitive ability, using data collected from early to late adulthood on cohort members in five longitudinal data sets. We find height is uniformly associated with better economic, health and cognitive outcomes â€“ a result only partially explained by the higher average educational attainment of taller individuals. We then turn to the NLSY 79 Children and Young Adult Survey to better understand what specific aspects of early childhood are captured by height. We find, even among maternal siblings, taller siblings score better on cognitive tests and progress through school more quickly. Part of the differences found between siblings arises from differences in their birth weights and lengths attributable to motherâ€™s behaviors while pregnant. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that childhood health influences health and economic status throughout the life course. ...|$|R

I document a positive association between height and later-life cognitive function, which is larger for women than for men. This sex difference increases when I address potential feedback effects from mid- and later-life circumstances on stature by using knee height as an instrument for height. Specifically, while the estimates for women remain largely unchanged, I only find a diminished and statistically insignificant association between instrumented height and later-life cognition for men. This finding suggests that {{at least part of}} the association between height and later-life cognition among men may stem from common third factors that are correlated with both height and later-life cognition, such as adverse occupational exposures or health events during mid- and later life. Extended models that also include education further diminish the association between height and later-life cognition. Education displays strong positive gradients with the employed measures of childhood circumstances - including height - which points to education as a potential pathway linking early-life conditions and later-life cognitive function.

40|$|Sorghum is a {{potential}} energy crop thanks to its high biomass productivity and low input. Biomass yield in sorghum is defined by height and maturity. To develop molecular breeding tools for genetic improvement of these two traits, we have identified simple sequence repeat <b>markers</b> linked to <b>height</b> and maturity using a pool-based association mapping technique. The sorghum mini core collection was evaluated across five environments for height and maturity. Seven tall and seven short accessions were selected based on their height in all environments. Likewise, six early- and 10 late-maturing accessions were selected mostly based on their maturity in two post-rainy seasons. Two additional height pools were constructed based on phenotypes in one environment. The three pairs of pools were screened with 703 SSR markers and 39 polymorphic markers were confirmed by individual genotyping. Association mapping of the 39 markers with 242 accessions from the mini core collection identified five markers associated with maturity or height. All were clustered on chromosomes 6, 9, and 10 with previously mapped <b>height</b> and maturity <b>markers</b> or QTLs.

This research developed an automatic image processing technique to detect rice crop height based on images taken by a digital camera attached to a field server.

The cut-off values were as follows: for prepubertal children, 14 cm (equivalent to 50 th percentile among girls and 60 th percentile among boys); for pubertal children, 15 cm for girls (30 th percentile) and 16 cm for boys (50 th percentile), and for postpubertal, 21. 5 cm for girls (70 th percentile) and 22 cm for boys (80 th percentile). Conclusion : SAD is a reliable indicator of visceral obesity among Arab children and adolescents in particular. Prospective studies should be done to determine whether such an association translates to a promising risk factor for hard endpoints such as diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{consequences}} of child health for economic and health outcomes in adulthood, using <b>height</b> as a <b>marker</b> of childhood health. After reviewing previous evidence, we present a conceptual framework that highlights data limitations and methodological problems that complicate the study of this topic. We then present estimates of the associations between height {{and a range of}} outcomesâ€”including schooling, employment, earnings, health, and cognitive abilityâ€”measured in fi ve data sets from early to late adulthood. These results indicate that, on average, taller individuals attain higher levels of education. Height is also positively associated with better economic, health, and cognitive outcomes. These associations are only partially explained by the higher average educational attainment of taller individuals. We then use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adults survey to document the associations between health, cognitive development, and growth in childhood. Even among children with the same mother, taller siblings score better on cognitive tests and progress through school more quickly. Part of the differences found between siblings arises from differences in their birth weights and lengths attributable to motherâ€™s behaviors while pregnant. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that childhood health infl uences health and economic status throughout adulthood. child health for economic and health outcomes, associations between height and a range of outcomes including schooling, employment, earnings, health, and cognitive ability...|$|R
40|$|Research {{across a}} number of {{disciplines}} has highlighted the role of early life health and circumstance in determining health and economic outcomes at older ages. Nutrition in utero and in infancy may {{set the stage for}} the chronic disease burden that an individual will face in middle age (David J. Barker, 1998; Barker et al. 1989; Johann Eriksson et al. 2001). Childhood health may also have significant effects on economic outcomes in adulthood. Collectively, a set of childhood health measures can account for a large fraction of the explained variance in employment and social status observed among a British cohort followed from birth into adulthood (Anne Case, Angela Fertig and Christina Paxson 2005). Recent research has paid particular attention to <b>height</b> as a <b>marker</b> of a childâ€™s early environment. A babyâ€™s length in infancy and height in childhood are strongly predictive of cognitive ability (Susan A. Rose 1994; Marcus Richards et al. 2002; Case and Paxson 2006), with better nutrition and health leading both to taller children and to greater cognitive function (Richard Lynn 1989). Analysis of data from British birth cohorts finds that a one-standard deviation increase in height is associated on average with a one-tenth of a standard deviation increase in scores on standardized language, math and drawing tests, measured at a variety of ages in childhood, with o...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND, OBJECTIVES, AND METHODS: The {{number of}} {{patients}} on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) is increasing rapidly on a global scale. We analyzed the International Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network (IPPN) registry, a global database active in 33 countries spanning a wide range in gross national income (GNI), to identify the impact of economic conditions on CPD practices and outcomes in children and adolescents. We observed close associations of GNI with the fraction of very young patients on dialysis, the presence and number of comorbidities, the prevalence of patients with unexplained causes of end-stage kidney disease, {{and the rate of}} culture-negative peritonitis. The prevalence of automated PD increased with GNI, but was 46 % even in the lowest GNI stratum. The GNI stratum also affected the use of biocompatible peritoneal dialysis fluids, enteral tube feeding, calcium-free phosphate binders, active vitamin D analogs, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patient mortality was strongly affected by GNI (hazard ratio per $ 10 000 : 3. 3; 95 % confidence interval: 2. 0 to 5. 5) independently of young patient age and the number of comorbidities present. Patients from low-income countries tended to die more often from infections unrelated to CPD (5 of 9 vs 15 of 61, p = 0. 1). The GNI was also a strong independent predictor of standardized height (p < 0. 0001), adding to the impact of congenital renal disease, anuria, age at PD start, and dialysis vintage. Patients from the lower economic strata (GNI < $ 18 000) had higher serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and lower serum calcium, and achieved lower hemoglobin concentrations. No impact of GNI was observed with regard to CPD technique survival or peritonitis incidence. We conclude that CPD is practiced successfully, albeit with major regional variation related to economic differences, in children around the globe. The variations encompass the acceptance of very young patients and those with associated comorbidities to chronic dialysis programs, the use of automated PD and expensive drugs, and the diagnostic management of peritonitis. These variations in practice related to economic difference do not appear to affect PD technique survival; however, economic conditions seem to affect mortality on dialysis and standardized <b>height,</b> a <b>marker</b> of global child morbidit...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative trait loci (QTL) and QTL x {{environment}} interaction {{were identified}} for 11 agronomic traits in soybean, when measured at two locations {{in each of}} two years in Iowa. The segregating population consisted of 76 F[subscript] 2 : 5 /F[subscript] 2 : 6 families derived from the cross between the two soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cultivars 2 Ì† 7 Minsoy 2 Ì† 7 (PI 27. 890) and 2 Ì† 7 Noir 12 Ì† 7 (PI 290. 136). A genetic linkage map consisting of 81 markers in 25 linkage groups was used to locate QTL by interval mapping. Analyses of variance was performed on 72 linked and unlinked markers to test for associations between markers and QTL and for QTL x environment interaction;QTL were identified for all traits except seed-protein content {{in at least one}} environment. For the developmental (R 1, R 8, reproductive period) and morphological traits (plant height, canopy height, lodging, leaf area) and seed yield, QTL were clustered on two linkage groups, 2 and 16. Three QTL were identified for seed-oil content on linkage groups 3, 9, and 31. A QTL for seed weight was identified on linkage group 1 also. These results were consistent with the genetic correlations among traits;Analyses of variance showed significant genotype x environment interaction for all traits except seed-oil content. Evidence for QTL x environment interaction varied among traits and depended on method of analysis. Interval mapping identified QTL consistently expressed in all environments only for plant height and lodging. QTL x environment interaction occurred for all other traits, in that QTL were detected only in a subset of environments;Single factor analyses of variance generally confirmed results from interval mapping. Several markers were significant in the analyses of variance that were not identified as significant using interval mapping, notably marker R 79;QTL x environment interaction was significant in the combined analysis of variance only for canopy <b>height</b> and <b>marker</b> G 173 on linkage group 16. These results indicated a lack of evidence for QTL x environment interaction, and were supported by the fact that plots of LOD scores along the linkage groups in interval mapping showed coinciding peaks across environments...|$|R
