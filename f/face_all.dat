5|$|Creatively, {{the focus}} of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout {{throughout}} the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley <b>face.</b> <b>All</b> but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, {{which one of the}} characters reads. Structured, at times, as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery.|$|E
5|$|The {{head and}} hands are {{coloured}} using {{a blend of}} oil, water and acrylic colour.

The whole process usually takes {{up to six months}} by a team of 20 people to create and cost about HK$1 million each.|$|E

5|$|At the 2006 Royal Rumble, Helms {{participated in}} an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won, {{even though he was}} a Raw superstar and the {{championship}} was defended solely on SmackDown!. As a result, he returned to the SmackDown! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio, Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights. During this time, Helms defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match. The next week, he was supposed to defend against Kid Kash, but Kash was away on a family emergency, so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place. Helms defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights. As a result, all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked Helms. It was later announced by SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event, Helms would <b>face</b> <b>all</b> the cruiserweights in a match for the title. Helms was able to retain the championship. Later, Long mandated that Helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights. Helm's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools; Helms retained by cheating.|$|E

25|$|Four {{days after}} the {{discovery}} of Mixer's body, on March 25, a surveyor discovered the nude, mutilated body of a teenage girl behind a vacant house on a remote, rural section of Earhart Road, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where the body of Joan Schell had been discovered eight months previous. Investigators called to the crime scene noted a dramatic increase in the savagery exhibited against the victim, with one investigator describing the injuries inflicted upon the victim as being the worst he had seen in 30 years of police work. A subsequent autopsy revealed the victim had died of numerous fractures covering one-third of her skull and one side of her <b>face,</b> <b>all</b> of which had been inflicted with a heavy blunt instrument. These injuries had been inflicted after the victim had been extensively beaten and tortured: her killer had placed a section of her own shirt into her trachea to muffle her screams as she received extensive blunt force trauma to the face, head and body, including several deep lacerations believed to have been inflicted with a leather strap. Welt marks upon the chest and shoulders indicated the killer had also used restraints to hold the victim prone as he whipped her torso and upper legs with a leather belt before tearing a branch from a nearby tree and inserting this instrument eight inches into her vagina. Blood spatterings and churned soil close to the crime scene indicated she had been beaten close to where her body was discovered, and that she may have attempted to escape her attacker.|$|E

Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask from her face. She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, [...] "How do I look in your mask?" ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his <b>face</b> <b>all</b> the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 November 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Shakira was conducting auditions to choose a different opening act for each of the tour's appearances in different cities.

Fans were allowed to vote for their favourite acts and the ones with the most would proceed to the finals; Shakira and her team would then pick the winner out of them. Sean Wolfington, Shakira's digital-business partner, talked about the decision and told the New York Post that [...] "The artists will open for Shakira live in big cities and virtually through a video performance in smaller markets. There are a lot of talented artists, and Shakira wants to help them by giving them part of her stage". The visuals and conceptual video scenes for the tour were managed and designed by entertainment branding agency Loyalkaspar, who had previously designed tour visuals for artists like U2 and Jay-Z. Elliott Chaffer, the creative director of the agency, talked about the project, saying that [...] "Shakira was a much bigger undertaking then anything we've attempted previously. They were looking for original content that had to work over two LED screens and on a huge projector mapping surreal models of an ever-changing animated <b>face,</b> <b>all</b> in just three weeks. This is for her global world tour, so modifications to the setlist and track durations continued through nine rounds of revisions".
