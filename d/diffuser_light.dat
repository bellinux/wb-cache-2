40|$|Abstract—This {{investigation}} {{demonstrates a}} novel light-emit-ting system {{with an array}} of blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Unlike a conventional lighting system that is constructed from white LEDs, the proposed planar lighting system uses blue LEDs to excite a YAG Ce yellow phosphor film remotely, yielding a high lumen efficiency with uniform and planar light-emission. The phosphor film herein acts as a wavelength converter and a <b>light</b> <b>diffuser</b> simultaneously. The optical properties of the pro-posed lighting system, angular color deviation and light-emitting uniformity, are studied. Eventually, a high lumen efficiency (73. 0 lm/W) and thin lighting module (7. 5 mm-thick) was demonstrated without the use of any conventional <b>diffuser</b> plate or <b>light</b> guiding plate (LGP). A low color deviation and a high light-emitting uniformity were achieved. Hence, the proposed lighting system exhibited superior optical performance using a compact module.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a concept based on the {{realization}} that a complex medium {{can be used as}} a simple interferometer. Changes in the wavefront of an incident coherent beam can be retrieved by analyzing changes in speckle patterns when the beam passes through a <b>light</b> <b>diffuser.</b> We demonstrate that the spatial intensity correlations of the speckle patterns are independent of the <b>light</b> <b>diffusers,</b> and are solely determined by the phase changes of an incident beam. With numerical simulations using the random matrix theory, and an experimental pressure-driven wavefront-deforming setup using a microfluidic channel, we theoretically and experimentally confirm the universal sensitivity of speckle intensity correlations, which is attributed to the conservation of optical field correlation despite multiple light scattering. This work demonstrates that a complex media is a simple interferometer, and presents opportunities to replace complicated reference-beam-assisted interferometers with a simple and compact scattering layer in various applications in metrology, analytical chemistry, and biomedicine...|$|R
40|$|Large surface area, thin, polymer {{optical waveguides}} are an {{emerging}} technology that enable {{a wide variety}} of light collection and illumination systems to be created for passive lighting, solar collectors, and safety lighting for motorized vehicles. This research builds on design of rigid concentrator and diffuser waveguides, proposing and evaluating modifications for the design of a flexible waveguide combining both concentrating and diffusing functionalities. The waveguides are thin, mechanically flexible sheets with thicknesses in the range of mm, and active surfaces from a few cm 2 to several m 2. Regions of the functional surface are designed to act as <b>light</b> concentrators, <b>light</b> <b>diffusers,</b> <b>light</b> transmission conduits or some combination thereof. This research examines how the geometry and spatial distribution of micro-optical features patterned on a bi-layered thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) waveguides can be used to guide captured light rays through flat and flexible configurations. Zemax OpticStudio software simulation tool is used to investigate the design parameters and their impact on concentrator and diffuser performance. A multi-functional concentrator-diffuser waveguide is modelled and analysed in a study which shows the flat waveguide has an overall efficiency of over 94 %, however when it is modelled as a flexible waveguide, less than 1 % of the incident light is successfully guided. Various design modifications are considered to mitigate these losses, and the efficiency of the flexible waveguide is improved to nearly 60 %. Based on the parametric optimization of the microfeatures, the suitable waveguide design is identified for variations in the waveguide’s flexibility, geometry, material and application...|$|R
50|$|A flash <b>diffuser</b> spreads the <b>light</b> {{from the}} flash of a camera. In effect, the light will not come from one {{concentrated}} source (like a spotlight), but rather will spread out, bounce from reflective ceilings and walls, thus getting rid of harsh light, and hard shadows. This is particularly useful for portrait photographers, since harsh light and hard shadows are usually not considered flattering in a portrait.|$|R

5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient <b>diffuser</b> of <b>light.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{department}} of Solid State Electronics develops and manufactures solar cells. Then {{they need a}} reliable method for evaluating {{the performance of the}} solar cell. One of their rigs use a halogen lamp with a power of 300 W. The lamp has gone out of production and needs a replacement. The purpose of this project is to find a suitable replacement. A suitable replacement must fulfill certain requirements; the light source has a light spectrum {{similar to that of the}} sun, a homogeneous light pattern and intensity of 1000 W / m 2. The lamp that the department currently uses only have a life span of 15 hours, so finding a lamp with a longer lifetime is desirable. The lamps have been tested using a spectrometer and a photodiode. With these two measurements it could be determined how similar the light source is to the sun. After testing several lamps, the results showed that many of the lamps spectrum were similar to the sun, but their intensity was too low. Therefore lenses were used to focus the light and increase the intensity. <b>Light</b> <b>diffusers</b> have been used to spread and smooth out the light. A Philips halogen lamp with a power 250 W, together with lenses and a <b>light</b> <b>diffuser,</b> was found to be the best replacement and fulfilled all the predetermined requirements.

40|$|Abstract: Approach {{to achieve}} self-calibration three {{dimensional}} (3 D) light field display is investigated in this paper. The proposed 3 D light field display is constructed up on spliced multi-LCDs, lens and diaphragm arrays, and directional <b>diffuser.</b> The <b>light</b> field imaging principle, hardware configuration, diffuser characteristic and image reconstruction simulation are described and analyzed, respectively. Besides the light field imaging, a self-calibration method is {{proposed to improve}} the imaging performance. An image sensor is deployed to capture calibration patterns projected onto and then reflected by the Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) film, which is attached to and shaped the diffuser. These calibration components are assembled with the display unit and can be switched between display mode and calibration mode. In calibration mode, the imperfect imaging relations of optical components are captured and calibrated automatically. We demonstrate our design by implementing the prototype of proposed 3 D light field display using modified off-the-shelf products. The proposed approach successfully meets the requirement of real application on scalable configuration, fast-calibration, large viewing angular range and smooth motion parallax...|$|R

50|$|As {{with all}} optical methods, {{reflective}} or transparent surfaces raise difficulties. Reflections cause light to be reflected either {{away from the}} camera or right into its optics. In both cases, the dynamic range of the camera can be exceeded. Transparent or semi-transparent surfaces also cause major difficulties. In these cases, coating the surfaces with a thin opaque lacquer just for measuring purposes is a common practice. A recent method handles highly reflective and specular objects by inserting a 1-dimensional <b>diffuser</b> between the <b>light</b> source (e.g., projector) and the object to be scanned. Alternative optical techniques have been proposed for handling perfectly transparent and specular objects.|$|R
40|$|Holographic glass light-shaping {{diffusers}} (GLSDs) are optical {{components for}} use in special-purpose illumination systems (see figure). When properly positioned with respect to lamps and areas to be illuminated, holographic GLSDs efficiently channel light from the lamps onto specified areas with specified distributions of illumination for example, uniform or nearly uniform irradiance can be concentrated with intensity confined to a peak a few degrees wide about normal incidence, over a circular or elliptical area. Holographic <b>light</b> <b>diffusers</b> were developed during the 1990 s. The development of the present holographic GLSDs extends the prior development to incorporate sol-gel optical glass. To fabricate a holographic GLSD, one records a hologram on a sol-gel silica film formulated specially for this purpose. The hologram is a quasi-random, micro-sculpted pattern of smoothly varying changes in the index of refraction of the glass. The structures in this pattern act as an array of numerous miniature lenses that refract light passing through the GLSD, such that the transmitted light beam exhibits a precisely tailored energy distribution. In comparison with other <b>light</b> <b>diffusers,</b> holographic GLSDs function with remarkably high efficiency: they typically transmit 90 {{percent or more of}} the incident lamp light onto the designated areas. In addition, they can withstand temperatures in excess of 1, 000 C. These characteristics make holographic GLSDs attractive {{for use in}} diverse lighting applications that involve high temperatures and/or requirements for high transmission efficiency for ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. Examples include projectors, automobile headlights, aircraft landing lights, high-power laser illuminators, and industrial and scientific illuminators...|$|R
