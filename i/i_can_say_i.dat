5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E

He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with Thomas Jefferson, who used this advice when founding the University of Virginia. Jefferson and Priestley became close, {{and when he had}} completed his General History of the Christian Church, he dedicated it to President Jefferson, writing that [...] "it is now only that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> see nothing to fear from the hand of power, the government under which I live being for the first time truly favourable to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{continued}} the educational projects {{that had been}} important to him throughout his life, helping to establish a [...] "Northumberland Academy" [...] and donating his library to the fledging institution.

[...] Of all of the religious works Priestley published in the United States, and there were many, it was his four-volume General History that was the most important. Stretching from 475 CE to Priestley's present, he tracked and explained what he saw as the history of Christianity and its [...] "corruptions", referencing his own An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1772–74). However, he ended it by praising American religious toleration.|$|E

500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E

6000|$|Luc. Perhaps--I cannot yet leave loving you. There 'twas. But I {{recalled}} {{it in my}} mind, And made it false before I gave it air. Once more, farewell--I wo'not,-- Now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> wo'not, wo'not love you. [...] [Going.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I don't {{know about}} the last. I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am active enough. I could walk the yard-arm, if required, cross from mast to mast by the stays, and do what most fellows do who call {{themselves}} spry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, thank you, Aunt Ada; it is {{very very}} kind of you, {{and there is no}} knowing when Aunt Jane may be able to go. I don't like to close up my Indian letter till <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> have seen them.' ...|$|E
