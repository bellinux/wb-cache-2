5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E

It {{has been suggested}} that running mate Sarah Palin's conservative views on social <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> have nudged Jews away from the McCain–Palin ticket. In the 2012 United States presidential election, 69% of Jews voted for the Democratic incumbent President Obama.|$|E
25|$|Landscape and {{heritage}} <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> {{be a significant}} issue for certain wind farms. However, these are minimal {{when compared with the}} Environmental effects of coal. However, when appropriate planning procedures are followed, the heritage and landscape risks should be minimal. Some people may still object to wind farms, perhaps on the grounds of aesthetics, but their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.|$|E

25|$|After Spider-Man, Wieringo's {{next major}} project was at Image Comics, where he reteamed with Dezago on their creator-owned fantasy series Tellos. The comic, a coming-of-age {{adventure}} {{set in a}} magical, piratical world, ran 10 <b>issues</b> (<b>May</b> 1999–November 2000). The last three issues were released by Gorilla Comics, a short-lived Image imprint co-founded by Wieringo and several other creators in 2000. Following {{the demise of the}} series, Wieringo also penciled one 13–page story in a post-series one-shot, Tellos: Maiden Voyage #1 (March 2001).|$|E
25|$|The {{mass media}} face {{a number of}} {{pressures}} that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims {{in terms of their}} credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who {{know a great deal about}} certain scientific <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.|$|E
25|$|Without {{appropriate}} {{awareness of}} marine pollution, the necessary global will to effectively address the <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> prove inadequate. Balanced {{information on the}} sources and harmful effects of marine pollution need {{to become part of}} general public awareness, and ongoing research is required to fully establish, and keep current, the scope of the issues. As expressed in Daoji and Dag's research, {{one of the reasons why}} environmental concern is lacking among the Chinese is because the public awareness is low and therefore should be targeted.|$|E

25|$|Pharmaceutical management, as with Parkinson's disease, {{involves}} {{striking a}} balance between treating the motor, emotive, and cognitive symptoms. Motor symptoms appear to respond somewhat to the medications used to treat Parkinson's disease (e.g. levodopa), while cognitive <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> improve with medications for Alzheimer's disease such as donepezil. Medications used {{in the treatment of}} ADHD (e.g. methylphenidate) might improve cognition or daytime sleepiness; however, medications for both Parkinson's disease and ADHD increase levels of the chemical dopamine in the brain, so increase the risk of hallucinations with those classes of pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|Bioethical {{concerns}} have historically {{played an important}} role in triage decisions, such as the allocation of iron lungs during the polio epidemics of the 1940s and of dialysis machines during the 1960s. As many health care systems in the developed world continue to plan for an expected influenza pandemic, bioethical issues regarding the triage of patients and the rationing of care continue to evolve. Similar <b>issues</b> <b>may</b> occur for paramedics in the field in the earliest stages of mass casualty incidents when large numbers of potentially serious or critical patients may be combined with extremely limited staffing and treatment resources.|$|E
