5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy.

I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> comfortable in my skin but this was tough."

500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters {{from those who have}} disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> proud for my part in creating Oracle." [...] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker." ...|$|E

With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back.

He increased her role in storylines. This made Cooper delighted, of the changes she stated: [...] "he seemed to like what I did and he's worked on it and developed it. Paul has really taken me under his wing, he's worked me so hard and he's given me opportunities that I could only have dreamt of."

Never Let Me Go was the second film based on an Ishiguro novel to open the festival, after Merchant Ivory–Ismail Merchant's The Remains of the Day in 1993. Regarding the film's screening at the London Film Festival, Ishiguro said, [...] "It is a fantastic privilege, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> lucky. To some extent it is a showcase for British talent and it's a tremendous honour". Describing Never Let Me Go as [...] "accomplished and imaginative", Sandra Helborn, the London Film Festival Artistic Director, added that [...] "It combines impeccable film making, outstanding performances and a deeply moving story, and I couldn’t wish for a stronger or more appropriate opening night".

500|$|According to numismatic {{historian}} Roger Burdette, [...] "Chapman's letter {{caused some}} consternation at the White House". [...] The President prepared a reply {{in which he}} expressed himself strongly to Chapman, but Bigelow persuaded him to substitute a milder letter over Bigelow's signature, defending the new coins. [...] Bigelow's letter replied to Chapman's complaint about the Indian, [...] "The answer to {{this is that the}} head was taken from a recent photograph of an Indian whose health was excellent. [...] Perhaps Mr. Chapman has in mind the fatter but less characteristic type of Indian sometimes seen on the reservations." [...] Chapman wrote again, and had the correspondence published in the numismatic press, but no one at the lame duck Roosevelt White House bothered to reply, according to Burdette, [...] "the new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty-five years, or until Congress ordered them changed". [...] Leach wrote to Bigelow on January 2, 1909, [...] "I was somewhat amused by their savage attack, and should have liked to have been in a position to reply to this unjust criticism. [...] However, I am pleased to say that adverse criticism of the coins is an exception. [...] <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> well pleased with the result." ...|$|E

Allen Daviau, who was nominated as cinematographer, publicly complained, [...] "I can't second-guess the Academy, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> sorry that I get nominations and Steven doesn't.

500|$|Unlike EastEnders, E20 uses {{incidental}} music, which Scott Matthewman of The Stage said {{makes it}} feel like an episode of Hollyoaks, a Channel 4 soap opera targeted at a teen audience. A remix of the EastEnders theme tune was created for the series, {{with members of the}} public submitting remixes in a competition held on the BBC website. The competition opened on 11 November 2009 and was officially launched on 13 November by Annie Mac on her BBC Radio 1 show. More than 250 entries were submitted. They were reduced to four and judged by Sathe, Santer, Keillor, original theme tune composer Simon May, and BBC Radio 1Xtra's DJ Ace. The winner, 21-year-old Carl Darling, was announced on 4 December 2009. He said [...] "I was very excited to hear that my track was chosen by such an eclectic judging panel. And to spend time in the BBC studios and walking around the Square was phenomenal. I have grown up hearing Simon May's original theme tune and watching Albert Square and the iconic Queen Vic, so <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> privileged {{to be a part of}} EastEnders: E20 history!" [...] Darling explained that he wanted to keep all the [...] "essential features" [...] of the original theme, but to make a grimy drum and bass version.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} a Bollywood version of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] in India during a Formula One after party in Greater Noida.

For the first time ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and near the end of the performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E

500|$|A final $11.2 {{million was}} {{allocated}} on January 6, 2005, which was 23.3% of the $48 million Department of Education budget for that fiscal year. On July 15, 2005, {{the school was}} awarded a $60,000 federal fund for energy efficiency 39% below the national energy threshold; this would save the New Brunswick government $115,193 per year, or an eventual $2 million over 20 years. The province's educational minister, Madelaine Dubé, said: [...] "It is {{good to know that}} our schools can also contribute to protecting our environment." [...] The school held its inauguration ceremony with Bernard Lord present on September 30, 2005, despite its delayed opening {{a few days after the}} beginning of the 200506 school year.

500|$|Christopher Eccleston's casting as the Ninth Doctor was {{announced}} on 22 March 2004. He was the production team's first {{choice for the}} character. Other actors linked to the role included Bill Nighy, Richard E Grant, Anthony Head, Eddie Izzard, Hugh Grant and Alan Davies. Jane Tranter, BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated in the announcement of his casting that casting an actor of Eccleston's reputation signalled [...] "our intention to take Doctor Who into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values– to be surprising, edgy and eccentric". Executive Producer Russell T Davies remarked that casting Eccleston [...] "raises the bar for all of us". Eccleston cited {{the quality of the}} scripts as a reason for joining the cast, stating in an interview on BBC's Breakfast programme that he was [...] "excited" [...] about working with Davies. In the press-pack for the series he states that he had emailed the writer to declare his interest in the role. Eccleston enjoyed having the chance to work on a series aimed at a different demographic than his previous work, noting that [...] "it's aimed at families, so I'm kind of acting for children and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> lucky {{to be able to do}} that". He felt that being cast by Davies in the series was a [...] "risk" [...] because as an actor he is not known for [...] "charm or comedy" [...] and anticipated a potential backlash due to being built up as [...] "an actor of stature" [...] and the difference between his own interpretation of the character and past doctors.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
