40|$|This report {{explores the}} impact of the crisis on wage-setting {{mechanisms}} in the 28 EU Member States plus Norway. It also examines {{the impact of}} the EU’s new economic governance regime – specifically the requirements of the country-specific recommendations and Memoranda of Understanding – on wage-setting mechanisms. It looks at changes in wage bargaining levels, the extent of horizontal coordination across bargaining units, links between the different levels involved in wage-setting, minimum wage-setting and indexation mechanisms, and the volume and duration of collective wage agreements. The report examines the factors influencing changes, chiefly economic and political ones, and addresses the role of different institutional actors in initiating and implementing changes, including the social partners, national governments and the European and international institutions. Overall, the extent and consequences of change in wage-setting has been greatest among the countries receiving <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>packages</b> from the troika of European and international institutions...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis rapidly spread across borders and financial markets, and also distressed EU bond markets. The crisis did not hit all {{markets in the}} same way. We measure the strength and direction of linkages between 16 EU sovereign bond markets using a factor-augmented version of the VAR model in Diebold and Yilmaz (2009). We then provide a novel test for contagion by applying the multivariate structural break test of Qu and Perron (2007) on this FAVAR detecting significant sudden changes in shock transmission. Results indicate substantial spillover, especially between EMU countries. Differences in bilateral linkages are due {{to a combination of}} fiscal trouble and a large banking sector, as Belgium, Italy and Spain are central to shock transmission during the financial crisis. Contagion has been a rather rare phenomenon limited to a few well defined moments of uncertainty on <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>packages</b> for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

The <b>Financial</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Package</b> (FAP) scheme for homeowners was a no-faults scheme that offered a remedy for cash strapped owners where none had existed previously. Why then, some three years after its introduction, has there been limited uptake by homeowners, with some labelling the scheme a failure? This paper explores the reasons leading up to its introduction of this financial package legislation, particularly the thrust of the submissions made to the New Zealand Parliament Local Government and Environment Select committee in the submission period prior to the reporting back to Parliament. It will also examined the construction issues that have plagued the NZ building industry since the 1990 s, and which have led to the passing of this legislation. The paper will outline the main characteristics that set this FAP apart from normal lending systems and explore the implications of the package for the homeowner and the building industry here in New Zealand. The reasons for the low uptake of the scheme three years on from its introduction in July 2011 are examined and analysed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{outlines}} Japan’s {{policies with}} regard to small businesses and small business financing, from the prewar period and throughout the postwar reconstruction period, {{from the viewpoint of}} international comparisons. The stance of the Japanese government vis-à-vis small businesses in the prewar period was that it should strengthen product competitiveness and credit by organizing them. However, the connection between those policies and finance was weak. Nonetheless, many small businesses made active use of informal transactions or private financial institutions that served small businesses. During wartime, the government forced small businesses to join the munitions industry or face closure. To facilitate changes or closures in small businesses, a governmental financial institution was established. On the other hand, the provision of loans for small businesses via private financial institutions or informal transactions quickly dissolved. During the postwar reconstruction period, the government established the Small Business Agency, resumed policies by which to rationalize and modernize small businesses through better organization, created new financial institutions that served small businesses, and launched government-funded <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>packages</b> for small businesses. It is clear that essential institutions and policies supporting small businesses during the time of high economic growth stemmed from the postwar reconstruction era...|$|R
