Acetylene cylinders should not {{be stored in}} confined spaces / enclosed vehicles / garages / buildings to avoid unintended leakage leading to <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> In the USA, National Electric Code (NEC) requires consideration for hazardous areas including those where acetylene may be released during accidents or leaks. Consideration may include electrical classification and use of listed Group A electrical components in USA. Further information on determining the areas requiring special consideration is in NFPA 497. In Europe, ATEX also requires consideration for hazardous areas where flammable gases may be released during accidents or leaks.|$|E
