40|$|Two {{case studies}} on Danish sandy loams {{investigated}} {{long-term effects of}} fertilization and crop rotation. Case Study 1 compared a diversely cropped organically farmed soil (DFG(1)) with a conventionally farmed soil predominantly growing annual crops (DFA), both receiving animal manure. In Case Study 2, a diversely cropped organically managed soil DFG(2)) receiving animal manure was compared with an almost exclusively cereal cropped conventionally farmed soil receiving no animal manure (CCC). A multi-level experimental strategy was followed to compare integrating field methods with specialized laboratory methods. Ease of tillage was described {{in the field and}} characterized using a <b>drop</b> <b>shatter</b> field test and by measuring aggregate tensile strength. Fitness as a seedbed was characterised visually in the field and from the <b>drop</b> <b>shatter</b> test. Impedance to seedling emergence and root penetration was evaluated by measuring bulk soil shear strength. For Case Study 1, soil tilth was better for the DFA soil than for the DFG(1) soil (i. e. lower soil strength and higher ease of fragmentation and friability index for DFA). However, a crumbly structure and a moderate bulk density suggested that the DFG(1) soil was also a favourable medium for plant growth. For Case Study 2, the CCC soil had a lower organic matter content, higher bulk density, higher soil strength, and lower ease of fragmentation in comparison with the DFG(2) soil...|$|R
40|$|The most {{critical}} parameters for the efficient design of coal processing operations {{depend on the}} assessment of coal breakage and washability characteristics of the coal resource. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) technology has been demonstrated to have the capability of analyzing washability and fragmentation parameters (particle size, energy, coal type). In this regard, progeny size distributions are obtained from sequential modified <b>drop</b> <b>shatter</b> tests (different input energy levels) and from XCT analysis. In this way, the breakage characteristics (selection and breakage functions) of coal particles are established and the prediction of particle size distribution (PSD) for different levels of energy input is demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|Laminated {{glass was}} invented in 1903 by the French chemist Édouard Bénédictus (1878-1930), {{inspired}} by a laboratory accident. A glass flask had become coated with the plastic cellulose nitrate and when <b>dropped</b> <b>shattered</b> but did not break into pieces. However, {{it was not until}} 1909 that Benedictus filed a patent. [...] In 1911, he formed the Société du Verre Triplex, which fabricated a glass-plastic composite to reduce injuries in car accidents. [...] Production of Triplex glass was slow and painstaking, making it expensive. It was not immediately widely adopted by automobile manufacturers, but laminated glass was widely used in the eyepieces of gas masks during World War I. In 1912, the process was licensed to The English Triplex Safety Glass Company. Subsequently, in the United States, both Libbey Owens-Ford and Du Pont de Nemours with Pittsburg Plate Glass produced Triplex.|$|R

40|$|Conventional coal {{washability}} {{analysis is}} achieved by conducting Float and Sink (FaS) test, which is sampling dependent, destructive and uses environmentally hazardous chemicals. With the improvement of modern 2 D and 3 D imaging technologies, image analysis methods of digital CT scanned images are being developed and trialled to predict coal washability in a more flexible, efficient and safe way. To support the validity of this approach, this study illustrates the fundamental differences in breakage and liberation behaviour of coal lithotypes at the same rank from a single seam. Nine lithotype samples were repeatedly CT scanned before and {{after a series of}} 2 m drops to emulate fragmentation during the <b>drop</b> <b>shatter</b> test. The 3 D watershed segmentation method was applied to scans to monitor changes in fragment size distribution and then assign a density to each fragment to obtain coal washability. Comparison between the processed image analysis results and FaS tests conducted after 31 drops show a very good match both in particle size distribution and coal washability for all the lithotypes. Results also show that dull coal or stone illustrate better agreement between CT image analysis and FaS test due to their very low percentage of small particles which may lead to underestimation when using CT image analysis. Possible ways of improving small particles estimation would be to use an XY plane H-maxima method and low merging coefficient in the image analysis process...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} concerning {{analysis of}} sprays and drop/turbulence interactions are reviewed. Consideration {{is given to}} dilute sprays and related dilute dispersed flows, which contain well-defined dispersed-phase elements (e. g. spherical drops) and have dispersed-phase volume fractions less than 1 %; and to the near-injector, dense spray region, having irregularly-shaped liquid elements and relatively-high liquid fractions. Early analysis of dilute sprays and other dispersed flows assumed either locally-homogeneous flow (LHF), implying infinitely-fast interphase transport rates, or deterministic separated flow (DSF) where finite interphase transport rates are considered, but interactions between dispersed-phase elements and turbulence are ignored. These limits are useful in some instances; however, recent evidence shows that both methods are deficient for quantitative estimates {{of the structure of}} most practical dispersed flows, including sprays. As a result, stochastic separated flow (SSF) methods have been developed, which treat both finite interphase transport rates and dispersed phase (drop) /turbulence interactions using random-walk computations for the dispersed phase. Evaluation of SSF methods for particle-laden jets; nonevaporating, evaporating and combusting sprays; and noncondensing and condensing bubbly jets has been encouraging, suggesting capabilities of current SSF methods to treat a variety of interphase processes. However, current methods are relatively ad hoc and many fundamental problems must still be resolved for dilute flows, e. g. effects of anisotropic turbulence, modification of continuous-phase turbulence properties by the dispersed phase (turbulence modulation), effects of turbulence on interphase transport rates, and <b>drop</b> <b>shattering,</b> among others. Dense sprays have received less attention and are poorly understood due to substantial theoretical and experimental difficulties, e. g. the idealization of spherical drops is not realistic, effects of liquid breakup and collisions are difficult to describe, spatial resolution is limited and the flow is opaque to optical diagnostics which have been helpful for studies of dilute sprays. Limited progress thus far, however, suggests that LHF analysis may provide a useful first-approximation of the structure and mixing properties of dense sprays near pressure-atomizing injectors. Since dense-spray processes fix initial conditions needed to rationally analyze dilute sprays, more research is this area is clearly warranted...|$|R

25|$|In the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, an alternative-timeline {{retelling of}} the first three titles, Scorpion reprises his role from the first game in seeking vengeance against the elder Sub-Zero, the {{difference}} being that he serves Quan Chi from the start, unaware that Quan Chi is the mastermind behind the Lin Kuei clan's murder of his family and clan. Raiden, attempting to alter the timeline of the events {{of the first}} three tournaments in hopes of averting Armageddon, talks Scorpion into sparing Sub-Zero's life on the grounds that he would seek to revive the Shirai Ryu in exchange. Scorpion agrees, and indeed when he defeats Sub-Zero in the Netherrealm, he refuses to kill him, but Quan Chi convinces Scorpion otherwise by replaying a graphic vision of the Lin Kuei's slaughter of the Shirai Ryu in addition to Scorpion's wife and child. Scorpion then reappears on the tournament grounds holding Sub-Zero's incinerated skull and spinal column aloft before letting it <b>drop</b> and <b>shatter</b> on the floor. Later in the game, the younger Sub-Zero (formerly Tundra) seeks revenge for his brother's death by demanding a fight with Scorpion in Shao Kahn's arena, and Quan Chi grants the request. Scorpion immediately recognizes {{that this is not the}} original Sub-Zero but his younger brother, who defeats Scorpion but is apprehended by his clan before he can finish Scorpion off, and Scorpion teleports away during the confusion. He was last seen when he appears to fight Raiden in the Netherrealm but loses against the Thunder God and disappeared. In his game ending, the Shirai Ryu appear before him as ghostly apparitions and reveal the truth. They aid him in Scorpion's killing Quan Chi for his deception. In Sub-Zero's ending, he learns the truth about his and Scorpion's families and offers Scorpion a chance to join him in his quest for vengeance, with Sub-Zero and Scorpion joining forces to form the new Deadly Alliance.|$|R
40|$|Measurements on the {{electrification}} on freezing {{of individual}} water drops of diameter between 3 and 5 mm supported by an air stream {{have shown that}} the freezing behaviour of the drops is temperature-dependent. Above - 10 C the freezing progressed uniformly throughout the drop from a single point. Below - 10 C the outer surface of the drop froze rapidly {{with the exception of a}} small area at the top of the drop. Freezing then progressed uniformly from the base of the <b>drop</b> upwards. Mo <b>shattering</b> or electrification of the drops was observed during their freezing. These results are contrasted with those of previous workers who observed the freezing of drops suspended on fibres. Measurements of the electrification of ice spheres supported by an air stream have indicated that the sign of the charge acquired by the spheres due to riming is temperature-dependent. When the sphere is rimed by droplets at temperatures above - 10 C it acquires a negative charge, and v/hen the riming droplets are at temperatures below - 10 C the ice sphere acquires a positive charge. An explanation is proposed for this effect in terms of the observed freezing behaviour of individual water drops. It I suggested that this effect could lead to thunderstorm electrification of the observed polarity. Measurements on the electrification of melting ice spheres supported by an air stream indicated that the sign of the charge acquired by the spheres is dependent on whether or not water is flung off the charge was negative. This may explain the discrepancies between the laboratory and field measurements of MacCready and Proudfit...|$|R
