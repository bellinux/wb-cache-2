25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E

Simultaneously, the broad band irradiances which induced the actinic exposures and/or the biologically effective exposures for any other process may be evaluated with the method. The erythemal exposures ranged from 13 to 23 muW cm- 2.

The UV spectral irradiance may be measured with calibrated spectroradiometers. Alternatively, the biologically effective UV may be measured with broadband devices. This paper reviews the techniques for assessing biologically effective exposures in photobiological experiments. UV meters, such as the Robertson-Berger (RB) meter, or passive dosimeters, such as polysulphone, that possess a spectral response approximating the human erythemal response {{can be used to}} estimate erythemally effective exposure or actinic exposure due to solar UV. The sensitivity of the RB meter is about 0. 56 uW cm- 2 and polysulphone can record an exposure of about 2 mJ cm- 2. For photobiological processes other than erythema these devices are not suitable to determine the exposure. In terms of these applications, a spectrum evaluator consisting of four different types of dosimeter material can be employed to evaluate the UV spectrum of the source. This method can be useful both for solar UV studies and research with UV lamps that possess radiation wavelengths shorter than 295 nm. The device can be used to measure exposures where the actinic and <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> differ significantly.

50|$|A {{relatively}} new rating designation for sun protective {{textiles and clothing}} is UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor), which represents the ratio of sunburn-causing UV measured without and with {{the protection of the}} fabric. For example, a fabric rated UPF 30 means that, if 30 units of UV fall on the fabric, only 1 unit will pass through to the skin. A UPF 30 fabric that blocks 29 out of 30 units of UV is therefore blocking 96.7%. Unlike SPF (Sun Protection Factor) measurements that traditionally use human sunburn testing, UPF is measured using a laboratory instrument (spectrophotometer or spectroradiometer) and an artificial light source, and then applying a sunburn weighting curve (<b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum)</b> across the relevant UV wavelengths.
