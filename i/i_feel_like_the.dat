In a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), {{when asked about the}} single most important management technique he'd learned and where, he said [...] "This one I got from PayPal, but I'm a strong believer in doing 1 on 1 meetings with each of my reports every week. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> company's psychiatrist, but I do feel like listening to people and hearing about their problems (personal and professional) cleans out the cobwebs and keeps the organization humming.” ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Rob Thomas also {{appreciated}} bloggers' {{contributions to}} Veronica Mars, stating [...] "Sometimes I think bloggers are our journalists. [...] <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> bloggers made the show. In a way, {{a day like}} (the press day) is preaching to the choir, but I don't know that we'd exist without them.” This {{was the first time}} that non-cast or crew members visited the set. After reaching Kearny Mesa, San Diego, where the show primarily films, the bloggers toured the set and talked with cast and crew members. One press member expressed that Ryan Hansen, Thomas, and Kristen Bell were especially kind and receptive to the visitors.|$|E
500|$|Like {{her debut}} album, Kesha worked with some {{previous}} producers and writers that {{worked with her}} on her first album, such as: Dr. Luke, Ammo, Benny Blanco and Max Martin. Unlike her debut album though, Kesha {{enlisted the help of}} producer Bangladesh. She explained the reason for enlisting his help was that she wanted to [...] "add a tougher edge to her music". She said that the message she wanted to put out through this album was to create [...] "good, positive, [...] music". She elaborated, [...] "I feel like I’m creating this hopefully very youthful and irreverent movement of the kids, of like adolescence. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> parents don’t get it, but the kids get it. And they deserve to have more good, positive music.” ...|$|E

500|$|Francis also {{expressed}} her disappointment in her former daytime role on General Hospital. She {{said that she}} has found that her [...] "fan base will follow" [...] her whatever she does. She explained that, [...] "My job is not to disappoint , not to cheat them. And <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> last little appearance on GH cheated them. I welcome {{the opportunity to do}} something new to continue to entertain my audience. What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray". Bell opened up about hiring Francis, revealing: [...] "Genie is amazing and a real pro. I put pen and paper and she ran with it. She is really a brave, courageous actress" [...] and added that [...] "It really has been fantastic to watch, and I think she is terrific." ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2001, {{the project}} had become {{stranded}} in development hell. In a Q panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, [...] "I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{time for a}} Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced {{in an interview in}} early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E

2500|$|Later in August, Foreman {{said that}} [...] "there {{are so many}} {{different}} directions we can go in. One of the songs has a (Led) Zeppelin feel.

And today... <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> past six, seven years of my life, and the adversity...in my life that I have endured and overcame, that is synonymous and it embodies what the word 'Trouble Man' means today.

2500|$|In Japan, Famitsu {{gave it a}} {{score of}} one eight, one nine, one ten, and one nine {{for a total of}} 36 out of 40. One {{reviewer}} said, [...] "The way you participate in events and run races on public roads serves well as a new direction for the series. [...] Earning popularity for things like drifting and other stuff makes it fun to just drive around, but I still wish there was something more unique to this game. I have to give top marks to the graphics and ease of play, though." [...] Another reviewer stated, [...] "This used to be a really stoic racing simulator, but this is more of a driving game designed to be easy to pick up. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> controls are more forgiving, too, and the open-world freedom makes the whole thing a lot more approachable." ...|$|E

In January 2016, Gunn revealed that he had chosen an additional Bowie song to appear in the film, but had cut the original scene it was featured in. The inclusion would have made Bowie the only artist to be featured on both mixtapes. With Bowie's death that month, Gunn hoped {{to find a way to}} include the chosen song somewhere else in the film as a [...] "fair and appropriate" [...] way to honor him, as Bowie was one of Gunn's idols. Gunn described the soundtrack as [...] "more diverse" [...] than that for the first Guardians, which had [...] "a bunch of songs that maybe you heard but didn’t know the name of the song–you didn’t know the name of the singer.
