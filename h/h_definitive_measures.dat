Guide numbers are {{a function of the}} illuminance and duration of a flash (a property called luminous exposure that have lux⋅seconds as their units of measure) arriving at a scene as measured by an incident-light meter (pictured at right), not the amount leaving the scene. This often seems counterintuitive to hobbyists who incorrectly assume that cameras’ built-in reflected-light meters are a <b>definitive</b> <b>measure</b> of exposure. However, this principle underlies why using a camera with a through-the-lens meter to photograph a park bench surrounded by sunlit snow underexposes the image, making the bench appear nearly black and the snow as dark as grass and foliage. This is because reflected-light meters are calibrated for an average scene reflectance of 18 percent and can’t “know” when a scene has non-average reflectance. See also Gray card and Light meter.|$|R

The regression equations between specific gravity and osmolality, however, differ considerably between the two age groups, maturation to the adult regression occurring within the first 5 years of life. Specifically derived regression equations should therefore be used when predicting urine osmolality from measurement of specific gravity in neonates. The osmolality of urine is the <b>definitive</b> <b>measure</b> of its concentration. Under normal physiological con-ditions low urine osmolality equates with hydration, and high urine osmolality with dehydration.
