5|$|A {{site for}} a church had been set aside on the estate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> and in 1884 Plumbe {{submitted}} designs for a church and mission hall. The mission hall opened in March 1885 with room for 350, and soon began to suffer from overcrowding. The people of Noel Park started a fund {{to pay for the}} church, which was consecrated on 1 November 1889 as St Mark's.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke {{deflectors}} were introduced due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton and Jefferson had the {{greatest}} impact on cabinet deliberations during Washington's first term. Their deep philosophical differences set them against each other <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> and they frequently sparred over economic and foreign policy issues. With Jefferson's departure, Hamilton came to dominate the cabinet, and Washington continued to turn to him for advice even after Hamilton resigned from the Cabinet.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 1890, {{the bridge}} was officially opened by future Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, then {{chairman}} of the newly formed London County Council. Unlike its predecessor, the new bridge was officially named Battersea Bridge.

Only with an adequate water supply can real life multiple water needs be met most conventional {{water supply system}} falls short. Systems are typically designed for a single use only either for domestic use or single productive use such as irrigation. Yet, in reality villagers invariably use these schemes for multiple purposes. Water supply system designed for multiple uses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outsets,</b> {{can make a difference}} to the lives of poor communities by improving food security and income as well as health and wellbeing. In addition to alleviate poverty, multiple use approaches also reduce unpaid workloads and enhance gender equity...|$|R

5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} formed as Dundee Hibernian in 1909, playing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> at Tannadice Park. They were voted into the Scottish Football League in 1910. After being saved from {{going out of}} {{business}} in October 1923, the club changed their name to Dundee United in order to widen their appeal.|$|E
5|$|The post-war period {{witnessed}} both {{expansion and}} the commissioning of new products. The company always ensured its products {{were covered by}} patent and trade mark, a policy prosecuted with vigour <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset.</b> The early 1920s saw the wholesale and export {{side of the business}} move to Notting Hill Gate, close to the pipe and cigarette division located at Campden Hill Road.|$|E

5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E

40|$|Selected {{applications}} of the NTU Shapley value to settings other than that of general equilibrium in perfect competition.

5|$|Frank then {{met with}} his assistant, N. V. Darley, and Harry Scott of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, whom Frank hired to help {{investigate}} the case. The Pinkerton detectives investigated many leads, ranging from crime scene evidence to allegations of sexual misconduct {{on the part of}} Frank. The Pinkertons were required to submit duplicates of all evidence to the police, including any that hurt Frank's case. Scott's collaboration with police detective John Black, who <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> believed in Frank's guilt, resulted in a conflict of interest.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving very slowly towards the coast.|$|E

[...] "I'm so glad you've come," [...] she said, with one of her rare smiles.|$|R
50|$|The court {{proceeded}} on {{the assumption}} that the claims were properly brought, although it noted that this was a slightly shaky assumption. Although the claims had survived a strike-out and an application for indemnity costs, the claims had failed, and a key part had been abandoned midway through trial. Millett J noted in particular that the undervalue claim was doomed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> very <b>outset.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Qualifications {{frameworks}} {{emerged from}} two complementary {{education and training}} discourses in the late 1980s: the competence approach to vocational education, and the shift to learning outcomes, embedded within the broader concept of lifelong learning. As a result, the interrelationship between competences and learning outcomes was not only firmly embedded in qualifications framework thinking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> very <b>outset,</b> but was also used in a hybridized form.|$|R
