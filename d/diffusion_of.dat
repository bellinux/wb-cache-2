5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E

For each system, <b>diffusion</b> processes <b>of</b> four physical quantities are simulated and the cross correlations between them are investigated.

In addition, the dynamic structure factor, which describes the <b>diffusion</b> behavior <b>of</b> local mass density fluctuations, is in general insufficient for probing <b>diffusion</b> processes <b>of</b> other quantities because in some cases there is no correlation between them.

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E

Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E
5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E

The observed significant increase <b>of</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient <b>of</b> cobalt atoms under the cyclic γ-ε-γ martensitic transformations {{was due to}} the action of two independent mechanisms - an athermal one and a thermally activated one. The first one arose from the direct γ-ε and the reverse ε-γ transformations with corresponding direct and reverse lattice shears during alternating stresses and simultaneous lattice restructuring. Another mechanism arose under the <b>diffusion</b> annealing <b>of</b> the phase-hardened alloy.|$|R
