5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} current output, {{ensuring that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current.|$|E
5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Andrei Kolmogorov {{developed}} in a 1931 paper {{a large part of}} the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stock market as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmgorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.|$|E

As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels.

According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E

In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially.

5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping {{applies only to}} damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them.

However, in physical implementations, various couplings with the environment are unavoidable {{and can lead to}} a dephasing of a quantum bit(qubit). The background charge fluctuations are an important dephasing process, especially in a charge qubit system. We examined the dephasing rate of a qubit due to random telegraph noise. Solving stochastic differential equations, we obtained the dephasing rate of a qubit constructed of a coupled-dot system; we applied our results to the charge Josephson qubit system. We examined the dephasing rates due to two types of couplings between the coupled-dot system and the background charge, namely, <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel coupling constant and <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asymmetric bias. For a strong coupling condition, the dephasing rate was inversely proportional to the time constant of the telegraph noise. When there is <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel coupling constant, Gaussian decay occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial regime.
