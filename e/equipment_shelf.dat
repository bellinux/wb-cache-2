40|$|A cross-disciplinary team of {{scientists}} and engineers applied expertise gained in Lunar Lander development to the conceptual design of a long-duration, deep space habitat for Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) missions. The design reference mission involved two launches to assemble a 5 -module vehicle for a 380 -day round trip mission carrying 4 crew members. The conceptual design process yielded a number of interesting debates, some {{of which could be}} significant design drivers in a detailed Deep Space Habitat (DSH) design. These issues include: a) Launch loads: Potentially drives layout of equipment mounted to module floors or walls, and whether temporary internal structure is required to distribute launch loads to minimize shell mass; b) Unmanned loiter time: When added to an already lengthy mission, loiter time further drives risk and reliability, and poses issues for <b>equipment</b> <b>shelf</b> life such as material degradation or cryogenic fluids boil-off; c) Pointing and Visibility: A habitat embedded in a 5 -module stack may drive Communications, Tracking, Guidance, and Navigation equipment out onto long booms to maintain line-of-sight visibility with targets. However, long booms will be more susceptible to disruption from exercise-induced vibration, potential damage during docking/undocking operations, and increased power distribution mass; d) Water: although it is assumed that a water processor will collect and recycle water, several interesting question were posed, such as: How much water to start with? Should potable water serve double-duty as radiation protection? And if so, should it be stowed in a single large tank, or smaller, portable containers? e) Design for repairability: one of the worst-case scenarios identified was a cabin depressurization that required suited repair from inside the module, potentially driving the need for long umbilical hoses or special equipment to allow smaller, mated modules to be used as safe havens for up to 180 days...|$|E
40|$|Faster, more {{powerful}} and dense computing hardware generates significant heat and imposes considerable data center cooling requirements. Traditional computer room air conditioning (CRAC) cooling methods are proving increasingly cost-ineffective and inefficient. Studies show that using the volume of room air as a heat exchange medium is wasteful and allows for substantial mixing of hot and cold air. Further, it limits cabinet/frame/rack density because it cannot effectively cool high heat density equipment that is spaced closely together. A more cost-effective, efficient solution for maximizing heat transfer and enabling higher heat density equipment frames {{can be accomplished by}} utilizing properly positioned ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂphase changeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtwo-phaseÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ pumped refrigerant cooling methods. Pumping low pressure, oil-free phase changing refrigerant through microchannel heat exchangers can provide up to 90 % less energy consumption for the primary cooling loop within the room. The primary benefits of such a solution include reduced energy requirements, optimized utilization of data center space, and lower OPEX and CAPEX. Alcatel-Lucent recently developed a modular cooling technology based on a pumped two-phase refrigerant that removes heat directly at the shelf level of equipment racks. The key elements that comprise the modular cooling technology consist of the following. A pump delivers liquid refrigerant to finned microchannel heat exchangers mounted on the back of equipment racks. Fans drive air through the <b>equipment</b> <b>shelf,</b> where the air gains heat dissipated by the electronic components therein. Prior to exiting the rack, the heated air passes through the heat exchangers, where it is cooled back down to the temperature level of the air entering the frame by vaporization of the refrigerant, which is subsequently returned to a condenser where it is liquefied and recirculated by the pump. All the cooling air enters and leaves the shelves/racks at nominally the same temperature. Results of a 100 kW prototype data center installation of the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology were dramatic in terms of energy efficiency and the ability to cool high-heat-density equipment. The prototype data center installation consisted of 10 racks each loaded with 10 kW of high-heat-density IT equipment with the racks arranged in a standard hot-aisle/cold-aisle configuration with standard cabinet spacing. A typical chilled-water CRAC unit would require approximately 16 kW to cool such a heat load. In contrast, the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology required only 2. 3 kW of power for the refrigerant pump and shelf-level fans, a reduction of 85 percent. Differences in hot-aisle and cold-aisle temperature were also substantially reduced, mitigating many issues that arise in purely air-based cooling systems, such as mixing of hot and cold air streams, or from placing high-heat-density equipment in close proximity. The technology is also such that it is able to retro-fit live equipment without service interruption, which is particularly important to the large installed ICT customer base, thereby providing a means of mitigating reliability and performance concerns during the installation, training and validation phases of product integration. Moreover, the refrigerant used in our approach, R 134 a, is a widely-used, non-toxic dielectric liquid which, unlike water, is non-conducting and non-corrosive and will not damage electronics {{in the case of a}} leakÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂa triple-play win over alternative water-based liquid coolant technologies. Finally, through use of a pumped refrigerant, pressures are modest (~ 60 psi), and toxic lubricants and oils are not required, in contrast to compressorized refrigerant systemsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂanother environmental win. Project Activities - The ARCTIC project goal was to further develop and dramatically accelerate the commercialization of this game-changing, refrigerant-based, liquid-cooling technology and achieve a revolutionary increase in energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction for our nationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure. The specific objectives of the ARCTIC project focused in the following three areas: i) advanced research innovations that dramatically enhance the ability to deal with ever-increasing device heat densities and footprint reduction by bringing the liquid cooling much closer to the actual heat sources; ii) manufacturing optimization of key components; and iii) ensuring rapid market acceptance by reducing cost, thoroughly understanding system-level performance, and developing viable commercialization strategies. The project involved participants with expertise in all aspects of commercialization, including research & development, manufacturing, sales & marketing and end users.

25|$|The retail {{environment}} {{not only}} affects quality perceptions, {{but can also}} impact on the way that customers navigate {{their way through the}} retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how <b>equipment,</b> <b>shelves</b> and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space. The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, {{is an example of a}} retail design feature known as a merchandise outpost and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate impulse purchasing or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of {{engineering}} {{education is to}} prepare students to practice engineering and, in particular, {{to deal with the}} forces and materials of nature. Thus, from the earliest days of engineering education, instructional laboratories have been an essential part of undergraduate programs. However, during the last decades the author and others have noted a trend towards increased use of simulations replacing physical experiments in electrical engineering education. One obvious reason is the fact that instructional laboratories are expensive to maintain. Another possible reason is the persistence of the belief that simulations can replace physical experiments. However, physical experiments are indispensable for developing skills to deal with physical processes and instrumentation. The Internet provides new possibilities for universities and other teaching organizations to share laboratories. Blekinge Institute of Technology (hereafter referred to as BTH) in Sweden has opened a traditional electronics laboratory for remote operation 24 - 7 and fitted the laboratory with a unique virtual interface where the students on the computer screen recognize the desktop instruments and the breadboard they have already used in the local laboratory. The fact that teachers in different countries can use existing teaching material in their own language is also unique for this laboratory. Instrument manuals can be downloaded from the web sites of the manufacturers. The activities started 1999 at BTH and the amount of work spent so far is approximately 12 man-years. The BTH design and has been awarded a Best Paper Award at the ASEE (American Society for Engineering Education) Annual Conference in Montreal 2002. Most remote electronics laboratories elsewhere offer fixed experiments but in this one, students around the world can simultaneously wire circuits much like they do in the local laboratory. The BTH laboratory is a client/server application and the Internet is used as the communication infrastructure. The equipment provided comprises a dual channel oscilloscope, a digital multi-meter a triple DC power supply, a circuit wiring robot, and component sets selected by the teachers who have written the lab instruction manuals for the courses. The laboratory staff has mounted these component sets in the circuit assembly robot in the equipment server at BTH and photographs of the components in a set will be displayed in a component box on the client PC screens. Thus a certain set of components is provided for each lab session. The current laboratory supports only instrument models used at BTH. Other universities have other models and a virtual <b>equipment</b> <b>shelf</b> containing other instruments from different manufacturers will be added. The performance of the provided hardware matches most instrument models used in undergraduate education. Students use the mouse to wire instruments and components from the component box to form a circuit on the breadboard displayed on each client PC. They thus control the robot by means of the wiring on the virtual breadboard, Figure 1. The robot is not a mechanical device but a switching matrix consisting of relays, sockets for components, and instrument connectors. Virtual instrument front panels are used to control and read the computer-based instruments by means of remote control, Figure 2. Most of the instruments in the equipment server are manufactured by National Instruments. To avoid damage to components and/or instruments, the teachers define maximum source voltages and all permitted current loops. However, harmless mistakes are allowed. A virtual instructor routine checks each desired circuit and acknowledges the circuit when the voltage levels are not too high and it only contains permitted current loops. Thus, if a user damages a component or an instrument the teacher is to blame not the user. A description of the laboratory can be found in: I. Gustavsson, J. Zackrisson, H. Åkesson, L. Håkansson, "A Flexible Remote Electronics Laboratory", Proceedings of the 2005 REV symposium, Brasov, Romania, June 30 - July 1, 2005. Figure 1. An operational amplifier (μA 741) circuit wired on the virtual breadboard. Figure 2. The oscilloscope virtual front panel displaying the slew rate of the uA 741 operational amplifier in the circuit on the breadboard illustrated in Figure 1. Access to the laboratory is restricted by a reservation system. The main items of this system are students, courses, and lab sessions in order to fit the traditional university system. The teacher of a course makes time reservations for regular supervised lab sessions of the course and specifies also the sets of components {{to be used in the}} sessions. Only students enrolled in the course are permitted to perform experiments using the component sets belonging to the lab sessions of that course. However, there are two guest courses open to the public. In each of the guest courses there is a lab session and a set of components. Only a 56 kbit/s modem and a web browser are required to access these experimental resources. The laboratory is always open and can be used by registered students and guest users around the world. The time-sharing scheme used allows simultaneous access with acceptable response time for 8 client PCs. The address of the laboratory web site is [URL] Universities and other teaching organizations are invited to let their students conduct experiments and to provide regular lab sessions using their own components and learning material in the language of their choice. Expensive laboratory equipment can be provided for students with no time or space limitations. Apart from the fact that each student or team of students using a client computer works in a virtual environment with no face-to-face contact with the instructor or other students in the laboratory, the difference between a lab session in the laboratory presented here and a session in a local laboratory is that it is not possible for users to manipulate the components and the wires with their fingers in a remote laboratory. However, the latter constitutes a new educational tool which is ready for use in undergraduate education and in secondary schools as well as in vocational training and life-long learning. Remote experiments will not replace local lab sessions but supplement them and make experiments more accessible, especially for inexperienced or less confident people requiring more time. It may be possible to compensate for the reduction in the number of traditional lab sessions during the past few decades and even improve electronics courses without incurring any increase in cost. New more effective teaching methods may emerge. Experiments can, for example, easily be integrated into lectures. How about opening a laboratory containing mechanical components? In most cases sound and/or video image transmission will be required. A remote vibration analysis laboratory is being set up at BTH and will provide a platform for an evaluation of the feasibility of remote vibration experiments using the same concept. A dynamic signal analyzer, Agilent 35670 A, connected to a server and traditional vibration sensors and actuators for experimental vibration analysis will be used. As a first example this setup will enable estimation of the important quantities in experimental vibration analysis based on measurements on a boring bar. Such bars are responsible for the majority of vibration problems in turning. The intention is to provide the students with vibration experiments related to an authentic important vibration problem in the industry. The research field has wider implications. Engineering education is not as popular today as it should be given the spread of technology in society. However, it is not so exciting to disassemble a modern digital alarm clock as grandmother’s one! Technical devices in our everyday life are no longer transparent. It has been reported that most teachers in, for example, nursery schools influencing our children have no technical courses whatsoever in their own professional training. The ultimate goal for the research at BTH is ubiquitous physical experimental resources accessible 24 - 7 for everyone to inspire and encourage children, young people and others to study engineering and become good professionals or to be used as means for long life learning of teachers and other professionals...|$|E

This thesis evaluates of the <b>shelf</b> <b>equipment</b> based on 802. 11 {{in a variety of}} situations, including both stationary and mobility tests. Performance tests of distances of up to 2000 meters have been possible to perform by connecting directional antennas to standard access points. Furthermore, a number of different transport layer protocols have been tested in order to cover a broad spectrum of the various types of applications that can come into consideration. Knowledge of distance limitations for this type of equipment and the performance impact of different transport layer protocols is of interest for the missile test range, RFN, in order to see if it is possible to use standard off the <b>shelf</b> <b>equipment</b> for some tasks during test activities. The results of the stationary tests show that the access points used in this thesis perform very well up to the maximum distance tested (2000 meters). Of the four TCP variants tested TCP Vegas is the overall winner, combining high throughput with noticeably fewer frames retransmitted by the access points. For UDP, few packet losses and low jitter were seen in general.

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} of railway bridges {{is an essential}} but currently expensive proposition. Current systems employing data loggers and analyzers are both labour intensive for setup and require trained manpower for deployment and usage. In this work we propose a system design for remote, on-demand railway bridge monitoring system which is easier to deploy and autonomous in its operation. The system is low cost, as off the <b>shelf</b> <b>equipments</b> are used and expensive sensing equipments are replaced with Micro Electronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based sensors and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) replacing the cabling and data logging system for data transportation and collection. Current structural {{health monitoring}} systems are essentially wired solution or proprietary single hop wireless solutions. These systems are non-scalable and difficult to deploy {{on most of the}} structures. In contrast our approach using independent nodes attached with appropriate sensors and batteries for power make them easy to deploy without hassles of cabling. Using wireless data transmission and multi-hop data transport our solution is highly scalable. Use of lo...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A time-resolved fluoroimmuno assay of the IgM-rheumatoid {{factor is}} described. Aggregated rabbit IgG was coated to microtitre plates {{to serve as}} the target protein. F(ab') 2 -fragments from antibodies, raised in rabbits against human IgM, were {{labelled}} with Eu 3 + and used in the assay to mark the bound IgM-rheumatoid factor. The labelling procedure is easy to perform, and {{there is no need for}} special <b>equipment.</b> The <b>shelf</b> life of the label at — 20 °C is at least one year. The lower detection limit of the assay is 1. 3 χ ΙΟ 3 IU/ 1. The range over which the IgM-rheumatoid factor can be measured at a within-run precision of < 5 % without varying the dilution (working range) is 5 — 1200 χ l O 3 IU/ 1. Linearity in serum dilutions is good. There is good correlation with existing methods for the assay of IgM-rheumatoid factor. This correlation is better with an assay using rabbit IgG as the target than with one using human IgG. Comparison of methods shows that standardization, despite the use of the WHO Reference Preparation as the first calibrator, remains problematic. The 95 th percentile in normal bloodbank donors is 8 χ ΙΟ 3 IU/ 1. The costs for the reagents were about 0. 5 Dutch florin (ca 0. 30 US-$) per well. In conclusion, the method described here is analytically at least comparable with other methods, in precision, linearity, working range etc. Finally, it is easy to perform.

40|$|Abstract- The wide scale {{deployment}} of IEEE 802. 11 based wireless networks {{have led to}} a number of security challenges. The MAC and Physical layers of IEEE 802. 11 wireless networks possess various vulnerabilities to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In this work we discuss DoS attacks which exploit the MAC layer vulnerabilities of IEEE 802. 11 networks. In recent years, DoS attacks in wireless networks have been getting the attention of researchers and it has been demonstrated that MAC layer related DoS attacks can easily be launched by using off the <b>shelf</b> <b>equipment.</b> In most cases the attacker forges the MAC addresses of wireless devices in order to halt the operation of the wireless network. MAC address spoofing is possible because the IEEE 802. 11 standard does not provide per frame source authentication for control and management frames. Even the new WLAN security standard IEEE 802. 11 i does not solve these problems. Many tools are easily available for attackers to launch such types of attack. In this paper we classify MAC layer DoS attacks into three categories, and we compare the existing countermeasures to such attacks. We also identify the issues with existing countermeasure and provide future research directions. I...|$|R
