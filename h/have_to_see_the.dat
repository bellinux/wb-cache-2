He alleged that the seas surrounding Pedra Branca had always been in Johor's hands and had never been surrendered to the British or to Singapore, and by accepting the ICJ decision and participating in technical discussions with Singapore the Malaysian government had infringed Johor's constitutional rights. Responding, Rais said the letter seemed designed for [...] "political mileage" [...] and that Johor had been fully involved in the proceedings. He told the Straits Times, [...] "Everybody has his opinion on such matters but I, as Foreign Minister, have to abide by the dictate of the law. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> letter first but it's rather late in the day to express disappointment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hollywood" [...] was filmed at Universal Studios in Universal City, California and {{directed}} by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who previously worked with Madonna on her videos for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] (1986), [...] "Justify My Love" [...] (1990), [...] "Human Nature" [...] (1995), [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] (1996), and [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] (2000). In the United States, it premiered on June 23, 2003, on VH1. Madonna had long {{been a fan of}} the work of French fashion photographer Guy Bourdin since about a decade ago, commenting on his photographs as [...] "They're so sick and interesting. These girls, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> look on their faces — they're really bizarre." [...] Arianne Phillips created the costumes for the video and she described Madonna's looks as an homage to old Hollywood glamour, while trying to be literal as well as conceptual. She paid tributes to stars like Ginger Rogers, Jean Harlow and Mae West. According to Mondino's own words, the concept of the video was: ...|$|E
500|$|On May 23, 2016, it was {{reported}} that Miramax and Blumhouse Productions were developing a new Halloween film, which they would co-finance. John Carpenter is set to executive produce the project and act as creative consultant. Carpenter said, [...] "Thirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I'm going to help {{to try to make the}} 10th sequel the scariest of them all." [...] On February 9, 2017, Carpenter announced that the new Halloween film would be released on October 19, 2018 and was going to be written by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride, and directed by Green. It will be a direct sequel to the original film and will ignore all the sequels. In September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode. In October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode. The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying [...] "I’ll be consulting with the director to see what he feels. I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, or we could combine those two things. I’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> movie to see what it requires." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN rated it {{seven out}} of ten, noting that American viewers do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> first series to be caught up, but added [...] "British fans might lament the absence of Richard Armitage's John Porter who was the ass-kicking hero of the {{original}} series." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times described the series as a [...] "variation on [...] "24" [...] that offers reasonably competent action scenes, depressingly casual depictions of torture and death, and a comic-book conspiracy story line while also being an efficient nudity delivery system." [...] Brent MacKnight rated the series five out of ten, calling it a [...] "decent enough action yarn with slick production values," [...] but was critical that the series was [...] "more concerned with gratuitous nudity [...] each episode includes a lifetime's worth of breasts and butt cheeks–than creating a story with any substance, character, or emotional weight." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was more critical of the series, stating [...] "At first, [...] "Strike Back" [...] seems like a highbrow series {{on the order of}} [...] "," [...] but after a few minutes it [...] "conforms to the Skinemax nickname with a graphic sex scene," [...] with [...] "multiple exclamations of the f-word and bloodshed galore." [...] Owen summed [...] "Strike Back shows off high production values and an intense, fast-paced story reminiscent of 24 or Sleeper Cell that occasionally dips into the ridiculous [...] It's too bad the show's graphic nature, especially the bloodshed, is so off-putting as to make the series unwatchable." ...|$|E
500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E

In several interviews {{at the time}} of the album's release, Gartside stated his dissatisfaction with Rough Trade's promotion of the record, hinting in one interview that [...] "there's still a lot of problems, as far as I'm concerned, fundamental matters of distribution and economics, promotion, marketing and a bias against their product at radio stations" [...] and in another he complained, [...] "I must say I've been badly disappointed the way RT have handled the past three singles.

2500|$|After Salinger's {{death in}} 2010, Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at Harold Ober Associates, stated that {{nothing has changed}} in terms of {{licensing}} film, television, or stage rights of his works. A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye released after his death. He wrote: [...] "Firstly, {{it is possible that}} one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> results of the transaction." [...] Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's first-person narrative into voice-over and dialogue would be contrived.|$|E
