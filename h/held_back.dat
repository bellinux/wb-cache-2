5|$|Melish likely <b>held</b> <b>back</b> much of {{the issue}} for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E

5|$|Meng Huo and his Nanman army then {{march on}} Chengdu, the Shu capital. The Nanman troops are <b>held</b> <b>back</b> from the bridges by Zhang Bao and Guan Suo, who hold the Nanman back {{to defend the}} legacy of their fathers (Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, respectively). Meng Huo kills the last of Shu's generals and conquers the land.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett <b>held</b> <b>back</b> from Discworld feature films; {{though the}} rights {{to a number of}} his books have been sold, no films have yet been made, albeit various books have been adapted into feature-length {{television}} dramas (see Television section below).|$|E
5|$|Stevens gave these prints to Levine, who {{returned}} The Abominable Snowmen to the BBC in February 1982, although he <b>held</b> <b>back</b> Invasion of the Dinosaurs from the BBC for a while. This was later {{returned to the}} BBC by Levine in June 1983, who then made a copy and returned the original to Levine.|$|E

5|$|The 46th Division took Montescudo on the 15th, and on {{the next}} day the 56th Division entered the town of Mulazzano, {{directly}} north of Montescudo and equally close to the border. The fighting pressed westward from here, with the 56th Division on the northern flank and the 46th on the south; both were <b>held</b> <b>back</b> by strong German resistance.|$|E
5|$|The three gorge dam is a steel-concrete gravity dam. The {{water is}} <b>held</b> <b>back</b> by the innate {{mass of the}} {{individual}} dam sections. As a result, damage to an individual section should not affect {{other parts of the}} dam. Due to the sheer size of the dam, it is expected to withstand tactical nuclear strikes.|$|E
5|$|Thick as a Brick was {{originally}} {{scheduled for release}} on 25 February 1972. It was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> a week to 3 March following production problems relating to the 1972 miners' strike. The album reached the top 5 in the UK charts, and number one in Australia, Canada and the United States, where it was certified Gold.|$|E

5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently <b>held</b> <b>back</b> by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly <b>held</b> <b>back</b> Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Dyer turned {{professional}} in either 1909 or 1910. Boxrec record his first fight in July 1909 against Jack Delaney, a boxer who Dyer would challenge in 1913 for the Wales welterweight title. Boxing magazine reported in January 1910 that his fight against future British and European welterweight champion Johnny Basham was Dyer's debut fight. Both fights are recorded as victories for Dyer, but {{the fight against}} Basham, held in Newport on New Year's Day 1910, was reportedly <b>held</b> <b>back</b> to late at night to allow Dyer to fulfill matinee and evening singer engagements in Stoll's Panopticon in St. Mary's Street, Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but {{producers}} {{were never}} satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge {{after he had}} an affair, but the producers and Gatiss {{found it easier to}} mention he died because he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas. The ending also changed; the final scene had originally involved Moriarty entering the Tower of London but that was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> for the following episode.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew {{himself from}} all {{political}} activities {{and went into}} hiding at Chandannagar {{in the house of}} Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition {{on the basis of a}} signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of July 23, 1st Battalion sent a 30-man patrol northward to locate the North Koreans. Near Poun, the patrol spotted a North Korean column approaching. The platoon took up {{superior}} positions and ambushed the column as it passed with all its weapons. The North Koreans halted their advance, thinking they had encountered a major position, and <b>held</b> <b>back</b> until daylight. When they turned back, the US patrol returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04:00 on July 24. It suffered six men missing to {{an unknown number of}} North Korean casualties.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and <b>held</b> <b>back</b> from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E
5|$|It {{was another}} 12 {{minutes before the}} {{collapse}} occurred, which enabled trains and platforms to be evacuated and incoming trains to be <b>held</b> <b>back.</b> The roof, girders and debris fell across four passenger trains, blocking all tracks. The part of the western wall that fell had crashed through the wall and roof of the neighbouring Royal Avenue Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre) in Northumberland Avenue, which was being reconstructed at the time. Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{was well}} {{received}} in retrospective reviews, with multiple critics calling {{it one of}} the best Virtual Boy games; some thought it was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> by the platform, and that it should be made available on other platforms, such as the Nintendo 3DS. In 2003, the staff at Tips & Tricks stated it to be the most uncommon North American Virtual Boy release, giving it a rarity rating of 6/10 based on a consultation with Digital Press.|$|E
