He started working as a Research Associate in the Malaria Section of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland before earning his tenure in the same institution in 1987. From 1988 to 1992, {{he worked at the}} Laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology in Palo Alto, California, USA, with dual roles, studying cytokine genes for Schering Plough, the parent organisation of DNAX Research Institute, and leading his Infectious Diseases laboratory there on malaria work funded by DNAX and USAID. [...] In 1994, he was named President and Scientific Director of Affymax, Inc. where he managed teams working on small molecule drug lead discovery using combinatorial chemistry and high throughput target screening. His independent malaria work continued at Affymax with support from USAID and Affymax, leading to cloning of the PfEMP1 gene while at Affymax. After Affymax was purchased by GlaxoWellcome, Howard led technology transfer and interchange in combinatorial chemistry, drug discovery and optimisation between Affymax and GlaxoWellcome worldwide. During this time, Molecular breeding or DNA shuffling Technology was conceived and the nascent company Maxygen Inc. incubated for later spun out from Affymax-GlaxoWellcome. From 1997 to 2009, Howard worked as Maxygen's CEO, focusing on human, including, protein pharmaceutical drugs and vaccine discovery, as core business. Non-core businesses were successively incubated, nurtured and spun-out (Codexis) or sold (Verdia). In 2008, he left Maxygen with $200MM in cash, no debt, on-going clinical stage drug development programs and multiple partnerships and licenses with other parties. Following his departure, Howard started Oakbio, Inc., a seed-stage, privately held Clean Technology company in Sunnyvale, California, USAwww.oakbio.com.

30|$|Many <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> are emitted discontinuously. The {{purification}} of discontinuously emitted <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> by biofiltration {{still remains}} challenging. Our {{findings suggest that}} BTF 2 cannot be acclimated and cannot form a robust biofilm successfully under discontinuous operation mode. Biomass accumulation inside BTF 2 was approximately 47 times lower than that observed in the continuously operated BTF 1. EPS, which is the key component of biofilm, was approximately one hundred times higher in BTF 1 than that in BTF 2, indicating that the biofilm formation in BTF 2 was severely affected. Under discontinuous operation mode, microbial cells usually enter a so-called endogenous metabolic state during idle times due to the insufficiency of carbon sources. The growth rates of microorganisms were thus lowered (Gallastegui et al. 2011). Additionally, biofilm formation is a highly complex process involving several steps, such as reversible adhesion to solid surfaces, irreversible attachment and EPS production (Molin and Tolker-Nielsen 2003; Zoubos et al. 2012). Those microbial cells reversibly adhered {{to the surface of}} packing materials can easily detach from the surface when nutrients are limited. In this situation, it is difficult to increase the density of microbial cells to a threshold level at which quorum sensing signal molecules can be produced (Kim et al. 2014).|$|R

Together the tools enable the design and development of new, energy efficient pathways and strains for the production of chemicals and advanced fuels via C 1 gas fermentation. As a proof-of-platform, we investigated heterotrophic growth on fructose versus autotrophic growth on gas that demonstrate the role of the Rnf complex and Nfn complex in maintaining growth using the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Pyruvate carboxykinase was found to control the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis and a new specialized glyceralde-hyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase was identified that potentially enhances anabolic capacity by reducing the amount of ATP consumed by gluconeogenesis. The results have been confirmed by the construction of mutant strains...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{this work}} was to {{construct}} the mixed matrix membrane based on polymer {{that could be used}} for the treatment of the <b>waste</b> <b>gases.</b> Therefore, high permeability for the carbon dioxide and low permeability for other gases commonly present in the <b>industrial</b> combustion <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> (nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, methane) are essential. Those membranes belong to the group of dense composite membranes, and mechanism for separation is based on the solution-diffusion mechanism. In this paper, feasibility of the application of poly(ethyleneoxid) -copoly(phtalamide) was tested. In order to enchase the permeability of carbon dioxide, three different zeolites were incorporated, and in order to improve compatibility between the inorganic particles and polymer chains, n-tetradecyldimethylamonium bromide (NTAB). was added. Three zeolites were with the 2 -dimensional pores (IHW, NSI and TER). The best results in carbon dioxide/hydrogen selectivity were obtained with the membrane constructed with PEBAX 1657 and surface treated zeolites, while the better results concerning selectivity were gained with membranes based on the Polyactive.

40|$|Recovery of {{elemental}} sulfur from <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> is {{an important}} problem both from environmental and economic perspectives. The most widely used process is the Claus process, where one-third of the acid gas is oxidized to SO 2 in a reaction furnace using air. This combustion generates {{a large amount of}} heat. Further, the combustion products undergo Claus reaction between H 2 S and SO 2. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a simple-to-use predictive tool suitable for combustion engineers, which is easier than existing approaches less complicated with fewer computations for predicting the theoretical flame temperature for both straight-through operation and for a split-flow operation with two-thirds of the acid gas bypassing the combustion section. The proposed tools are formulated as a function of the temperature of the acid gas feeding the combustion section and the hydrogen sulphide mole fraction (dry basis) in feed gas. Results show that the proposed predictive tool has a very good agreement with the reported data where the average absolute deviation percent is less than 0. 1 %. The proposed method is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly for various cases. This proposed simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for engineers and scientists to have a quick check on theoretical flame temperature for both straight-through operations as well as for a split-flow operation for a wide range of operating conditions without the necessity of any pilot plant set up and experimental trials. In particular, process and combustion engineers would find the proposed approach to be user friendly involving transparent calculations with no complex expressions for their applications to the design and operation of sulfur recovery Claus unit...|$|R
