5|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser black-backed <b>gulls</b> (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring <b>gulls</b> (Larus argentatus), 2pairs of great black-backed <b>gulls</b> (Larus marinus) and varying numbers of common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). The feeding habits of lesser black-backed <b>gulls</b> were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales in}} many areas may prey on {{cormorants}} and <b>gulls.</b> A captive killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea <b>gulls,</b> and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{keys are}} a {{transitional}} area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The {{interior of the}} keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least sandpipers. <b>Gulls</b> and terns include royal terns, laughing <b>gulls</b> and ring-billed <b>gulls,</b> with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season.|$|E

50|$|The Vega <b>gull,</b> East Siberian <b>gull,</b> or East Siberian herring <b>gull</b> (Larus vegae) {{is a large}} <b>gull</b> of the herring gull/lesser black-backed <b>gull</b> complex which breeds in North-east Asia. Its {{classification}} {{is still}} controversial and uncertain. It is variously treated as a separate species, as a subspecies of American herring <b>gull</b> (L. smithsonianus) or included with both the American herring <b>gull</b> and European herring <b>gull</b> in L. argentatus. The Mongolian <b>gull,</b> Larus mongolicus, has previously been regarded as a subspecies of the Caspian <b>gull</b> (L. cachinnans) but is now sometimes lumped with the Vega <b>gull.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted that the yellow-legged <b>gull</b> {{is a full}} species, but until recently there was much disagreement. For example, British Birds magazine split yellow-legged <b>gull</b> from herring <b>gull</b> in 1993 but included the Caspian <b>gull</b> in the former, but the BOU in Great Britain retained the yellow-legged <b>gull</b> as a subspecies of the herring <b>gull</b> until 2007. DNA research however suggests that yellow-legged <b>gull</b> is actually closest to the great black-backed <b>gull</b> L. marinus and Armenian <b>gull</b> L. armenicus, while the Caspian <b>gull</b> is closer to herring <b>gull</b> and lesser black-backed <b>gull</b> L. fuscus, rather than being each other's closest relatives.|$|R
5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} <b>gulls</b> were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the <b>gulls</b> have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or <b>gulls.</b> Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large <b>gulls.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from <b>gulls,</b> skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged <b>gulls</b> is restricted to relatively few individual <b>gulls</b> specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E
25|$|White-winged <b>gull</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} the four pale-winged, high Arctic-breeding taxa within the former group; these are Iceland <b>gull,</b> glaucous <b>gull,</b> Thayer's <b>gull,</b> and Kumlien's <b>gull.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like many Oregon coast locations, {{flocks of}} seagulls are {{frequently}} present in winter. The most common species are western <b>gull,</b> glaucous-winged <b>gull,</b> and California <b>gull.</b> Occasionally Thayer's <b>gull</b> and American herring <b>gull</b> are observed here.|$|R
5|$|<b>Gulls</b> are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small <b>gulls.</b> Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than <b>gulls</b> and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E

The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small <b>gulls.</b> In Tasmania, three species have been recorded.

In Tasmania, thirteen species of <b>gulls</b> and terns have been recorded, five of which are vagrants. The two groups have been considered separate families, but some findings that the noddies and white tern are offshoots to the combined group have led the two to be classified as a single family for the time being.|$|E

5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{have been}} observed swallowing city pigeons in St. James's Park in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semi-urban environment and are in constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including Cape gannet chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp <b>gulls,</b> greater crested terns and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly {{willing to take a}} wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver <b>gulls.</b> Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels and grey <b>gulls.</b> Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown and Peruvian pelicans.|$|E

5|$|Some species, {{including}} frigatebirds, <b>gulls,</b> and skuas, {{engage in}} kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism {{is thought to}} be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like <b>gulls,</b> corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.|$|E
