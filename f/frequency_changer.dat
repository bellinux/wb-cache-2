50|$|One UK company, Mazda/Ediswan, {{produced}} a triode-pentode <b>frequency</b> <b>changer,</b> the AC/TP. Designed for low-cost AC radios, {{the device was}} deliberately designed to allow strong signals to pull the oscillator without the risk of radiating the oscillator signal from the aerial. The cathode was common to both sections of the valve. The cathode was connected to a secondary coil on the oscillator coil and thus coupled the oscillator into the pentode mixer section, the signal being applied to grid 1 in the conventional manner. The AC/TP {{was one of the}} AC/ range of valves designed for low-cost radios. They were considered durable for their time (even the AC/TP <b>frequency</b> <b>changer,</b> which was normally problematic). Any AC/ valves encountered today are likely to be brand new as service shops stocked up on spares which were seldom required.|$|E
50|$|The pentagrid {{was part}} of a line of {{development}} of valves that were able to take an incoming RF signal and change its frequency to a fixed intermediate frequency, which was then amplified and detected in the remainder of the receiver circuitry.

50|$|Rotating-machine <b>frequency</b> <b>changers</b> used {{to convert}} between 25 Hz and 60 Hz systems were awkward to design; a 60 Hz machine with 24 poles would {{turn at the}} same speed as a 25 Hz machine with 10 poles, making the {{machines}} large, slow-speed and expensive. A ratio of 60/30 would have simplified these designs, but the installed base at 25 Hz was too large to be economically opposed.|$|R
50|$|One company, Osram, made {{an ingenious}} move. One of their popular pentagrid {{converter}} designs was the MX40, initially marketed in 1934.

Thus a pentagrid radio could easily be converted to a triode-hexode without any other circuit modifications.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variable-frequency}} drive {{is a type}} of <b>frequency</b> <b>changer</b> used for speed control of AC motors such as used for pumps and fans. The speed of an AC motor is dependent on the frequency of the AC power supply, so changing frequency allows the motor speed to be changed. This allows fan or pump output to be varied to match process conditions, which can provide energy savings.|$|E

The power between Plauen (Vogtland) and Hof was connected on 9 November 2013 and regular electric train services commenced to Hof on 15 December 2013.

RE 3 Regional-Express services have been operated between Dresden and Hof since then using double-deck carriages and electric haulage.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{where most}} load {{was to be}} railway or motor loads, it was {{considered}} economic to generate power at 25 Hz and install rotary converters for 60 Hz distribution. Converters for production of DC from alternating current were available in larger sizes and were more efficient at 25 Hz compared with 60 Hz. Remnant fragments of older systems may be tied to the standard frequency system via a rotary converter or static inverter <b>frequency</b> <b>changer.</b> These allow energy to be interchanged between two power networks at different frequencies, but the systems are large, costly, and waste some energy in operation.|$|E

5000|$|The sets used a four-valve {{superhet}} circuit with {{an audio}} output of 4 watts at 10% total harmonic distortion; they performed {{as well as}} many pre-war sets. The valve complement consisted of a triode-hexode <b>frequency</b> <b>changer,</b> a variable-μ RF pentode IF amplifier and a high slope output pentode. A [...] "Westector" [...] solid-state copper oxide diode was used for demodulation, which saved one valve and allowed use of an available type of pentode for the audio stage. The HT line was derived from a full wave rectifier. All valves were on International Octal sockets apart from the rectifier which was on a British 4-pin base. There were minor variations between set makers; for instance Philips used IF transformers with adjustable ferrite cores (so-called slug tuning) rather than the conventional trimmer capacitors.|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with static frequency changers, using solid-state switching devices, capable of directly (i. e. without an intermediate dc link) converting polyphase ac power of a given frequency to single or polyphase power of a chosen frequency. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part, comprising five chapters, {{is devoted to the}} study of ideal frequency changers operated from ac Sources having zero internal impedance. The second part, comprising two chapters, considers sources with finite internal impedances. Chapter 1 introduces the basic concepts of static frequency conversion, outlines the basic mathematical models representing static frequency changers and defines the output and input performance indicators. Chapter 2 presents a detailed investigation of that class of three-pulse frequency changers which will be studied in the thesis. A large portion of the chapter is devoted to the study of output waveform generation. The mathematical tools of the investigation, existence matrices and modulating functions, are introduced and defined. Analytical expressions for output waveforms corresponding to various practical modulating functions are derived and the related performance indicators are computed. Assuming a given desired output performance, criteria for an optimal modulating function are established. It is proved that only one system can generate an output waveform conforming to the postulated prerequisites. This system is termed the "Unrestricted" <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changer.</b> Expressions for the input current waves are also derived in this chapter and the corresponding input performance indicators are determined. The concept of a new <b>frequency</b> <b>changer</b> having the unique property of providing unity input power factor, regardless of the load, is introduced. This system is termed the "Unity Power Factor" <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changer.</b> In Chapter 3 the previous results are extended to systems having pulse numbers which are integral multiples of three. Chapter 4 is devoted to the study of output voltage control. Three basic methods are analysed and detailed quantitative data for output voltage and input current waves, and the related performance indicators, are presented in graphical form. In Chapter 5 special aspects of static frequency changing are investigated. It is shown that the input displacement factor is variable. The concept of the "Controlled Displacement Factor" <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changer</b> is introduced It is proven that the naturally commutated cycloconvertor is theoretically equivalent to a particular "Controlled Displacement Factor" <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changer.</b> Chapter 6 presents a detailed analysis of the "Unrestricted" <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changer,</b> operated from an ac source with finite internal impedance. The basic conditions are defined and an outline is given of the techniques of symmetrical components used for the analysis. The input current, input terminal voltage and output voltage waveforms are expressed in terms of the input terminal impedance and the positive, negative and zero sequence components of the output currents. The equivalent sequence impedances and the output impedance matrix are derived. The output voltage unbalance is computed under various conditions and presented in graphical form. The relationships between the amplitudes of the unwanted components in the output waveform and the resonant frequency of the input terminal circuit are also graphically presented. The results obtained are verified by computer simulations. In Chapter 7 a similar analysis of the "Unity Power Factor" <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changer</b> is carried out. The computed data are also graphically presented. Again, the results are verified by appropriate computer simulations...|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{these devices}} were {{electromechanical}} machines called a motor-generator set. Also devices with mercury arc rectifiers or vacuum tubes were in use. With {{the advent of}} solid state electronics, it has become possible to build completely electronic <b>frequency</b> <b>changers.</b> These devices usually consist of a rectifier stage (producing direct current) which is then inverted to produce AC of the desired frequency. The inverter may use thyristors, IGCTs or IGBTs. If voltage conversion is desired, a transformer will usually be included in either the ac input or output circuitry and this transformer may also provide galvanic isolation between the input and output ac circuits.

50|$|AC systems used a {{wide range}} of {{frequencies}} {{depending on the type of}} load; lighting load using higher frequencies, and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies. The economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems, operating at a common frequency, were developed. The same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day, could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve lighting load in the evening, thus improving the system load factor and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall. Many exceptions existed, generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency, and rotating <b>frequency</b> <b>changers</b> and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network.|$|R
