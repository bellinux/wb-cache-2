The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.|$|E

25|$|In the Netherlands and Belgium, cheek kissing is {{a common}} {{greeting}} between relatives and friends (in the Netherlands slightly more so in the south). Generally speaking, women will kiss both women and men, while men will kiss women but refrain from kissing other men, instead preferring {{to shake hands with}} strangers. In the Netherlands and the Dutch part of Belgium usually three kisses are exchanged. The same number of kisses is found in Switzerland.

Roxy breaks down and admits that, while she was in her coma, she slept with Charlie in their upsets. Ronnie forgives her and tries to move forward, but has doubts about her marriage. When Vincent's wife Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) discovers that Ronnie and Vincent had dated before, she accuses Ronnie of having an affair with him, but she assures her that they are no longer together. On returning home, Ronnie sets up cameras to spy on Charlie and Roxy, paranoid they might sleep together again. Roxy starts a secret relationship with Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), and Ronnie is furious when she finds out, as Dean raped Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). Dean finds Ronnie's hidden cameras, and Roxy moves out, feeling violated. Ronnie <b>kisses</b> <b>and</b> sleeps with Vincent again, despite them both being married. Ronnie admits she doesn't love Charlie, and ends their marriage. Charlie and Roxy {{come up with a plan}} to flee to France with Matthew, but Roxy secretly tells Ronnie and they plan to double cross Charlie and get him arrested. However, events backfire and Ronnie nearly loses Matthew, though Charlie returns to Walford soon after. Ronnie asks Vincent to help her get rid of Charlie, and he disappears, with Roxy finding his discarded wallet. She later asks Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) to move in with her.|$|E

40|$|Background: The neuropeptide <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> its {{receptor}} KissR are key-actors in {{the brain}} control of reproduction in mammals, where {{they are responsible for}} the stimulation of the activity of GnRH neurones. Investigation in other vertebrates revealed up to 3 <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> 4 KissR paralogs, originating from the two rounds of whole genome duplication in early vertebrates. In contrast, the absence of <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR has been suggested in birds, as no homologs of these genes could be found in current genomic databases. This study aims at addressing the question of the existence, from an evolutionary perspective, of the Kisspeptin system in birds. It provides the first large-scale investigation of the Kisspeptin system in the sauropsid lineage, including ophidian, chelonian, crocodilian, and avian lineages. Results: Sauropsid <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR genes were predicted from multiple genome and transcriptome databases by TBLASTN. Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses were performed to classify predicted sauropsid <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR genes and to re-construct the evolutionary scenarios of both gene families across the sauropsid radiation. Genome search, phylogenetic and synteny analyses, demonstrated the presence of two Kiss genes (<b>Kiss</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kiss</b> 2 types) <b>and</b> of two KissR genes (KissR 1 and KissR 4 types) in the sauropsid lineage. These four genes, also present in the mammalian lineage, would have been inherited from their common amniote ancestor. In contrast, synteny analyses supported that the other <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR paralogs are missing in sauropsids as in mammals, indicating their absence in th...|$|R

Marital affection between Ruth and her husband is only represented through brief <b>kisses</b> <b>and</b> hugs. The role ends when Ruth and Paul emigrate to Australia where Paul will teach agriculture, leaving Lassie with neighbor Cully Wilson. Timmy was reclaimed by the County and eventually adopted by a family named McCullough and began using his middle name, Steven. Ruth and Timmy (Steven) are reunited 25 years later in the seventh episode of the first season of the syndicated television show The New Lassie, entitled [...] "Roots".|$|E

The chorus, reminiscent of other pop productions by Max Martin, has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. After the second chorus, the beats drop and Spears speaks the lines in the hook. This is followed by a dubstep-influenced breakdown, which lasts about thirty seconds. Spears moans, blows <b>kisses</b> <b>and</b> sings the lines [...] "Gimme something good, don't wanna wait I want it now / Pop it like a hood and show me how you work it out."

After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit [...] "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized.

500|$|While Monteverdi {{had looked}} {{backwards}} {{in the sixth}} book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets.

500|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} or not Roosevelt had a sexual relationship with Hickok. It was known in the White House press corps at the time that Lorena Hickok was a lesbian. Scholars, including Lillian Faderman and Hazel Rowley, have asserted that there was a physical component to the relationship, while Hickok biographer Doris Faber has argued that the insinuative phrases have misled historians. Doris Kearns Goodwin stated in her 1994 Pulitzer Prize–winning account of the Roosevelts that [...] "whether Hick and Eleanor went beyond <b>kisses</b> <b>and</b> hugs" [...] could not be determined with certainty. Roosevelt was close friends with several lesbian couples, such as Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman, and Esther Lape and Elizabeth Read, suggesting that she understood lesbianism; Marie Souvestre, Roosevelt's childhood teacher and a great influence on her later thinking, was also a lesbian. Faber published some of Roosevelt and Hickok's correspondence in 1980, but concluded that the lovestruck phrasing was simply an [...] "unusually belated schoolgirl crush" [...] and warned historians not to be misled. Researcher Leila J. Rupp criticized Faber's argument, calling her book [...] "a case study in homophobia" [...] and arguing that Faber unwittingly presented [...] "page after page of evidence that delineates the growth and development of a love affair between the two women". In 1992, Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook argued that the relationship was in fact romantic, generating national attention. A 2011 essay by Russell Baker reviewing two new Roosevelt biographies in the New York Times Review of Books (Franklin and Eleanor: An Extraordinary Marriage, by Hazel Rowley, and Eleanor Roosevelt: Transformative First Lady, by Maurine H. Beasley) stated, [...] "That the Hickok relationship was indeed erotic now seems beyond dispute considering what is known about the letters they exchanged." ...|$|E
