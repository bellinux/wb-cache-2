50|$|The type {{species for}} Cyanomyovirus {{of the family}} Myoviridae is Cyanophage AS-1, which was {{isolated}} from a waste stabilization pond, and {{was also the first}} genus recognized. The tails have been observed as either contractile or noncontractile with lengths of 20 to 244 nm, widths of 15 to 23 nm, and a shrinking range of 93 nm. Cyanophages generally have isometric <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> with diameters ranging from 55 to 90 nm. There is large morphological variation in this group, which suggests that they infect a variety of host species. At the point of attachment between the long tail and the head there is a base plate where short pins are attached, a contractile sheath, and an internal core, similar to other bacteriophages in the Myoviridae.|$|R
5000|$|The first bolts had square heads, {{formed by}} forging. These are still found, {{although}} {{much more common}} today is the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head.</b> These are held and turned by a spanner or wrench, {{of which there are}} many forms.

5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the socket wrench's drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|E
50|$|The numbers {{stamped on}} the head of the bolt are {{referred}} to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped {{on the head}}. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 15 {{wild-type}} Brocothrix thermosphacta strains isolated from beef {{and the type}} strain, B. thermosphacta ATCC 11509, were used as hosts for the isolation of bacteriophages under psychrotrophic conditions (7 degrees C). A total of 21 virulent, psychrotrophic phages were successfully isolated and purified from aqueous extracts of spoiled rib steaks. Phage plaque size and plating efficiency significantly increased as incubation temperature was reduced from 25 to 1 degree C. Electron microscopy of two homologous B. thermosphacta phages showed the virions to consist of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> and tails, with terminal appendages clearly visible {{on one of the}} phages. On the basis of culture and biochemical data, the wild-type B. thermosphacta strains had characteristics identical to those of strain ATCC 11509. However, specific differences in the pattern of susceptibilities to the phages revealed the presence of 14 distinct phage lysotypes. Phage typing may provide a rapid and sensitive means of differentiating B. thermosphacta strains...|$|R

30|$|High {{stresses}} at the pin–bone interface {{contribute to}} micro-motion and failure resulting in unicortical loosening. Experimental models have demonstrated far higher pressures are generated under loading {{conditions at the}} bone interface from half pins as compared to fine wires [5]. The pin–bone interface has therefore been regarded as the weakest link in the mechanical stability of external fixation systems and has been investigated extensively [6, 7, 8]. In contrast, no studies {{have looked at the}} interface between the half pin and frame assembly. Loss of stability here compromises the bone remodelling process through a change in the biomechanics of the construct. In the systems of Ilizarov and Taylor Spatial frames (TSF) external fixation by Smith and Nephew, grub screws are used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate 2 different methods used (grub screw or 10  mm stainless steel <b>hexagonal</b> <b>headed</b> bolt [M 6 A 2 - 70]) to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. This is to determine whether use of bolts is appropriate and could reduce the potential for loosening at this interface.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{anchor bolt}} is a cast-in-place anchor. As {{seen in the}} figure, most designs consist of a standard bolt with a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head,</b> which is cast in the wet concrete before it sets. There are other designs, some consisting of a bent bolt with a hook on the end, or some other sort of bending. Cast-in-place anchor bolts are the strongest type of fastener, but the casting is difficult, and they are usually only used for heavy machines mounted on poured concrete floors. Another use of this anchor bolt is to connect the concrete foundation of a building to its wall. With this, the building is more resistant to earthquakes. Currently there are several devices to assist in holding and in placing anchor bolt to set in the concrete. These devices are mostly made from composite plastic.|$|E
50|$|The museum {{considers}} its {{highlight to}} be three medieval ceremonial maces which date from the 15th century. The oldest of these, the Mace of the Faculty of Arts, was commissioned in 1416 and was probably made in Paris. It has a simple <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> on which are engraved the images of saints and the coats of arms of various important families {{from the time of}} the foundation of the University of St Andrews. The second mace, that of the College of St Salvator, was made in Paris by Jean Maiel in 1461. The head is considered by some to be one of the finest pieces of medieval European silverware in existence. It shows Christ, or St Salvator, in the centre of an architectural shrine. He stands on a globe with his hands raised to show the nail marks. Around him stand three angels, each holding a symbol of the passion. The third mace, that of the Faculty of Canon Law, was probably made in Scotland in the mid-15th century and is thought to be a copy of the Mace of the Faculty of Arts, though the quality is not as good. Its probable origin in Scotland makes it particularly rare. These maces are still used during graduation ceremonies.|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophages {{have been}} {{proposed}} as specific alternative for chemotherapy against multidrug resistant bacterial infections. The aim {{of the present study}} was the isolation and purification of bacteriophages from sewage, which were effective against multidrug resistant bacterial isolates and detection of their morphological characteristics. Sewage and clinical samples were used for the isolation of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. The bacteriophages were isolated and purified from sewage samples by overlay cultures of the isolated bacteria after centrifugation and filtration procedures. Three isolates of the most multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa selected for bacteriophage isolation. Most of the isolates were resistant to different classes of antibiotics in the aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines and β-lactam antibiotic groups. The isolated bacteriophges showed different plaque morphologies on the bacterial cultures. The three purified bacteriophages had icosahedral or <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads.</b> Long tails observed in Escherichia coli bacteriophages, with the total length of about 170 nm for the phages particles; short tails observed in Klebsiella pneumonia phages particles, with the approximate total lengths of 150 nm; and short tails with the approximate 35 nm total particles length observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{synthesis}} of ZnO nanorods with <b>hexagonal</b> pyramid-like <b>heads</b> {{by a simple}} and low cost technique of spray pyrolysis {{with the help of}} zinc acetate and tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate precursors. In the present study, the growth of ZnO nanorods is optimized by varying a number of sprays and annealing temperatures in the synthesis process. FESEM analysis reveals that ZnO nanorods are observed when the number of sprays exceeds 150 and film-like structure is observed below 150 sprays. Nanorods are formed when the molar ratio of zinc acetate to tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate in the solution mixture is 3 : 1. The optimum annealed temperature for the growth of nanorods is determined to be 350 degrees C. The length and diameter of the vertically aligned nanorods are in the range of 1 - 3 mu m and 80 nm, respectively. XRD diffraction patterns and HRTEM analysis confirm that the ZnO nanorods are single crystals with a preferred growth direction of 0 0 0 1. The effect of various growth parameters including molar ratio of zinc acetate to tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate in the mixture, number of sprays and annealing temperatures on the growth of ZnO nanorods are systematically studied. A plausible growth mechanism for <b>hexagonal</b> pyramidal <b>heads</b> of ZnO nanorods is discussed.

40|$|Virulent bacteriophages {{specific}} for Aeromonas salmonicida were isolsted {{from water}} samples, collected from fish farms, rivers, lakes and marshes in Japan. The isolated phages differed greatly {{in the fine}} structure of the virion, plaque morphology, spectrum of lytic action, stability and one-step growth characteristics. At the same time, They had identical serological properties. Based on the phage properties, they were classified in five groups, Group I phages consisted of an elongated <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> and a tail of complex structure with a contractile sheath. The phages of groups II, IV and V had a head with a hexagonal outline and tail with a contractile sheath. Group III phages exhibited a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> with a unique short tail. In the five groups, The phages belonging to group III formed the largest clear plaque, were unstable to heating at 50 °C for 30 min. and adding chloroform, and showed the shortest of latent period. They had a peculiar property in others of the groups. Phage typing with presentative phage of each group may provide a rapid and senstive means of differentiating A. salmonicida strains. サケ科の魚類のせっそう病の原因菌であるAeromonas salmonicidaに感染性をもつヴィルレント・ファージが本邦各地の養魚池,河川,湖沼の試水から分離され,その代表ファージ 6 株について特性を明らかにした。ファージ粒子構造,溶菌斑形態,宿主域,安定性,一段増殖曲線,血清学的性状などの知見により供試ファージを 5 群に区別した。各群ファージの特性は概略次の通りであった。I群のファージ: やや偏長な六角形の大きい頭部と収縮性尾鞘をつけた尾部からなる粒子構造を構成し;小さくて透明な溶菌斑を形成し;加熱処理に対しやや不安定であり,一段増殖の潜伏期が長く,平均放出量が小さい;そして,血清型Iである。II群のファージ: 外観正六角形の頭部と収縮性尾鞘をつけた尾部からなる;径 3 ~ 4 mmの透明な溶菌斑;安定であり;平均放出量大きく;そして血清型IIである。III群のファージ： 外観正六角形の頭部と小さな痕跡の尾部からなる;径 6 ~ 8 mmの大きく透明な溶菌斑;不安定であり;平均放出量はそれほど大きくないが潜伏期は短く;そして血清型IIIである。この群は他に比して多くの性状で特徴的であった。IV群のファージ: 外観正六角形のやや大きい頭部と収縮性尾鞘をつけた尾部からなる;小さな混濁した溶菌斑;やや不安定であり;潜伏期長く,平均放出量小さい;そして血清型IVである。V群のファージ: 外観正六角形の頭部と収縮性尾鞘をつけた尾部からなる;小さく混濁した溶菌斑;安定であり;潜伏期長く,平均放出量小さい;そして血清型Vである。IV群とV群との性状の違いは安定性,血清型にみられるがその差異は小さい。これら各群の代表ファージはA. salmonicidaファージ型別のためのファージ・セットの一部として有効に利用しうるものであると考える...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds: Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} microorganisms used in dairy industry for production of fermented milk products. Bacteriophages which attack  L. lactis are a serious threat to the dairy industry because of their negative effects on fermentation processes. Methods: Samples of raw milk were examined for the presence of lactococcal bacteriophages. Samples were centrifuged and then filtered through 0. 45 µm pore size filters. The filtrates were added to early-exponential cultures of Lactococcus lactis subspp. Lactis (PTCC 1336). Overlay method was used to detect the formation of plaques. After isolation and concentration of phages, serial dilutions of phage stock were used to determine titer of phage in concentrated sample. Electron Microscopy was used for observation and characterization of structural details of bacteriophages. Results: Two phages were isolated; one of them had a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> of 45 × 30 nm in diameter and a flexible non-contractile tail of 70 nm long which belonged to Siphoviridae. The other had a short tail and a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> of 53 × 60 nm in diameter which was a member of Podoviridae family. Conclusion: In this study, for the first time, two phages were isolated from milk. This does not reduce the significance of phage control in different stages of the production. The spread of the phages in the production plant can be very harmful...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to induce and characterize verotoxin-encoding phages from a collection of 91 verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O 103 :H 2 strains of human and bovine origins. All the strains carried the vt 1 gene, and two carried the vt 2 gene as well. The phages were induced by UV irradiation and characterized by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), genome size, morphology, and Q and P genes, characteristic of lambdoid phages. A total of 32 vt-positive phages were induced and isolated from 31 VTEC O 103 :H 2 strains. Thirty phages were vt 1 positive, and two were vt 2 positive. Ten of the 30 vt 1 -positive phages (33. 3 %) were from cattle strains, and 20 (66. 6 %) were from human strains. The two vt 2 -positive phages were from human strains. Phages belonged to 21 RFLP profiles, of which 17 were single-phage profiles and 4 were multiple-phage profiles. The estimated genome size of the phages ranged from 34 to 84 kb. Two phages that were examined by electron microscopy possessed <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> with long tails, and one had an elongated head with a long tail. The Q and P genes were amplified in all 32 phages, and the Q-stxA 1 gene region yielded an amplicon in 19 phages (59. 3 %). It is concluded that the VTEC O 103 :H 2 strains of human origin were more readily inducible than those of bovine origin and that the genotypic profiles of verotoxin-encoding phages were highly diverse, as revealed by their RFLP profiles...|$|R
40|$|A {{bacteriophage}} encoding the Shiga toxin 2 c variant (Stx 2 c) {{was isolated}} from the human Escherichia coli O 157 strain CB 2851 and shown to form lysogens on the E. coli K- 12 laboratory strains C 600 and MG 1655. Production of Stx 2 c {{was found in the}} wild-type E. coli O 157 strain and the K- 12 lysogens and was inducible by growing bacteria in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Phage 2851 is the first reported viable bacteriophage which carries an stx 2 c gene. Electron micrographs of phage 2851 showed particles with elongated <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> and long flexible tails resembling phage lambda. Sequence analysis of an 8. 4 -kb region flanking the stx 2 c gene and other genetic elements revealed a mosaic gene structure, as found in other Stx phages. Phage 2851 showed lysis of E. coli K- 12 strains lysogenic for Stx phages encoding Stx 1 (H 19), Stx 2 (933 W), Stx (7888), and Stx 1 c (6220) but showed superinfection immunity with phage lambda, presumably originating from the similarity of the cI repressor proteins of both phages. Apparently, phage 2851 integrates at a different chromosomal locus than Stx 2 phage 933 W and Stx 1 phage H 19 in E. coli, explaining why Stx 2 c is often found in combination with Stx 1 or Stx 2 in E. coli O 157 strains. Diagnostic PCR was performed to determine gene sequences specific for phage 2851 in wild-type E. coli O 157 strains producing Stx 2 c. The phage 2851 q and o genes were frequently detected in Stx 2 c-producing E. coli O 157 strains, indicating that phages related to 2851 are associated with Stx 2 c production in strains of E. coli O 157 that were isolated in different locations and time periods...|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli 0157 :H 7 is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) family. These organisms are responsible for a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from non-bloody diarrhoea to gross bloody diarrhoea with complications that include haemorrhagic colitis (HC), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP). Infection occurs by the ingestion of faecally contaminated food products, water sources and through person-to-person contact. Outbreaks of E. coli O 157 :H 7 have been reported worldwide although most outbreaks seem to be from countries in the Northern hemisphere. Very little information is available on the prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in South Africa. The only data available on E. coli O 157 :H 7 were from a 1992 outbreak in Swaziland with some cases spreading to the adjacent provinces of South Africa. Selective methods were assessed and optimised to identify and isolate E. coli O 157 :H 7 from food, water and faeces. These methods included culture techniques, immunomagnetic separation, immunoassays and molecular confirmation techniques. The methods optimised and assessed in this study proved to be suitable for the detection and isolation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from environmental water, food and faecal samples. In addition to the isolation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from these sources, methods were also optimised for the characterisation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 using repetitive sequence analysis and induction of shiga toxin (Stx) ¬converting phages which carry the genes coding for Stx from strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7. The prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in human-, bovine- and porcine faeces, sewage and recreational waters was investigated in a selected region of South Africa. Data suggested a low prevalence in sewage (0. 76 %), recreational waters (0 %) and human faecal (0 %) samples with a higher prevalence among carriers such as cattle (12. 5 %) and pigs (14. 29 %). UV-induced Stx-converting phages were examined and found to have different phage morphologies to the previously described lambdoid structure. In order to establish the host range susceptibility of these phages, all induced phages were subjected to conditions favourable for infecting E. coli O 157 :H 7, non-O 157 E. coli and other members of the enterobacteriaceae family including Salmonella, Shigella, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus. These results have shown that Stx-phages were able to infect Salmonella cholerasuis and produce infectious progeny from these strains. Stx-converting phages propagated in Salmonella cholerasuis were able to re-infect strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7. This study has shown that IMS in combination with molecular techniques was a sensitive tool for the isolation, identification and characterisation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from different sources. Results indicated that Stx-phages induced from E. coli O 157 :H 7 demonstrated lambdoid structure as well as phages with long <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> and long non-contractile tails.

40|$|Spatially {{resolved}} cathodoluminescence (CL) {{study of}} a ZnO nanonail, having thin shank, tapered neck, and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> sections, is reported. Monochromatic imaging and line scan profiling indicate that the wave guiding and leaking from growth imperfections {{in addition to the}} oxygen deficiency variation determine the spatial contrast of CL emissions. Occurrence of resonance peaks at identical wavelengths regardless of CL-excitation spots is inconsistent with the whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonances of a two-dimensional cavity in the finite difference time domain simulation. However, three dimensioanl cavity simulation produced WGM peaks that are consistent with the experimental spectra, including transverse-electric resonances that are comparable to transverse-magnetic ones...|$|E
40|$|A Shiga toxin 2 (Stx 2) -encoding {{bacteriophage}} Min 27, {{isolated from}} Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 strain of China, having a regular <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> and short tail, was {{integrated into the}} host wrbA gene and sequenced with a length of 63, 395 nucleotides. Min 27 had a high homology compared to reported Stx 2 phage 933 W, while three genes (O, P and ORF 31) in the replication region were homologous to genes of phage Shigella flexneri V (SFV) of S. flexneri 5 strain 8401 isolated in China. It demonstrated that Min 27 was closely related to phage 933 W though they were isolated from different geographic areas, but an obvious regionally genetic exchange had occurred in its replication region...|$|E
30|$|The image {{acquisitions}} {{were performed}} on a Tandem Discovery NM/CT 670 from GE Medical Systems with two heads. We used LEHR/PARA collimators (low-energy high-resolution/parallel) with <b>hexagonal</b> holes. The <b>head</b> radius was set to a constant distance of 24 cm. Two energy windows, primary and scatter, were recorded with the standard clinical settings. The primary window corresponding to the photopeak of 99 mTc and was set to 126.45 – 154.55 keV, and the scatter window was set to 114 – 126 keV. SPECT acquisitions consisted in 60 step-and-shoot projections of 25 s each and over 360 °. The spatial sampling was 4.418 × 4.418 mm, and the 2 D matrix of pixel was 128 × 128. CT was acquired right after SPECT, with a tube voltage of 120 kV. Slice thickness was 1.25 mm, and pixel spacing was 0.9765 × 0.9765 mm. SPECT reconstruction was performed with manufacturer’s iterative ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm that include attenuation, DEW scatter, and CDR correction. All images were reconstructed with the same software version (Xeleris 3.0) and parameters sets, with 10 subsets and 20 iterations.|$|R
40|$|A {{bacteriophage}} which reproduces on Arthrobacter globiformis ATCC 8010 {{was isolated}} from soil. This bacteriophage, designated φAG 8010, propagates either in soft agar or broth {{cultures of the}} host. Because of a slow adsorption rate, neither the latent period nor burst size was determined. The mature virion belongs to Bradley's group B and exhibits a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> measuring 69 nm (length) by 60 nm (width) attached to a sheathless tail 120 nm long. The buoyant density of the mature virion is 1. 534 g/cm 3. The mature virion contains double-stranded DNA with a buoyant density of 1. 722 g/cm 3 (equivalent to 63. 3 % G + C). Of 14 strains (representing 13 species) of Arthrobacter examined, including A. globiformis ATCC 4336, only A. globiformis ATCC 8010 supported replication of φAG 8010...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To use {{partially}} characterized phages for {{generation of}} phage lysates having {{potential to be}} developed as vaccines against Salmonella Abortusequi. Material and Methods: Phage/s isolation from several sewage samples was attempted against Salmonella Abortusequi strains procured from the National Salmonella Reference Centre, IVRI using enrichment and agar overlay technique. A concentrated stock of the phage was prepared after its purification. The lytic range, morphology and DNA size were determined. Results: Two lytic phages could be isolated and purified. The phage with wider lytic range was found to possess a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> with a very short tail. The DNA size {{was found to be}} 21 kb. Conclusion: The investigation reports first isolation of a lytic phage against Salmonella Abortusequi. The phage can be used in future for development of phage lysate based immune therapeutic agent against equine abortions. [Vet World 2013; 6 (2. 000) : 72 - 75...|$|E
