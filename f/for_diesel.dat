5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon, Diesel begin to {{challenge}} Ramon for the Intercontinental championship. Michaels helped Diesel defeat Ramon for the title on April 13, 1994. This win began a push <b>for</b> <b>Diesel</b> that saw him win the WWF's Triple Crown Championship in one calendar year.|$|E
5|$|Developments in technology, such as computers, {{satellite}} communication, and the Internet, {{have contributed}} to many improvements within the industry. These developments have increased the productivity of company operations, saved {{the time and effort}} of drivers, and provided new, more accessible forms of entertainment to men and women who often spend long periods of time away from home. In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency implemented revised emission standards <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> trucks (reducing airborne pollutants emitted by diesel engines) which promises to improve air quality and public health.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2009, California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{approved}} the specific rules and carbon intensity reference {{values for the}} California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) that take effect January 1, 2011. CARB's rulemaking included ILUC. For some biofuels, CARB identified land use changes as {{a significant source of}} additional GHG emissions. It established one standard for gasoline and alternative fuels, and a second <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel and its replacements.|$|E
50|$|Whyte {{notation}} {{is generally}} used for steam locomotives throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. <b>For</b> <b>diesels</b> and electrics, North America uses the AAR wheel arrangement scheme while British practice uses a slightly simplified {{form of the}} European UIC classification scheme (except <b>for</b> small <b>diesel</b> shunters, where Whyte notation is used).|$|R
50|$|For {{an example}} the new CODAG-propelled s of the Royal Norwegian Navy, the gear ratio <b>for</b> the <b>diesel</b> engine is changed from about 1:7.7 (engine:propeller) for diesel-only to 1:5.3 when in diesel-and-turbine mode. Some ships even have three {{different}} gear ratios <b>for</b> the <b>diesel</b> engines: one each <b>for</b> single <b>diesel</b> and double diesel cruises {{and the third}} when the gas turbine is engaged.|$|R
50|$|A DMU shed is {{believed}} to have been added in 1958 along with servicing facilities <b>for</b> <b>diesels.</b> D2000 series 0-6-0 diesel shunters were the first diesel locos allocated to Neville Hill, probably in that year; the quartet in 1961 comprised D2242-4/6.|$|R
5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and were identical to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975–1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' <b>for</b> <b>diesel,</b> 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
40|$|This work {{involved}} {{the production of}} diesel from most commonly available palm fruits oil Pisifera elaeis guineensis and testing for the brake power, torque of an engine and specific fuel consumption of a conventional diesel engine utilizing the produced diesel from palm oil. The obtained results were compared with those <b>for</b> fossil <b>diesel</b> fuel. The {{results show that the}} value of brake power was 6927. 21 W <b>for</b> fossil <b>diesel</b> while that of biodiesel was 7135. 02 W. Similarly the value for brake torque <b>for</b> fossil <b>diesel</b> was 44. 1 Nm and that of biodiesel was 45. 42 Nm. The average value obtained for the specific fuel consumption in the three experiments conducted <b>for</b> fossil <b>diesel</b> and biodiesel were 69. 09 and 129. 21 l/kWh respectively. It was discovered that the values of brake power, torque power and specific fuel consumption <b>for</b> bio <b>diesel</b> fuel were higher than those of fossil diesel fuel...|$|R
50|$|Trim {{levels are}} G and G Luxury <b>for</b> rear-wheel drive <b>diesel</b> and petrol, and V <b>for</b> 4×4 <b>Diesel</b> and petrol. The common rail turbo {{intercooled}} diesel has functional scoop on its hood.|$|R
5000|$|Objective 1: Biofuel <b>for</b> Transport. <b>Diesel</b> <b>for</b> {{land and}} sea {{transport}} will be a blend of 5% processed palm oil and 95% petroleum diesel. This ‘B5’ would be made available throughout the country.|$|R

25|$|For newly {{introduced}} models, {{the regulation}} dates applied a year earlier– January 1, 2000 for petrol and January 1, 2003 <b>for</b> <b>diesel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Allocation {{of number}} {{in a series}} commencing from 97x01, where x {{represented}} the engine power Type (1 to 5), '7' for ex-multiple unit conversions and '8' <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> shunters.|$|E
50|$|The growing market <b>for</b> <b>diesels</b> in Canada {{meant it}} became {{worthwhile}} to build facilities in Canada to avoid import duties. While MLW and CLC both utilized existing steam locomotive erecting shops in Montreal and Kingston, respectively; General Motors, never having built steam locomotives, required a new facility.|$|R
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} {{that does}} not completely close can contribute to running once the engine is off, since the extra fuel and oxygen mixture can combust easily in the warm piston chamber. Similarly, hot vaporized oil gases from the engine crankcase can provide ample fuel <b>for</b> <b>dieseling.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1954 a {{group of}} steam {{switchers}} was renumbered to free up numbers in the 600s and 700s <b>for</b> <b>diesels.</b> Then in 1956 all locomotives were renumbered again. All steam locomotives were renumbered below 1000, thus freeing all four digit numbers {{for use by the}} growing numbers of diesels.|$|R
25|$|The {{two groups}} of {{emissions}} standards for heavy duty vehicles each have different appropriate test requirements. Steady-state testing is used <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> engines only, while transient testing applies to both diesel and petrol engines.|$|E
25|$|It is {{very common}} in Europe and Asia because those regions have high demand <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> and kerosene. In the US, fluid {{catalytic}} cracking is more common because the demand for gasoline is higher.|$|E
25|$|For {{passenger}} cars with a Gross Vehicle Weight rating of greater than 2500kg and for light commercial vehicles, the regulation dates applied from January 1, 2002 for petrol models, and January 1, 2007 <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> models.|$|E
50|$|L'Orange GmbH, a German {{engineering}} manufacturing company, {{is one of}} {{the leading}} manufacturers of injection systems <b>for</b> large <b>diesel</b> engines worldwide. It developed and produced the first common-rail system <b>for</b> large <b>diesel</b> engines. L'Orange is a supplier to engine manufacturers and is part of Rolls-Royce Power Systems (formerly Tognum).|$|R
50|$|In addition, similar {{numbering}} schemes {{were introduced}} <b>for</b> electric and <b>diesel</b> locomotives, but with prefix letters E for electrics and V (from German Verbrennungsmotor for internal combustion engine) <b>for</b> <b>diesels.</b> <b>For</b> electric locomotives, the class numbers roughly followed the scheme for steam locomotives, e. g. E 18 22 was a locomotive {{from the class}} E 18 introduced in 1935. Diesel locomotives received class numbers indicating one tenth of the horsepower rating (according to the original design), e. g. V 80 001 was the first unit of class V 80 introduced by the DB in 1953 with originally 800 hp (later re-engined to 1100 hp).|$|R
50|$|If {{renewable}} fuel such as wood or other biofuel is used then {{the system could}} be carbon neutral. The use of biofuel remains controversial; however, liquid biofuels are easier to manufacture for steam plant than <b>for</b> <b>diesels</b> as they do not demand the stringent fuel standards required to protect diesel injectors.|$|R
25|$|By the 21st century, <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> {{locomotive}} traction worldwide {{the majority}} of countries used diesel–electric designs, with diesel hydraulic designs not found in use outside Germany and Japan, and some neighbouring states, where it is used in designs for freight work.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} itself contained {{two floors}} housing the living areas; {{two of the}} legs held fuel oil <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> generators, while the third held the intake for the desalination unit. The platform roof served as a helicopter landing area. A rotary gantry was suspended from the platform to allow servicing of its underside.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the U.S. Navy {{completed}} a $12 million wind-energy {{project at the}} base, erecting four 950-kilowatt, 275-foot-tall wind turbines, reducing the need <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel to power the existing diesel generators (the base's primary electricity generation). In 2006, the wind turbines reduced diesel fuel consumption by 650,000 gallons annually.|$|E

25|$|The Urakaze-class vessels {{made use}} of oil-fired Brown-Curtiss turbine engines, and had the {{distinction}} of being the first vessels built for Japan to be designed for use without coal. The initial design called <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> engines, however, due to the outbreak of World War I, Yarrow could not obtain necessary gear components from Germany.|$|E
25|$|Both {{naturally}} aspirated and turbocharged versions were built, but the all-alloy engine blocks failed under the much greater pressures involved in diesel operation. The project was, therefore, abandoned. The effort {{to strengthen the}} Rover V8 <b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> operation was not, however, completely wasted; the 4.2-litre petrol variant of the engine used crankshaft castings developed in the Iceberg project.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{confusion}} between kerosene and {{the much}} more flammable and volatile gasoline, some jurisdictions regulate markings or colorings for containers used to store or dispense kerosene. For example, in the United States, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requires that portable containers used at retail service stations be colored blue, as opposed to red (for gasoline) or yellow (<b>for</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel).|$|E

50|$|These engines use an {{injection}} pump that is entirely mechanical, {{this was the}} standard <b>for</b> <b>diesels</b> of the day. The fuel system also utilizes indirect injection which made it louder than mechanically direct injected engines. Both 6.9 and 7.3 liter engines use the Stanadyne DB-2 injection pump fed by a cam-driven lift pump.|$|R
