50|$|The {{complexity}} of the glacial period and its subdivision into several glacial epochs, separated by interglacial epochs of considerable length (certainly longer than the postglacial epoch) has a structural consequence in the superposition of successive till sheets, alternating with non-glacial deposits. It also has a physiographic consequence in the very different amount of normal postglacial erosion suffered by the {{different parts of the}} glacial deposits. The southernmost drift sheets, as in southern Iowa and northern Missouri, have lost their initially plain surface and are now maturely dissected into gracefully rolling forms. Here, the valleys of even the small streams are well opened and graded, and marshes and lakes are rare. These sheets are of early Pleistocene origin. Nearer the Great Lakes, the till sheets are trenched only by the narrow valleys of the large streams. Marshy sloughs still occupy the faint depressions in the till plains and the associated moraines have abundant small lakes in their undrained <b>hollows.</b> These <b>drift</b> sheets are of late Pleistocene origin.|$|R

A {{piece of}} <b>hollow</b> cane, <b>drifted</b> from unknown isles, and found upon the beach, its once jagged ends rubbed {{smoothly}} even as by sand-paper; its golden glazing gone. Long ground between {{the sea and}} land, upper and nether stone, the unvarnished substance was filed bare, and wore another polish now, one with itself, the polish of its agony. Circular lines at intervals cut all round this surface, divided it into six panels of unequal length. In the first were scored the days, each tenth one marked by a longer and deeper notch; the second was scored {{for the number of}} sea-fowl eggs for sustenance, picked out from the rocky nests; the third, how many fish had been caught from the shore; the fourth, how many small tortoises found inland; the fifth, how many days of sun; the sixth, of clouds; which last, of the two, was the greater one. Long night of busy numbering, misery's mathematics, to weary her too-wakeful soul to sleep; yet sleep for that was none.|$|R
40|$|The {{model of}} a tranSformation of ion-acoustic double layer with small {{amplitude}} into strong double layer is presented in [1]. In this paper this model and all stages of evolution are described analytically. Earlier by numerical simulation in [2] and analytically in [3] {{it has been shown}} that an ion-acoustic instability development leads to a formation of a nonmonotoneous ion-acoustic double layer with small amplitude if an electron drift velocity is a little smaller than an electron thermal velocity. But this double layer accelerates ions. Hence on first front of ion-acoustic double layer an ion density becomes smaller. But into this region the electron flow penetrate with electron velocity only a little smaller than electron thermal velocity. Hence on the first front of the potential <b>hollow</b> the electron <b>drift</b> velocity becomes more than electron thermal velocity due to flow continuity law []. Due to Bunemann mechanism interaction of electron flow with this region an electric potential hump of large amplitude is excited with growth rate, proportionalto a*(m. lm) rt 3. Here a! " is the electron plasma frequency; tn", midta electron and ion masses. This strong electric potential hump can be unstable relative to radiation of electron reversal jump. After that former hump becomes strong double layer...|$|R
40|$|Information {{is lacking}} on spray {{techniques}} to reduce off-target loss {{on the ground}} and via spray drift from the treated area in nursery applications. Airborne deposits at three elevations on sampling towers and on the ground at several distances from the sprayer were investigated with the three spray treatments in an open field without crops. Tests were conducted with an air blast sprayer equipped with conventional hollow cone nozzles (HC), low drift nozzles (AI), and conventional hollow cone nozzles with a drift retardant (HCDR) in an open field without crops. To compare field test results, wind tunnel experiments were conducted to assess spray deposits on the floor beyond 0. 4 m downwind distance from the nozzles and airborne deposits at 2. 1 m downwind from the spray discharge point with the three spray techniques. Droplet size distributions across spray patterns were measured with a laser particle/droplet image analysis system. There {{was no significant difference in}} airborne deposits for the three elevations at both 15 and 30 m downwind from the sprayer between AI and HC methods except for 3. 05 m elevation at the 15 m distance although the average airborne deposits with AI were lower than that with HC. The downwind spray deposits on the ground at 15 and 30 m from the sprayer with AI were higher than that with HC and HCDR. Compared with conventional <b>hollow</b> cone nozzles, <b>drift</b> reduction from air induction nozzles or the spray mixture with drift retardant was significant in wind tunnel tests but was not significant in field tests...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} a digest {{of the work}} {{accomplished}} in a salmon investigation conducted {{under the authority of}} the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries of the California Division of Fish and Game. Active work was begun in 1919, and is still in progress. At the outset the investigation was so planned as to contribute as directly as possible to the solution of certain questions relating to the conservation of the fishery. The work has progressed in a fairly satisfactory way in some directions as will appear, while in others the results are not so good. The information now most needed relates to the seaward migration of young salmon, and to the relative contribution of natural and artificial propagation to the population of the river. It may seem that the matter of depletion is overstressed in this report, since its progress has been evident for years. A condition of increasing depletion was not sufficiently evident on the Klamath however, to be convincing to those most interested. In fact, opinions to the contrary were commonly held, some asserting that the "run" was not only maintaining itself but that it was gradually building up. There is very little exact information concerning fishing operations on Klamath River previous to 1912, and no really dependable statistics are available relating to the catch before that time. During the period of placer mining on the river, large numbers of salmon were speared or otherwise captured on or near their spawning beds, and if credence is given to the reports of old miners, there then appeared the first and perhaps major cause of early depletion. In 1912 three plants operated on or near the estuary and the river was heavily fished, no limit being placed on the activities of anyone. A resume of commercial fishing near the mouth or the river appears on page 88. In the collection of statistical data relating to the ocean catch of salmon, the state authorities {{have not been able to}} separate the different species. Four occur in the state, but only two species are of commercial importanceâ€”the king salmon, or chinook, and the silver salmon or coho; hence all statistics relating to ocean fishing include both of these fishes in unknown proportions, the king salmon certainly predominating in a large measure. Commercial fishing is now confined to the lower part of the estuary of Klamath River, partly as a matter of convenience and partly because of legal restrictions. Formerly nets were used at certain places as far up stream as Blue Creek, and occasionally beyond. Advantage was taken of slack water below the swift riffles, and much work was done at Ferry <b>Drift</b> and at <b>Hollow</b> Tree <b>Drift.</b> An official tide limit, above which fishing was illegal, was first fixed at the mouth of McGarvey Creek. Later it was moved down stream at the point where the highway bridge stands. Salmon are caught by means of drifting gill nets, which are laid out across the river mostly between the lowermost island and a safe distance from the jaws. It is the habit of the fishermen to start the layout at a signal from the cannery whistle, usually about eight o'clock in the evening. The nets are laid from the decked stern of a large rowboat, one man at the oars and another at the net. Occasionally a skilful man manages both boat and net. Layouts are accomplished simultaneously from both sides of the river, the nets thus interdigitating across the stream. After the layout the nets drift with the current until recovered. The fisherman passes slowly from end to end of his net removing the entangled fish, evidence of which is apparent from the movements of the corks. often the fishing is over in a short time, and in rare cases the fish become entangled so rapidly that no time is lost in bringing in both net and fish. Too often however, drift after drift is made with poor success. Occasionally a large sturgeon runs afoul of the nets, harbor seals have been caught, while small sharks, skates, and almost any fish of small size may become entangled. The capture of some steelheads can not be avoided. The number of fishermen varies somewhat from year to year, and also during the season, more boats operating after the migration is well on, some fishermen being perfectly willing to allow others to do the prospecting and preliminary exploring when fish may be scarce, and hidden snags not definitely located. Fishing is not usually accompanied with success when there is a bright moon overhead. The actual fishing and the work in the cannery is to a considerable extent in the hands of Indians who are the descendants of members of the small aboriginal tribes which inhabited the region. Salmon have always furnished a great part of their food, and they have come to depend pretty largely upon the money earned during the fishing season for the few necessities of a simple life. They are skilled in the production of artistic baskets, and formerly, dugout canoes of large size and fine proportions were made by them. Some of these were beautifully carved. The lore of these people is replete with legends relating to the things about them. They were greatly restricted in their geographic outlook, but they seem to have been closely acquainted with every detail of their own land. They were essentially nature worshipers, and the fishes, reptiles, birds and mammals were adopted into intimate spiritual companionship...|$|R
