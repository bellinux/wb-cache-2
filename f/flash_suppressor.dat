5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor</b> that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.|$|E
25|$|The barrel is {{fitted with}} a 'birdcage' style <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor,</b> which can be fully {{disassembled}} without the need of additional tools.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} conical <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor,</b> the No 5 Mk I could only mount the No. 5 blade bayonet, which was also {{designed}} {{to serve as a}} combat knife if needed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> {{are seen}} as a [...] "military" [...] feature, and {{semi-automatic}} long guns with <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> were defined as Military-Style Semi-Automatics in 1992, requiring a permit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>{{suppressors}}</b> {{and sound}} suppressors {{are the most}} obvious devices that operate in the transitional ballistics realm. These both alter {{the flow of the}} escaping gas to reduce the effects of the muzzle blast. <b>Flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> introduce turbulence into the mixing of fuel-laden hot gases escaping from the muzzle and the surrounding oxygen-rich air, reducing combustion efficiency and thus reducing the size and brightness of the <b>flash.</b> Sound <b>suppressors</b> slow the expansion of gases, allowing it to cool and reducing the rate at which it escapes to prevent a shockwave from forming.|$|R
50|$|The State of California outlaws <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> on semiautomatic rifles with {{detachable}} magazines, but allows muzzle brakes {{to be used}} instead.|$|R
25|$|The Mini-14 GB ("government bayonet") models feature {{either a}} pistol grip, side folding stock or a {{standard}} semi-pistol grip stock, a 20 or 30-round magazine, bayonet lug, threaded barrel, and <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor.</b> The GB models also come with standard rifle stocks. Sales {{are intended for}} only the law enforcement, military and private security markets, and can only be found in their Law Enforcement Catalog. However, some have entered the civilian market.|$|E
25|$|Early {{production}} models were supplied with barrels that had six right-hand grooves and a 305mm (1:12 in) rifling twist (optimized {{for use with}} M193 ammunition), while recent {{production models}} feature a 178mm (1:7 in) twist barrel with six right-hand grooves (used to stabilize the heavier SS109/M855 projectile). The barrel has a slotted <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor</b> with 6 ports {{and can be used}} to launch rifle grenades (such as the BT/AT 52) or mount a bayonet lug attachment (it will accept the M7 bayonet).|$|E
25|$|The {{precision}} rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with {{a similar}} operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle is fed from a 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor</b> and a muzzle brake. It can be replaced with a sound suppressor, which {{requires the use of}} subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|WASR-series rifles are {{inexpensive}} and easily customized, {{with hundreds of}} aftermarket stocks, muzzle brakes, <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors,</b> telescopic sights, and other accessories available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> and muzzle brakes can {{be legally}} {{acquired}} and used on {{all types of}} weapons, unless {{they are designed to}} significantly or predominantly reduce the sound.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> {{and barrel}} shrouds {{were seen as}} [...] "military" [...] {{features}} and were {{on the list of}} federally defined features that could cause a rifle to be defined as illegal, if the lower receiver was manufactured after the effective date of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban that went into effect in 1994 in the United States. In the context of that law, the National Rifle Association deemed telescoping stocks a [...] "cosmetic feature". This ban expired in 2004, although some states such as California and New York have similar bans in place restricting the use of <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} {{free-floating}} barrel (the barrel does not contact the handguard). The barrel is {{fastened to the}} receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with a wrench. The barrel is produced using a cold hammer forging process and features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate. The barrel assembly consists of the gas block, a collar with a bayonet lug that {{is also used to}} launch rifle grenades and a slotted <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The SS2 is {{an upgrade}} of the Pindad SS1, being a {{licensed}} {{version of the}} FN FNC. The SS2's <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor</b> is based on that of the Colt M16A2, {{and it has a}} reciprocating charging handle {{that can be used for}} forward assist, with the front sight being based on the AK rifles. The carrying handle and detachable rear sight is placed on top of Picatinny railings. Most of the SS2 rifle variants can have its carry handle removed in order to gain access to its picatinny railings to install various optics.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} be legal for {{purchase}} by civilians without obtaining a tax stamp for a Short Barreled Rifle (SBR) {{as defined by the}} United States National Firearms Act, the PS90 carbine has an extended 407mm (16in) barrel and is semi-automatic, with a trigger pull of approximately [...] The lengthened barrel has eight rifling grooves, with a right-hand twist rate of 1:229mm (1:9 in) and a rifled length of the muzzle is equipped with a fixed [...] "birdcage" [...] type <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Smith Enterprise Inc. (SEI) is {{a firearm}} and {{accessory}} manufacturing facility based in Tempe, Arizona {{that is known}} for making <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors,</b> muzzle brakes, sound suppressors, M14 rifles and accessories for M14 rifles.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{semi-automatic}} rifles {{with features}} such as pistol grips and <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors,</b> L1A1s are classified as military-style semi-automatics, requiring a special permit to own them. Magazine capacities for other centrefire semi-automatics are limited to seven rounds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> reduce, or in {{some cases}} eliminate, the flash by rapidly cooling the gases as they leave the end of the barrel. Although the overall amount of burning {{propellant}} is unchanged, the density and temperature are greatly reduced, as is the brightness of the flash.|$|R
500|$|The product {{improvement}} program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the {{product improvement}} kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor,</b> and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E

50|$|Barrel: The barrel is a 20 in long 1:7.7 in twist match grade {{stainless}} steel barrel, manufactured by Compass Lake Engineering from Krieger blanks. Current SAM-Rs {{are equipped with}} 'chipped' <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> to allow attachment of the KAC M4 quick-detach sound suppressor, while earlier examples were fielded with standard compensators.|$|R
50|$|Because {{both the}} optical flash and muzzle blast are muffled by <b>flash</b> <b>{{suppressors}}</b> and muzzle blast suppressors (also known as “silencers”), {{the efficacy of}} gunshot detection systems may be reduced for suppressed weapons. The FBI estimates that 1% or fewer of crimes that involve gunfire are committed with silenced guns.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} devices {{referred}} to as hybrids that function as both <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> and muzzle rise / recoil compensators such as the White Sound Defense FOSSA-556. The U.S. military A2 muzzle device is technically a hybrid device as it has vents that are biased upwardly to reduce muzzle rise.|$|R

2500|$|According to {{official}} recoil tests the No. 4 rifle yielded [...] free recoil {{energy and the}} No. 5 carbine [...] Of the No. 5 carbine [...] extra recoil energy [...] was caused by adding the conical <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Birdcage type" [...] <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> {{still have}} prongs, but feature a {{ring on the}} front to prevent {{vegetation}} entanglement between the prongs. The closed bottom port of the M16A2 design makes the device function as a compensator. Both designs require indexing with a crush washer which unfortunately contributes to flash signature.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{states have}} passed more {{restrictive}} laws, with more inclusive definitions of assault weapons. [...] One {{example is the}} NY SAFE Act, which changed the restriction {{to one or more}} (rather than two or more) of the above features, and expanded the restricted muzzle devices beyond just <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> to include compensators and muzzle brakes.|$|R
50|$|Surefire {{produces}} Picatinny rail forends, sound <b>suppressors,</b> muzzle brakes, <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors,</b> EarPro branded {{hearing protection}} and tactical communication earpieces, and Combat Utility knives. These knives combine some {{features of a}} multi-tool with the blade of a combat knife. In late 2010, Surefire introduced STANAG compatible high capacity magazines with a capacity of 60 or 100 rounds.|$|R
2500|$|Introduced in 2009, the [...] "Tactical Rifle" [...] is {{the newest}} variant, which {{includes}} the shorter 16.12" [...] barrel with <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor,</b> and is available with a standard fixed stock/forend, or a collapsible ATI-brand stock with Picatinny rails. This model is chambered in both [...]223 Remington/5.56×45mm NATO and [...]300 AAC Blackout as of 2015.|$|E
2500|$|A {{product of}} Troy Industries the CAR 14 (Carbine Assault Rifle 14) is a smaller and lighter {{tactical}} {{version of the}} M14. [...] Its barrel is 12.5 inches long and it weighs 7.9 pounds. The rifle has select fire ability, a threaded <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor</b> for a suppressor, a tactical rail on top for sights and other attachments, and the operating rod cover.|$|E
2500|$|The M14K is a {{commercial}} {{version of the}} M14 designed and built by Timothy F. LaFrance of La France Specialties of San Diego, California, most using forged receivers produced by Smith Enterprise of Tempe, Arizona. This rifle has a custom-made short barrel with a custom-made <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor,</b> shortened operating rod, and employs a unique gas tube system. [...] Fully automatic versions have a removable <b>flash</b> <b>suppressor.</b> [...] Semi-automatic versions (of which very few were made) have a silver-brazed flash hider {{to comply with the}} requirement that Title I firearms have a 16" [...] barrel. [...] Most M14Ks employ the M60 gas tube system. [...] Some late-model M14Ks employ a custom-designed and manufactured gas system. [...] Both are intended to control the rate of fire in fully automatic mode. [...] The rear sight is a custom-made National Match type aperture, and the front sight is a custom-made narrow blade, wing-protected sight {{to take advantage of the}} additional accuracy afforded by the special barrel.|$|E
50|$|During the Rhodesian Bush War, {{security}} forces fitted most standard FNs with customised <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> to reduce recoil on fully automatic fire. However, a few soldiers rejected these devices, which they claimed upset {{the balance of}} their weapons during close action. In this theatre, the FN was generally considered superior to the Soviet Kalashnikovs or SKS carbines carried by communist-backed PF insurgents.|$|R
50|$|When {{firing a}} gun, a flash {{is often seen}} at the muzzle (known as a muzzle flash) and is {{produced}} by the hot gases escaping the barrel. The size of the flash depends on {{various factors such as}} barrel length, type and amount of powder, etc. <b>Flash</b> <b>suppressors</b> are attached to the muzzle of the weapon to diminish these effects.|$|R
50|$|The cannon {{carriage}} {{is based}} on the earlier ZPU-2 anti-aircraft twin heavy machine gun, which mounted two KPV 14.5 mm heavy machine guns. ZU-23-2 can be identified by different placement of the ammunition boxes (at right angles to the gun carriage) and by muzzle <b>flash</b> <b>suppressors.</b> In another similarity to the ZPU series, single-barrel and four-barrel versions of the ZU-23 were also developed. However, these versions never entered service.|$|R
