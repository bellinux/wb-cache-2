For example, the emissions of a predator's food source, such as odors or pheromones, may be in the air or on a surface where the food source has been. Cells in the head, usually the air passages or mouth, have chemical receptors on their surface that change when in contact with the emissions.

40|$|Rhenium, {{with its}} high melting temperature, {{excellent}} elevated temperature properties, {{and lack of}} a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT), is ideally suited for the hot gas components of the ACM (Attitude Control Motor), and other high-temperature applications. However, {{the high cost of}} rhenium makes fabricating these components using conventional fabrication techniques prohibitive. Therefore, near-net-shape forming techniques were investigated for producing cost-effective rhenium and rhenium alloy components for the ACM and other propulsion applications. During this investigation, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>forming</b> (EL-Form) techniques were evaluated for producing the hot gas components. The investigation focused on demonstrating that EL-Form processing techniques could be used to produce the ACM flow distributor. Once the EL-Form processing techniques were established, a representative rhenium flow distributor was fabricated, and samples were harvested for material properties testing at both room and elevated temperatures. As a lower cost and lighter weight alternative to an all-rhenium component, rhenium- coated graphite and carbon-carbon were also evaluated. The rhenium-coated components were thermal-cycle tested to verify that they could withstand the expected thermal loads during service. High-temperature electroforming is based on electrochemical deposition of compact layers of metals onto a mandrel of the desired shape. Mandrels used for electro-deposition of near-net shaped parts are generally fabricated from high-density graphite. The graphite mandrel is easily machined and does not react with the molten electrolyte. For near-net shape components, the inner surface of the electroformed part replicates the polished graphite mandrel. During processing, the mandrel itself becomes the cathode, and scrap or refined refractory metal is the anode. Refractory metal atoms from the anode material are ionized in the molten electrolytic solution, and are deposited onto the cathodic mandrel by electrochemical reduction. Rotation of the mandrel ensures uniform distribution of refractory material. The EL-Form process allows for manufacturing in an inert atmosphere with deposition rates from 0. 0004 to 0. 002 in. /h (10. 2 to 50. 8 m/h). Thicknesses typically range from microns to greater than 0. 5 in. (13 mm). The refractory component produced is fabricated, dependably, to within one micron of the desired tolerances with no shrinkage or distortion as in other refractory metal manufacture techniques. The electroforming process has been used to produce solid, nonporous deposits of rhenium, iridium, niobium, tungsten, and their alloys...|$|E

40|$|Microbial-induced {{corrosion}} (MIC) is an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>form</b> of corrosion that is initiated, facilitated, or {{accelerated by}} bacteria and biofilms {{on the metal}} substrate. Coating methods {{have been widely used}} to inhibit MIC because of their effectiveness, ease of application and low cost. Conventional coatings for MIC inhibition are based on heavy metals such as tin, copper, and zinc; however, these coatings are toxic to the environment. Recently, environmentally friendly coatings were developed to overcome MIC problems. Among these new coatings, studies have focused on conductive polymers, which have both antibacterial and anticorrosive properties. The biocidal and anticorrosive properties of conductive polymers make them appropriate coatings for MIC inhibition. This research project is aimed to study and compare the behaviour towards MIC of four types of conductive polymer coatings namely, polyaniline nanofibres, polyaniline-silver nanocomposite, polyaniline-carbon nanotube, and polyaniline-graphene nanocomposite. These polymers were synthesized and produced through in situ chemical polymerization from various chemicals. This was followed by coating the synthesized polymer coatings onto mild steel substrates by solvent casting method. The behaviour of the polymer coated substrates towards MIC was investigated through immersion test in Pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculated nutrient-rich simulated seawater (NRSS) medium for one to eight weeks. The corrosion rates and corrosion resistance of the coated mild steel were determined by electrochemical test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3. 5 % sodium chloride solution respectively. Materials characterisation and analysis were carried using field emission electron microscope (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Adhesion and conductivity test were performed on the polymer-coated mild steels using pull off and four point probe instruments respectively. The overall results show that nanocomposite coatings displayed better MIC inhibition behavior in comparison with pure polyaniline coating and PANI-graphene act as the best MIC inhibition coating. This is due to the good antibacterial and anticorrosive properties of the coating which effectively inhibit MIC. In addition, electrically conductive polymer coatings could inhibit biofilm formation and impart good anticorrosive properties. This research project concluded that these conductive polymer coatings are suitable candidates for MIC inhibition application...|$|R
