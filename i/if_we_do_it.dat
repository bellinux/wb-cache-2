500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because {{who knows how long}} the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|There were rumours about Kent {{releasing}} an EP, as {{they had}} been spotted in studio and guitarist Sami had said, [...] "We might release an EP, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> will only be digitally released." [...] Just one month before the November 2005 release, The Hjärta & Smärta EP (The Heart & Pain EP) was confirmed, as a CD as well as a digital release. It was well received and contained five tracks, [...] "Dom som försvann" [...] (Those Who Disappeared) becoming the radio single and having a video recorded. The EP made No.1 in Sweden and remained on the charts for 33 weeks.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{was only}} fooling," [...] {{answered}} Fred. [...] "I wouldn't {{be afraid to}} ride right up to his door. That is, in the daytime. Of course, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> at night he might become suspicious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{what are}} we come here for--into this world, I mean--but to do!' {{returned}} Leonard; 'and I take it, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right, it does not much matter what or where it is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] shouted Henry, [...] "I hope we take Niagara. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{will cut}} the French entirely {{off from the}} Ohio and the Mississippi, and this ground will be safer than ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{best not}} to keep a grudge against a defeat, I suppose. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> won't help us. I've had my quarrel with the Pymantoning County Fair, too; but it wasn't with the Fine Arts Committee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are but a}} short {{distance}} {{on this side of}} the town. We could not hope to get there before the Bairds; and, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> would be a quarter of an hour before we could mount and be off." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{protested that}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> was our clear duty {{to pay a}} small rent; but Mrs. Evelegh brushed that aside. 'You've robbed yourselves over the bicycle,' she insisted, 'and I'm delighted to let you have it. It's I who ought to pay, for you'll keep the house dry for me.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Our {{idea for}} Oddworld was to birth a rich {{universe}} of relevant material with endearing characters, {{one that we}} could reflect those issues that we felt most deeply about ... thenconvert them into interactive entertainment. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> right, {{there was no reason}} why the universe we had created couldn’t tell infinite stories. Much like Star Wars. Lorne Lanning ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But naturally! What {{is there}} {{to do for a}} woman but think? We cannot act, or rather, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> is in a very {{insignificant}} way. We are lookers-on at most of the things in life worth doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{curtains}} inspire confidence," [...] Miss Allan decided. [...] "When {{the ball}} {{is in full swing}} it will be time to draw them. We might even open the windows a little.

6000|$|The captain {{shook his}} head. [...] "Don't be {{in such a}} hurry," [...] he said. [...] "It {{will not be an}} easy job to open that mound, and we shall need the help of the blackies, as you call them, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Phil Labonte stated {{about the}} song: [...] "Tru-Kvlt-Metal" [...] is really sarcastic. It's really {{directed}} towards {{the people that}} we've heard year after year, record after record, saying, 'Oh, put out another record like The Fall Of Ideals. We've done that, and even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> some purist would say it's tarnished anyway because we've already <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> You can't win, so (the song) {{is kind of like}} flicking my nose at them and giving them the bird." ...|$|R

"It is well, my love," [...] {{said the}} aunt, soothingly; [...] "you cannot fail with such means, {{and your own}} exertions, finally to prevail over your own worst enemies, your passions. The task our sex has to sustain is, at the best, an arduous one; but so much the greater is our credit <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, sir," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Truck, who, having {{thus far}} opened his mind, {{for the first}} time that morning gave a vigorous hem! and set about lighting a cigar.--"We may do it, gentlemen, or we may not do it. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> you will hear farther from me; if we fail, why, tell them at home that we carried sail as long as a stitch would draw." ...|$|E

We hold it for a time over the fire, pouring a little water on as fast as it evaporates; that softens the wood, and we can bend it much more evenly than <b>we</b> could <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> by force. Besides, when it is {{fastened}} into its position it remains, when it is dry, in that shape, and throws no strain on to anything." ...|$|R

She has gone through a tornado without having {{suffered}} the slightest damage, except the loss of the dinghy. I shall be getting the topmast up in another hour. You see, I have got her number-two jib on her and shifted the mizzen, but she is still a bit too lively to make it safe to get up the spar.

6000|$|... "If you did," [...] Brooks {{answered}} him, [...] "you'd {{do it by}} yourself, and you'd stand a {{fair chance}} of being run out. There's {{going to be no}} preaching or hymn-singing here. Those sorts of things are very well in their way, but they've {{nothing to do with this}} show.

6000|$|... "First things first," [...] said Sir Richmond. If we {{set about}} getting fuel sanely, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as the deliberate, {{co-operative}} {{act of the}} whole species, then it follows that we shall look very closely into the use that is being made of it. When all the fuel getting is brought into one view as a common interest, then it follows that all the fuel burning will be brought into one view. At present we are getting fuel {{in a kind of}} scramble with no general aim. We waste and lose almost as much as we get. And of what we get, the waste is idiotic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] said Turnbull, stolidly. [...] "Let {{us look at}} a few final facts. Beyond {{that hill}} there is {{comparatively}} clear country. Fortunately, I know the part well, and if you will follow me exactly, and, when necessary, on your stomach, {{we may be able}} to get ten miles out of London, literally without meeting anyone at all, which will be the best possible beginning, at any rate. We have provisions for at least two days and two nights, three days <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> carefully. We may be able to get fifty or sixty miles away without even walking into an inn door. I have the biscuits and the tinned meat, and the milk. You have the chocolate, I think? And the brandy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Phil Ogden; [...] "but I doubt <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Father {{says it is}} a week's {{work for}} five men, {{if you could get}} them to do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Swardson defended Bucky Larson in an October 2011 interview, {{in which}} he blamed its poor {{financial}} showing on the difficulties of advertising the material: [...] "To promote an R-rated movie, with commercials, with this character, it was just really, really hard. It {{was hard to get}} the movie across to people. The trailer in theaters was really tame because we couldn't show any of the insanity, and even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> it wouldn't hit because it had no context. It was just really frustrating." [...] He predicted the film would find more appreciation on DVD.|$|R
5000|$|... "Years later, when Philby {{made his}} escape to Moscow, Peggie and I {{were having a}} drink with Footman, who was looking shattered. 'I know', said Peggie. 'We could work out a plan to leak {{information}} to the NKVD showing that Philby was a triple-cross, that Nicholas Eliot's last meeting with him in Beirut had really been to brief him {{on how to make}} touch with our Embassy in Moscow. I'll bet they'd swallow the story, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> craftily.' 'But the NKVD would shoot him', protested David, shocked to the core. 'Yes', said Peggie happily, 'and serve him bloody right.'" ...|$|R

Look here, Peter," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "we won't say {{anything}} about being his nephews, unless {{there is no other}} way of getting taken; for <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> won't be nice. We shall be taken notice of, and not treated like other fellows, and that will cause all sorts of ill-feeling and jealousy, and rows. It will be quite time to say who we are when we have done something to show that we shan't do discredit to him. You see it isn't much in our favor that we are here as two runaway boys. If we were older we could go as volunteers, but of course we are too young for that." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{stay in this}} villa till our {{month is}} out, and then we go for a week into Siena that I may be nearer the churches and pictures, and see {{something}} of the cathedral and Sodomas. We calculated that it was cheaper to move our quarters than to have a carriage to and fro, and then Dr. Harding recommended repeated change of air for me, and he has proved his ability so much (so kindly too!) that we are bound to act on his opinions as closely as we can. Perhaps we may even go to Volterra afterwards, if the finances will allow of it. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> may be for another week at farthest, and then we return to Florence. You had better direct there as usual. And do write and tell me much of yourself, and set me down in your thoughts as quite well, and ever yours in warm and grateful affection.|$|E

In {{the first}} place, as you say, every one liked her and in the second, a crime of that sort is quite {{out of the way}} of our quiet Devonshire people. It must have been some stranger, that's evident. Yet on the other hand it is {{singular}} that the man should have got into her room. I don't suppose there has been a window fastened or a door locked on the ground floor for years; the idea of a burglary never occurs to any one here. By the way, the coroner ought to be informed at once. I will speak to Carne about it; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> this morning he will have time to send over this evening and summon a jury for to-morrow; the sooner it is over the better. Directly the Chief Constable arrives he will no doubt send round orders everywhere for tramps and suspicious persons to be arrested. Plymouth is the place where they are most likely to get some clue; in the first place it's the largest town in this part, and in the second there are sure to be low shops where a man could dispose of valuables." ...|$|E
5000|$|The splashings {{continued}} until June 2007, when James Cooper, 24, {{was arrested at}} an art opening in Brooklyn for trying to set off a stink bomb from a coffee canhttps://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/28/arts/design/28stin.html?ex=1342584000&en=66dabc6cd02ba8ff&ei=5124&partner=delicious&exprod=delicious at an art opening for Shepard Fairey. Cooper was charged with third-degree arson, reckless endangerment, placing a false bomb, criminal possession of a weapon, harassment and disorderly conduct. Two days after his release, a group of individuals distributed a 16-page manifesto at another Fairey art opening entitled <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> {{this is how it}} would’ve happened.

In the meanwhile every man I can spare from here will start in cutting out a ten-foot trench at the mine. That would take away {{a good deal of}} any water that did come down." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009, Captain EO regained {{popularity}} on the Internet. For several years, {{a small group of}} fans had petitioned Disney to bring back the attraction and Jackson's death had brought this campaign to a peak. Soon afterward, Disney officials were seen in Disneyland at the Magic Eye Theater and reportedly held a private screening of Captain EO to determine if it could be shown again. On September 10, Disney CEO Bob Iger said, [...] "There aren’t plans to bring back Captain EO at this time ... We are looking at it.
