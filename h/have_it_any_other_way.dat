60|$|WELL, {{that was}} a hard month on us all. Poor Benny, she kept up the best she could, and me and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the house, but it kind of went for nothing, as you may say. It was the same up at the jail. We went up every day to see the old people, but it was awful dreary, because the old man warn't {{sleeping}} much, and was walking in his sleep considerable and so he got to looking fagged and miserable, and his mind got shaky, and we all got afraid his troubles would break him down and kill him. And whenever we tried {{to persuade him to}} feel cheerfuler, he only {{shook his head and said}} if we only knowed what it was to carry around a murderer's load in your heart we wouldn't talk that way. Tom and all of us kept telling him it WASN'T murder, but just accidental killing! but it never made any difference--it was murder, and he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> He actu'ly begun to come out plain and square towards trial time and acknowledge that he TRIED to kill the man. Why, {{that was a}}wful, you know. It made things seem fifty times as dreadful, and there warn't no more comfort for Aunt Sally and Benny. But he promised he wouldn't say a word about his murder when others was around, and we was glad of that.|$|E

But they can't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> because it's what holds them together, they enjoy the drama and pushing each other's buttons.The only way to express these extreme emotions is with extreme imagery, {{all of which is}} fantasism and nothing in the song is based on reality.Leona Lewis's [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] isn't actually about her bleeding and this song isn't actually about punching someone in the mouth." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, Alex Henderson said [...] "Akchoté's guitar playing is free-spirited but {{relatively}} accessible -- certainly by avant-garde jazz standards -- and he speaks {{a language that}} is primarily a jazz language but incorporates elements of blues, rock, folk and Latin music" [...] and observed that the album [...] "won't {{go down in history}} as a five-star masterpiece, but it's a thoughtful, enjoyably sincere way for Akchoté to acknowledge Sharrock's legacy". All About Jazz said [...] "Sonny II is thoroughly flawed, to the extent it's disjointed and underdeveloped, and to some that might be reason enough for disqualification, but I don't think Noël Akchoté—or Sonny Sharrock—would <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> To be sure, Akchoté doesn't pack the same raw, visceral punch that Sharrock did. But his roots are clear, his debts are paid, and this record is proof". JazzTimes reviewer, Aaron Steinberg, observed [...] "The obtuse French-born guitarist doesn't attempt to replicate Sharrock's fearsome sound. This personal, almost diaristic recording instead considers Sharrock the composer refracted through the guitarist's imagination." ...|$|E

As we toured more and more, the things that people loved about our live show and our music was not, we realized, on that album. We needed something immediate, powerful and full of energy, and that's what No Weak Heart Shall Prosper is, we're both much happier with this album and how it's coming together. As an album and as a band, this project contains so much more of what we've learned about ourselves in these past three years, that I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> our time is fast approaching, and when it comes, this is what it sounds like.

5000|$|Beefcake's {{personality}} {{has changed}} considerably since Hell-O. Oderus Urungus and Beefcake originally had an almost brotherly relationship, and the dialog {{between the two}} reflected such. When Michael Bishop was replaced by Casey Orr, that relationship changed as well - instead, Beefcake became extremely arrogant ("Beef is an arrogant bastard with absolutely no regard for feelings of others. No one likes him and he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> His ill temper and egotistical vanity make him the perfect rock star.

While Bishop returned for We Kill Everything, his personality remained the same (possibly because Orr returned after the album was recorded). Little is known about Todd Evans' take on Beefcake, though his entries in the Gwar.net blog again reflect extreme arrogance ("Feast on the limitless knowledge that your puny, under-developed mind craves...and feel free to ask what you will, you just may warrant a reply, but probably not so don't hold your breath!").|$|E

Fozzie accepts, but since he and Scooter {{were supposed to do}} an act together, Scooter has to audition a replacement. Although it's summer, it eventually snows right as Scooter found a replacement in Frosty the Polar Bear. Meanwhile, at the Whatnot Theater, Fozzie finds that the cast is very similar to the Muppets like Dermot the Dog (a dog parody of Kermit the Frog), Miss Tiggy (a tiger parody of Miss Piggy), Doctor Tongue, Bonzo the Great (a monkey version of Gonzo), a carrot parody of Animal who plays the spoons, and a British bulldog parody of Sam the Eagle (down to wearing the Union Jack flag). Fozzie learns that his gig is as a replacement for the resident beaver Ozzy (who's leaving because of a bigger opportunity). Fozzie eventually returns to the Muppets since many of the Whatnots believe their show to be what performers do before something better comes along while Fozzie always saw what he does as what he is, but wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
