500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of the show were {{complimentary}} towards the finished episode. Carter said, [...] "I think that David, {{a person who has}} a very intimate understanding of the show, made the best of his opportunity to tell {{a very different kind of}} X-File, and expand the elastic show that it is." [...] Anderson was also pleased, saying, [...] "I was proud of David for writing the script.

500|$|Despite these failings, Strom was {{recognized}} as possessing a number of virtues: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind,</b> considerate, and honest. Most of all, he was humble: he had not sought the party leadership and notoriously asked after being repeatedly addressed as [...] "Premier" [...] at his first cabinet meeting why it could not [...] "just be plain 'Harry' anymore". When travelling to Ottawa, he stayed at the un-posh Skyline Hotel and ate meals in its basement cafeteria, where he ordered bread and pea soup for $0.25. [...] On final analysis, Barr concludes that this temperament, commendable though it may be, was unsuited to running the government of an emerging economic powerhouse.|$|E
500|$|As a physician, he was {{described}} as [...] "humane, never withholding his services from the poorest and humblest, and his unremitting and unrewarded efforts in behalf of the suffering [...] give him rank in a profession eminently benevolent."

500|$|During this period, Ochs {{was taking}} drugs {{to get through}} performances. He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, {{and he was also}} {{drinking}} heavily. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, [...] "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals aroundâ€”so many pills. I'd never seen anything like that." [...] Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

He had a lasting influence on the men who played for him. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> and considerate but demanding, too. He was a fine defensive basketball coach who believed in aggressive defensive fundamentals. In football, he was respected for what he knew and what he could do with his material." ...|$|E
500|$|Near the Oldenburg's estate, Ramon in Voronezh province, Olga {{had her own}} villa, called [...] "Olgino" [...] {{after the}} local town.

Her daughter-in-law later wrote, [...] "She tried to help every needy person as far as her strengths and means would permit." [...] At the hospital, she learned basic medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor. She exemplified her strong Orthodox faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to the charitable endeavours she supported.

500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you down. I think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E
500|$|Fifth-year senior Turner {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} uncontested starter at quarterback {{for the first time}} in his career. He was backed-up by sophomore Jamarr Robinson and true freshmen C. J. Brown and Danny O'Brien. Turner's {{seniority}} was called critical for the performance of the team's relatively youthful offensive line. Head coach Friedgen said, [...] "If I had to choose between a veteran offensive line and an inexperienced quarterback, or an inexperienced line with a veteran quarterback, I think I'd go with the veteran quarterback." [...] Upon the conclusion of preseason camp, the coaching staff praised his progress, particularly his game-planning, for which he had been criticized in the past. Turner said, [...] "Mentally, I am way further ahead than where I was last year." [...] Physically, he dropped 16 pounds by adding muscle and losing body fat, and weighed 220 pounds before the start of the season. Offensive coordinator Franklin said, [...] "You look at him, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of mushy last year. You look at him now and he's muscular and shaped. He looks more athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|Sargent's moral {{character}} attracted comment throughout his life. Early on, {{he developed a}} taste for luxury: Adrian Boult commented on his travelling to college by taxi, but Sargent rejoined, [...] "All the more room for you, Adrian, on the bus." [...] Despite Sargent's vanities and rivalries, he had many friends. Sir Thomas Armstrong in a 1994 broadcast interview stressed that Sargent [...] "had many good generous virtues; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> to many people, and I loved him...." [...] Nevertheless, even friends such as Sir Rupert Hart-Davis, Secretary of the Literary Society, considered him a [...] "bounder", and the composer-suffragette Dame Ethel Smyth called him a [...] "cad". Yet despite his philandering and ambition, Sargent was a deeply religious man all his life and was comforted on his deathbed by visits from the Anglican Archbishop of York, Donald Coggan and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Heenan. He also received calls from Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, and had a reconciliation with his son, Peter, from whom he had been estranged for a year.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after his}} {{departure}} from the British-Irish band One Direction, Zayn started working on his debut solo studio album; months later, on 22 July 2015, {{it was announced that}} Zayn was recording new music with record producer Malay Ho, after the producer posted a photo with the singer on his Instagram account. Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard [...] "Pillowtalk" [...] and [...] "Fool for You" [...] before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was [...] "incredible" [...] and agreed to work with him. The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malikâ€™s Beverly Hills Hotel room, {{and in the middle of}} the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a [...] "super creative, super free" [...] atmosphere. Zayn admitted that [...] "Heâ€™s just an amazing person. Like from the second I met him I just knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of different. He looks into every instrument in high detail and he understands how to break it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Continuing the band's {{policy of}} using names that would repulse {{potential}} listeners, the band named the album by using {{part of the}} phrase [...] "queer as a three dollar bill" [...] and adding the word [...] "Y'all" [...] for Florida flavor, naming the album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall. The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music. After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating [...] "The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile." [...] That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for Faith No More, a band often credited as {{paving the way for}} Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. The group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalled [...] "That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" [...] emulates {{the style}} of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song [...] "amplifies the noxious {{self-absorption}} of the American character to hilarious extremes" [...] by describing a narrator who, upon hearing {{about a number of}} horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. [...] Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told The A.V. Club: [...] "Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So he came in and knocked it out. I think thatâ€™s an F-Sharp, so <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of mad at me for that." [...] "Bob" [...] is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song's first line is [...] "I, man, am regalâ€”a German am I", which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song's lyrics [...] "sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan's nasal whine." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Genius in France", emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa's son, Dweezil performed the song's intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.|$|E

500|$|Billboard named Usher the Hot 100 Artist of the 2000s decade. Usher had {{the most}} no. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 charts with 7 and held the no. 1 {{position}} for a total 41 weeks. Confessions was ranked as the top solo album of the decade, selling 20 million copies worldwide. Considered by Bonsu Thompson of Vibe to be [...] "the Thriller of our generation", Damien Scott of Complex said it [...] "became pop culture catnip" [...] because of its theme. Pop music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker remarks that [...] "For a while, Confessions was pop music" [...] and says it [...] "may {{turn out to have}} been the last true blockbuster in pop". Clay Cane said in 2008 [...] "We didnâ€™t see pop-R artists on pop radio, and Usher is one of those people in the 90â€™s who was the catalyst for that; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of the pioneer [...] Heâ€™s the greatest example of pure crossover success". Regarded as the best dancer in pop since Michael Jackson by writers of VH1 and The Guardian, Jody Rosen said in 2012 [...] "He's the biggest male pop singer in the world; sometimes, it seems like he's the only one, in a marketplace still dominated by divas". Complex's Justin Charity referred to him as [...] "the greatest male pop singer of the past couple decades" [...] in 2015. He has attained 9 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, tied with the Bee Gees, Elton John, and Paul McCartney.|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospitalâ€”who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a manâ€”and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawedâ€”everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Squall was mixed. Journalist Jack Patrick Rodgers of PopMatters said that Squall's cynicism and frustration with {{those around him}} made him a strong character, but [...] "coldly inhuman". GamesRadar called Squall the fifth-best Final Fantasy hero of all time, praising the development of his personality and his improved interactions with other characters. GameZone rated him the fourth-best character in the franchise, saying that while fans [...] "either love or hate this guy" [...] he became the [...] "ultimate anti-hero" [...] (despite little dialogue) of an entertaining journey. The website called Squall and Rinoa the best couple created by Square Enix, noting the differences {{between them and the}} fact that their relationship was the first in the series to drive the plot of a game. They were on The Inquirers list of most-memorable video-game love teams, with comments again focused on the differences between them. GameSpot said that while Squall could be viewed as a [...] "jerk", he could also be seen as [...] "standoffish because of some repressed Wagnerian broodiness, in which case <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of interesting". Allgame said that they initially hated Squall, but although he originally seemed [...] "cold and uncaring", his romance changed him for the better. RPGamer called Squall [...] "everyone's favorite orphan" [...] and said that although he tries to distance himself from others, [...] "he can't help but draw people to him, be it sorceresses or gun-slinging ladies' men". GameDaily ranked him sixth on their list of the [...] "Top 25 Gaming Hunks", stating that while critics described the character as a [...] "jerk", his character design, notably his scar, made him visually appealing. Similarly, Den of Geek listed Squall {{as one of the most}} sexually appealing video game characters based on the design, most notably his scar. Arnold Katayev of PSXextreme praised Squall's redesign in Kingdom Hearts as the game's best. In a 2008 Oricon poll, Squall was voted the tenth-most-popular video-game character. He was voted the 29th-best video-game character by Famitsu readers in February 2010. Complex listed him as the one of the greatest Final Fantasy characters.|$|E
