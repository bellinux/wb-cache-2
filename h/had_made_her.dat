5|$|Less {{than three}} weeks after Mauna Loas charter, the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor {{propelled}} the United States into World War II. Mauna Loas movements {{over the next three}} months are unknown, but by mid-February 1942, she <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> way to Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.|$|E
5|$|Timothy Bloodworth <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> way to Augusta {{by early}} December {{when she was}} {{recorded}} making a roundtrip to Brindisi between 6 and 21 December. By early January 1944, she <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> way to Bizerta, and from there on 8 January for Naples, where she arrived three days later. The cargo ship sailed from that port on 29 January, touching at Augusta the next day, and then joining convoy GUS 29 for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Sources show Timothy Bloodworth arriving at Hampton Roads on 15 February but do not report any movements until early May, when she is shown sailing for Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The attacks {{influenced}} Hamasaki's lyrical {{and musical}} direction, and <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> decide {{to create more}} worldly-inspired music. The EP utilizes dance and pop music, with each song being influenced by pop rock, electronica, and trip hop music. Like Rainbow, it contains ambient-influenced sounds such as handclaps and cheering. The lyrical content deals with freedom, fun and sadness, continuing themes seen on her previous album.|$|E

5|$|Production of Tiga Dara {{began in}} 1956. Chitra Dewi, Mieke Wijaya, and Indriati Iskak were {{cast as the}} titular maidens. Dewi had {{previously}} appeared in Tamu Agung, and Wijaya <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> debut in the Palembang Film Corporation's Gagal (Fail) the previous year. Iskak, the 14-year-old daughter of film director Raden Iskak, made her feature film debut with Tiga Dara. Supporting roles were filled by Fifi Young, Rendra Karno, Hassan Sanusi, Bambang Irawan, and Roosilawaty. For the role of Joni, Ismail cast his real-life son, Irwan Usmar Ismail.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (née Jenyns, spelt Jennings in {{most modern}} references; 5 June 1660 (Old Style)– 18 October 1744) rose {{to be one}} of the most {{influential}} women of her time through her close friendship with Queen Anne of Great Britain. Sarah's friendship and influence with Princess Anne was widely known, and leading public figures often turned their attentions to her in the hope that she would influence Anne to comply with requests. As a result, by the time Anne became queen, Sarah’s knowledge of government, and intimacy with the Queen, <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a powerful friend and a dangerous enemy.|$|E

5|$|A third frigate {{was visible}} on the horizon. Emerald {{immediately}} set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The {{need to make the}} two captured frigates ready to sail delayed Leviathan, and by the time this was completed the third frigate <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> escape. Leviathan then returned to rendezvous with Emerald, managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.|$|E
5|$|After first {{arriving}} at Fort Crockett, Middleton adapted to garrison life while {{engaging in the}} Galveston social scene by attending Saturday night dances in town. At one such dance he had a navy lieutenant introduce him to Jerusha Collins, who would later become his wife. She had attended Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas and <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> debut in Galveston society in 1911. Following {{the death of her}} father, Sidney G. Collins, Jerusha had come to live with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. John Hagemann, in the heart of Galveston. As a merchant, Hagemann was well to do, and drove a Studebaker touring car when most people in the town rode in buggies, wagons, and surreys. Middleton met the Hagemanns, soon becoming a regular visitor at their house while calling on Jerusha.|$|E
5|$|The {{king and}} queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the {{submissive}} role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534, he saw her failure {{to give him a}} son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine. Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with Margaret ("Madge") Shelton in 1535, although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton.|$|E

5|$|West Nohno <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> way to Hampton Roads, Virginia, by 29 May, {{when she}} sailed for Key West, Florida. After her 4 June arrival at Key West, she began a nine-month journey to Alexandria, Cairo, and other ports. During this {{extended}} voyage, three crewmen entered one of West Nohnos fuel tanks {{to clean it}} while the ship was at Suez on 29 September 1942. The crewmen did not use gas masks and were soon overcome by fumes. The second mate of the Norwegian tanker Britannia, Henning Vaagsnes, entered the tank and removed all three men. Two of West Nohnos men survived but the third, despite two hours of attempts to revive him by Vaagsnes, did not. For his efforts, Vaagsnes received {{a pair of binoculars}} from U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and a gold watch from the ship owners. He was also awarded St. Olav's medal with Oak Branch, a medal awarded for personal courage and bravery by the Norwegian government.|$|E
5|$|In August 1899, Gellibrand easily {{passed the}} {{examinations}} for promotion to captain, but was {{passed over for}} the post of adjutant of the 2nd Battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment, then based in St Helens, Merseyside. In October the post became vacant again, {{and this time he}} secured it. The South African War had broken out, and the 2nd Battalion embarked for South Africa on 30 November, but Gellibrand was left behind, in charge of the regimental depot. He eventually received orders to embark for South Africa with reinforcements on 3 January 1900. He arrived in South Africa on 25 January 1900. Soon after, he was given command of D Company. As such he participated in the relief of Ladysmith, leading a bayonet charge on 27 February. His company entered the town on 3 March. Five days later he became ill with typhoid, and lay in a comatose state until 3 April. He was joined in Durban by Elsie, who <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> way out to South Africa with Cecil Rhodes, and they embarked for England together on 26 May, arriving at Southampton on 18 June.|$|E
5|$|While escaping, Jack and Joanna are {{attacked}} by a dataDyne assault team assisted by Killian in a dropship. Joanna manages to kill Killian and escape with Sekhar, but Jack is captured by dataDyne. With the help of Sekhar, Joanna learns that her father has been taken to a mansion in China, where Zhang Li lives. Joanna infiltrates the mansion and finds her father in a cell. He has been tortured, and begins speaking gibberish to her, an after effect of the neurodrive. The pair fights {{their way out of}} the complex, but their extraction is interrupted by Zhang Li's daughter, Mai Hem, who kills Jack before Joanna escapes in a hovercraft. Joanna and Sekhar decide to pursue Zeigler's lead and seek out Dr. Caroll, who works aboard a research platform on the Pacific Ocean. Upon meeting with Joanna, Dr. Caroll uses a neurodrive to extract Zeigler's data from Joanna's memory, which she gained when she rescued her father. Soon after, Sekhar betrays Joanna and shoots Dr. Caroll, revealing that she decided to join dataDyne because Zhang Li <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a large offer. A team of Carrington Institute agents saves Joanna, but Sekhar ultimately escapes with the data.|$|E
