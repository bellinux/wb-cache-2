5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they {{practically}} become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an aspirational undercurrent to the lyrics, and like many of their subsequent songs, <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> explicitly linked to ambition–"Free your mind of doubt and danger/Be for real don't be a stranger/We can achieve it/We can achieve it".|$|E

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that beliefs and <b>desires</b> <b>are</b> to be conceived as dis-positional mental states. This means that beliefs {{are to be}} understood as what may lead one to action given a desire, and that <b>desire</b> <b>are</b> what may lead one to action given beliefs. But this way of understanding beliefs and desire...|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} {{because they believe that}} the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E
5|$|Soma ascends to the castle's {{keep and}} confronts Graham in the throne room. Although Soma's sole <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> {{to leave the}} castle, Graham is {{convinced}} that Soma must be killed for absorbing {{the souls of the}} castle's monsters. Soma manages to defeat Graham, even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form. As Graham falls in defeat, Soma absorbs his powers, and realizes he is Dracula's reincarnation. Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of chaos into the castle. Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm, but Julius attacks him, believing that Soma is Dracula. Julius allows Soma to defeat him, as he sensed Soma's soul fighting against Dracula's influence. Before he leaves, Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula. Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of chaos. Soma manages to defeat the manifestation of chaos and is sent congratulations by Yoko, Hammer, Julius, and Arikado. Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina, pleased that the conflict is over.|$|E
25|$|If <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> repressed, it {{is because}} every {{position}} of desire, no matter how small, is capable of calling into question the established order of a society: not that <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> asocial, on the contrary. But it is explosive; there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors. Despite what some revolutionaries think about this, <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> revolutionary in its essence — desire, not left-wing holidays! — and no society can tolerate a position of real desire without its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy being compromised.|$|E

25|$|A Streetcar Named <b>Desire</b> <b>is</b> a 1947 play {{written by}} American playwright Tennessee Williams that {{received}} the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1948. The play opened on Broadway on December 3, 1947, and closed on December 17, 1949, in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. The Broadway production {{was directed by}} Elia Kazan and starred Jessica Tandy, Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, and Kim Hunter. The London production opened in 1949 with Bonar Colleano, Vivien Leigh, and Renee Asherson and was directed by Laurence Olivier. The drama A Streetcar Named <b>Desire</b> <b>is</b> often regarded as among the finest plays of the 20th century, and {{is considered by many}} to be Williams' greatest.|$|E

25|$|For Schopenhauer, Will had ontological primacy {{over the}} intellect; in other words, <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> {{understood}} to be prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of puruṣārtha or goals of life in Vedānta Hinduism.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{format of}} the <b>Desire</b> syndicated program <b>was</b> for three telenovelas to run with different titles. The <b>Desire</b> name <b>was</b> intended as an umbrella for all the separate telenovelas within.

Not once had they kissed. Love was gone. They would never yearn and burn again. For them there was nothing left--no more tremblings and flutterings and delicious anguishes, no more {{throbbing}} and pulsing, and sighing and song. <b>Desire</b> <b>was</b> dead. It had died in the night, on a couch cold and unattended; nor had they witnessed its passing. They learned {{it for the first time}} in each other's eyes.|$|R
25|$|Lacan's {{concept of}} <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> related to Hegel's Begierde, {{a term that}} implies a {{continuous}} force, and therefore somehow differs from Freud's concept of Wunsch. Lacan's desire refers always to unconscious desire because it is unconscious desire that forms the central concern of psychoanalysis.|$|E

25|$|It {{is through}} the will that mankind finds all their suffering. Desire for more is what causes this suffering. He argues that only {{aesthetic}} pleasure creates momentary escape from the Will. Although the concept of desire {{may be influenced by}} Buddhist teachings, it should not be treated as direct reference since <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> not thought to be the fundamental nature of human beings in Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{the sexual}} {{education}} {{perspective of the}} discourse of <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> very rare in U.S. high schools. This perspective encourages adolescents {{to learn more about}} their desires, gaining pleasure and feeling confident in their sexualities. Researchers state that this view would empower girls because it would place less emphasis on them as the victims and encourage them to have more control over their sexuality.|$|E

25|$|Sex {{drive is}} {{dependent}} on androgen levels only {{in the presence of}} estrogen, but without estrogen, free testosterone level actually decreases sexual desire (instead of increases sex drive), as demonstrated for those women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and the sexual desire in these women can be restored by administration of estrogen (using oral contraceptive). In non-human mammals, mating <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> triggered by estrogen surge in estrus.|$|E
25|$|Title ix, Of the Education of Youth.-(i) Of parish schools. Teachers {{belonging}} to religious congregations should be employed when possible in our schools.

25|$|In a 2004 study, {{the female}} {{subjects}} (both gay and straight women) became sexually aroused when they viewed heterosexual and lesbian erotic films.

The study's senior researcher said that women's sexual <b>desire</b> <b>is</b> less rigidly directed toward a particular sex, as compared with men's, and it is more changeable over time.|$|E
