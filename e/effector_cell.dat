2500|$|One {{possible}} {{treatment for}} cancer involves monoclonal antibodies that bind only to cancer cell-specific antigens and induce an immune response against the target cancer cell. Such mAbs {{can be modified}} for delivery of a toxin, radioisotope, cytokine or other active conjugate or to design bispecific antibodies that can bind with their Fab regions both to target antigen and to a conjugate or <b>effector</b> <b>cell.</b> Every intact antibody can bind to cell receptors or other proteins with its Fc region.|$|E
2500|$|Like the T cell, B cells {{express a}} unique B cell {{receptor}} (BCR), in this case, a membrane-bound antibody molecule. All the BCR {{of any one}} clone of B cells recognizes and binds to only one particular antigen. A critical difference between B cells and T cells is how each cell [...] "sees" [...] an antigen. T cells recognize their cognate antigen in a processed form – as a peptide {{in the context of}} an MHC molecule, whereas B cells recognize antigens in their native form. Once a B cell encounters its cognate (or specific) antigen (and receives additional signals from a helper T cell (predominately Th2 type)), it further differentiates into an <b>effector</b> <b>cell,</b> known as a plasma cell.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of intact influenza virus and purified detergent solubilized haemagglutinin (HA) subunits from these viruses on human natural killer (NK) cell activity was examined. <b>Effector</b> <b>cells</b> incubated with whole influenza virus for 18 hr initiated {{the production of}} alpha interferon which {{was associated with the}} enhancement of NK cell activity. In contrast, purified influenza virus HA suppressed NK activity in a dose-dependent manner, when added {{at the onset of the}} cytotoxicity assay, or when used to pre-treated <b>effector</b> <b>cells</b> prior to assay for cytotoxicity against K 562 target <b>cells.</b> <b>Effector</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to influenza HA for 90 min, washed and re-incubated in fresh medium for up to 18 hr, failed to regain their cytotoxicity. Suppression of NK cell cytotoxicity could not be ascribed to direct toxicity of HA preparations or residual detergent and preservative in these preparations. The augmented cytotoxicity of activated human <b>effector</b> <b>cells</b> was also susceptible to suppression by virus HA, and pretreatment of human PBL <b>effector</b> <b>cells</b> with HA for 90 min, prior to exposure to human alpha interferon caused NK <b>effector</b> <b>cells</b> to become refractive to the enhancing effects of HIFN.

Listeria-specific <b>effector</b> <b>cells</b> generated after in vitro culture of normal spleen cells with viable L. monocytogenes for 5 days conveyed L 3 T 4 +, Lyt- 2 -, Thy- 1 + surface antigens and produced MCF and MAF in response to the secondary stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes. The cells required for the induction of Listeria-specific <b>effector</b> <b>cells,</b> which produce <b>effector</b> lymphokines, MCF and MAF, were L 3 T 4 +, Lyt- 2 -, Thy- 1 + cells.

The suppressed cytotoxic response was accompanied by impairment of cytotoxic cell activities and lack, or very low level of anti-FI antibodies in the sera of animals during the establishment phase of infection.
