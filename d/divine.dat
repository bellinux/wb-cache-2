5|$|The <b>divines</b> {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians.

With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the <b>divines</b> became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The <b>divines</b> were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians.

5|$|Humans had {{free will}} to ignore <b>divine</b> {{guidance}} {{and the behavior}} required by maat, but by doing so they could bring <b>divine</b> punishment upon themselves.

Natural disasters and human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry <b>divine</b> bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent <b>divine</b> rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, <b>divine</b> wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of <b>divine</b> grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a <b>divine</b> revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the <b>divine</b> guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to <b>divine</b> guidance.|$|E

40|$|Apollo {{landing sites}} and {{returned}} soils afford us {{a unique opportunity}} to "ground truth" <b>Diviner</b> Lunar Radiometer compositional observations, which are the first global, high resolution, thermal infrared measurements of an airless body. The Moon is the most accessible member of the most abundant class of solar system objects, which includes Mercury, asteroids, and icy satellites. And the Apollo samples returned from the Moon are the only extraterrestrial samples with known spatial context. Here we compare <b>Diviner</b> observations of Apollo landing sites and compositional and spectral laboratory measurements of returned Apollo soils. <b>Diviner,</b> onboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, has three spectral channels near 8 micron that were designed to characterize the mid-infrared emissivity maximum known as the Christiansen feature (CF), a well-studied indicator of silicate mineralogy. It has been observed that thermal infrared spectra measured in simulated lunar environment (SLE) are significantly altered from spectra measured under terrestrial or martian conditions, with enhanced CF contrast and shifted CF position relative to other spectral features. Therefore only thermal emission experiments conducted in SLE are directly comparable to <b>Diviner</b> data. With known compositions, Apollo landing sites and soils are important calibration points for the <b>Diviner</b> dataset, which includes all six Apollo sites at approximately 200 m spatial resolution. Differences in measured CFs caused by composition and space weathering are apparent in <b>Diviner</b> data. Analyses of <b>Diviner</b> observations and SLE measurements for a range of Apollo soils show good agreement, while comparisons to thermal reflectance measurements under ambient conditions do not agree well, which underscores the need for SLE measurements and validates our measurement technique. <b>Diviner</b> observations of Apollo landing sites are also correlated with geochemical measurements of Apollo soils from the Lunar Sample Compendium. In particular, the correlations between CF and FeO and AI 203 are very strong, owing to the dependence on the feldspar-mafic ratio. Our analyses suggest that <b>Diviner</b> data may offer an independent measure of soil iron content from the existing optical and gamma-ray spectrometer datasets...|$|R

Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the <b>divine,</b> transcendent reality.
