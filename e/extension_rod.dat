40|$|ABSTRACT: Conventional {{resonant}} bar tests {{allow the}} measurement of seismic properties of rocks and sediments at low frequencies (several kilohertz). However, the tests require a long, slender sample which {{is often difficult to}} obtain from the deep subsurface and weak and fractured formations.

This technique involves a jacketed core sample placed between a pair of long, metal <b>extension</b> <b>rods</b> with attached seismic source and receiver—the same geometry as the split Hopkinson pressure bar test for large-strain, dynamic impact experiments. Because of the added length and mass to the sample, the resonance frequency of the entire system can be lowered significantly, compared to the sample alone.

Then, numerical inversions for the compressional and shear wave velocities and attenuation are performed.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated rotary percussive drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded <b>extension</b> <b>rod</b> is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded <b>extension</b> <b>rod</b> to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface.

40|$|Automatic {{control of}} {{machines}} often requires a signal {{proportional to the}} <b>rod</b> <b>extension</b> of a hydraulic cylinder.

Acceleration signals of the cylinder were processed using several methods to compute the extension. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method could not produce accurate results for a moving cylinder due to the interrelation of resolution and sample time inherent in the method.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPost-traumatic total knee {{arthroplasty}} for extra-articular malunion requires {{correction of}} the deformity, either through asymmetrical bone resection (possibly inducing ligaments imbalance) or osteotomy {{at the time}} of arthroplasty. We report the results of a continuous multicenter, retrospective series of 78 patients (18 implants with osteotomy) with a mean 4 years of follow-up. The hypothesis is that the selected procedure requires {{to be based on the}} deformity's location and severity. PatientsWith a mean age of 63 years (younger in the osteotomy group), 38 patients had femoral malunion, 36 had tibial malunion, and four had a combined malunion. There were 70 frontal deformities (48 varus and 22 valgus) and 10 rotational deformities, often diaphyseal, four of which more than 20 °. Twelve patients had a history of infection; eight had frontal laxity greater than 10 °, and 15 a limited range of motion in flexion. In 70 cases, semi- or nonconstrained implants were used, and in eight cases more constrained implants, including four hinge prostheses. ResultsWe observed two deep infections, one case of avulsion of the extensor mechanism, and two cases of aseptic loosening with femoral malunion and varus deformity. Two osteotomies resulted in nonunion, one with internal fixation devices mobilization requiring revision using <b>extension</b> <b>rods.</b> The function and pain scores were significantly improved. The mobility improvements were moderate but did not compromise the surgical procedure main objective. The preoperative hip-knee angle was corrected with both techniques. Only the function score gain was greater for the isolated arthroplasty procedures. Discussion and conclusionThe indications for arthroplasty alone were extended to 20 ° varus and 15 ° valgus, with no major residual laxity. Beyond 10 °, hinge prosthesis should be available. Associated osteotomy can correct rotational deformities that cannot be compensated with bone cuts. In deformities that are close to the joint, osteotomy facilitates implantation of moderately constrained prosthesis. This indication is based on CAT scan rotational deformities measurements because rotational deformities require an osteotomy, and/or the presence of extraligamentous deformity that cannot be reduced with collateral ligaments surgical release.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{topology}} optimization has undergone an enormous practical development since {{the appearance of}} the paper by Bendsøe and Kikuchi (1988), where some ideas from homogenization theory were put into practice.

Using absolute coordinates, the mass and constraint matrices are sparse and this sparsity may be exploited to speed-up time integration.

40|$|The {{study and}} {{prediction}} of the transverse vibration {{properties of the}} hydraulic cylinder {{can play an important}} role in applications such as feedback control systems, condition monitoring and fault diagnostics. Being a structure with varying geometry, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the hydraulic actuator are functions of the <b>rod</b> <b>extension.</b> The hydraulic actuator is modeled analytically as beams with end masses separated by seals which are modeled as springs. Two analytical models are derived for an air-filled cylinder using free-free boundary conditions. The first model assumes that the cylinder components are rigid. Using the Lagrange 2 ̆ 7 s equations, this 2 ̆ 2 rigid 2 ̆ 2 model is intended to obtain the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the first mode. The second model takes into account the flexibility of the barrel and the rod. Using the Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s principle, the model was used to obtain the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the first three deflection modes. A variation of the second model is studied to consider the effect of the oil mass in the natural frequencies of the hydraulic cylinders. An experimental modal analysis was performed on four air-filled and oil-filled hydraulic cylinders at several <b>rod</b> <b>extensions</b> to validate the models. Although the experimental mode shape of the first deflection mode looked like a rigid mode, the rod beam is deflecting inside the cylinder making the rigid model unsuitable for predicting its transverse vibration properties. The elastic model, in addition of providing a better approximation of the natural frequencies, it gives an insight of the mode shape of the rod inside the cylinder barrel. For the hydraulic cylinders studied, the error between the analytical and experimental natural frequencies was smaller for air filled cylinders. Although the modified elastic model improved the prediction of the natural frequencies of oil-filled cylinders by a few Hertz, it seems that the effect of the oil mass is not the only factor affecting the modal properties. The new understanding of the transverse vibration properties of the hydraulic cylinder may help to facilitate future research in vibration control of hydraulic machinery, structural condition monitoring, design of hydraulic cylinders, and other applications. ...|$|R

Despite an overall reduction of all dystrophin isoforms and of β-dystroglycan in retinal tissue from mutant mice, we observed no apparent change in the histotypic layering of the retina, or in the ultrastructure of several specific cell types, including rods and cones. In retinae from wild type and mdx 3 Cv mice, dystrophin and β-dystroglycan were concentrated in small <b>extensions</b> of <b>rod</b> and cone photoreceptor terminals protruding into the outer plexiform layer.

The same parameters were much less affected in cone terminals. These results show, that dystrophin and β-dystroglycan are differentially distributed in the retina, and that a severe reduction of dystrophin has no gross effect on retinal structure, but could influence intraretinal signalling at the level of the photoreceptor terminals.

When varying the composition of the surrounding nucleotides or removing the negatively charged -COOH termini of the MTs by subtilisin digestion, we found no significant changes in the measured distance.

40|$|International audienceA planar rod {{model with}} {{flexible}} cross-section {{has been proposed}} and discussed recently in literature (Guinot et al., 2012; Picault et al., 2014). This 1 D model is especially suitable for the modeling of tape springs, which develop localized folds through the flattening of the cross-section, and represents a good alternative to 2 D shell models which are numerically hard to perform. However, due to its planar nature, it {{does not account for}} the coupling between bending and twisting that is noticed experimentally. In this context, we propose an <b>extension</b> of this <b>rod</b> model to 3 D motions that includes torsional warping of the cross-section, based on postulated assumptions that are approximations. Starting from a complete non-linear elastic shell model, we introduce an original kinematics inspired from the elastica model and from Vlassov’s theory (Vlassov, 1962) in order to describe in-plane and out-of-plane changes of the cross-section shape with few parameters. In the specific case of shallow tape springs, approximate expressions of the strain and kinetic energies are derived by performing an analytical integration over the cross-section. The 1 D tape spring rod model eventually involves only eight kinematic variables: seven to describe the translation and the rotation of the cross-section (parameterized by a unit quaternion) and one for the shape of the cross-section which is assumed to remain circular. Expressions of the potential and kinetic energies are then introduced in a suitable finite element software that can perform an automatic differentiation to solve the problem. Two static cases are treated. The first one, a tape spring clamped at one end and submitted at the other end to a follower twisting moment, shows that the model account for the bending-twisting couplings in large displacements and large rotations. The second one, a novel test named the transverse bending test, illustrates the ability of the model to account for complex scenarios of 3 D foldings, involving bending and twisting as well as the creation of folds, their migration along the tape and their duplication. Quantitative comparisons to numerical results obtained with a shell finite element model are shown...|$|R

Preliminary planning for the initiation of a dynamic structural analyses of the overall steam generator was completed. External pressure loading and thermal stress calculations show that the calandria has a suitable design margin. A revised fuel latch operable from the rear face of the core was designed. A study was initiated to determine the feasibility of substituting Zircaloy for the stainless steel tubing within the active core. Preliminary sizing of control <b>rod</b> <b>extensions</b> and gang plates was completed. Initial loading of the second configuration of the 630 A critical experiment reactor was completed. Detailed power distributions were measured in the 11 typical positions. Subcritical and critical rod worth curves were obtained in the critical experiment with up to 132 shim rods in the core. Moderator temperature coefficient measurements were made and agreed well with analytical data. Critical experiment correlation of fine radial power calculations in the revised mock-up showed good agreement. Performance specifications were prepared for a 1 -Mw(e) power plant. Parametric thermal analyses, based on various tube sheet thicknesses and heating rates, were completed for {{the top and bottom}} tube sheets.

Studies were performed to determine the size of the port openings needed to prevent buckling in the containmert vessel in the event of ship sinking. A blower shaft static seal was built and tested with satisfactory results. Manufacture and procurement of all parts for two developmental dynamic rod actuators were completed. The two-tube boiler was modified and operated satisfactorily on automatic control down to 20 percent power. A reactor control system that meets response and accuracy requirements was simulated on the analog computer. Investigation of a possible test site for power testing the prototype reactor was continued with cost estimates and a facility layout drawing being made for the IET facility at ITS. Specimen ORF- 4 was removed from test after 4800 hours of actual operation at 1300 deg F, equivalent to approximately 15, 000 hours of full- power 630 A operation. An estimated 40 percent burnup of the /sup 235 /U atoms occurred. Creep tests on warm-finished fuel sheet have accumulated more than 12, 000 hours at 630 A stress and temperature conditions with no greater than 0. 75 percent plastic creep. Cladding-stock creep tests have surpassed 15, 000 hours at various combinations of stress and temperature with satisfactory results. (auth...|$|R
