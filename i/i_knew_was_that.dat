500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, all <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, she {{released}} [...] "Jikele" [...] as the album's third single. Motherland was {{revealed to be}} a 12-track album and when asked why is it taking so long? she commented [...] "One needs to take one's time because good work takes time. But it must be worth the wait in the end." [...] At the 4th City People Awards, 14 July 2013, she lost South South Musician of the Year to fellow Rivers State recording artist Oba Omega; present at the occasion were the celebrities Rita Dominic and Yvonne Nelson from Ghana. Muma Gee competed in the first Imo State intercommunity beauty pageant, representing the community of Umuhu in Ngor Okpala. She came into the competition through her matrimonial union with Eke, whose heritage stems from the Umuhu people. On 1 August 2013, she was named Mrs. Ngor Okpala by first lady of Imo State, Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha, after beating off challenges from 28 other entrants. It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio. On 15 February 2014, whilst heavily pregnant with her first child, she confirmed {{in a telephone interview}} with Saturday Beats of The Punch that she will be performing at the album launch party for Motherland regardless of her physical condition. On 18 April, just weeks before the anticipated concert, Uwame delivered twins – {{a boy and a girl}} commenting on this Uwame said, [...] "I was not initially expecting twins. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I started getting big and bigger. And people would see me and say, oh, you are looking so beautiful. I didn't believe I was going to have twins." ...|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. Well, all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> {{told her}} the mine was {{probably}} a frost she went for me like steam.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{the least}} idea. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> a very clever fellow and never seems very {{confident}} about anything without good reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> {{have never}} drunk {{more than a}} teaspoonful at once. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want it. Don't get it at the Falcon.' ...|$|R
60|$|All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{he disliked}} me {{and had some}} {{contempt}} for my person. Why? Apparently because his ship had been delayed three hours on my account. Who was I {{to have such a}} thing done for me? Such a thing had never been done for him. It was a sort of jealous indignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next thing}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I awoke {{in the house}} of the White Witch and saw you {{sleeping}} at my side and the Witch leaning back upon her bed and smiling at me through the thin blanket with which she covers herself up, for I could see the laughter in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{paid for}} it. It {{was two years}} and over before I knew what happened. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I was Julian Jones and that I'd been blacklisted in the big strike, and that I was married to Sarah here. I mean that. I didn't know {{anything}} in between, and when Sarah tried to talk about it, it gave me pains in the head. I mean my head was queer, and I knew it was queer.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she didn't {{blame you}} at all. She blamed herself {{for what had}} happened, only herself. I had it from her own lips." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{bridge was}} built in the time of Robert Bruce, by one Bishop Cheyne, of whom all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> he evidently had a good eye for the picturesque.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} question," [...] grumbled Zikali {{in a deep}} voice. [...] "All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> done by poisoning, and I smell the poison. It is here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why couldn't {{you leave}} the cat alone?" [...] I shouted at him in idiotic remonstrance, for my brain had gone, and all <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{we were about to}} be thrown into the fiery pit. Already I was over it; I felt the flames singe my hair and saw its red caverns {{awaiting}} me, when of a sudden the brutal hands that held me were unloosed and I fell backwards to the ground, where I lay staring upwards.|$|E
6000|$|Pere Lenegre nodded: [...] "I {{only heard}} it this morning," [...] he said, [...] "from {{one or two}} {{threatening}} words the treacherous brute let fall. He knows that you lodge in the Place des Trois Maries, and that you come here frequently. I would have given my life to warn you then and there," [...] continued the old man with touching earnestness, [...] "but I didn't {{know where to find}} you. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> you were looking after Pierre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Aphrodite, or by Isis, {{or both of}} them I did not know. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I {{must seek}} him, then and evermore, as seek I do to-day and shall perchance through æons yet unborn. So I followed, as I was taught and commanded, the sistrum being my guide, how it matters not, and giving me the means, and so at last I came to this ancient land whereof the ruin in which you sit was once known as Kôr." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> where. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he once {{mentioned}} casually {{in one of}} {{his letters}} <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> going to Buenos Ayres, where he had some property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>know,</b> Pambasa. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{weary of}} this foolishness, {{and of the}} world. Tell me of {{something}} that will lighten my heart, for it is heavy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course, our midnight soup has its critics,' {{said one}} of the Officers who has charge of its distribution; 'but all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it saves many from jumping into the river.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{replied that}} I was innocent, but that I {{would wait for}} legal {{assistance}} before I defended myself. The justice remanded me and the examination was over. Three days later my unhappy mistress was subjected to the same trial. I {{was not allowed to}} communicate with her. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the lawyer had arrived from London to help her. Toward the evening he was admitted to see me. He shook his head sorrowfully when I asked after my mistress.|$|E
60|$|My {{quotation}} {{was hardly}} {{out of my}} lips before we had rounded the corner above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to Sanjowlie. In {{the centre of the}} level road stood the black and white liveries, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington. I pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe must have said something. The next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I was lying face downward on the road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} know that, of course," [...] {{asserted}} Nimmie Amee. [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> neither of you came to marry me, as you had promised to do. But men are not scarce in the Land of Oz. After I came here to live, I met Mr. Chopfyt, {{and he was the}} more interesting because he reminded me strongly of both of you, as you were before you became tin. He even had a tin arm, and that reminded me of you the more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{criticism}} of her singing sounds more sincere than your admiration of her loveliness. I am not musician enough to judge. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her singing <b>is</b> {{good enough for}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell," [...] {{returned}} Richard. [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{many who}} have no mercy on her would change their minds if they beheld her patient and kindly demeanour to all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{make that}} fellow out," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Never could. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if Hilary Vane pulls us through this mess, {{in the shape}} he's in, it'll be a miracle.|$|R
60|$|Here {{and there}} they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that great gulf they had made, {{overtaken}} by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time this death was incomprehensible. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then how did ye {{expect me}} to know what orders ye'd given?" [...] Mr. Blood's tone was {{positively}} aggrieved. [...] "All that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> one of your slaves was being murthered by {{the sun and the}} flies. And I says to myself, {{this is one of the}} Colonel's slaves, and I'm the Colonel's doctor, and sure it's my duty to be looking after the Colonel's property. So I just gave the fellow a spoonful of water and covered his back from the sun. And wasn't I right now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I did {{not exactly}} levitate, but {{something}} or someone {{seemed to get}} a hold of me, and I was just rushed along in a most tumultuous fashion. The next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I was standing at the door of that sepulchre, though I have no recollection of going up in the lift, or whatever it is. I believe those beastly caves are full of ghosts, or devils, and the worst of it is that they have kept my solar-tope, which I put on this morning forgetting that it would be useless there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she <b>is</b> living {{somewhere in}} Raynham, {{and last week}} there was a paper here to say <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> in want {{of the means of}} fitting out her son for India.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be proved," [...] I {{answered}} cautiously. [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> a wonderfully learned person of most remarkable appearance, and <b>that</b> his daughter <b>is</b> the loveliest creature I ever saw." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," [...] said I; [...] "all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> Queequeg here <b>is</b> a born member of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{admit that}} the old Berserk blood of the Smiths boiled at that juncture. I picked up a sleep-producer from the floor, as Comrade Brady would say, {{and handed it to}} the big-stick merchant. He went down like a sack of coal over the bookcase, and at that moment I rather fancy the other gentleman must have got busy with his club. At any rate, {{somebody}} suddenly loosed off some fifty thousand dollars' worth of fireworks, and the next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the curtain had risen for the next act on me, discovered sitting in a prison cell, with an out-size in lumps on my forehead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} struggle, {{but he seemed}} to hold me as if I were in a vice. I heard Alice scream, and then I must have fainted; for the next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I was being carried along on horseback. I was so muffled up, and he held me so tight, that I felt it was no use to struggle; and I made up my mind to lie quite still, as if I was still insensible, till he put me down; and then--I think I {{intended}} to try and seize his pistol, or to get hold of a knife, if there was one and, if I could not kill him, to kill myself.|$|E
60|$|A {{week later}} {{he hired a}} man to make several dozen square yards of trellis-work to put {{around the back of}} his hut, that his women-folk might be {{screened}} from the public gaze. The man went away in the evening, and left his day's work to pave the short cut from the public road to my house. I was driving home in the dusk, and turned the corner by Naboth's Vineyard quickly. The next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the horses of the phaeton were stamping and plunging in the strongest sort of bamboo net-work. Both beasts came down. One rose with nothing more than chipped knees. The other was so badly kicked that I was forced to shoot him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Elizabeth,--"no. <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> him. <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> him. There <b>is</b> something.... But <b>I</b> don't <b>know.</b> All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> him." [...] Her {{face was}} a face of {{infinite}} distress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that <b>I</b> do not <b>know.</b> Some corporation, perhaps, or some hospital. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not. <b>That</b> he {{has told}} me quite plainly. And he was very right to do so," [...] added George, after a pause.|$|R
5000|$|I {{never saw}} a written order, Herr Hauptmann. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Heydrich said to me: [...] "The Führer has ordered the {{physical}} extermination of the Jews." [...] He said that as clearly and surely as I'm repeating it now.|$|R
