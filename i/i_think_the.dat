5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|You know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Triton kind of, I {{think was}} a spur for that routine as I think back. Because I then {{imagined}} what a trip {{like that would}} have been like with a totally incompetent commander, and the cruise of USS Codfish was the final result.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

5|$|I think it's {{something}} that is so unique about Rihanna whatever she's doing, whatever character she's playing, whatever side of herself she's showing, she's in it 1,000 percent... And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> song and {{the theme of this}} song, she wanted to obviously show a softer side, a lighter side, one that's caught in maybe a tumultuous relationship... There's so much variety with her and it's been such a journey with her.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know it is. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

5|$|Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of}} race {{has been so}} {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
25|$|There {{were a lot}} of very {{important}} ideas that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> mainstream media couldn't handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls who were wearing barrettes in their hair or writing 'slut' on their stomach.|$|E

25|$|To me {{the ideal}} film— which I've never succeeded in making— {{would be as}} though the reel were behind one's eyes and you were {{projecting}} it yourself, seeing what you wish to see.

25|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{the highest level}} of scholarship in Cherniss’s book Aristotle’s Criticism of Plato and the Academy, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> influence of this book has been largely baleful. Vlastos’s review in Gnomon inadvertently made matters worse … The divergence in the work of much European and North American Plato scholarship since 1950 can be traced, I believe, to the respect paid or not paid to Aristotle’s testimony about Plato’s philosophy.|$|E

25|$|First of all, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{country is}} in deep trouble. We, as a country have blazed unimagined trails technologically and industrially.

25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand.

25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents.
