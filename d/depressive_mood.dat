The bands play with very slow tempos and melodic tones, creating an atmosphere of darkness and melancholia.

Notable bands include Reverend Bizarre, Minotauri, Dolorian, Shape of Despair, Thergothon, Skepticism and Unholy.|$|E
25|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder: Spanish researchers analysed the diets of 12,059 {{people over}} six years and found those who ate the most trans fats had a 48 per cent higher risk of depression {{than those who did}} not eat trans fats. One mechanism may be trans-fats' substitution for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Very high intake of trans-fatty acids (43% of total fat) in mice from 2 to 16 months of age was associated with lowered DHA levels in the brain (p=0.001). When the brains of 15 major depressive subjects who had committed suicide were examined post-mortem and compared against 27 age-matched controls, the suicidal brains were found to have 16% less (male average) to 32% less (female average) DHA in the OFC. The OFC controls reward, reward expectation, and empathy (all of which are reduced in <b>depressive</b> <b>mood</b> disorders) and regulates the limbic system.|$|E

40|$|On {{a sample}} of 180 pupils (90 boys, 90 girls) of Grammar school Kočevje a {{frequency}} of depressive symptoms among adolescents has been researched {{as well as the}} impact of gender, learning achievements and age on a depressive reaction phenomenon. A <b>Depressive</b> <b>Moods</b> Scale (Vesel, 1999) has been used, which is very reliable (0, 93). A factor analysis has shown that it measures one common factor - depressive reactions, which illustrate 31 % variance. It has been established that one third of pupils are experiencing depressive symptoms frequently or very frequently. Disappointment with oneself because of one&# 39;s own mistakes is the most frequent, then concentration difficulties and rambling of thoughts, which have been frequently or very frequently experienced by 40 % of pupils. Among five groups of depressive symptoms, cognitive and emotional ones are the most frequent. A high score on the <b>Depressive</b> <b>Moods</b> Scale has been achieved by 10 % of boys and 32 % of girls included in our sample, which shows that girls have more difficulties in experiencing depressive reactions, while learning achievements as well as age do not seem to have any impact on differences in experiencing depressive reactions...|$|R

In contrast, some caregivers report lower levels of strain in recurrence than with the initial cancer, presumably because they had adapted to the stress of chronic illness.|$|R

A total of 150 subjects representing 3 different S. E. S levels were given the “My Memories of Upbringing”, Children Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory tests.

50|$|Death-doom is {{an extreme}} subgenre of heavy metal.

Fifty-five mothers and their young clinic-referred children served as Ss. Mothers completed depression and child perception measures and mother-child interactions were observed in the home. A path analysis indicated that the model was a good fit to the data as maternal depression was associated with perceptions of child maladjustment and with parenting behavior which was itself associated with child behavior...|$|R
50|$|The General Behavior Inventory (GBI) is a 73-question {{psychological}} self-report {{assessment tool}} designed by Richard Depue and colleagues {{to identify the}} presence and severity of manic and <b>depressive</b> <b>moods</b> in adults, {{as well as to}} assess for cyclothymia. It {{is one of the most}} widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of bipolar disorder and the fluctuation of symptoms over time. The GBI is intended to be administered for adult populations; however, it has been adapted into versions that allow for juvenile populations (for parents to rate their offspring), as well as a short version that allows for it to be used as a screening test.|$|R

On the other hand, one technique used by Alfred Adler to combat neurosis was to minimize the excessive significance the neurotic attaches to his own symptoms—the narcissistic gains derived from pride in one's own illness.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} the 6 -year follow-up of French gendarmes {{exposed to the}} chikungunya (CHIK) infection in 2006 on Reunion Island. The aim was to see {{to what extent the}} subjective health differences observed in 2008 (30 months after infection) between CHIK infected (CHIK+) and noninfected (CHIK-) gendarmes still persisted in 2012, and to investigate a possible return to a pre-CHIK health status for CHIK+ subjects. Gendarmes were contacted by mail in 2012 and asked to complete a self-questionnaire asking for morbidity, health care and medicines consumption since the last follow-up in 2008. Quality of life (QoL) after 6 years was evaluated using the SF- 36 scale. In comparison with CHIK- subjects (n =  171), CHIK+ (n =  81) presented with higher rheumatic but also nonspecific morbidity such as headaches and fatigue associated with a large psychological impact, frequent <b>depressive</b> <b>moods</b> and social disabilities, leading to a significant impairment of the QoL and higher health care consumption. When restricted to CHIK+ subjects, comparing the data with that of 2008 showed persistent but decreasing self-reported rheumatic morbidity, and an increase over time of chronic discomfort (headache, fatigue) and <b>depressive</b> <b>moods,</b> resulting in no overall improvement in QoL. Despite possible cohort attrition bias, the comparability of CHIK+/CHIK- subjects allows the assumption of a long-term impact of CHIK infection with less chance of returning to a previous health status. Although these results may be specific to the 2006 virus strain, we recommend that public health strategies in the epidemic-prone countries include a response to the consequences of chronic post-CHIK disorders...|$|R
