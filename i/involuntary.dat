5|$|Athetosis â€“ Athetosis is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, <b>involuntary</b> movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g. cerebral palsy, choreoathetosis).|$|E
5|$|Enforcement {{of federal}} civil rights law in the South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt v. United States (1905) that peonage was <b>involuntary</b> servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) <b>involuntary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pathology in the {{basal ganglia}} may be {{indicated}} by rigidity {{and resistance to}} movement of the limbs, and {{by the presence of}} characteristic <b>involuntary</b> movements.|$|E
5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: <b>involuntary</b> dance-like movements. In neuroacanthocytosis, this is {{particularly}} prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech and eating. These movements are usually abrupt and irregular and present during both rest and sleep.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Kelgian species, Naydrad looks like a giant caterpillar. Since the <b>involuntary</b> {{movements}} of Kelgians' fur completely show their emotions, the species is incapable of both lying and tact. Naydrad is a specialist in rescuing victims of space accidents.|$|E
5|$|Angered by {{institutional}} psychiatric {{practices and}} lenient <b>involuntary</b> commitment processes, Millett became an activist. With her lawyer, {{she changed the}} State of Minnesota's commitment law so that a trial is required before a person is involuntarily committed.|$|E
5|$|BayPointe Hospital and Children's Residential Services, with 94-beds, is {{the only}} {{psychiatric}} hospital in the city. It houses a residential unit for children, an acute unit for children and adolescents, and an age-segregated <b>involuntary</b> hospital unit for adults undergoing evaluation ordered by the Mobile Probate Court.|$|E
5|$|Childfree couples {{choose to}} not have {{children}}. These include: young couples, who plan to have children later, {{as well as those}} who do not plan to have any children. <b>Involuntary</b> childlessness may be caused by infertility, medical problems, death of a child, or other factors.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by <b>involuntary</b> repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and <b>involuntary</b> silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E
5|$|The medulla, {{along with}} the spinal cord, {{contains}} many small nuclei involved {{in a wide variety}} of sensory and <b>involuntary</b> motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and digestive processes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main forms of {{manslaughter}} in English law: voluntary manslaughter, cases which would otherwise amount to murder {{but for some}} legally recognised mitigating factor; and <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter which includes cases of gross negligence manslaughter and unlawful act manslaughter.|$|E
5|$|Tics are sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic {{movements}} (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) {{that involve}} discrete muscle groups. Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are <b>involuntary</b> sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat.|$|E
5|$|When Dan White {{was found}} guilty of <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter, his {{successful}} diminished capacity defense enraged the gay community. That the police and fire departments had raised money for his defense gave their anger a focus, turning it against the city government and especially the SFPD.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of <b>involuntary</b> examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of <b>involuntary</b> hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in <b>involuntary</b> hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E
5|$|After {{over eight}} months of working to {{purchase}} the franchise, local businessman Bill Sexton withdrew his bid to purchase the Timberwolves in August. However, Glen Taylor later headed a group to purchase {{the team with the}} NBA approving the transaction in October 1994. By 1995 Top Rank would enter <b>involuntary</b> bankruptcy and as a result, the NBA rejected their offer securing the franchise in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Although McCarthy {{had been}} charged with first-degree murder, the judge allowed the jury to {{consider}} lesser charges of second-degree murder and <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter. On June 26, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder and two days later he was sentenced to life imprisonment; he will be eligible for parole in 2037.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed <b>involuntary</b> commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such <b>involuntary</b> confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Jackson had been {{administered}} propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam, and the Los Angeles coroner decided to treat the death as a homicide. Law enforcement officials conducted a manslaughter investigation of his personal physician Conrad Murray, and charged him with <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter in Los Angeles on February 8, 2010. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Indiana {{became the}} first state to adopt {{eugenics}} legislation, that allowed the <b>involuntary</b> sterilization of dangerous male criminals and the mentally defectives. It was never put in effect and in 1921 Indiana {{became the first}} state to rule such legislation unconstitutional when the Supreme Court of Indiana acted. A revised eugenics law was passed in 1927, and it remained in effect until 1974.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{with the}} Chicago Spire site for sale by Ireland's National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), {{interest}} resumed, drawing {{in at least}} a half-dozen offers for the property. Under the <b>involuntary</b> bankruptcy ruling in October 2013, Shelbourne had until the end of March 2014 to obtain approval of a reorganization plan, and was considering a bid to take back control of the property, reigniting hope that the skyscraper might actually be built.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost every}} case, dissidents were {{examined}} at the Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry in Moscow, where persons being prosecuted {{in court for}} committing political crimes were subjected to a forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation. Once certified, the accused and convicted were sent for <b>involuntary</b> treatment to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals controlled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, many {{individuals}} with Down syndrome were institutionalized, {{few of the}} associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. With {{the rise of the}} eugenics movement, 33 of the then 48 U.S. states and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability. Action T4 in Nazi Germany made public policy of a program of systematic <b>involuntary</b> euthanization.|$|E
5|$|<b>Involuntary</b> {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an insignificant crime.|$|E
5|$|Mehserle's {{trial was}} {{subsequently}} moved to Los Angeles following concerns {{that he would}} be unable to get a fair trial in Alameda County. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle was found guilty on a lesser charge of <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter. He was released on June 13, 2011 and is now on parole.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} <b>involuntary</b> host to the common cuckoo, but overall its {{population}} is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The {{attorneys}} {{who represented the}} LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of <b>involuntary</b> bankruptcy, and {{that members of the}} Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is a small}} region at {{the base}} of the forebrain, whose complexity and importance belies its size. It is composed of numerous small nuclei, each with distinct connections and neurochemistry. The hypothalamus is engaged in additional <b>involuntary</b> or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles, eating and drinking, and the release of some hormones.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others <b>involuntary</b> hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E
5|$|The total {{compensation}} demanded by {{families of the}} victims came to 830,000 euros. Victims' families were also reported to want the police inspector who did not confiscate Saari's gun {{in the days before the}} shooting (Saari was interviewed in relation to his internet videos), who was charged with dereliction of duty, to be additionally charged with <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} <b>involuntary</b> host to the common cuckoo, but overall its {{population}} is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Wallace is {{grateful}} for an <b>involuntary</b> stop in Bali, which he finds {{one of the}} most interesting places of his trip, as Hindu customs and religion are still practised, while on Lombok he finds Australian birds such as cockatoos, observing that this is the most westerly point of that family's range.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} {{for a series of}} comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. His personal physician was convicted of <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison.|$|E
5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes <b>involuntary</b> spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was competent {{to stand trial}} on the charges, which eliminated him {{as a candidate for}} <b>involuntary</b> commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is <b>involuntary,</b> and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¿Ï‚ and Î±Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¿Î½ is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{retirement}} {{may have been}} <b>involuntary,</b> the Life of CathrÃ³e of Metz and the Prophecy of BerchÃ¡n portray Constantine as a devout king. The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where {{he is said to}} have been abbot, was probably that of St Andrews. This had been refounded in his reign and given to the reforming CÃ©li DÃ© (Culdee) movement. The CÃ©li DÃ© were subsequently to be entrusted with many monasteries throughout the kingdom of Alba until replaced in the 12th century by new orders imported from France.|$|E
