50|$|The main {{benefit of}} milk runs is, {{according}} to common opinion in literature, {{in the higher}} utilization of trucks and the resulting reduction of transport costs by up to 30%. In addition, the reduction of stock, both at the supplier side and at the customer side, avoidance in delays at the loading ramp, due to the consolidation of several suppliers and the specified time windows, high security planning and integration of reusable container recycling. The literature completely ignores the reduction of pollution of the environment, both by consolidation and the resulting higher utilization of trucks, and by the reduction of transportation vehicles, compared to JIT or <b>groupage</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{complexity}} and dynamics in <b>groupage</b> <b>traffic</b> requires flexible, efficient, and adaptive planning and controlling processes. While the general problem {{refers to the}} Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), additional requirements have to be fulfilled in application. Individual properties and priorities of orders, a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, dynamically incoming orders, unexpected events etc. require a proactive and reactive system behavior. To enable automated dispatching processes, we have implemented a multiagent system where the decision making is shifted from a central system to autonomous, interacting, intelligent agents. To evaluate the approach we used multiagent-based simulation and modeled several scenarios on real world infrastructures with orders provided by our industrial partner. The results reveal that agent-based dispatching meets the in-creasing requirements in <b>groupage</b> <b>traffic</b> while supporting the combination of pickup and delivery tours and accommodating request priorities, time-windows, as well as capacity constraints.

40|$|Abstract: The {{dynamics}} {{and complexity of}} planning and scheduling processes in <b>groupage</b> <b>traffic</b> require efficient, proac-tive, and reactive system behavior to improve the service quality while ensuring time and cost efficient trans-portation. We implemented a multiagent-system to emerge an adequate system behavior {{and focus on the}} decision making processes of agents that is based on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with aspects like contract time windows, individual restricted capacities of trucks, premium services and varying priorities of dynamically incoming orders. We present an optimal depth-first branch-and-bound asymmetric TSP solver with constraints on tour feasibility and depot reachability at any step of the process. To evaluate our approach, we use established benchmarks as well as its inclusion in a real-life multiagent-based simulation. Simulated scenarios are based on real customer orders of our industrial partner Hellmann Worldwide Logistics GmbH & Co. KG and are applied on real world infrastructures. The results reveal that efficient optimal decision making in multiagent systems increases the service quality and meets the requirements and challenges in logistics. ...|$|E
