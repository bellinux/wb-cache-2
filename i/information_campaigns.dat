It was also emblematic of the blurred lines between government and political advertising. However, the IR <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> also revealed the limitations of incumbency advantage and the limitations to some aspects of the modern trend towards permanent campaigning. Public anger over the plethora of taxpayer-funded advertisements limited the effectiveness of the messages being delivered. The government persisted with the <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> - perhaps a signal it was designed not to turn public opinion in favour of the reforms, but to prevent an increase in public dissatisfaction following the negative campaign being waged by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) ...|$|R

25|$|In the 1980s, first genital herpes {{and then}} AIDS emerged {{into the public}} {{consciousness}} as sexually transmitted diseases {{that could not be}} cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969. Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.|$|E
25|$|Batteries {{are used}} either as sole or as backup power for {{residential}} smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Doctors Without Borders, in {{cooperation}} with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, runs three cholera treatment units in Freetown, where more than 500 patients have been treated. The organisation has treated approximately 4,600 patients in Sierra Leone and Guinea since February. The group has begun to establish other cholera treatment centres at 34 Military Hospital in the west of Freetown, expanding the total number of beds from 90 to 200. The group is also collaborating with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation to inform the public of how to avoid contracting the disease. Among the other groups helping victims are Action Firm (AF) and the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society. AF provided free medical care for victims while about 400 volunteers of the Sierra Leone Red Cross helped out on sanitation awareness campaigns. Oxfam, a charity group based in the United Kingdom, is another group that provides nearly 67,000 people in Freetown with emergency water chlorination. Oxfam also plans to assist up to 500,000 people with cholera prevention kits, water purification kits and public <b>information</b> <b>campaigns</b> on how to prevent the disease. The Isle of Man donated to assist the activities in the country through Oxfam. The other British groups mobilised include Save the Children, International Rescue Committee, Concern, Care International and the British Red Cross. The Finnish Red Cross sent medication and doctors to the country on 24 and 25 August. World Vision is also working with the government to prevent the disease from spreading through various activities, including the collection of the garbage pills.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impact of {{behavioral}} interventions and nudging in dealing with the food waste problem. In particular, the authors implement an <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> aiming to increase consumers’ awareness of the food waste problem. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: In the period of three weeks, the authors observe intentions to prevent food waste and actual food waste of the consumers in a university restaurant serving ready meals. During the intervention period, consumers are exposed to an <b>information</b> <b>campaign,</b> designed to avoid consumers’ insufficient planning problem. FINDINGS: Consumers are willing to pay the same price for less food more often during the campaign than before the campaign, but the approximated impact on the food waste is not significant. Social emotions of guilt and shame are linked to consumers’ intentions to prevent food waste, suggesting channels to be included in a successful <b>information</b> <b>campaign</b> nudging consumers toward food waste reduction. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The authors were not able to measure precisely food waste, but observed consumers in a real-life context. Consumers were not aware of the study, and made daily purchase decisions before and after the <b>information</b> <b>campaign.</b> SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: Consumer behavior is at the core of the food waste problem in developed countries. It is important to understand how consumers can be nudged at low cost, using an <b>information</b> <b>campaign,</b> to change their attitude to food waste, and to decrease food waste. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The authors collected an original dataset on the impact of an <b>information</b> <b>campaign,</b> observing behavior of consumers in a real-life context...|$|R
