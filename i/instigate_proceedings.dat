The Kew Constabulary have no power to <b>instigate</b> <b>proceedings</b> for an offence committed within their jurisdiction under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, indicating that the Metropolitan Police retain primary responsibility for the policing of Kew Gardens. This contrasts with {{the responsibilities of the}} Royal Parks Constabulary (now abolished in England and Wales with their staff and functions transferred to the Metropolitan Police), which had responsibility for the instigation of proceedings within their jurisdiction and were attested under the same legislation as the Kew Constabulary.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 July 1961 Semler, as Chairman of the {{supervisory}} board joined {{the directors of}} the three companies Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd to <b>instigate</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{for the establishment of a}} “Vergleichsverfahren”, which would have provided for a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement enabling the business to continue to trade while at the same time protecting the interests of creditors. [...] Two months later, however, in September 1961, the Borgward and Goliath businesses were declared bankrupt, followed in November by the Lloyd business. Subsequent “conspiracy theorists” have suggested that Semler, for reasons of his own, never had any intention of allowing the Borgward auto-businesses to survive.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} encouraged {{victims to}} assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. Victims were provided the opportunity to file civil suits against, trafficking offenders, though in the case of child victims, adult family members needed to <b>instigate</b> <b>proceedings.</b> At least one such case was pending in the Northwest Region {{at the end of the}} reporting period, with an 18-year-old victim, supported by local organizations, suing an alleged trafficking offender. Through the National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, and national and international NGOs, the government for the first time provided specialized training on how to identify trafficking victims to some of its officials, including law enforcement officers, in four regions of the country beginning in July 2009.|$|E
5000|$|On 20 May 2009 at the Bill's {{committee}} stage, section 36, {{dealing with}} blasphemy {{was introduced by}} Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern as an amendment. Section 36 defines a new indictable offence of [...] "Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter", which carries a maximum fine of €25,000. The offence consists of uttering material [...] "grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion", when the intent and result is [...] "outrage among {{a substantial number of}} the adherents of that religion". A defence is permitted for work of [...] "genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value". [...] "Religion" [...] excludes profit-driven organisations or those using [...] "oppressive psychological manipulation". Upon conviction under section 36, a court warrant can authorise the Garda Síochána (police) to enter premises to search for and seize any copies of the blasphemous material. Only the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) can <b>instigate</b> <b>proceedings,</b> as distinct from private prosecutions like Corway.|$|E
40|$|SHOPLIFTERS possess {{characteristics}} which distinguish them criminologically {{from other}} thieves. More {{women than men}} are convicted, the reconviction rate is low, and the offenders have a higher average age and come from more diverse socio-economic back grounds. SHOPLIFTING has been investigated from psychiatric and sociological standpoints. It is frequently associated with a stress situation in an otherwise law-abiding individual. He may then disregard the criminality of his act {{for the sake of}} its therapeutic effect. It can be carried out successfully without the support of a criminal subculture, but that support may be essential if the offender is to continue once discovered. RESEARCH to date is concerned mainly with the convicted shoplifter - but many who are apprehended are never convicted, since this depends primarily on the readiness of the store to <b>instigate</b> <b>proceedings</b> against them. Although few stores keep reliable records about those they apprehend, one firm made 382 such records available for analysis. From this a descriptive report was made, and a comparison drawn between those apprehended and those convicted. Additionally, since the gravity of the offence in terms of amount stolen was known, a further comparison was made between the sentences imposed by the eleven magistrates' courts in the areas concerned. A SUMMARY of the research findings is given in Chapter 7...|$|E

40|$|The issues {{discussed}} in the paper relate to the checking proceedings carried out pursuant to article 307 of the code of penal proceedings in respect of a suspected person enjoying material, formal and jurisdictional immunity. The said article proposes a different, from the traditional one, typological approach to the immunity, taking into account a broader aspect of the code of penal proceedings. The checking proceedings are carried out before any preparatory proceedings take place; therefore, properly undertaken actions ensure efficiency of the whole course of proceedings and proper realisation of {{the basic principles of}} a criminal trial. They also serve as a guarantee of the competences of the participants to the criminal proceedings. According to article 307 of the code of criminal procedure, there are three possible ways of the checking procedure: a) request for complementary data (information) to the ones included in the information of the crime; b) addition of complementary data (information) contained in the information of a crime, consisting of the hearing of the party providing information in the capacity of a witness; c) checking the facts by the very organ itself, normally, by way of operational and investigation tasks. According to article 307 para. 5 of the code of penal procedure, it is possible to carry out checking procedures regarding the information possessed by the police, and regarding information or intelligence as to which a question might arise that a crime had been committed. Checking proceedings, i. e. a stage clearly separated from the preparatory proceedings, partially realises the objectives and tasks of the preparatory proceedings, which becomes especially pronounced and significant when data about people are being collected, as among those data there is also information about immunity which may have been granted to a given person at a certain time. There are two possible ways in which the checking procedure may be terminated; 1). by a decision not to instigate proceedings; or 2). by a decision to <b>instigate</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The following conclusions have been formulated: material immunities and jurisdictional immunities disclosed {{in the course of the}} checking proceedings result in automatic decisions to reject the application to instigate preparatory proceedings; 2). the disclosure, in the course of checking proceedings, of the formal immunity should result in an automatic instigation o f preparatory proceedings, which is related to the necessity to commence, by an authorised prosecutor, of an action to start a relevant procedure to procure the permission to enforce law. The above conclusions are subject to transformations under the public and private claims procedures...|$|E

5000|$|To {{ameliorate}} this problem, the Duke of Buccleuch in 1851 <b>instigated</b> <b>proceedings</b> to {{have the}} southern part, in the Ettrick valley, disjoined from the parish and erected into a separate parish. The duke proposed to make over the chapel at Ettrickbridge, which he had built in 1839, to be {{the church of the}} new parish, to erect a suitable manse for the minister, and to bear the expense of the judicial separation proceedings. The new parish would extend to 9 miles in length up the river Ettrick, be about 6 miles wide, with an area of about 50 square miles, population 600. The remaining portion of the parish of Yarrow would contain a population of about 670, extending in length to about 19 miles, and in breadth.

50|$|Beginning in 1907, Tucker was {{involved}} in a scandalous divorce, which threatened to tarnish the carefully crafted family history that her mother had spent years building. For two years, newspapers from coast to coast covered the story. Tucker initiated the proceedings alleging misconduct by her husband. Approaching the War Department, she attempted to have him discharged from the military, alleging he had engaged in conduct unbecoming to an officer. The military investigation proved the charges insufficient and when her divorce was declined Colonel Tucker <b>instigated</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The press carried reports that the marital trouble was due to the bequest from Lemon, several years before. Tucker then changed the grounds to desertion, and Colonel Tucker was arrested, but released as he was undergoing medical treatment. In 1909, the couple were granted an absolute divorce, with the major ordered to pay alimony to Tucker. In 1911 the couple's only remaining child, Logan, died of heart failure amid rumors of suicide.|$|R

Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null and void.

In 1914, the Newfoundland legislature replaced the local elected council in St. John's with an appointed commission consisting of twelve men. Governing the city for two years, the commission, of which Gosling was chairman, instituted a range of reforms, including a reorganization of water and sewage services and a new method of collecting and spending revenue. One such revenue reform included <b>instigating</b> legal <b>proceedings</b> against tax evaders who refused to pay after August 1, 1914.
