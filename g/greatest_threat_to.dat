5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|In April 1949, Truman {{appointed}} Radford to {{the position}} of Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. A staunch anticommunist, Radford saw the <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> U.S. security coming from Asia, not Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as South Asia and the Far East. He became acquainted with political and military leaders in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Formosa, and Japan, and learned about the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> {{manta rays}} is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly {{distributed}} over the oceans, but {{is concentrated in}} areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the Nile crocodile. Humans are the <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of the story that crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E
5|$|The divines {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two groups as the <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Muhammad, many {{powerful}} Arab tribes broke away in open revolt against the rule of Medina. Caliph Abu Bakr sent his armies to counter the rebels and apostates. Khalid was one of Abu Bakr’s main advisers and an architect of the strategic planning of the Riddah wars. He was given the command over the strongest Muslim army and was sent towards central Arabia, the most strategically sensitive area where the most powerful rebel tribes resided. The region was closest to the Muslim stronghold of Medina and was the <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the city. Khalid first {{set out for the}} rebel tribes of Tayy and Jalida, where Adi ibn Hatim—a prominent companion of Muhammad, and a chieftain of the Tayy tribe—arbitrated, and the tribes submitted to the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|In 1204 the Byzantine {{capital of}} Constantinople was sacked and {{occupied}} by the Fourth Crusaders, an important moment of the Christian East–West Schism. The Byzantine Empire, already weakened by misrule, was left divided and in chaos. Taking advantage of the situation, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum began seizing territory in Western Asia Minor, until the Nicaean Empire was able to repulse the Seljuk Turks from the remaining territories still under Roman rule. Eventually Constantinople was re-taken from the Latin Empire in 1261 by the Nicaean Empire. However {{the position of the}} Byzantine Empire in the European continent remained uncertain due to the presence of the rival kingdoms of the Despotate of Epirus, Serbia and the Second Bulgarian Empire. This, combined with the reduced power of the Sultanate of Rum (Byzantium's chief rival in Asia) led to the removal of troops from Asia Minor to maintain Byzantium's grip on Thrace. However the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum was by no means a blessing to the Empire as nobles known as ghazis began setting up their fiefdoms, {{at the expense of the}} Byzantine Empire. While many Turkish beys participated in the conquest of Byzantine and Seljuk territory, the territories under the control of one such Bey named Osman I posed the <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Nicaea and to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The Third Fleet sailed from Ulithi on 30 December 1944. On 3 and 4 January its {{aircraft}} carriers struck Japanese airfields on Formosa, Okinawa and nearby islands {{in an attempt}} to prevent them from being used to attack the Allied forces at Lingayen Gulf. In addition, its strike aircraft attacked Japanese shipping at Formosa, sinking at least three merchant vessels and damaging four frigates. Acting on a request from General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the South West Pacific Area, the fleet struck airfields on Luzon on 6 and 7 January. At around this time Vice-Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the commander of the Seventh Fleet which was responsible for the Lingayen Gulf landings, asked Halsey to operate west of Luzon to provide air cover during the initial period of the invasion. Halsey did not believe that it was appropriate for his force to operate in such a passive role, and instead ordered further strikes on the Japanese airfields in southern Formosa which posed the <b>greatest</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Kinkaid's command. These took place on 9 January. During the morning of 9 January, Nimitz released the Third Fleet from directly covering the Lingayen Gulf area, and authorized it to enter the South China Sea. Once all the strike aircraft had landed that afternoon Halsey issued orders to execute the planned attack into the South China Sea. During the fleet's operations from 3 to 9 January it destroyed more than 150 Japanese aircraft, but lost 86 of its own, including 46 in accidents.|$|E

25|$|Following the Spoiling of Vijayabahu in 1521, {{the kingdom}} of Kotte split into three {{competing}} states – Sitawaka, Raigama, and Bhuvanekabahu VII's kingdom of Kotte.

In 1522, the Kandyans secured Portuguese protection against Sitawaka, but any potential for alliance ended in 1546 when Portuguese and Kotte forces invaded the kingdom.
