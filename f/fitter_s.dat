40|$|We {{report the}} {{preparation}} of aminopropyl-functionalized mag-nesium phyllosilicate (Mg-organoclay) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) functionality (FITC-organoclay) by one-pot sol-gel synthesis.

X-ray fluorescence and elemental analysis were conducted to confirm {{the composition of the}} Mg-organo-clay. The FITC-organoclay particles were polydispersed with an average particle size of 50 nm, as determined from SEM images. The XRD patterns of FITC-organoclay exhibited broad peaks and reduced basal d 001 indicating a less condensed and more disordered structure than was observed for Mg-organoclay. The conjugation between FITC- and Mg-organoclay was char-acterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectral data demonstrated the successful conjugation of FITC dye molecules to the Mg-organoclay. The time-resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that FITC had a lifetime of 4. 58 ns, whereas the lifetime of FITC-organoclay required a double exponential <b>fit</b> (<b>s</b> 1, 2 = 0. 72 and 2. 68 ns).

In this study, the impli cations of eliciting willingness-to-pay responses for an early intervention program for handicapped preschoolers are discussed. A survey technique, known as the contingent valuation method (CVM), is applied to program to empirically estimate wil lin gness-to-pay for the total program and for particular components of the program. Also investigated are the implications of using a rationality test in the survey to determine if consumer responses are in accordance with assumptions for rational consumer behavior. Results indicate relatively high willingness-to-pay for the program as whole, but low value is associated with program components. This implies that parents may value these programs more for the respite rather than specialized services offered. Results of the rationality test support the hypothesis that such a measure is necessary in survey designs of this nature...|$|R

Companies are more and more faced with the problem of the multilingual bottleneck, and are looking for new technologies which bring in productivity gains in the localisation and globalisation process. On the other hand, the increasing number of LT products, especially machine translation systems (MT) calls for useful and practical assessment procedures for potential users in order to prove if a given system <b>fit</b> <b>s</b> a user's needs. Static evaluations which test a system's fitness as-is, may be good for coarse-grained system comparisons, e. g. for best buy reports, or to make a system rating as the first step of more detailed system tests. Dynamic evaluations which consider also a system's adaptability and extensibility in a certain use case are more time-consuming, but they are the most realistic and constructive approaches to evaluation: they ideally combine both the assessment of the state-of-art of a system with the assessment of its extensibility and adaptability potential. The paper investigates the requirements for a useful evaluation of MT and presents practical guidelines to trigger the successful deployment of LT in an industrial context. The scenario is multilingual technical documentation in the automotive industry. ...|$|R

Alongside these, the ships were equipped with new rifled breech loading Armstrong guns of two types; 7 inch and 40 pounders. [...] Although the Armstrong guns represented a new direction in artillery, the breech loading mechanism meant that they were unable to withstand the explosion of a heavy cartridge. Smaller cartridge charges were therefore required and the gun's muzzle velocity suffered as a result.

40|$|Mutations the {{in human}} DJ- 1 (hDJ- 1) gene are {{associated}} with early-onset autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). hDJ- 1 /parkinsonism associated deglycase (PARK 7) is a cytoprotective multi-functional protein that contains a conserved cysteine-protease domain. Given that cysteine-proteases can act on both amide and ester substrates, we surmised that hDJ- 1 possessed cysteine-mediated esterase activity. To test this hypothesis, hDJ- 1 was overexpressed, purified and tested for activity towards 4 -nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) as µmol of pNPA hydrolyzed/min/mg·protein (U/mg protein). hDJ- 1 showed maximum reaction velocity esterase activity (Vmax = 235. 10 ± 12. 00 U/mg protein), with a sigmoidal <b>fit</b> (<b>S</b> 0. 5 = 0. 55 ± 0. 040 mM) and apparent positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient of 2. 05 ± 0. 28). A PD-associated mutant of DJ- 1 (M 26 I) lacked activity. Unlike its protease activity which is inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), esterase activity of hDJ- 1 is enhanced upon exposure to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ( 100 µM) suggesting that its activity is resistant to oxidative stress. Esterase activity of DJ- 1 requires oxidation of catalytic cysteines, as chemically protecting cysteines blocked its activity whereas an oxido-mimetic mutant of DJ- 1 (C 106 D) exhibited robust esterase activity. Molecular docking studies suggest that C 106 and L 126 within its catalytic site interact with esterase substrates. Overall, our data show that hDJ- 1 contains intrinsic redox-sensitive esterase activity that is abolished in a PD-associated mutant form of the hDJ- 1 protein...|$|R
