25|$|Robert Hope-Jones {{and others}} {{designed}} many {{new kinds of}} pipes {{in an effort to}} create colorful sounds for the theatre organ. Many of these new stops attempted to imitate the sounds of real orchestral instruments, while others simply contributed unique new colors to the tonal palette. Important new stops invented or refined by Hope-Jones included the Tibia Clausa, Tibia Plena, and the <b>Diaphone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hope-Jones {{believed}} that higher wind pressures would allow pipes to more accurately imitate orchestral instruments by causing the pipes to produce harmonic overtones which, when mixed with other pipe ranks, produced tones more imitative of actual instruments. The high wind pressures {{also led to}} the development of instruments that are unique in theatre organs (such as the <b>diaphone</b> and tibia clausa), and allowed any rank in the organ to function as a solo instrument. These higher pressures were possible due to the development of high-velocity, motor-driven blowers and wind regulators.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the largest}} <b>diaphones</b> ever constructed, the foghorn was {{decommissioned}} in 1973 because of technological advances in marine navigational equipment. The device fell into disrepair {{over the next few}} decades. Early in 2000, the Low Head Progress & Heritage Association in conjunction with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service (the present owners of the equipment) began a project to restore the foghorn. The device became operational again in April 2001. Today, the foghorn at Low Head Lighthouse is one of only two functioning Type G <b>diaphones</b> in the world, and it is sounded every Sunday at noon.|$|R
500|$|The term <b>diaphone</b> first {{appeared}} in usage by phoneticians like Daniel Jones and Harold E. Palmer. Jones, who {{was more interested in}} transcription and coping with dialectal variation [...] than with how cognitively real the phenomenon is, originally used <b>diaphone</b> to refer to the family of [...] sounds that are realized differently depending on dialect but that speakers consider to be the same; an individual dialect or speaker's realization of this <b>diaphone</b> was called a diaphonic variant. [...] Because of confusion related to usage, Jones later coined the term diaphoneme to refer to his earlier sense of <b>diaphone</b> (the [...] class of sounds) and used <b>diaphone</b> to refer to the variants.|$|E
500|$|The concept {{goes back}} to the 1930s. The word <b>diaphone</b> was {{originally}} used with the same meaning, but was later repurposed to refer to any of the particular variants, making the relationship between diaphoneme and <b>diaphone</b> analogous to that between phoneme and allophone.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, {{the term}} <b>diaphone</b> {{can be used}} in discussions of {{cognates}} that occur in different languages due to borrowing. [...] Specifically, [...] used the term to refer to phonemes that are equated by speakers cross-linguistically because of similarities in shape and/or distribution. [...] For example, loanwords in Huave having [...] "diaphonic identification" [...] with Spanish include àsét ('oil', from Spanish [...] ) and kàwíy ('horse', from Spanish [...] ). This perception of sameness with native phonology means that speakers of the borrower language (in this case, Huave) will hear new features from the loaner language (in this case, Spanish) as equivalent to features of their own and substitute in their own when reproducing them. [...] In these interlanguage transfers, when phonemes or phonotactic constraints are too different, more extreme compromises may occur; for example, the English phrase Merry Christmas, when borrowed into Hawaiian, becomes mele kalikimaka.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of ways <b>diaphones</b> are {{represented}} in literature. One way is through the IPA, this can be done with slashes, as if they are phonemes, or with other types of brackets: ...|$|R
5000|$|The concept {{does not}} necessitate the {{formation}} of a transcription system. <b>Diaphones</b> can instead be represented with double slashes. This is the case, for example in [...] and [...] where diaphonemes are represented with bracketing: ...|$|R
50|$|There is {{also part}} of the great organ in Worcester Cathedral in the UK. In recent work, only one Hope-Jones rank of pipes Viol d'Orchestre has been retained. As long ago as the early 1970s, the <b>diaphones,</b> solo division, and orchestral oboe were removed.|$|R

2500|$|Fog signal building: the {{original}} fog signal building {{was destroyed in}} a storm in 1935. [...] The building was replaced with a brick structure in 1937. [...] It was used to house steam boilers, clock timing apparatus, radio equipment, diesel generators, and equipment to operate 3 large <b>diaphone</b> horns until 1982. [...] The Coast Guard replaced the <b>diaphone</b> horns with an electronic fog horn in 1983 that sounded from the light tower. [...] The Coast Guard stopped fog signals from Whitefish Point in 1995. [...] The GLSHS abandoned their 1996 plans to demolish the fog signal building and started restoration of {{the exterior of the}} building in 2002. [...] The GLSHS uses the fog signal building as a ground maintenance facility not open to the public.|$|E
500|$|Diaphonology {{studies the}} {{realization}} of <b>diaphones</b> across dialects, and is important if an orthography is to be adequate {{for more than one}} dialect of a language. In historical linguistics, it is concerned with the reflexes of an ancestral phoneme as a language splits into dialects, such as the modern realizations of Old English [...]|$|R
5000|$|The late 1890s {{reconstruction}} of the ship canal resulted in the replacement of this tower and the fog signal house with a single brick lighthouse containing both signals. This house, constructed of Cream City brick, was completed in 1901, and the new tower was first lit on September 1 of that year. This tower stood on {{the southeast corner of}} the rectangular building, and housed the lens retained from the old light; the fog whistles and their reflector were also moved from the old structure to the new. The latter were replaced in 1915 with locomotive whistles, and in 1921 with Type F <b>diaphones,</b> setting off another round of noise complaints, which led to the installation of a new sound reflector. The <b>diaphones</b> were replaced in 1968 with an electronic horn, but in 1976 a group styling itself TOOT (for [...] "reTurn Our Old Tone") began a campaign to restore the fog signal. Horns from the Kewaunee Pierhead Light were obtained, and in 1995 the <b>diaphones</b> were put back in service, eliciting, of course, a new round of noise complaints, which led to restriction of the signal to daytime operation. The signal required a three-phase current supply for operation, and when this failed in 2005, the Coast Guard refused to pay for repairs; legal concerns led the city to refuse to pick up the tab, and the signal was dismantled the following year. The light, however, continues in service, displaying a fixed green light.|$|R
500|$|Diaphonemic systems don't {{necessarily}} {{even have}} to utilize the IPA. [...] <b>Diaphones</b> are useful in constructing a writing system that accommodates multiple dialects with different phonologies.

50|$|When {{construction}} of the organ commenced, it was planned to have two 64-foot stops in the pedal, a <b>Diaphone</b> Profunda and a Dulzian. Later, the design was revised, and the <b>Diaphone</b> was cut, because it was feared it would crowd the Right Stage chamber (due to {{the width of the}} pipes). Consequently, the Dulzian was moved to the Right Stage chamber. However, the sound of the 64-foot Dulzian did not meet the criteria, requiring <b>Diaphone</b> pipes to be used for the lowest 22 notes. The remaining pipes in the rank are reeds. Because of the low frequencies involved, and because the <b>diaphone</b> is voiced to imitate a reed stop, the transition from reed to <b>diaphone</b> cannot be heard.|$|E
50|$|All Saints' Church, Upper Norwood, had an {{interesting}} example of a three-manual Hope-Jones organ within a parish church setting, complete with <b>diaphones</b> and Wurlitzer-style console. It was hoped {{that it might be}} restored {{at some point in the}} future, but the organ has now been dismantled. The historic Hope-Jones 16&prime; open wood rank complete with chest from All Saints' Church was moved in February 2011 to West Ashling Chapel belonging to The Clock Trust, where it is on public display with many other Hope-Jones pipes from this organ.|$|R
5000|$|In 1881, two {{fog signal}} {{buildings}} were constructed about a half-mile away. [...] Originally steam powered, the Steam whistles {{were converted to}} <b>diaphones.</b> Improvements were made in 1887, and again in 1891 to repair damage caused by a lightning strike. The light was upgraded to incandescent oil vapor in 1912, and in the 1930 the entire station was electrified. In 1961, a new barracks building was constructed and a solar-powered light installed. The lighthouse was automated in 1972, and the structure boarded. [...] The light is still an active aid to navigation.|$|R
5000|$|Sirens {{began to}} replace bells for {{municipal}} warning {{in the early}} 1900s, but became commonplace following America's entry into World War II. Most siren models of this time were single-tone models which often sounded almost an octave higher in pitch than their European counterparts. Dual-tone sirens became {{more common in the}} 1950s, but have been used in some areas since about 1915. During the Cold War, standard signals were used throughout the country for civil defense purposes, referred to as [...] "alert" [...] and [...] "attack". Volunteer fire departments generally used a different siren signal. Many towns, especially in California and New England, used coded air horns or <b>diaphones</b> for fire calls and reserved sirens for civil defense use.|$|R

50|$|This {{light is}} {{designed}} as an autonomous automated electrified station. It {{is under the}} control and maintenance of Coast Guard Station in Tawas City, Michigan. Ordinarily it displays a 15,000 candela 375 mm light powered by a 120 volt electric lamp. Power is supplied through a submarine cable, which crosses the shoal from Point Lookout. The 75 ft focal plane makes its flash (1-second every 5 seconds) visible for 16 mi. It is supplemented by a standby 110 candela acetylene light with a half second flash every three seconds—which activates automatically {{if there is a}} power failure. In foggy weather, mariners are warned by twin compressed-air two-tone #3 <b>diaphones,</b> which operate on a 30-second cycle (3-second blast followed by 27 seconds of silence).|$|R
5000|$|Frequent {{and oppressive}} fog made the passage hazardous; and also made duty {{at the light}} to be {{considered}} a hardship in an extremely lonely and forbidding place. [...] A fog bell signal was installed in 1862. In 1864 it was replaced by a foghorn. In 1875 it was converted to a steam powered fog siren. In 1880 a separate fog building was built for a [...] "duplicate" [...] fog siren. This began a 10 in steam whistle and new building in 1900 (which still exists near water's edge). [...] In 1904, there came a realization that the whistles were [...] "less than effective' and they were replaced by dual <b>diaphones.</b> [...] The horns made living there difficult; fertilized eggs would be destroyed by the sounds.|$|R
5000|$|Einar Haugen {{expanded}} the diaphonic {{approach to the}} study of bilingualism, believing <b>diaphones</b> represented the process of interlingual identification wherein sounds from different languages are perceptually linked into a single category. [...] Because interlingual identifications may happen between unrelated varieties, it is possible to construct a diasystem for many different language contact situations, with the appropriateness of such a construction depending on its purpose and its simplicity depending on how isomorphic the phonology of the systems are. For example, the Spanish of Los Ojos (a small village in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico) and the local variety of Southwestern English are fairly isomorphic with each other so a diaphonic approach for such a language contact situation would be relatively straightforward. [...] makes use of a diaphonic approach in discussing the phonology of the pidgin English used by Japanese immigrants on Hawaiian plantations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diaphone</b> is a genus of moths of the Noctuidae family.|$|E
50|$|Hope-Jones also {{developed}} an imitative {{version of the}} <b>diaphone</b> called the diaphonic horn, which had a more reed-like quality than the <b>diaphone</b> and was voiced on lower wind pressures. Wurlitzer built {{a version of the}} diaphonic horn for their theater organs at 32&prime; and 16&prime; pitches with huge wooden resonators as extensions of its Diaphonic diapason, and at 16&prime; with metal resonators as an extension of its smaller-scale Open diapason. The Austin Organ Company {{also developed}} a metal <b>diaphone</b> at 16&prime; pitch known as a Magnaton. Due to its penetrating tone, a diaphone-type horn has also been used in foghorns and fire signals.|$|E

50|$|This {{ship was}} built to replace LV-44, badly damaged in the New England Hurricane of 1938, for the Cornfield Point station. Patterned after the LV-112, she has a hull unlike that of any of her sisters; in effect, a single-ship class. She is the last riveted-hull {{lightship}} built for the US Lighthouse Service, all subsequent ships having welded hulls. Propulsion was diesel, {{with a set of}} diesel generators and compressors providing power for the beacon and auxiliaries. The light was a duplex 375 mm lantern on a single mast, at 57 ft above the water line. Dual <b>diaphones</b> were provided for a fog signal, as well as a bell and radiobeacon. A radar unit was installed in 1943. The crew complement was fourteen, to serve on a two weeks on/one week off basis. When the lighthouse service was merged into the coast guard in 1939, she was renumbered WAL 539.|$|R
