500|$|The Democrats renominated Beckham without {{opposition}} in 1920. His {{opponent in the}} general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the <b>distilling</b> <b>industry</b> and the saloon business in the state, and in areas where these industries were prominent Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of President Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3percent of the vote to Beckham's 49.7percent. [...] During his single term in the Senate Beckham served alongside three other U.S. Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin and Augustus O. Stanley.|$|E

50|$|Hartley {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the New York Temperance Society in 1829. Four year later he became the Corresponding Secretary and Agent. He set about reorganising and {{extending}} the scope of the society; publications were circulated and newspapers used to spread the message. Many thousands of the residents signed the pledge, and claims were made that the campaign led to a reduction in crime and pauperism. During his investigations he discovered that much of the waste product from the brewing and <b>distilling</b> <b>industries</b> was used to feed farm animals. He claimed that there was a link between the production of unhealthy milk from these animals and a rise in infant mortality.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} the {{governorate}} was mainly based on agriculture. During the grain harvest, thousands of agricultural laborers from {{the parts of the}} Empire found work in the area.

As 'czar' of the nation's <b>distilled</b> liquor <b>industry,</b> Sturges drew up a code of practice to reform commercial practices, maintain an open competitive market, to end the system of secret rebates and other corner-cutting dodges, and to balance the field between larger and smaller operations.|$|R
50|$|Sour mash is {{a process}} used in the <b>distilling</b> <b>industry</b> that uses {{material}} from an older batch of mash to start the fermentation of a new batch, analogous to the making sourdough bread with a starter.

Sour mash does not refer to the flavor of the whiskey, as is sometimes thought.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concerns}} {{of these groups}} were in some areas well-founded. Alcohol abuse was an endemic social problem in most western countries and, as the local brewing and <b>distilling</b> <b>industry</b> expanded, it quickly became a serious problem in Australia. However, the Temperance movements were driven by a dogmatic Christian world view, and {{the aim of the}} larger [...] "Christian Morality" [...] movement at this time was to outlaw any social behaviour which went against Christian teaching - this included the consumption of alcohol, all forms of gambling and animal racing, prostitution and recreational (non-alcohol) drug use.|$|E

40|$|The {{huge amount}} of demand for feedgrains from this region could not {{possibly}} be met by producing countries from the other regions. In order to fulfill this increasing demand for conventional raw materials, an alternative for the conventional raw materials produced in the Asia and Pacific region is becoming increasingly more important. A potential alternative is concentrates or non-conventional concentrates produced locally in relative abundance in this region. These feedstuffs include feed grains, by-products from the milling, sugar <b>industries,</b> brewing and <b>distilling</b> <b>industries.</b> Vegetable, citrus, and animal by-products from abattoir, feather meal and blood meal are also possibilities. In addition to more widespread use of unconventional feed sources, the following approach is recommended to improve utilization and performance. These include establishing the nutritive value of non-conventional feeds, quality control to minimize variability, proper storage and processing to assure the nutritive value and prevent mycotoxin contamination, properly balance amino acids with protein sources, supplementation with synthetic amino acids and the use of enzymes to increase digestibility. Currently, practical applications for these resources in feed formulation are negligible despite the potential. The socio-economic aspects will dominate the use of these: non-conventional concentrates. In the future, the feed industry will resolve the problems in using locally available raw feed materials...|$|R
50|$|Prohibition turned some of {{the valley}} {{residents}} to another source of income - moonshine. The abundant water supply and deep woods areas in the valley were ideal for the concealment of illegal whiskey <b>distilling.</b> The moonshine <b>industry</b> thrived even after the Volstead Act was repealed in 1933, but the rising price of sugar finally brought the illegal whiskey industry to an end.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to {{developing}} a continuous activated carbon (AC) production process integrating drying, carbonization, and physical activation without external heat input. The massive byproduct in the <b>distilled</b> spirit <b>industry,</b> <b>distilled</b> spirit lees (SL), {{was used as the}} raw material in this study. The kinetic behaviors in each step, including drying, carbonization, and activation, were first investigated via laboratory tests. The results show that the whole AC production process can be completed in 30 min, including most of the time for drying, several minutes for carbonization, and several seconds for activation. On the basis of these laboratory results, an integrated process for continuous production of AC was proposed. The mass and heat balance calculation demonstrated a good balance for the developed process technology, and a pilot plant treating 2000 kg of SL/h was in turn built and commissioned to run autothermally and continuously. This demonstrated thus the technology for application to granular feedstock such as SL, although the produced AC from SL had surface areas of only about 191 m(2) /g and relatively low adsorption values, including 610 - 630 mg/g for iodine and 20 - 30 mg/g for methylene blue, due to the too short activation time in the pilot activator...|$|R
5000|$|The modern Canadian <b>distilling</b> <b>industry</b> {{produces}} {{a variety of}} spirits (e.g. whisky, rum, vodka, gin, liqueurs, spirit coolers, and basic ethyl alcohol), but Canada's primary reputation, domestically and internationally, remains {{for the production of}} Canadian whisky, a distinctive rye-flavoured, high quality whisky. The product is distilled from cereal grains (rye and corn primarily), aged in oak barrels for a minimum of three years, then bottled or sold in bulk. Canadian whisky captures one-quarter of the total Canadian spirits market and is the only Canadian distilled spirits product which is [...] "appellation protected", meaning that by law it can only be produced in Canada.|$|E

50|$|As the {{railways}} extended to Xuzhou, the city {{appeared to be}} prospering again, and it opened to foreign traders formally in 1922, still, only quite a few small and medium-sized shops were operating, {{on account of the}} continual warfare. Meanwhile, the industrial structure had to adapt itself to a war economy. <b>Distilled</b> beverage <b>industry</b> in Xuzhou was single flourishing sector since the Japanese military purchased the liquor from practitioners as an alternative to alcohol during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Likewise the lodging industry from 1945 to 1949, it grew rapidly as massing of KMT's troops. Besides, the finance was also in disorder. On November, 1933, recession and over-issue of the local notes triggered a run on local banks, which gummed up whole regional commercial activities.|$|R
50|$|It is {{impossible}} to underestimate Aeneas Coffey's importance {{in the history of}} <b>distilling.</b> Analogies between <b>industries</b> are hard to make, but one can safely call him the 'Henry Ford of Distilling', the 'Father of Irish Whiskey' or the 'Man who put the 'e' into whiskey'. Just as Ford came from Irish stock but made his name, fame and fortune in America, so Aeneas Coffey was an Irishman whose invention changed the world.|$|R
50|$|Fractional {{distillation}} {{is one of}} {{the unit}} operations of chemical engineering. Fractionating columns are widely used in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be <b>distilled.</b> Such <b>industries</b> are the petroleum processing, petrochemical production, natural gas processing, coal tar processing, brewing, liquified air separation, and hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a complex, multicomponent mixture that must be separated, and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, also called fractions. That is the origin of the name fractional distillation or fractionation. It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics.|$|R
