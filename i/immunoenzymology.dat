30|$|Introduction The {{diagnosis}} {{in clinical}} toxicology {{is based on}} the collection of information on (1) the substance, the dose, and the route of administration, (2) signs and symptoms that have to fit the supposed ingested drug (SID), and (3) toxicological analysis (TA) which is expected to provide the definitive diagnosis. However, in the past, the development of methods based on <b>immunoenzymology</b> provided information on the class rather the substance by itself with questionable ability to quantify exposure. Consequently, routinely used TA was progressively discarded. TA was recommended in only a few number of toxicants and in conditions where SID does not explain major signs and symptoms. However, over the past decade, modern TA using various modes of mass spectrometry was developed; meanwhile, analysts claimed they was able to address all toxicological concerns of attending physicians. From a theoretical viewpoint, this assumption was sounded. However, the translational to practice has not been assessed to our knowledge. The aim of this retrospective study performed in a medical polyvalent intensive care unit (MPICU) was to test the hypothesis more especially as the MPICU has unlimited access to facilities provided by three University Toxicology Laboratory (Tox Lab).|$|E
