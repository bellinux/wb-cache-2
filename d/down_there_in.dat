The war with America was over {{by the time she was}} ready for service, and with no immediate use for her with the draw-down of the navy, Terpsichore was placed in ordinary at Chatham.|$|E

25|$|Alligator {{was one of}} {{the third}} batch of Enterprise-class ships to be ordered by the Admiralty, with the {{contract}} to build her being awarded to Philemon Jacobs, of Sandgate on 7 May 1782. She was laid <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> December 1782 and launched on 18 April 1787. With there being no immediate need for a large number of ships in the navy {{after the end of the}} war with America, Alligator was gradually completed between 20 April 1787 and 18 July 1790, at first at Deptford Dockyard and then at the civilian yards of Randall & Co, at Rotherhithe. She cost a total of £2,771 with £4,330 spent on fitting costs and expenses incurred at Deptford. She commissioned under her first commander, Captain Isaac Coffin in June 1790.|$|E
25|$|Small two-decked warships, usually classed as fourth rates {{had largely}} {{fallen out of}} favour by {{the second half of}} the eighteenth century, and by the end of the century even the smaller third rates of 64 guns were being phased out. The American War of Independence led to a revival in the concept of the smaller two decked designs, as their shallow draught but comparably heavy {{armament}} compared to frigates, made them suitable for coastal warfare in the shallow waters of the North American coastline. The Roebuck class was a revival of a 1769 design by Sir Thomas Slade, with nineteen ships ordered to the design during the war, and classed as fifth rates, but not as frigates, as they carried their main armament on two decks, rather than one. Mediator was ordered from the commercial shipbuilder Thomas Raymond, of Northam, on 3 December 1779. She was laid <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> July 1780 and was launched on 30 March 1782.|$|E
500|$|Hamidiye {{was ordered}} from the Imperial Arsenal in 1871, {{originally}} {{under the name}} Nüsretiye, and was laid <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> December 1874. After the original Hamidiye, of the , was purchased by the Royal Navy, Nüsretiye was renamed Hamidiye, in honor of Sultan Abdul Hamid I. She was launched in February 1883, and was ready for sea trials, though without her armament installed, by 1893. Fitting-out work was completed the following year, when she was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet. By the time she entered service, she had been surpassed by the rapidly changing warship designs of the 1880s and 1890s, first by the turret ships such as the Italian [...] type, and then by modern pre-dreadnought battleships like the British , which began to enter service the year before Hamidiye was commissioned. Moreover, Hamidiye was equipped with poor quality armor, and difficult to handle, so she was employed as a stationary training ship for torpedo boat crews. In addition, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, {{who had come to}} power in 1876 {{as a result of a}} coup in which the Navy had played a major role, distrusted the Navy and reduced its budgets to the minimum.|$|E

Following what was {{standard}} procedure, Col Hathaway gave orders for the 15 VC KIA to be buried [...] "before they became a health hazard." [...] Major Donald Potter, 1-46 Inf's executive officer, issued instructions that the bodies be buried in an eroded section near the resupply LZ. For reasons that never become clear, five of the bodies were transported instead to the base trash dump. By the time this was noticed, it was past 1200 and the bodies were beginning to bloat in the heat. Rather than move the bodies again, Maj Potter instructed the commander of Company D to [...] "go on and burn them <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the trash dump." [...] Burning the bodies of enemy combatants is considered a war crime, but Potter did not seem to realize this.|$|E

The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti, Bakhtiyar Kaki, Baba Farid, Nizamuddin Auliya (each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history. Moinuddin Chishtī turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached Ajmer along with Sultan Shahāb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori, and settled <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring {{a great deal of respect}} amongst the residents of the city. Moinuddin Chishtī practiced the Sufi Sulh-e-Kul (peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.|$|E

2500|$|On February 15, 2012, Korine {{contacted}} rapper Riff Raff about {{appearing in}} an upcoming film of his which {{would turn out to}} be Spring Breakers. Once the trailer was released there was speculation that the character Alien was based around Riff Raff. According to Franco, his character is based on the underground rap artist Dangeruss, who has a cameo in the film. [...] "Of course Harmony and I looked at some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at. I would say the biggest influence on the role was this local Florida rapper named Dangeruss. He's fairly unknown, but he was <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the place, living the life, and he became the biggest model for me, and he's in the movie."

2500|$|Academy Award nominee, screenwriter and {{director}} Josh Olson, most {{famous for his}} screenplay for A History of Violence, made a video review of Sorcerer for the Trailers from Hell webseries in 2007. He praised the movie highly, stating that it is Friedkin's best effort ("Sorcerer is Friedkin {{at the top of}} his game") and was [...] "at least equal to the original." [...] He also applauded the atmosphere, which he said had [...] "a wonderful tone to it and a real sense of dread and desperation [...] it's tight and suspenseful, every scene grabs you by the collar, and it's beautifully shot. You can feel the humidity <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> South America. You can feel the sweat on the sticks of dynamite." [...] He concluded the review by saying that the only aspect in which the movie failed was the fact that it came out around the same time as Star Wars. Olson felt that [...] "the movie deserved a huge audience" [...] as well as fantasizing that [...] "somewhere there's an alternate universe where Sorcerer is a massive game-changing hit in Hollywood and I'm doing Trailers from Hell commentary on some unknown cult classic called Star Wars. In that world Hollywood has spent the next 30 years making smart, edgy movies for grown-ups, the literacy rate is 100%, we haven't been in a war since Vietnam and world hunger is just a memory." ...|$|E
