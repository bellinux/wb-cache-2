5|$|Seaborg {{also became}} {{an expert in}} dealing with noted Berkeley {{physicist}} Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation, and often answered a junior man's question before it <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.|$|E
5|$|The Navy, however, {{still had}} a {{requirement}} for a ship capable of defeating enemy cruisers and the original concept was revived as Project 69. The proposed size of the ship continually escalated as the requirement was revised {{to allow it to}} fight larger ships like the German s. The preliminary design was finally approved in January 1939 and two ships were laid down in November 1939, before the detailed design <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> approved.|$|E

5|$|The film's soundtrack {{started an}} oldies music revival, {{and demand for}} the album caught RCA Records by surprise. According to Franke Previte, before a single <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> released, there were a million albums on back-order. The Dirty Dancing album spent 18weeks at numberone on the Billboard 200 album sales charts and went {{platinum}} eleven times, selling more than 32 million copies worldwide. It spawned a follow-up multi-platinum album in February 1988, entitled More Dirty Dancing.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception of}} Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C. Calhoun, snubbed the Eatons because they married so soon after John Timberlake's death, rather than waiting for the usual {{mourning}} period; there were stories that Eaton and Peggy Timberlake had been having an affair before John Timberlake had died. Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> a prostitute. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at which she would be present. According to Emily Donelson, Eaton considered resigning in {{the first months of}} the administration.|$|E

5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle of Melrose reports Clement's death {{under the}} year 1258. Clement's legacy {{was to be}} remembered as the restorer of the diocese of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, though there is no record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning that was almost {{certainly}} believed to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by Walter Bower, a Lowland Scottish historian writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely three times a week, as if it were some rural chapel. He built it up to be a hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding prebends and canonries. Such flattering sentiments <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a hagiography of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.|$|E

25|$|During Dvořák's life, {{only five}} of his symphonies were widely known. The first {{published}} was his sixth, dedicated to Hans Richter. After Dvořák's death, research uncovered four unpublished symphonies, of which the manuscript of the first <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> lost to the composer himself. This led to an unclear {{situation in which the}} New World Symphony has alternately been called the 5th, 8th and 9th. This article uses the modern numbering system, according to the order in which the symphonies were written.|$|E
25|$|After Ernani, Verdi had {{considered}} {{a large number}} of projects for the future and the Byron play was one of them. Foscari <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> considered as early as 1843 when he had been approached by La Fenice in Venice, but it was rejected as unsuitable because the story included criticism of actions of the Republic of Venice which may have been offensive to the great families who had governed the Republic, including the extant Foscari family.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} {{had been}} long before selected, and {{the whole of the}} ground <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> surveyed, with a view to meet the contingency which had now actually occurred; but then it must be remembered, that in this design the co-operation of the IV Corps (Bülow's) was fully expected, whereas the latter had now become a doubtful question: and hence it was that Blücher was led to place more reliance upon a direct support from Wellington, than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the early}} 1990s {{collapse}} of Canadian stocks, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) banned fishing for northern (that is, cod {{to the north}} and east of the island of Newfoundland, in Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization areas JKL) cod in 1992, which caused great economic hardship in Newfoundland and Labrador. The collapse was blamed on cold water, or seals, and it <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> suggested the cod were really still there; only rarely was overfishing acknowledged, or management's role in that.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{official}} entry of other nations, the American Revolutionary War {{was by no}} means confined to American soil; naval operations, by both the Continental Navy and privateers, ranged across the Atlantic.

Captain Day <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> accorded a gun salute by the French admiral at Brest.|$|E

The double-track Lancaster Canal Tramroad was opened in 1803 with three steam-worked inclined planes and a low trestle bridge across the Ribble. The canal was extended north from Johnson's Hillock to Walton Summit through a tunnel at Whittle Hills.|$|E
25|$|There {{were some}} {{questions}} about whether Sky <b>had</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> in the car that morning to begin with.

Solomon was not aware of anyone having seen his son other than his ex-wife since an April doctor visit. However, Maile told the police that Sky had indeed been in the car that morning.|$|E
