5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing Interstate 495 in Massachusetts), but it may someday be surpassed in length by Interstate 369 in Texas. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as Interstate 83 <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Pennsylvania, Interstate 99 in Pennsylvania, Interstate 12 in Louisiana, Interstate 19 in Arizona, Interstate 97 <b>in</b> <b>Maryland,</b> <b>and</b> Interstate 2 in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs.|$|E
5|$|I-81, {{like all}} Interstate highways, {{is a part}} of the National Highway System for its entire length. It is the {{shortest}} mainline Interstate <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> contains the shortest portion of I-81 of all six states through which the Interstate highway passes. The Interstate was dedicated as Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway in 1987.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 2008, {{advocacy}} groups <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> New York, and their federal representatives, pushed for legislation to establish two national historical parks honoring Harriet Tubman: one to include her {{place of birth}} on Maryland's eastern shore, and sites along {{the route of the}} Underground Railroad in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties in Maryland; and a second to include her home in Auburn, NY. For the next six years, bills to do so were introduced, but were never advanced or enacted. Meantime, in 2013, President Barack Obama used his executive authority to create the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument, consisting of federal lands on Maryland's Eastern Shore at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

Nine years later, the Institute became Baldwin University. He moved to Kansas around 1857, laying the foundation for Baldwin City, Kansas, as well as Baker University. In his later life, he purchased a Louisiana plantation, and made contributions to education in India late in his life.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common <b>in</b> <b>Maryland,</b> <b>and</b> Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania MÃ¤nnerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reported}} stations for box huckleberry fall within the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Delaware {{were found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1750, Mason married Ann Eibeck, {{only child}} of William and Sarah Eibeck of Charles County, Maryland.

At the time of his marriage, Mason was living at Dogue's Neck, though in which residence is uncertain. George and Ann Mason would have nine children who survived to adulthood. Ann Mason died in 1773; their marriage, judging by surviving accounts, was a happy one.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of I-68 began in 1965 and continued for over 25years, with completion on August 2, 1991. While {{the road was}} under construction, {{it was predicted that}} economic conditions would improve along the corridor for the five counties connected by I-68: Allegany, Garrett, and Washington <b>in</b> <b>Maryland,</b> <b>and</b> Preston and Monongalia in West Virginia. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown, West Virginia, and Cumberland, Maryland. Although the freeway serves no major metropolitan areas, it provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Washington, D.C., {{were among the}} most {{damaging}} from a tropical cyclone in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, United States. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day.|$|E
5|$|Though Gloria {{moved quickly}} through the region, it dropped {{moderate}} rainfall in locations, including 6.04 inches (153 mm) at BaltimoreâWashington International Airport. In addition, some unofficial reports in southeastern Virginia indicated amounts of up to 8 inches (200 mm) of rain. Because much of the Mid-Atlantic experienced the western, weaker side of this hurricane, damage was relatively light. High winds downed numerous trees throughout the area, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, including 237,000 in New Jersey, 124,000 <b>in</b> <b>Maryland,</b> <b>and</b> 56,000 in Virginia. Extreme rainfall in Virginia resulted in $5.5 million (1985 USD) in damage. Intense flood waters split Long Beach Island in half {{for a period of}} time.|$|E

5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Twin Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland Geological Survey {{was formed}} in 1896 to study the state's natural resources. Within two years, the agency {{determined}} that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state's transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, {{also known as the}} Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of macadam roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms to {{the north}} of the {{circulation}} brought moderate rainfall to Maryland; the same thunderstorms caused a light aircraft to crash near Baltimore, resulting in the death of its three occupants. Rainfall spread across much of Maryland, peaking at 4.24in (105mm) in Hollywood. Tropical storm force winds extended into Delaware, and a peak wind gust of 75mph (121km/h) was reported in Rehoboth Beach. Only isolated and minor damage occurred <b>in</b> <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Delaware. In New Jersey, a hurricaneforce wind gust was reported on Long Beach Island, and 1.3in (33mm) of rainfall was reported in Atlantic City. In the southernmost counties in the state, the winds left about 15,000electrical customers without power. In New York, after Hurricane Gloria in the previous season left thousands of customers without power, the Long Island Lighting Co. arranged for additional workers for potential power restoration. Light rainfall and gusty winds extended into the New York metropolitan area.|$|E
