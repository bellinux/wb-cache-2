30|$|Along with {{residential}} {{heating and}} pool attendance, geothermal water {{is used in}} a variety of different ways and has far reaching socioeconomic as well as cultural implications, such as reducing ecological footprints by supplying foodstuff: vegetables, fruit in greenhouses, fish farming, enabling production of certain health care products and even turning it into <b>fuel</b> <b>fit</b> for cars. The crucial point here for innovation is not to be stuck in the distinction between non-renewables and renewables as alternatives, but to focus on how different natural processes are appropriate for different purposes. As an innovation scholar, von Hippel (2006) stresses: “Users that innovate can develop exactly what they want, rather than relying on manufacturers to act as their (often very imperfect) agents”. The possibilities to serve articulated needs increase as the direct use of geothermal energy becomes more controllable. A tomato is no longer a tomato but various strains, cherry tomato or plum tomato.|$|R
40|$|Correlations of {{hydrogen}} content with aromatics content, heat of combustion, and smoke point are derived for some synthetic fuels prepared from oil and coal syncrudes. Comparing {{the results of}} the aromatics content with correlations derived for petroleum fuels shows that the shale-derived <b>fuels</b> <b>fit</b> the petroleum-based correlations, but the coal-derived fuels do not. The correlations derived for heat of combustion and smoke point are comparable to some found for petroleum-based correlations. Calculated values {{of hydrogen}} content and of heat of combustion are obtained for the synthetic fuels by use of ASTM estimation methods. Comparisons of the measured and calculated values show biases in the equations that exceed the critical statistics values. Comparison of the measured hydrogen content by the standard ASTM combustion method with that by a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method shows a decided bias. The comparison of the calculated and measured NMR hydrogen contents shows a difference similar to that found with petroleum fuels...|$|R
50|$|A 250-litre <b>fuel</b> tank is <b>fitted</b> as standard, but {{additional}} tanks {{sizes of}} 170 and 250 litres were available. The tank {{is equipped with}} a filter that separates water from fuel.|$|R
50|$|When {{launched}} the car proposed several problems. The {{first of the}} problems with the coupe is engine access which because the car is a mid rear arrangement proposed several problems and made the car hard to work on, it is reported that the subframe had to be removed in order to work on the engine. The second problem is the KV6 powerplant which had to have a bespoke smaller <b>fuel</b> tank to <b>fit</b> in the engine bay as the standard <b>fuel</b> tank wouldn't <b>fit,</b> although disputed as to whether the car received the KV6 powerplant in the first place.|$|R

The company {{was the first}} to create a subsidiary to market and sell its vehicles in the country, and the first to manufacture automobiles in North America.|$|R
5000|$|Conformal {{fuel tanks}} (CFTs) are {{additional}} <b>fuel</b> tanks <b>fitted</b> {{closely to the}} profile of an aircraft that extend either the range or [...] "time on station" [...] of the aircraft. CFTs have a reduced aerodynamic penalty compared to external drop tanks, and do not significantly increase an aircraft's radar cross-section. Another advantage of CFTs provide {{is that they do}} not occupy ordnance hardpoints like drop tanks, allowing the aircraft to carry its full payload.|$|R
50|$|On 25 December 2001, a Agusta A109 {{helicopter}} G-DPPH {{operated by}} Dyfed-Powys Air Support Unit crash landed near Cross Hands in Carmarthenshire when both engines stopped due to fuel starvation. The fuel starvation {{resulted from a}} defective fuel pump and incorrect measures taken to manage cross feeding arrangements between the <b>fuel</b> tanks <b>fitted</b> to the helicopter. The civilian pilot and one of two police officer observers on board escaped with minor injuries, the second police officer observer was unharmed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} wood, with some parts fabricated from carbon fibre. The standard engine available is the [...] Rotax 582 two-stroke powerplant. Two 25 L <b>fuel</b> tanks are <b>fitted.</b> The aircraft was designed for aerobatics and stressed to +6 and -5g.|$|R

5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary <b>fuel</b> tanks <b>fitted</b> in the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|R
