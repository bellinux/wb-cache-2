5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

500|$|Although Warner Brothers studio {{had assumed}} that the many costumed films that studios like MGM had earlier {{produced}} would never succeed {{during the years of}} the Great Depression, they nonetheless took a chance by producing Captain Blood in 1935. The film is a swashbuckler action drama based on the popular novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz. It would star a then unknown extra, Errol Flynn, alongside the little-known de Havilland. According to film historian Tony Thomas, both actors had [...] "classic good looks, cultured speaking voices, and a sense of distant aristocracy about them". Filmed between August 5 and October 29, 1935, Captain Blood gave deHavilland the opportunity to appear in her first costumed historical romance and adventure epic, a genre to which she was well suited, given her beauty and elegance. In the film, she played Arabella Bishop, the niece of a Jamaica plantation owner, who purchases at auction an Irish physician wrongly condemned to servitude. The on-screen chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn was evident from their first scenes together, where clashes between her character's spirited hauteur and his character's playful braggadocio did not mask their mutual attraction to each other. Arabella is a feisty young woman who knows what she wants and is willing to <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The bantering tone of their exchanges in the filmthe healthy give-and-take and mutual respectbecame the basis for their on-screen relationship in subsequent films. Captain Blood was released on December 28, 1935, and received good reviews and wide public appeal. DeHavilland's performance was singled out in The New York Times and Variety. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The popular success of the film, as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple, led to seven additional collaborations.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, the state of Missouri had chosen not to secede from the Union but not to <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> or against it either: its position, as determined by an 1861 constitutional convention, was officially neutral. Missouri, however, had been the scene of much of the agitation about slavery leading up to the outbreak of the war, and was home to dedicated partisans from both sides. In the mid-1850s, local Unionists and Secessionists had begun to battle each other throughout the state, {{and by the end of}} 1861, guerrilla warfare erupted between Confederate partisans known as [...] "bushwhackers" [...] and the more organized Union forces. The Missouri State Guard and the newly elected Governor of Missouri, Claiborne Fox Jackson, who maintained implicit Southern sympathies, were forced into exile as Union troops under Nathaniel Lyon and John C. Frémont took control of the state. Still, pro-Confederate guerrillas resisted; by early 1862, the Unionist provisional government mobilized a state militia to fight the increasingly organized and deadly partisans. This conflict (fought largely, though not exclusively, between Missourians themselves) raged until after the fall of Richmond and the surrender of General Robert E. Lee, costing thousands of lives and devastating broad swathes of the Missouri countryside.|$|E
