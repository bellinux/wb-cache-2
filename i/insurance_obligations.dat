40|$|Construction {{projects}} are generally {{designed as a}} general contract or a complete contract. In a general contract the commercial contract {{that is being used}} is AB 04 and related advice and instructions, AMA AF 07. In AB 04 there is an insurance requirement that stipulates that the contractor shall take all risks and liability insurance for the contract where the client must be co-insured. Construction law is almost exclusively regulated by the various standard contracts, one of those is AB 04. The Construction Contracts Committe is an organization that has published the standard contracts in this area of law and also the advice and instructions to help the parties to understand the agreements. The insurance requirement occurs in an area of law that is complex and the meaning of the concept is not entirely clear, nor which of the parties’ interests and responsibilities that are covered by the types of insurances that are provided by the insurance requirement. This can create problems for the contractor and his client because the possibility exists that neither party knows what protection, or the extent of that protection, that the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> provides for the contract. The essay investigates the meaning and consequence of the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> by discussing how the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> is portrayed by the literature that is published in this field of law. To investigate the meaning of the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> it is in my opinion important to also describe the meaning of the insured interest, some of the different types of liability that the parties may have and also the meaning of minimum coverage that are possible to have with the two types of insurance. Insurance terms from two different insurance companies, If and Zurich, is compared with the minimum of coverage possible in AMA AF 07 to determine wheter the insurance terms are compatible whit AMA AF 07 and the consequences that occur for the policyholder in the event that the insurance terms are not compatible...|$|R

The basis of this article is a new framework including a minimum <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> (basis health care for all) with freedom to choose between different health insurances and benefit structures and through different service packages. The minimum <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> includes more competition within the production of health services, a decoupling of contributions from the wage bill and the build-up of more capital.

40|$|The Solvency II {{directive}} {{requires that}} insurance liabilities are valued using a best estimate plus a risk margin.

The unitary cost of capital applied to the future capital requirement should be fixed. This paper deals with conceptual issues relating to the risk margin estimate through the cost of capital approach. It shows that the Solvency II specification of the methodology is consistent with financial economics. However, the theoretical framework required (a frictionless and normally distributed world) is too far-fetched to be acceptable.

The legal position {{of this type of}} bicycle in the Netherlands is, at this moment in time, dual. According to the Road Traffic Act, it is a `normal' bicycle for which the behavioural rules for cyclists apply. According to the Dutch Motor Vehicle Liability Law, however, it is a bicycle with an auxiliary-engine and, just like light mopeds, insurance is obligatory. Many are of the opinion, however, that the electrically assisted bicycle is more like a bicycle than a light moped. The <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> therefore makes purchasing this bicycle type more difficult, whereas it is a environmentally friendly means of transport. The Ministry of Justice maintains that the electrically assisted bicycle can be exempted from insurance, if it appears that riding this bicycle type presents no extra danger to the other road users than an ordinary bicycle. In this study, the accident risk of electrically assisted bicycles both for the riders themselves and for other road users was estimated.

40|$|Return {{guarantee}} {{constitutes a}} key ingredient of classical life insurance premium calculation. In the current low interest rate environment insurers face increasingly strong {{financial incentives to}} reduce guaranteed returns embedded in life insurance contracts. However, return guarantee lowering efforts are restrained by associated demand effects, since a higher guaranteed return makes the net price of the insurance cover lower. This tradeoff between possibly higher future <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations</b> {{and the possibility of}} a larger demand for life insurance products can theoretically also be considered when determining optimal guaranteed returns. In this paper, optimality of return guarantee levels is analyzed from a solvency point of view. Availability and some other properties of optimal solutions for guaranteed returns are explored and compared in a simple model for two measures of solvency risk (company-level and contract-level VaR). The paper concludes that a solvency risk minimizing optimal guaranteed return may theoretically exist, although its practical availability can be impeded by economic and regulatory constraints...|$|E
40|$|Compulsory insurance” is not {{a recent}} {{invention}} in insurance law; rather, from traditional motor vehicle insurance to newly developed international Conventions, there is continuing expansion in ways of applying the compulsory insurance obligation.

The paper begins by considering the necessity of the compulsory insurance obligation, {{as well as its}} potential drawbacks; this is followed by discussing a number of key issues, including the subject matter insured, the principle of direct action, the choice of liability regime, and the certificate of insurance. It concludes that a uniform solution to the issues discussed in the paper may be achieved under international Conventions, whereas varying legislation on a domestic level may provide differing answers to these issues, mostly due to the impact of political, economic, environmental or other external influences.

40|$|In the United States {{the risk}} that a {{financial}} breakdown {{could lead to a}} taxpayer bailout of the deposit insurance fund has been cited to justify current regulatory controls on what activities may be affiliated with banks. Despite some regulatory changes in the 1990 s to protect taxpayers from future debacles, however, widespread failures could still expose taxpayers to losses.; This article proposes a new way to monitor the deposit insurance fund by having the FDIC issue capital notes. Because the interest paid on the notes would be suspended if the fund required a loan from the Treasury or eliminated if taxpayer funds were contributed to offset deposit insurance losses, noteholders would have more incentive to clearly signal the condition of the insurance fund. This signal would help regulators, taxpayers, and their congressional representatives monitor the health of the fund and would change the incentive structure facing FDIC directors.

40|$|We {{construct}} the Valuation Portfolio (VaPo) for the runoff of a non-life insur-ance company. The VaPo represents {{the obligations of}} the insurer for the whole period of the <b>insurance</b> contract.

In this setup financial and technical risks are clearly separated.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This project will comprise a London workshop bringing together policy-makers and practitioners to explore Iran sanctions {{in the specific}} context of the <b>insurance</b> industry. The <b>obligation</b> to comply with sanctions constitutes an important commercial consideration with numerous associated challenges that vary considerably according to sector. Implementation can be costly and complex and {{it can be difficult to}} determine whether compliance policies and procedures meet the challenges. However, the consequences of being found in non-compliance with sanctions are significant. Firms thus have a strong interest in fully understanding and keeping pace with intricate and rapidly-evolving sanctions regimes. The workshop will further industry knowledge and understanding with regard to the challenges associated with sanctions and their effective implementation. The workshop will also benefit policy-makers. Sanctions are as much a political tool as an economic one and the political symbolism associated with implementing sanctions means that policy-makers are often required to legislate on sanctions regimes without sufficient time to fully consider the challenges that these regimes will pose to commercial stakeholders. The workshop will offer policy-makers an opportunity to better understand and thus mitigate the challenges posed by sanctions to industry...|$|R
