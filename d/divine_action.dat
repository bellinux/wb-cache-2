This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
500|$|Gregory, {{following}} Basil, {{defined the}} Trinity as [...] "one essence [...] in three persons [...] ", the formula {{adopted by the}} Council of Constantinople in 381. Like the other Cappadocian Fathers, he was a homoousian, and Against Eunomius affirms {{the truth of the}} consubstantiality of the trinity over Eunomius' Aristotelian belief that the Father's substance is unengendered, whereas the Son's is engendered. According to Gregory, the differences between the three persons of the Trinity reside in their relationships with each other, and the triune nature of God is revealed through <b>divine</b> <b>action</b> (despite the unity of God in His action). The Son is therefore defined as begotten of the Father, the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father and the Son, and the Father by his role as progenitor. However, this doctrine would seem to subordinate the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to the Son. Robert Jenson suggests that Gregory implies that each member of the Godhead has an individual priority: the Son has epistemological priority, the Father has ontic priority and the Spirit has metaphysical priority. Other commentators disagree: Morwenna Ludlow, for instance, argues that epistemic priority resides primarily in the Spirit in Gregory's theology.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its early}} days, this notion was greatly {{influenced}} {{the philosophy of}} German idealism, from which its founders drew much inspiration: belief in humanity marching toward {{a full understanding of}} itself and the divine, manifested in moral progress towards perfection.

Geiger conceived revelation as occurring via the inherent [...] "genius" [...] of the People Israel, and his close ally Solomon Formstecher described it as the awakening of oneself into full consciousness of one's religious understanding. The American theologian Kaufmann Kohler also spoke of the [...] "special insight" [...] of Israel, almost fully independent from direct divine participation, and English thinker Claude Montefiore, founder of Liberal Judaism, reduced revelation to [...] "inspiration", according intrinsic value only to the worth of its content while [...] "it is not the place where they are found that makes them inspired."

One, that houses do not propagate, so as to produce continuing lines of each sort and variety; but this is of small moment on Agassizs view, he holding that genealogical connection is not of the essence of a species at all.

50|$|From the {{earliest}} times in known civilizations, {{events in the}} natural world were expressed through a collection of stories concerning everyday life. In ancient times, a mortal world existed alongside an upper world of spirits and gods acting through nature to create a unified and intersecting moral and natural cosmos. Humans, living in a world that was acted upon by free acting and conspiring gods of nature, attempted to understand their world and the <b>actions</b> of the <b>divine</b> by observing and correctly interpreting natural phenomena, such as the motion and position of stars and planets. Efforts to interpret and understand divine intentions led mortals to believe that intervention and influence over godly acts was possible—either through religious persuasion, such as prayer or gifts, or through magic, which depended on sorcery and the manipulation of nature in order to bend the will of the gods. Knowing divine intentions and anticipating <b>divine</b> <b>actions</b> through the manipulation of the natural world was believed achievable and the most effective approach. Thus, mankind had a reason to know nature.|$|R
50|$|In Cartesian philosophy, {{the phrase}} deus deceptor is {{sometimes}} used {{to discuss the}} possibility of an evil God that seeks to deceive us. This character is related to a skeptical argument as to how much we can really know if an evil demon were attempting to thwart our knowledge. Another is the deus otiosus ("idle god"), a theological concept used to describe the belief in a creator god who largely retires from the world and is no longer involved in its daily operation. A similar concept is that of the deus absconditus ("hidden god") of Thomas Aquinas. Both refer to a deity whose existence is not readily knowable by humans through either contemplation or examination of <b>divine</b> <b>actions.</b> The concept of deus otiosus often suggests a god who has grown weary from involvement in this world and who has been replaced by younger, more active gods, whereas deus absconditus suggests a god whom humans are incapable of seeing, or who has consciously left this world to hide elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|In Plato’s Republic, Socrates and his interlocutors {{assign to}} poetry an {{important}} educational {{task in the}} envisioned just state, but then find the existing poetry mostly unsuitable for it. Examining how poets speak about the gods, Socrates directs at Hesiod the criticism that he »did not speak falsely well« (377 e 7) when narrating the actions of Uranus and Cronus. We may find this criticism surprising: the poet is not reproached for speaking falsely about the actions of these two gods, but for not speaking falsely well about them. It seems, therefore, that Socrates would not disapprove of Hesiod’s false speaking, provided that the poet spoke falsely well. In order to clarify Socrates’ criticism, it is first examined what it means, {{in the case of}} Hesiod, »to speak falsely« (as opposed to »speaking truly«), and then what it means »not to speak falsely well« (as opposed to »speaking falsely well«). Relying on some further arguments by Socrates, a distinction is made between two kinds of claims that can be made about the gods: claims about what the gods are like and claims about what they did. As this paper tries to show, it is acceptable to Socrates if poets speak falsely about what the gods did (for, because there is no knowing about the <b>divine</b> <b>actions,</b> {{it is not possible to}} speak truly about this, as is suggested at 382 c 10 –d 3), but not about what they are like (for what we do know about the divine nature is that it is good and therefore cannot cause evil, and so it must be spoken of, as is argued at 379 b 1 – 16). It turns out, therefore, that poets speak falsely well about what the gods did when they attribute good actions to them, i. e. such actions as they could in fact have done: doing so, the poets speak falsely about what the gods did, but implicitly speak truly about what they are like. As Hesiod attributed bad actions to Uranus and Cronus, he implicitly spoke of the gods as capable of evil. Therefore he did not speak falsely only about the <b>divine</b> <b>actions,</b> but, implicitly, also about the nature of the divine. That is why he did not speak falsely well...|$|R
