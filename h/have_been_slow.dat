5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E

The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E

25|$|Verbal Behavior had an uncharacteristically cool reception, {{partly as}} a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms.

25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E

25|$|Re-localization of {{manufacturing}} infrastructure by multinational corporations (MNCs) to low-cost countries {{has led to}} de-industrialisation. The reduction of human intervention through automation of production and logistics processes has reduced employment opportunities. Differing taxation regimes within the European Union have led to aggressive tax optimization and avoidance by conglomerates and small and medium-sized enterprises. Favourable commercial tax credit agreements and the rampant misuse of special purpose entity (SPE) based in certain EU28 member States (UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxemburg & Belgium) have allowed large corporations to avoid, minimise or indefinitely defer tax dues. Populist movements all over the European Union have campaigned for policies which target loopholes allowing tax avoidance by transnational corporations and scrutinize incentives and subsidies given to factories where automation {{of manufacturing}} processes has improved productivity and enriched share-holders but diminished job prospects for non-specialized workers. Governments <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> {{to move away from}} neoliberal policies and adopt measures which advance the public good of local communities through public-private initiatives which nurture grass-roots innovation, promote social partnering entrepreneurship and sustain job creation in self-employing SMEs.|$|E
25|$|Even if the Royal Navy {{had been}} neutralised, {{the chances of}} a {{successful}} amphibious invasion across the Channel were remote. The Germans had no specialised landing craft, and would have had to rely primarily on river barges to lift troops and supplies for the landing. This would have limited the quantity of artillery and tanks that could be transported and restricted operations to times of good weather. The barges were not designed for use in open sea and, even in almost perfect conditions, they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> and vulnerable to attack. There were also not enough barges to transport the first invasion wave nor the following waves with their equipment. The Germans would have needed to immediately capture a port in full working order, a highly unlikely circumstance considering the strength of the British coastal defences around the southeastern harbors at that time and the likelihood the British would have demolished the docks in any port from which they had to withdraw. The British also had several contingency plans, including the use of poison gas.|$|E
25|$|Netball is {{the most}} popular women's sport in Botswana, Malawi and Tanzania. In Botswana netball is {{primarily}} played by women, with men traditionally serving as officials, coaches and administrators for the sport. There are also a few men-only teams, although many were discontinued in the 2000s in favour of mixed-gender teams. The Botswana Netball Association as founded in the 1970s and is the national organisation responsible for netball in Botswana. Netball was introduced to Tanzania after World War I, when the country was under British colonial rule. All primary schools in the country have a court and children are generally recruited to high level teams at a young age. The Netball Association of Tanzania (CHANETA) was created in 1966 and has been mostly run by women, although men can play a role in coaching. During the 1970s and 1980s, the International Olympic Committee and the British Council promoted netball in Tanzania, but were unwilling to investment money. Economic liberalisation saw the popularity of netball decline during the 1990s, and recent attempts to raise netball's popularity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> as sport is culturally more acceptable for men. The Tanzanian national netball team finished in third place at the 2010 Nations Cup.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict angiographic CAD. The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> to provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat {{within minutes of}} her arrival home on 17 December 2010, using [...] "sufficient force" [...] to kill her.

The injuries included cuts, bruises, and a fractured nose. Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy, and her death would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> and painful. However, he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak's initial attack on Yeates.|$|E
500|$|Those {{who argue}} that Tyrannosaurus was {{incapable}} of running estimate the top speed of Tyrannosaurus at about [...] This is still faster than its most likely prey species, hadrosaurids and ceratopsians. In addition, some advocates {{of the idea that}} Tyrannosaurus was a predator claim that tyrannosaur running speed is not important, since it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> but still faster than its probable prey. Thomas Holtz also noted that Tyrannosaurus had proportionately longer feet than the animals it hunted: duck-billed dinosaurs and horned dinosaurs. Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos. Healed Tyrannosaurus bite wounds on ceratopsian fossils are interpreted as evidence of attacks on living ceratopsians (see below). If the ceratopsians that lived alongside Tyrannosaurus were fast, that casts doubt on the argument that Tyrannosaurus {{did not have to be}} fast to catch its prey.|$|E
