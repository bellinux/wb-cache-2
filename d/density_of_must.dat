However, when looking at the Wolbachia-host associations, the Trichogramma-Wolbachia form a monophyletic group based on several Wolbachia-specific genes, which may be explained by horizontal transfer of Wolbachia between different species. Therefore, although interspecific horizontal transfer of Wolbachia is limited in-vitro, it is likely to occur quite frequently in nature and is not well understood yet.|$|R

The magnitude of scattering in the interarm region between l = 50 - 70 deg is comparable to that predicted by a model calculation of a 'smooth' component of interstellar turbulence.
