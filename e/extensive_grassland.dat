50|$|The {{topography}} and geology of South Africa {{is extremely}} varied, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of habitats. Due to this, South Africa enjoys high biodiversity, and is ranked sixth out of the world’s seventeen megadiverse countries. In the extreme northwest of the country is true desert, which is the southernmost end of the Namib desert, a desert that is at least 55 million years old, making it the oldest desert in the world. This arid corner intergrades into the extensive semi-arid Karoo found across much of South Africa, covering the Northern Cape and into parts of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and the Free State. This biome used to be <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> in the past, but has become dominated by small shrubs and succulents due to centuries of overgrazing. To the north and east of these biomes is the Kalahari, which is mainly semi-arid woodland, dominated by thorn trees of the genus Acacia. The north-east and eastern parts of South Africa (Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Kwa-Zulu Natal)is covered with savanna and open woodlands known as bushveld. This area supports the widest variety of wildlife in the country. The most prevalent biome in South Africa is grassland, particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses and low shrubs. In this biome trees are rare and occur only along watercourses where fires are uncommon. Towards the southern coast, the vegetation is again dominated by shrubs in ecological communities known as thicket and noorsveld, where succulent species such as Euphorbia, Aloe, and Portulacaria afra are common, as well as Cape honeysuckle Tecoma capensis and Cape leadwort Plumbago auriculata. To the west, the vegetation intergrades into Mediterranean shrubland known locally as fynbos, dominated mainly by plant families rare in other habitats, such as Proteaceae, Ericaceae and Restionaceae. Here the vegetation is made up of sclerophyllous plants which do not support much mammal or bird life. Finally, the last biome found is forest, which only covers 1% of South Africa and is concentrated around the Knysna area and scattered along the escarpment of the Drakensberg mountains upwards along Kwa-Zulu Natal.|$|E
40|$|Livestock farming {{forms an}} {{integral}} part in {{the economy of the}} Uttarakhand Himalaya and {{plays an important role in}} the mixed crop farming system. In addition, high diversity in livestock composition is the characteristic features of the mainland of Uttarakhand. The state obtains high potential of milk production because of availability of fodder as a form of <b>extensive</b> <b>grasslands,</b> which are locally known as bugyals or kharaks and fodder trees. Livestock, other than milk production, are widely used for manure, plowing fields and transportation of goods. The availability of <b>extensive</b> <b>grasslands</b> and feasible climatic conditions manifest a way for sustainable livestock farming in Uttarakhand, particularly in the temperate zone between 1400 m and 2200 m, where production of milk is high. Valley regions are generally known for rearing of drought animals with low milk producing capacity. This paper aims to discuss on the prospects of sustainable livestock farming and to trace the temporal changes that took place over the past years in terms of livestock population, composition, and the governmental policies and planning for developing livestock sector. It draws implications on these experiences for livestock planners and policy-makers and raises several research issues related to livestock sector development...|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of emission factors for many peatlands is difficult, and reliable {{data on the}} exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) between soil and atmosphere of these areas is particularly scarce. Reasons for this are the multitude of soil and land use combinations that control greenhouse gas exchange and the high effort associated with data acquisition. We investigated the greenhouse gas exchange of a peat bog restoration sequence {{over a period of}} 2 yr (July 2007 –June 2009) in an Atlantic raised bog in Northwest Germany. We set up three sites representing different land use intensities: intensive grassland (mineral fertilizer, cattle manure and 4 – 5 cuts per year); <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> (no fertilizer or manure, maximal 1 cutting per year); near-natural peat bog (almost no anthropogenic influence). We obtained seasonal and annual estimates of greenhouse gas exchange based on closed chamber measurements. CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were recorded bi-weekly, CO 2 NEE determinations were carried out 3 – 4 weekly. To get annual sums the CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were interpolated linearly while NEE was modelled. The intensive grassland site emitted 548 &plusmn; 169 g CO 2 -C m&minus; 2 in the first and 817 &plusmn; 140 g CO 2 -C m&minus; 2 in the second year. The <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> site showed a slight uptake in the first year (&minus; 148 &plusmn; 143 g CO 2 -C m&minus; 2 ), and a small emission of 88 &plusmn; 146 g CO 2 -C m&minus; 2 in the second year. In contrast to these agriculturally used sites, the near-natural site took up CO 2 -C in both years (&minus; 8 &plusmn; 68 g CO 2 -C m&minus; 2 and &minus; 127 &plusmn; 53 g CO 2 -C m&minus; 2 ). Under consideration of N 2 O and CH 4 exchange, the total average greenhouse warming potential (GWP) for 2008 amounts to 441 &plusmn; 157 g m&minus; 2 , 14 &plusmn; 152 g m&minus; 2 and 31 &plusmn; 68 g m&minus; 2 CO 2 -C-equivalent for the intensive grassland, the <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> and the near-natural site, respectively. Despite inter-annual variability, rewetting contributes considerably to mitigating GHG emission from formerly drained peatlands.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of organicfertilizers (cow manure + dung water; cattle slurry) applied in {{different}} annual doses of nitrogen (54, 84 and 120 kg/ha) by different intensities of grassland utilization (extensive – two cuts per year, medium intensive – three cuts per year, intensive – four cuts per year) on percentage of plant functional groups, dry matter yield, and forage quality. The study was performed on small-plot trial over 7 years on moderately moist grassland in the Czech Republic. The proportion of legumes was significantly higher in the treatments fertilized with cow manure + dung-water combined with medium intensive utilization and intensive utilization (10. 2 % and 10. 3 %, respectively). Fertilization significantly increased dry matter yields by 51. 9 % (cow manure + dung water) and 56 % (cattle slurry) compared with unfertilized controls (4. 81 t/ha). Grasslands fertilized with cattle slurry showed significantly higher concentration of crude protein (142. 9 g/kg) compared with unfertilized (126. 4 g/kg). <b>Extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> utilization significantly affected the increase of crude fibre concentration (up to 282. 1 g/kg), and decrease of the energy value (up to 4. 68 MJ g/kg of NEL). Organic matter digestibility was also negatively influenced by <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> utilization (61. 0 %, 65. 42 % and 67. 44 % for the extensive, medium intensive and intensive utilization, respectively).

40|$|Wetlands {{can either}} be net sinks or net sources of {{greenhouse}} gases (GHGs), depending on the mean annual water level and other factors like average annual temperature, vegetation development, and land use. Whereas drained and agriculturally used peatlands tend to be carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) sources but methane (CH 4 ) sinks, restored (i. e. rewetted) peatlands rather incorporate CO 2 , tend to be N 2 O neutral and release CH 4 . One of the aims of peatland restoration is to decrease their global warming potential (GWP) by reducing GHG emissions. We estimated the greenhouse gas exchange of a peat bog restoration sequence {{over a period of}} 2 yr (1 July 2007 – 30 June 2009) in an Atlantic raised bog in northwest Germany. We set up three study sites representing different land use intensities: intensive grassland (deeply drained, mineral fertilizer, cattle manure and 4 – 5 cuts per year); <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> (rewetted, no fertilizer or manure, up to 1 cutting per year); near-natural peat bog (almost no anthropogenic influence). Daily and annual greenhouse gas exchange was estimated based on closed-chamber measurements. CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were recorded bi-weekly, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements were carried out every 3 – 4 weeks. Annual sums of CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were estimated by linear interpolation while NEE was modelled. Regarding GWP, the intensive grassland site emitted 564 ± 255 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 and 850 ± 238 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 in the first (2007 / 2008) and the second (2008 / 2009) measuring year, respectively. The GWP of the <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland</b> amounted to − 129 ± 231 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 and 94 ± 200 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 , while it added up to 45 ± 117 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 and − 101 ± 93 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 in 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 for the near-natural site. In contrast, in calendar year 2008 GWP aggregated to 441 ± 201 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 , 14 ± 162 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 and 31 ± 75 g CO 2 –C equivalents m− 2 yr− 1 for the intensive grassland, <b>extensive</b> <b>grassland,</b> and near-natural site, respectively. Despite inter-annual variability, rewetting contributes considerably to mitigating GHG emission from formerly drained peatlands. Extensively used grassland on moderately drained peat approaches the carbon sequestration potential of near-natural sites, although it may oscillate between being a small sink and being a small source depending on inter-annual climatic variability...|$|E
