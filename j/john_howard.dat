5|$|Anzac Day, 25 April – There {{has been}} a degree of support by some in recent years for making Anzac Day, 25 April, Australia's {{national}} day, including in 1999, by Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Peter Hollingworth.

The astragalus is about 4.5mm long, broad for a talpid, and has the head oriented farther from the axis of the foot than in talpids.|$|E

5|$|Minogue was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister <b>John</b> <b>Howard</b> issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E
5|$|The NATO council {{declared}} {{the attacks on}} the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter. This marked the first invocation of Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind. Australian Prime Minister <b>John</b> <b>Howard</b> who was in Washington D.C. during the attacks invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty. The Bush administration announced a War on Terror, with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks.
