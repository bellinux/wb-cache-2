40|$|International audienceProper {{motor control}} of our own body implies a {{reliable}} representation of body parts. This information {{is supposed to be}} stored in the Body Schema (BS), a body representation that appears separate from a more perceptual body representation, the Body Image (BI). The dissociation between BS for action and BI for perception, originally based on neuropsychological evidence, has recently become <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> behavioural studies in physiological conditions. By inducing the rubber hand illusion in healthy participants, Kammers et al. (2009) showed perceptual changes attributable to the BI to which the BS, as indexed via motor tasks, was immune. To more definitively support <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> dissociable body representations in physiological conditions, here we tested for the opposite dissociation, namely, whether a tool-use paradigm would induce a functional update <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BS (via a motor localization task) without affecting the BI (via a perceptual localization task). Healthy subjects were required to localize three anatomical landmarks on their right arm, before and after using the same arm to control a tool. In addition to this classical task-dependency approach, we assessed whether preferential access to the BS could also depend upon the way positional information about forearm targets is provided, to subsequently execute the same task. To this aim, participants performed either verbally or tactually <b>driven</b> versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> and perceptual localization tasks. Results showed that both <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> and perceptual tasks were sensitive to <b>the</b> update <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forearm representation, but only when the localization task (perceptual or motor) was driven by a tactile input. This pattern reveals that <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> output is not sufficient per se, but has to be coupled with tactually mediated information to guarantee access to the BS. These findings shade a new light on <b>the</b> action-perception models <b>of</b> body representations and underlie how functional plasticity may be a useful tool to clarify their operational definition...|$|R

This paper presents the concept and implementation of a scheme that uses a real time control approach to realize <b>drive</b> synchronization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multiple <b>motors.</b> <b>The</b> basic principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control is <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> both master and slave are measured and compared {{in such a way}} to get speed synchronization of both motors regardless of different modes of operation. A new Master-Slave configuration is developed. Imperfect synchronization can be corrected on-line using ARM This paper discusses an implementation where a continuously variable speed operation is provided for <b>the</b> multiple <b>motors</b> by using a single low cost ARM controller. These controllers implement variable speed drives with minimum external hardware thus increasing the reliability. A new master-slave control scheme using ARM is developed. Imprecise synchronization the master-slave technique is designed to reduce the synchronization error under the assumption the slaves can follow the master instantly. More recently there has been a large interest in electronic synchronization, because it offers certain advantages in terms of flexibility and reliability...|$|R
40|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{complexity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{dynamic model}} <b>of</b> a planar 3 -RRR flexible parallel manipulator (FPM), {{it is often}} difficult to achieve active vibration control algorithm based on the system dynamic model. To establish a simple and efficient dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planar 3 -RRR FPM to study its dynamic characteristics and build a controller conveniently, firstly, considering <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> rigid-flexible coupling and <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> inertia at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexible intermediate link, the modal function is determined with the pinned-free boundary condition. Then, considering the main vibration modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, a high-efficiency coupling dynamic model is established on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> guaranteeing <b>the</b> model control accuracy. According to the model, <b>the</b> modal characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexible intermediate link are analyzed and compared with the modal test results. The results show that the model can effectively reflect the main vibration modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planar 3 -RRR FPM; in addition the model can be used to analyze <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> inertial and coupling forces on the dynamics model and <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> torque <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor.</b> Because this model is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less dynamic parameters, it is convenient to carry out the control program...|$|R
