This paper establishes mechanical equations for jet bits and analyzes the hydroseal of backward jets in bottom holes.

Laboratory experiments indicate that the flow rate, the angle between the backward nozzle axis and the <b>jet</b> <b>bit</b> axis, and the hole diameter are the major influencing factors; the generation of the pulling force is mainly due to the inlet pressure of the jet bit; the backward jets can significantly increase not only the pulling force but also the stability of jet bits. The pulling force would reach 8, 376 N under experimental conditions, which can steadily pull the high-pressure hose forward.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{concept for}} a mining method {{developed}} {{for a series}} of thin soft sloping seams between competent roof and floor strata is presented. The method proposed has the form of a retreating longwall where the mining method is by hydraulic sluicing. The face is essentially formed by drilling a directionally controlled borehole between gateroads. The directional drilling assembly is then removed from the drill-string and replaced by a <b>jetting</b> <b>bit</b> which is used to sluice the coal from between the borehole and the goaf. The process may then be repeated by drilling another hole parallel to the first and the process of mining operation is repeated. BACKGROUND Present longwall practice Longwall mining is a capital intensive inflexible system which can yield very high production when things go right. It is generally suitable for operation in geologically uniform situations where the panel width can be maintained and where the panel length is adequate to justify the cost of moving the machinery between panels. It is limited in the range of height in which {{it can be used to}} those that permit miners to work safely. This means about 1. 5 to 4. 0 m, or higher if top level caving is used. Longwall mining has been used on slopes to about 25 o but at these angles there is a constant battle to prevent the equipmen...|$|R
5000|$|Mud is a {{vital part}} of {{drilling}} operations. It provides hydrostatic pressure on the borehole wall to prevent uncontrolled production of reservoir fluids, lubricates and cools the drill bit, carries the drill cuttings up to the surface, forms a [...] "filter-cake" [...] on the borehole wall to prevent drilling fluid invasion, provides an information medium for well logging, and helps the drilling by fracturing the rock from the <b>jets</b> in the <b>bit.</b> To fulfill these tasks effectively, the mud contains carefully chosen additives to control its chemical and rheological properties.|$|R

The band starts to destroy the Pig Man's army of flying sharks, the Pig Man gets into a giant flying snake, when the guitar solo starts, the back of Ian's fighter <b>jet</b> gets <b>bit</b> off by a flying shark, causing him to crash. When the guitar solo finishes, Aaron starts to shoot at a flying shark with an MP5, Aaron's target flies behind John, causing Aaron to shoot John's plane multiple times, John crashes {{into the side of}} a building, Aaron's plane immediately gets destroyed by a flying shark. Ben, the last man standing, is left to fight the Pig Man one-on-one, after a small firefight, Ben's ultimate fate is a kamikaze into the flying snake.|$|R
30|$|By {{applying}} (8), {{the average}} TOB at each test region [no-kick (1), kick, and no-kick (2)] for experimental Run_ 1 and Run_ 2 are determined and summarized in Fig.  23. It {{can be observed}} that the average TOB drops when kick is experienced in the wellbore (pressure cell). This may be consequential to the lift force exerted by the air <b>jet</b> underneath the <b>bit</b> reducing the interactions between the bit and the core specimen. This reduction in interactions will lower the driving force (or TOB) required to drill the core specimen compared to the higher driving force required when the wellbore is not experiencing kick, which will thus increase the TOB.|$|R
30|$|The kick {{effects on}} the rate of {{penetration}} (ROP) {{can be observed in}} Figs.  10 and 11 of Run_ 1 and Run_ 2, respectively. As shown from point A to point B of the no-kick region 1, the ROP value is 0.055  in/s (1.4  mm/s). As soon as kick occurs (i.e. gas injection into the wellbore) the ROP drops to about 0.04 in/s (1.02  mm/s) from point B to B′, which represents about a 27 % drop. From point B′ to point C, the ROP remains constant in this kick region. When the air injection ceases at point C, the ROP increases to about 0.058  in/s (1.5  mm/s) for Run_ 1 and 0.055 in/s (1.4  mm/s) for Run_ 2 from point C to C′. This may be explained by the upthrust force, which creates an air <b>jet</b> between the <b>bit</b> and the core rock specimen, thus lifting the bit and causing minimal bit–rock interactions.|$|R
40|$|During the 12 th Five-Year Plan period (2011 â 2015), CNPC {{independently}} {{developed a}} series of new drilling equipment, tools and chemical materials for deep and ultra-deep wells, including six packages of key drilling equipment: rigs for wells up to 8000 Â m deep, quadruple-joint-stand rigs, automatic pipe handling devices for rigs for wells being 5000 / 7000 Â m deep, managed pressure drilling systems & equipment, gas/fuel alternative combustion engine units, and air/gas/underbalanced drilling systems; seven sets of key drilling tools: automatic vertical well drilling tools, downhole turbine tools, high-performance PDC bits, hybrid <b>bits,</b> <b>bit</b> <b>jet</b> pulsation devices, no-drilling-surprise monitoring system, & casing running devices for top drive; and five kinds of drilling fluids and cementing slurries: high temperature and high density water-based drilling fluids, oil-based drilling fluids, high temperature and large temperature difference cementing slurry, and ductile cement slurry system. These new development technologies have {{played an important role}} in supporting China's oil and gas exploration and development business. During the following 13 th Five-Year Plan period (2016 â 2020), there are still many challenges to the drilling of deep and ultra-deep wells, such as high temperatures, high pressures, narrow pressure window, wellbore integrity and so on, as well as the enormous pressure on cost reduction and efficiency improvement. Therefore, the future development trend will be focused on the development of efficient and mobile rigs, high-performance drill bits and auxiliary tools, techniques for wellbore integrity and downhole broadband telemetry, etc. In conclusion, this study will help improve the ability and level of drilling ultra-deep wells and provide support for oil and gas exploration and development services in China.

5000|$|From Jeff Arndt's 2001 {{interview}} with RomweberMuch {{has been said}} about rockabilly roots-rocker Dexter Romweber over the years, both positive and negative, and sorting fact from fiction is no easy undertaking. Words like [...] "crazy," [...] "possessed," [...] "frenzied," [...] and [...] "demented" [...] get thrown around quite a bit. But so do words like [...] "authentic," [...] "visionary," [...] "genuine," [...] and [...] "genius." [...] Which of these terms most accurately describes the man is up for debate. While that last g-word is thrown around way too often these days, don't be too quick to dismiss this description of Dexter. As for the man himself, Romweber seems to shrug off the attention responding simply by saying, [...] "You tend to get a reputation traveling around, playing rock-n-roll." [...] Indeed. And Dexter's credentials precede him in this department.Romweber has been [...] "travelling around, playing rock-n-roll" [...] since the mid-1980s. He and drummer Crow made up the seminal roots outfit Flat Duo Jets that hailed from Chapel Hill, NC and, for a short time, Athens, GA. Often pegged by critics and casual fans as simply rockabilly, the Duo Jets were adept at playing in a multitude of styles. Their music stemmed from a love of 1950s rock-n-roll artists like Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Elvis, et al., and they played it with passion and abandon-exactly what rock-n-roll is all about.From the start, Flat Duo Jets shows became legendary for the fierce drumming of Crow and the blazing guitar work of Romweber. The image of Crow lanky and hovering over his tiny kit, staring through his stringy black mane of hair toward Dex as he looks to the ceiling, briefly, before ripping into the opening riffs of a tune etched into the setlist inside his head is indelible. This WAS the Flat Duo Jets.What distinguished this band from other retro outfits is that the Duo Jets were not really retro at all. While their music was certainly inspired by the rock-n-roll of the 1950s, one got the feeling that nothing was calculated. There was no marketing ploy on anyone's part to capitalize on a trend or movement at the time. Dex and Crow brought the music to life with such vitality and passion that the styles did not seem antiquated in their hands. This was the genuine article. This music was alive and well.While much of the band's recorded output has a ragged, rushed feel to it, the Duo Jets were able to record some fine discs. Standouts are the Jim Dickinson-produced Go Go Harlem Baby, White Trees, and their last record, Lucky Eye, co-produced by Scott Litt and Chris Stamey. Dickinson played to the band's proven strengths on Harlem- deep grooves and rhythms, driving guitar, the interplay between Dex and Crow. The record has a spontaneous, kinetic feel to it that really captures the spirit of the band. White Trees sees the Duo <b>Jets</b> stretching a <b>bit</b> toward musical territories not previously explored by the two. The band flirts with more conventional rock song structures and a somewhat adventurous use of the recording studio, courtesy of producer Caleb Southern, with varying degrees of success.|$|R
