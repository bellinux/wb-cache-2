Estudos utilizando a flarefotometria confirmam o aumento do "flare" em olhos com tumores intra-oculares malignos e benignos. Objetivo: Avaliar a flarefotometria como auxiliar no diagnóstico diferencial de {{melanoma}} maligno e nevo de coróide, comparando-se com olhos contralaterais normais. Métodos: Foram avaliados olhos com melanoma maligno e olhos com nevo de coróide diagnosticados por meio de oftalmoscopia indireta e/ou ultra-sonografia. Os olhos normais contralaterais foram utilizados como controles. A flarefotometria foi realizada em todos os pacientes, sob midríase bilateral, utilizando equipamento Laser Flare Meter (FC 500, Kowa). Foram aplicados os testes de Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, e Spearman para análise estatística. Resultados: A média da flarefotometria nos olhos com melanoma maligno de coróide foi 17, 1 ph/ms e nos olhos normais contralaterais foi 4, 06 ph/ms. Nos olhos com nevo de coróide o valor da flarefotometria foi 6, 12 ph/ms e nos olhos contralaterais normais foi 4, 47 ph/ms. O valor da flarefotometria foi maior nos olhos com melanoma maligno e nevo quando comparado com os olhos contralaterais normais (p Introduction: Malignant intraocular {{tumors are}} associated {{with an increase in}} the aqueous flare, caused by alterations of the blood-ocular barriers through various mechanisms. Several studies have demonstrated an ocular flare increase using <b>flare</b> photometry in <b>eyes</b> with benign and malignant tumors. Purpose: To evaluate flare photometry as an adjunct method in the differential diagnosis of choroidal malignant melanoma and choroidal nevus comparing to normal control eyes. Methods: Eyes with melanoma and nevus were diagnosed by indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy and/or ultrasound were evaluated. The fellow normal eyes were used as a control. In all subject and control <b>eyes</b> <b>flare</b> photometry was performed using the Laser Flare Meter (FC 500, Kowa), under mydriasis. Statistical analysis was done using the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, and Spearman tests. Results: Thirty-one eyes with malignant melanoma and 18 eyes with nevus were evaluated. The flare photometry average in the eyes with malignant melanoma was 17. 1 ph/ms and in the control fellow eyes it was 4. 06 ph/ms. In eyes with choroidal nevus the flare photometry average was 6. 12 ph/ms and in the control fellow eyes it was 4. 47 ph/ms. The flare photometry was higher in eyes with malignant melanoma and nevus than in the fellow normal eyes (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 01). Comparing the eyes with malignant melanoma and nevus, flare photometry was significantly higher in eyes with malignant melanoma (p< 0. 001). There was a positive correlation between the tumor thickness and flare photometry (r= 0. 47).

30|$|Interestingly, while 4.5 % of Ahmed {{eyes and}} 11 % of Baerveldt <b>eyes</b> {{experienced}} uveitic <b>flares</b> {{during the early}} or late postoperative period, there were no instances of this in trabeculectomy eyes. This may well be due to sampling bias, as uveitic eyes with greater inflammation at baseline {{may be seen as}} poor candidates for trabeculectomy, and thus are more likely to receive a shunt. Alternatively, this difference may be due to aqueous shunt implants inducing more inflammation than trabeculectomy with MMC. The placement of a foreign material like silicone may incite an inflammatory response; silicone has a high affinity for plasma proteins and a tendency to activate inflammatory mediators as well as stimulate fibrosis [27, 28]. This would be particularly unfavorable in uveitic patients who are already predisposed to severe inflammation.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{clinical}} value of quantitative determination of aqueous flare {{in patients with}} uveitis by FM- 600 laser flare cell meter(LFCM). METHODS:According to clinical manifestation, 129 patients(171 eyes) with uveitis were divided into 3 groups in our hospital from July 2009 to July 2010 : 87 cases(87 eyes) in anterior uveitis group, 10 cases(20 eyes) in intermediate uveitis group, 32 cases(64 eyes) in posterior uveitis group. The other 50 cases(100 normal eyes) were in the control group. Flare in patients with uveitis at different stages was graded and measured by LFCM(FM- 600) and slit-lamp microscope. RESULTS: Flare of grade 1 +, 2 +, 3 + and 4 + were noted in 48, 35, 2 and 2 eyes in anterior uveitis patients, respectively. LFCM examination revealed that the mean flare values in anterior uveitis <b>eyes</b> with <b>flare</b> of grade 1 + and 2 + were 28. 6 ± 6. 7 pc/ms and 144. 3 ± 28. 1 pc/ms, and 5. 1 ± 1. 8 pc/ms in the control group.

40|$|Background: Pertussis is {{an acute}} {{bacterial}} {{infection of the}} respiratory tract caused by Bordetella pertussis. Without immunization and adequate therapy, the disease will evolve to severe complication. The purpose of the case report was to describe the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} severe pertussis from a Papuan infant in remote mountainous area of Papua. Case report: A 5 months old male Papuan infant, lived in the mountainous area of Papua was admitted to the hospital after 1 week of cough. No history of DPT immunization. Physical examination revealed continuous coughing, sunken fontanel, sunken <b>eyes,</b> nasal <b>flaring,</b> chest retraction, and bilateral crackles. Laboratory examination showed white blood count was 87, 600 /µL, CRP 48 mg/dL, ASTO negative. He deteriorated and referred to ICU for Mechanical Ventilation. His bronchoalveolar lavage taken at day 10 confirmed Pseudomonas from the culture and Bordetella pertussis by the PCR. Discussion: Children lived in the Honai without enough ventilation at the area of low coverage of immunization are susceptible to pneumonia. This infant was treated with Erythromicin and Ceftriaxon on admission with the idea that they will cover broad spectrum of antibacterial, atypical pneumonia or Pertussis infection. The Sputum culture from bronchoalveolar lavage showed Pseudomonas resistant to Amoxillin and Erythromicin, but sensitive to Amikacin. This finding explains why there was no clinical improvement after 2 weeks of Erythromicin. After changing to Amikacin, the clinical condition improved in 7 days. Conclusion: On the area with low immunization coverage, the pediatrician should consider Pertussis as one of the possible etiology of pneumonia, and start treating early to get the better result and avoid severe complication. It recommended that all countries should consider expanding vaccination strategies to include adding Pertussis booster doses to pre-school children (4 – 6 years old), to adolescent and to those specific adults that have the highest risk of transmitting Bordetella pertussis infection to vulnerable infants...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This prospective randomized study comprised 90 consecutive patients with age-related cataract who {{were randomly assigned to}} either Group 1 (n = 45) with BSS or Group 2 (n = 45) with RL. Observations made included measurement of central corneal thickness (CCT), presence of anterior chamber flare and cells, endothelial cell loss, and change in coefficient of variation (CV). Data was analyzed using Mann Whitney test and test of proportion. Results: Mean increase in CCT on postoperative Day 1 was 58 &#x 00 B 5;m and 97 &#x 00 B 5;m in Groups 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0. 01). Increase in CCT at one month was 10 &#x 00 B 5;m and 11 &#x 00 B 5;m in Groups 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0. 99); increase in CCT at three months was 3 &#x 00 B 5;m and 6 &#x 00 B 5;m in Groups 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0. 86). Number of <b>eyes</b> with <b>flare</b> grades in a range of 0 to 3 was statistically higher in Group 2 on postoperative Day 1 (P = 0. 004, 0. 016, &# 60; 0. 001, 0. 047 for Grade 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively).

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the inflammatory reaction after implantation of an angle-supported foldable acrylic anterior chamber IOL for myopia correction over time. Methods. Adult individuals seeking vision correction with stable myopia > 7. 0 [*]D were included. Exclusion criteria are anterior chamber depth < 2. 8 [*]mm, insufficient endothelial cell density, other preexisting ocular conditions, and prior <b>eye</b> surgery. Laser <b>flare</b> photometry and slitlamp examination were performed before {{and up to}} 1 year after implantation of an AcrySof Cachet IOL (Alcon Laboratories, Forth Worth, TX, USA). Postoperative treatment comprised antibiotic eye-drops for 5 days and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eye-drops (NSAIDs) for 4 weeks. Results. Average laser flare values of 15 consecutive eyes of 15 patients were 8. 3 ± 9. 7 preoperatively and 19. 0 ± 24. 2 (1 day), 24. 0 ± 27. 5 (1 week), 17. 6 ± 13. 4 (1 month), 14. 9 ± 15. 4 (3 months), and 10. 0 ± 7. 0 (1 year) photon counts/ms after implantation, respectively. Slitlamp examination yielded 0 or 1 + cells (SUN classification) in every one eye throughout the follow-up period. Conclusion. Results indicate a low maximum inflammatory response and a quick recovery to a long-term safe level.

60|$|We {{had little}} time, however, {{to gaze at}} this strange scene, for upon our {{appearance}} the hounds abandoned their helpless attempts to reach Saxon, and flew, with a fierce snarl of satisfaction, at Reuben and myself. One great brute, with <b>flaring</b> <b>eyes</b> and yawning mouth, his white fangs glistening in the moonlight, sprang at my horse's neck; but I met him fair with a single sweeping cut, which shore away his muzzle, and left him wallowing and writhing {{in a pool of}} blood. Reuben, meanwhile, had spurred his horse forward to meet his assailant; but the poor tired steed flinched {{at the sight of the}} fierce hound, and pulled up suddenly, with the result that her rider rolled headlong into the very jaws of the animal. It might have gone ill with Reuben had he been left to his own resources. At the most he could only have kept the cruel teeth from his throat for a very few moments; but seeing the mischance, I drew my remaining pistol, and springing from my horse, discharged it full into the creature's flank while it struggled with my friend. With a last yell of rage and pain it brought its fierce jaws together in one wild impotent snap, and then sank slowly over upon its side, while Reuben crawled from beneath it, scared and bruised, but none the worse otherwise for his perilous adventure.|$|R
