50|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Berkeley, Cottrell began consulting for the DuPont Company at its explosives- and acids-producing facility near Pinole, California, 20 {{miles north of the}} University. DuPont wanted {{to address the problem of}} precipitating the acid mists which form when sulfur trioxide is bubbled through water or dilute sulfuric acid. Using an <b>electrical</b> <b>method</b> similar to one envisioned by Sir Oliver Lodge in England, Cottrell began experimenting with electrostatic precipitation as a means of collecting sulfuric acid mists. The result of Cottrell’s work was the electrostatic precipitator, a device which could collect fly ash, dust and fumes, acid mists and fogs that spewed from turn-of-the century plants, and which became a primary means for controlling industrial air pollution. Cottrell made it work by developing a reliable high-voltage power supply and electrodes that permitted electrical energy to leak across a gas-filled chamber from many small points. In 1906, electric current was applied to a small laboratory device emitting sulfuric acid mist, and the concept became a reality. The first patent, No. 895,729, was issued on August 11, 1908. The electrostatic precipitator remains a principal technology for pollutant removal from industrial waste flows to this day.|$|E
5000|$|Compared {{to other}} green algae species, Botryococcus braunii has a {{relatively}} thick cell wall that is accumulated from previous cellular divisions; making extraction of cytoplasmic components rather difficult. Fortunately, {{much of the}} useful hydrocarbon oil is outside of the cell. acting as a biofilm to aggregate individual cells into colonies. The best method of separating the oils from the cells with minimal damage to the cells has long been sought. For some time, it has been known that hexane can perform this function. However, an <b>electrical</b> <b>method</b> may be cleaner and better overall. Electric fields have been applied in short pulses to extract hydrocarbons from other species of microalgae by weakening the cell walls. These pulses have been microseconds to milliseconds in length. In April 2017 it was reported [...] researchers at Kumamoto University in Japan have used shorter, nanosecond long pulses to target the extracellular matrix of Botryococcus braunii. They found the electric method to be less costly and less damaging to the cells than other methods. The Kunamoto scientists found that when the pulses are applied ten times per second, the optimal field strength was 50 kilovolts per centimeter and the optimal energy applied to be 55.6 Joules per milliliter of Botryococcus braunii matrix. Unfortunately, polysaccharides are also extracted from the matrix and must {{be separated from the}} oils.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Landfill is {{the major}} method of solid waste {{disposal}} in developing countries. To protect soil and groundwater from contamination, anti-seepage systems have to be installed in landfills. However, during the construction of anti-seepage system, many factors can result in holes in geomembrane liners. For the purpose of improving construction quality, the construction company needs to find the leaks in geomembrane liners and analyze the damage causes according to the positions after construction. The <b>electrical</b> <b>method</b> can effectively test the integrity of geomembrane liners. In this paper, we combine the <b>electrical</b> <b>method</b> with the wireless location technology and bring forth a leak marking scheme. The working flow of the scheme is as follows: place two acoustic transceivers on two vertexes s of the detection area; after detecting the leaks with the <b>electrical</b> <b>method,</b> calculate the leaks ’ relative coordinates in the detection area through acoustic ranging and, then, mark positions of leaks in the landfill. At last, we design acoustic signals for ranging, analyze their performance on anti-interference, and design the leak marking algorithm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn <b>electrical</b> <b>method</b> {{to measure}} {{extracellular}} bioelectrical activity in vitro is presented. This method exploits the Helmholtz capacitive double-layer {{established at the}} electrode surface. Small extracellular voltage variations {{in the order of}} μVs induce through the double-layer capacitor a displacement current that is measured. This current is then enhanced by a gain factor proportional to the electrode capacitance. In addition, when measurements are carried out at low frequencies in current mode the electrode contribution to the noise can be minimized. The performance of the electrodes and the method is demonstrated using zebrafish hearts and glioma cell cultures. We propose that this <b>electrical</b> <b>method</b> is an ideal tool to measure in vitro slow and temporally synchronized events that are often involved in long range intracellular signaling...|$|E
