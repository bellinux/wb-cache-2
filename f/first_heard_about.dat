5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E

25|$|According to Khattab's brother, he <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the Chechen {{conflict}} on an Afghan {{television channel}} in 1995; {{that same year}} he entered Chechnya, posing as a television reporter. He was credited as being a pioneer in producing video footage of Chechen rebel combat operations in order to aid fundraising efforts and demoralize the enemy.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, {{three years}} after {{submitting}} his thesis on the Kerr effect, he disobeyed the direct orders of his supervisor and used laboratory equipment to measure the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field. He was fired for his efforts, but he was later vindicated: he won the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of what has now {{become known as the}} Zeeman effect. As an extension of his thesis research, he began investigating the effect of magnetic fields on a light source. He discovered that a spectral line is split into several components {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. Lorentz <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Zeeman's observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam, where these results were communicated by Kamerlingh Onnes. The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman into his office and presented him with an explanation of his observations, based on Lorentz's theory of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1954, {{work on the}} Canal and other labor camps was halted, and beatings in prison outlawed. The Securitate was again on the alert just two years later, when de-Stalinization was officially {{introduced}} by the Soviet Union. When Romanian intellectuals <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> rumors <b>about</b> Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech, and began questioning Romania's own Stalinism, Drăghici extended secret police surveillance to the academic field.|$|R

25|$|Panahi {{directed}} Crimson Gold in 2003, {{produced by}} Jafar Panahi Productions. The film depicts an impoverished pizza delivery man's {{failed attempt to}} rob a jewelry store and the events that drove him to his crime. The story is based on real events that Panahi <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> when Kiarostami told him the story while they were stuck in a traffic jam {{on their way to}} one of Kiarostami's photographic exhibits. Panahi was extremely moved by the story and Kiarostami agreed to write the script for him to direct. Panahi submitted the film to the Cannes Film Festival without being granted a permit from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Panahi had applied for the permit but the Ministry demanded several cuts be made to the film. Panahi refused and submitted the film anyway. At the festival it won the Un Certain Regard Jury Award. It later won the Golden Hugo Award for Best Film at the Chicago International Film Festival. Like The Circle, Crimson Gold was banned in Iran.|$|E
500|$|The Honourable Virgil P. Moshansky, who {{investigated}} the crash in Dryden {{and wrote the}} report, appeared in the documentary, alleging that if the recommendations in his report had been followed, the USAir accident could have been prevented. Moshansky told the documentary that his report [...] "probably sat on somebody's [...] desk." [...] He said [...] "when I <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it I thought, my God, it's Dryden all over again ... certainly if they had followed the recommendations in my report, the F28 crash at LaGuardia could have been averted." ...|$|E

The script required the creation of new ships through Computer-generated imagery, these included a new Romulan warbird as well as a Federation freighter. Thornton had previously developed the CGI ships on Babylon 5.|$|E

'You must know, I'm in love with her,' he added resolutely." ...|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Plummer's {{longtime}} manager, Lou Pitt, {{one of the}} film’s lead producers, {{was recommended}} Alan Judd's novel The Kaiser's Last Kiss. Pitt said: “The <b>first</b> time I <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the novel was from Chris who liked the character and setting quite a lot as did I after reading it... {{this would have been}} around 2005 or 2006. At the time, the book was under option, but for good reason, we kept an eye on it.” ...|$|R

The assisted suicide storyline {{was the first}} time the subject had been addressed in a soap. Gillian Bevan, who plays Gina, explained: [...] "Gina can't bear to be a burden to her husband any longer. She is adamant that Elliot wouldn't understand her decision." [...] Although Elliot comes to understand Gina's decision, and is by her side as she dies, his relationship with his children becomes strained as a result. Sam Stockman, who plays Elliot's son James, explained in October 2007: [...] " [...] still blames Elliot for helping his Mum die and then just posting her suicide note to him, which was the <b>first</b> he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her death".|$|R
500|$|Reid {{was a fan}} of mafia movies (including The Godfather and Goodfellas) and {{aspired to}} become a film maker. Being of Irish and Italian ancestry, {{he wanted to make}} a film that would relate to both nationalities. Reid <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> mobster Danny Greene from his {{roommates}} in Ohio, and believed that New York City, Chicago and Boston were the [...] "three meccas of mafia crime". According to Reid, there wasn't much documentation on Greene's life, but after hearing that Porrello was about to publish a book on Greene and the Mafia in Cleveland, he was determined to make a movie about him.|$|E
500|$|The European {{association}} of the Maya with eschatology {{dates back to the}} time of Christopher Columbus, who was compiling a work called Libro de las profecías during the voyage in 1502 when he <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "Maia" [...] on Guanaja, an island off the north coast of Honduras. Influenced by the writings of Bishop Pierre d'Ailly, Columbus believed that his discovery of [...] "most distant" [...] lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the Apocalypse. End-times fears were widespread {{during the early years of}} the Spanish Conquest as the result of popular astrological predictions in Europe of a second Great Flood for the year 1524.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
5000|$|A Vodafone {{representative}} {{declared in}} the breaking news story on Channel 4 that “It’s the <b>first</b> we’ve <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it and naturally we’re shocked and surprised.” He {{went on to}} say that Dishfire was probably circumventing UK law. According to Channel 4's Geoff White, [...] "the Dishfire system gives GCHQ a legal loophole to get such information without needing a RIPA request. That's because the text messages are gathered and stored by the NSA - and GCHQ's access to foreign intelligence agencies' stash of data is not covered by any UK law." [...] Former UK Interception Commissioner Sir Swinton Thomas drew an analogy between this method of circumventing the UK interception laws and torture in a foreign country, adding that it was a “different area of course, but the concept is very similar”.|$|R

25|$|In January 1916, Stieglitz {{was shown}} a {{portfolio}} of charcoal drawings by a young artist named Georgia O'Keeffe. Stieglitz was so taken by her art that without meeting O'Keeffe or even getting her permission to show her works he made plans to exhibit her work at 291. The <b>first</b> that O'Keeffe <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> any of this was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year. She finally met Stieglitz after going to 291 and chastising him for showing her work without her permission.|$|R
500|$|He {{was offered}} the chance to direct Iron Man 3 for Marvel Studios but {{declined}} and instead signed on to direct Les Misérables for Working Title Films, which he had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> while discussing a different project with screenwriter William Nicholson in 2010. Hooper {{had not seen the}} musical, so watched a performance of it in London's West End. Adapted from the musical, the film starred Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Eddie Redmayne. As the film required the actors to sing and dance, they were auditioned in front of Hooper, producers and composers. The role of Fantine was hugely contested; Hooper said, [...] "It was like half a dozen of the biggest female movie stars on the planet wanted to play the role".|$|E
500|$|Wood {{said that}} she is {{sometimes}} puzzled when reading Steffy's scripts, but connects her present storyline to the character's past. She said: [...] "I just think back to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|Haynes had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> {{the film}} in 2012 from costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her production company Dirty Films Ltd., had {{been involved with the}} project for [...] "a long time". Haynes learned {{they were looking for a}} director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was so interesting to me when I first read this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind." [...] Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with guitarist Rick Nielsen, the interviewer asked if Nielsen would {{comment on the}} claim that Comita wrote the song.

He did write [...] "Reach Out (And Take It)" [...] which was on the Heavy Metal movie soundtrack. But he wrote that song with a guy named Bob James. He originally told us he had written it, but we later found out, he didn’t write it (alone)." ...|$|R

The man's face can't be seen throughout the entire video and for a period after the DVD's release there was an unconfirmed rumor that the man is pornographic actor Ian Scott. [...] When first asked by reporters about this video, Alexandratou and her manager, Menios Fourthiotis, stated that this was the <b>first</b> time they <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it and that they thought that it was a joke or a blackmail attempt.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{just said}} {{at this stage}} I don't care whether the album comes out without Los Lobos on it.

And three months passed, and {{there was no mention of}} 'joint writing.' The album came out and we heard nothing.

500|$|Spears {{spoke to}} V about the {{sessions}} for Femme Fatale, commenting {{that she had}} been recording the album for two years. During the recording sessions, the singer contacted songwriter Ester Dean in 2009, after receiving a demo of the song [...] "Drop It Low", which Spears wanted to record. The song, however, was later released as Dean's debut single. Spears then recorded two songs co-written by Dean for Femme Fatale. [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] was written by Dean, Jeremy Coleman, Joshua Coleman, Mathieu Jomphe, and Benjamin Levin, while being produced by Blanco, Ammo, JMIKE, and Billboard. It features American recording artist Sabi. Spears <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Sabi after listening to songs from The Bangz, an old music group the latter participated. Sabi explained that, after she was asked to collaborate with Spears, she felt it was so surreal that she refused to believe her luck until the song was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Miller <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the {{clearing}} of the Les Innocents cemetery {{ten years before}} writing the novel, when reading a book by French medievalist and historian, Philippe Ariès; specifically his 1977 work entitled L'Homme devant la mort, or The Hour of Our Death. Ariès' book did not go into {{a great deal of}} detail concerning this actual event, however Miller was [...] "taken by the theatricality" [...] of it and decided to write a novel based around the exhumation. In an interview with Kira Cochrane he stated the novel [...] "appealed to [...] as being interesting, visually interesting", stating [...] "it was when it all happened that made it stand out. It's the 1780s, a few years before the French revolution". Miller further stated that his father's occupation as a doctor also had some bearing in his interest in the human body, stating [...] "I grew up looking at these things – my Beano and Dandy were the BMJ and The Lancet". Miller decided not to include any French dialogue in the novel as [...] "it is so pretentious" [...] in an English-language novel, stating [...] "I was afraid that my editor would strike it out".|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} The Understudy {{was written}} by Andres Heinz; Aronofsky <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it while editing his second film Requiem for a Dream (2000) and described it as [...] "All About Eve with a double, set in the off-Broadway world." [...] After making The Fountain (2006), Aronofsky and producer Mike Medavoy had screenwriter John McLaughlin rewrite The Understudy; Aronofsky said McLaughlin [...] "took my idea of Swan Lake and the ballet and put [...] into the ballet world and changed the title to Black Swan." [...] When Aronofsky proposed a detailed outline of Black Swan to Universal Pictures, the studio decided to fast-track development of the project in January 2007. The project [...] "sort of died, again" [...] according to Aronofsky, until after the making of The Wrestler (2008), when he had Mark Heyman, director of development of Aronofsky's production company Protozoa Pictures, write for Black Swan [...] "and made it something that was workable." [...] By June 2009, Universal had placed the project in turnaround, generating attention from other studios and specialty divisions, particularly with actress Portman attached to star. Black Swan began development under Protozoa Pictures and Overnight Productions, the latter financing the film. In July 2009, Kunis was cast.|$|E

Finally the Williams fight did take place in Brisbane. However, only 10 out of a publicised 12 rounds were fought. Bout judges awarded the fight to the New Zealand Champion on points. Since that night in Brisbane {{there has been a}} lot of talk in the media, ranging from a failed drugs test, to no drugs testing at all, no WBA official present at the bout, and one fight judge stated that the <b>first</b> he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the fight being 10 rounds was from the arena announcer. However, despite all the media speculation, the WBA has confirmed that the fight was legitimate and Williams the recognised International heavyweight title-holder.

He indicated that the <b>first</b> time he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Waiganjo was after he was mentioned in a report as having accompanied M’Mbijiwe to a high level security meeting to Baragoi before the massacre that took place. Iteere further claimed that M’Mbijiwe informed him that Waiganjo {{was in charge of}} the Kenya Police Reservists in the province. This he said “mesmerised” him since the reservist units had been disbanded since 2004 by the then police commissioner Maj (Rtd). General Mohammed Ali.|$|R
