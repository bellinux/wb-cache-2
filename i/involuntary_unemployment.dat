A strain of disequilibrium or [...] "non-Walrasian" [...] theory developed that criticized the synthesis for apparent contradictions in allowing disequilibrium phenomena, especially <b>involuntary</b> <b>unemployment,</b> to be modeled in equilibrium models. Moreover, they argued, {{the presence of}} disequilibrium in one market must be associated with disequilibrium in another, so <b>involuntary</b> <b>unemployment</b> had to be tied to an excess supply in the goods market.

Clower (1965) introduced his [...] "dual-decision hypothesis" [...] that a person in a market may determine what he wants to buy, but is ultimately limited in how much he can buy based on how much he can sell. Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud (1968) argued that disequilibrium formed a fundamental part of Keynes's theory and deserved greater attention. Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman formulated general disequilibrium models in which individual markets were locked into prices before there was a general equilibrium. These markets produced [...] "false prices" [...] resulting in disequilibrium. Soon after the work of Barro and Grossman, disequilibrium models fell out of favor in the United States, and Barro abandoned Keynesianism and adopted new classical, market clearing hypotheses.|$|E

500|$|Classical economists had {{difficulty}} explaining <b>involuntary</b> <b>unemployment</b> and recessions because they applied Say's Law {{to the labor}} market and expected that all those willing {{to work at the}} prevailing wage would be employed. In Keynes's model, employment and output are driven by aggregate demand, the sum of consumption and investment. Since consumption remains stable, most fluctuations in aggregate demand stem from investment, which is driven by many factors including expectations, [...] "animal spirits", and interest rates. Keynes argued that fiscal policy could compensate for this volatility. During downturns, government could increase spending to purchase excess goods and employ idle labor. Moreover, a multiplier effect increases the effect of this direct spending since newly employed workers would spend their income, which would percolate through the economy, while firms would invest to respond to this increase in demand.|$|E

RBC dismissed the need to explain business cycles with price surprise, market failure, price stickiness, uncertainty, and instability. Instead, Kydland and Prescott built parsimonious models that explained business cycles with changes in technology and productivity. Employment levels changed because these technological and productivity changes altered the desire of people to work.

In contrast to conventional wisdom, our theory predicts that faster economic growth promotes inequality.

The necessity for the development of this model was demonstrated by the growth of local economic initiatives during the 1970 's, and the lack of monitoring and evaluation exercise to assess their success and cost-effectiveness. The first stage of research involved the confirmation that the potential for micro-economic and spatial initiatives existed.

The final stage involved the investigation of current techniques of evaluation and their adaptation for the purpose in hand. This led to a recognition of a gap in the armoury of techniques. The employment-dependency model has been developed to fill that gap, providing a low-budget model, capable of implementation at the small area level and generating a vast array of industrially disaggregate data, in terms of employment, employment-income, profits, value-added and gross income, related to levels of United Kingdom final demand.

These combinations of work and welfare should be explored further as they possibly mask existing in-work benefits that have remained under the radar of the debate. Unfortunately, EU-SILC data does not allow a detailed analysis, so country-specific, preferably administrative, data are needed to analyse whether these benefits are associated with very short periods of full <b>unemployment,</b> <b>involuntary</b> short-time work, voluntary types of leave, or a compensation for other specific circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Employed {{individuals}} in the U. S. are increasingly more likely to work part-time involuntarily than to be unemployed. Spells of involuntary part-time work are different from unemployment spells: a full-time worker who takes on a part-time job suffers an earnings loss while remaining employed, and is unlikely to receive income compensation from publicly provided insurance programs. We analyze these differences {{through the lens of}} an incomplete-market, job-search model featuring unemployment risk alongside an additional risk of involuntary part-time employment. A calibration of the model consistent with U. S. institutions and labour market dynamics shows that involuntary part-time work generates lower welfare losses relative to unemployment. This finding relies critically on the much higher probability to return to full-time employment from part-time work.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} whether {{inflation}} “greases the wheels ” {{of the labor}} market ignore inflation’s potential for disrupting wage patterns in the same market. Using a unique 40 -year panel of wage changes made by large mid-western employers, this paper 1) develops and applies an institutionally-based model of wage-setting that predicts the existence of independent occupational and employer adjustments embedded in wage changes, and 2) uses the model to draw inferences about inflation’s labor-market costs and benefits from adjustments in these two relative prices. Our empirical results, whose robustness we explore, suggest that (consistent with some previous studies) higher nominal wage growth does add beneficial “grease ” to relax downward wage rigidity. These potential benefits taper off after inflation rises to about 3 - 4 percent (allowing for 1 percent growth of labor productivity). However, inflation also generates disruptive, unintended wage variations (“sand”), which continue to mount at least until inflation reaches rates of 7 to 10 percent. So, while inflation does appear to add grease, the net benefits of inflation peak at CPI levels of about 2. 5 percent and are probably an order of magnitude less than previous grease-only benefit estimates. Thus, many fears about the impact of low inflation on labor markets are probably exaggerated. “Higher prices or faster inflation can diminish <b>involuntary,</b> disequilibrium <b>unemployment</b> [...] The economy is in perpetual [...] . disequilibrium even when it has settled into a stochastic macro-equlibrium [...] Price inflation [...] . is a neutral method of making arbitrary money wage paths comform to the realities of productivity growth. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{increasing}} {{female employment}} {{has contributed to}} reducing gender inequality, it has also exposed women to higher economic insecurity. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to understand the social conditions that might expose women to economic insecurity in different European cities. Specific aspects have been considered: (a) reduced (part time) work, (b) hampered labour-market participation (<b>unemployment,</b> <b>involuntary</b> inactivity due to care tasks), (c) different household structures (single/couple; with/without young children) or (d) educational level of both partners in the household. Data are based on a survey carried out in 2012 in seven European cities, representative of the different welfare/gender regimes in Europe. The results show that the most important divide is between women cohabiting/not cohabiting with a partner. Splitting the analysis on these two groups of women, differentiated configurations of conditions exposing women to economic insecurity have emerged in different welfare/care regimes. While Nordic, Central-eastern and Anglo-Saxon cities substantiate an individualised model of exposure to economic insecurity mostly driven by women’s participation in the labour market, in Continental and Mediterranean cities insecurity mainly depends on the educational levels (mainly of the partner in the case of coupled women) and the organisation of the household (presence of children) ...|$|R

It could be, that there simply are no jobs for the unemployed, but it could also be that there is a mismatch between the skills that the unemployed have, and the type of skilled labour for which there is a demand. If the latter is the case, then it could be argued that if the unemployed were willing to retrain or do a different kind of work, then they could get a job.

Thus, it will become obvious that not the distortion as such is decisive but its general equilibrium effects. We will derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an increase in employment and welfare due to an increase in the exogenously given wage. For improvements in employment and welfare the direction of change in the nontraded goods price and, thus, the output effect shows to be the driving force in our model.

30|$|Since {{the seminal}} paper by Clark and Oswald (1994), economists have been {{increasingly}} {{interested in the}} connection between unemployment and subjective well-being. In an effort {{to test the hypothesis}} that the rising unemployment in Britain is voluntary, Clark and Oswald (1994) analyze mental well-being scores from the British Household Panel Study. Finding that unemployed people have lower levels of mental well-being than those employed, they conclude that unemployment is not voluntary in general. As they acknowledge, however, it is difficult to establish causality with their cross-sectional data. For example, people with intrinsically lower levels of subjective well-being are more likely to lose jobs. To control for such unobserved individual heterogeneity, other researchers employ individual fixed effects on panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and provide causal evidence that unemployment does significantly lower life satisfaction (Clark et al. 2001; Gerlach and Stephan 1996; Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew 2009; Winkelmann and Winkelmann 1998). Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew (2009) further point out that a decrease in job satisfaction may cause a worker to become voluntarily unemployed, rendering the fixed-effect estimates based on panel data still biased. To overcome this problem, they identify the workers in their data who are involuntarily unemployed due to company closures and show that this <b>involuntary</b> entry into <b>unemployment</b> further lowers life satisfaction among German women, but not among German men. 1 Interestingly, the magnitudes of the effects of unemployment on life satisfaction are very similar between the fixed-effects estimations and those without fixed effects in most papers, suggesting that the bias due to unobserved individual heterogeneity is minimal in the pooled estimations without fixed effects. Due to the lack of data, however, just one cognitive measure of subjective well-being, overall satisfaction with life, is analyzed in the papers based on the GSOEP.|$|R
40|$|To be in {{relative}} poverty {{is to be}} excluded from the normal activities and acceptable standard of living in one’s community. In order to determine whether poverty in Australia is due to involuntary or voluntary causes a detailed examination is undertaken {{of the causes of}} disadvantage and the groups on whom these causes are impacting. Poverty is defined as involuntary when it is caused by factors outside of individual control, or where choices are so limited that one cannot escape from poverty. Nationwide evidence and a case study of poverty in the Newcastle region suggest the following indicators of <b>involuntary</b> poverty: Structural <b>unemployment,</b> Excess of job seekers over job vacancies, Polarisation of job growth into high skilled and low-paid low-skilled work, Decline in social expenditure, Lack of access to affordable childcare services, Increased cost of further education, Mismatch of education with areas of job growth, Unequal access to the internet, Inadequate provision of public transport, Relatively low expenditure on health of low-income groups, Decline in bulk billing, Decline in availability of low cost housing, Below poverty line welfare payments, High effective marginal tax rates for welfare recipients entering paid employment. Secondary indicators produced by the above causes include the presence of cohorts of poverty and locations of disadvantage (postcodes of poverty). A statistical analysis of poverty in Newcastle shows that the variance in the log of odds of poverty between Newcastle’s suburbs is largely due to variations in cohorts of disadvantage and structural causes. This supports the hypothesis that the majority of poverty in Australia is involuntary. It is necessary that the government acknowledge that poverty is largely involuntary so that Australia can shift from a culture of blame to one of mutual responsibility. Government and community action is required to rectify the causes of involuntary poverty. This can be achieved through job creation schemes, sufficient compensation for the unemployed and other groups of disadvantage, adequate and affordable provision of infrastructure and services, such as public transport, childcare, health care, public housing and education. The result will be a more cohesive society with equal opportunity for all citizens and improved social and individual welfare...|$|R
