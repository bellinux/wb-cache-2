25|$|Dr. Robert Bea, {{chair of}} an {{independent}} levee investigation team, {{has said that the}} New Orleans-based design firm Modjeski and Masters could have followed correct procedures in calculating safety factors for the flood walls. He added, however, that design procedures of the Corps may not account for changes in soil strength caused by the changes in water flow and pressure during a hurricane flood. Dr. Bea has also questioned the size of the design safety margins. He said the corps applied a 30%margin over the maximum <b>design</b> <b>load.</b> A doubling of strength would be a more typical margin for highway bridges, dams, off-shore oil platforms and other public structures. There were also indications that substandard concrete may have been used at the 17th Street Canal.|$|E

In addition, through tests of the Su-27M and the Su-37, engineers had determined that thrust vectoring could compensate for the loss of manoeuvrability brought about by the removal of canards, the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the design.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to review current approaches for the specification of <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> for rime ice and to propose improvements based on an analysis of field data provided by Hydro-Quebec. Hydro-Quebec established an experimental site on Mont Belair in 1994 {{for the purpose of}} obtaining much more detailed data on ice accretion in real time for both glaze ice and rime ice. In this study, rime ice events were identified, analyzed and characterized in terms of their recurrence, severity and relationship to winds. IEC- 60826 (2000) recommended procedures are used to calculate design rime ice and wind-on-ice loadsusing the ice load map of CSA C 22. 3 No. 1 - 01.

This was essentially an F/A-18A lightened by approximately weight was reduced by removing the folding wing and associated actuators, implementing a simpler landing gear (single wheel nose gear and cantilever oleo main gear), and change to a land-based tail-hook. The revised F/A-18L included wing fuel tanks and fuselage stations of the F/A-18A. Its weapons capacity would increase from largely due to the addition of a third underwing pylon and strengthened wingtips (11 stations in total vs 9 stations of the F/A-18A). Compared to the F-18L, the outboard weapons pylons are moved closer to the wingtip missile rails. Because of the strengthened non-folding wing, the wingtip missile rails were designed to carry either the AIM-7 Sparrow or Skyflash medium-range air-to-air missiles, in addition to the AIM-9 Sidewinder as found on the F/A-18A.

40|$|When {{interest}} is in establishing <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> for wind turbines, {{it is common to}} either carry out extensive simulation studies or undertake a field measurement campaign. At the Blyth offshore wind farm in the United Kingdom, a 2 MW wind turbine was instrumented, and environment and load data were obtained in a pervious study.
