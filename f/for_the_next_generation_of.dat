40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} solve the {{challenges}} in processor design <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> wireless communication systems, this paper first proposes a system level design flow for communication domain specific processor, and then proposes a novel processor architecture <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> wireless communication named GAEA using this design flow. GAEA is a shared memory multi-core SoC based on Software Controlled Time Division Multiplexing Bus, with which programmers can easily explore memory-level parallelism of applications by proper instructions and scheduling algorithms. MPE, which is the kernel component of GAEA, adopts hybrid parallel processing scheme to explore instruction-level and data-level parallelism. The pipeline and instruction set of GAEA are also optimized <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> wireless communication systems. The evaluation and implementation results show that GAEA architecture is suitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> wireless communication systems. I...|$|R

25|$|In {{northwest}} America, {{salmon is}} a keystone species, {{which means the}} impact they have on other life is greater than would be expected {{in relation to their}} biomass. The death of the salmon has important consequences, since it means significant nutrients in their carcasses, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, are transferred from the ocean to terrestrial wildlife such as bears and riparian woodlands adjacent to the rivers. This has knock-on effects not only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> salmon, but to every species living in the riparian zones the salmon reach. The nutrients can also be washed downstream into estuaries where they accumulate and provide much support for estuarine breeding birds.|$|E
25|$|The Viggen was {{initially}} developed as an intended {{replacement for the}} Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role and later the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter. In 1955, as Saab's prototype Draken, the most aerodynamically advanced fighter {{in the world at}} that point, performed its first flight, the Swedish Air Force was already forming a series of requirements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> combat aircraft; due to the challenging nature of these requirements, a lengthy development time was anticipated, with the first flight intended to be no early than the middle of the next decade. Between 1952 and 1957, the first studies towards what would become the Viggen were carried out, involving the Finnish aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa. Over 100 different concepts were examined in these studies, involving both single- and twin engine configurations, both traditional and double delta wings, and canard wings. Even VTOL designs were considered, with separate lift engines, but were soon identified as being unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s {{abstract}} painting {{continued to}} develop in America through varied styles. Geometric abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Color Field painting and minimal painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting {{as well as some}} other new movements. Morris Louis (see gallery) was an important pioneer in advanced Colorfield painting, his work can serve as a bridge between Abstract expressionism, Colorfield painting, and Minimal Art. Two influential teachers Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Josef Albers is best remembered for his work as an Geometric abstractionist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series Homage to the Square, (see gallery). In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.|$|E

25|$|Uppermost in {{the minds}} of the Spanish ministers was the need to {{preserve}} their empire intact and put it in hands powerful enough to guarantee that integrity. The preservation of the whole empire <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Spaniards was the driving motive in the last months of Charles II's life, but the grandees, led by Cardinal Portocarrero, knew that militarily their country was at the mercy of neighbouring France and that Austria, lacking a navy, could not hope to validate its claims. Consequently, Charles II, pressed on his sick-bed by his ministers, signed his final will on 3 October 1700, annulling the renunciations imposed on Maria Theresa and fixing the entire inheritance on the younger grandson of Louis XIV, Philip, Duke of Anjou. As Philip was not immediately in line for the French throne (the Dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy stood between him and the crown), the Spanish government hoped that this arrangement would be acceptable to European states who feared the unification of the French and Spanish thrones under a single monarch. If Philip should die or refuse, the offer was to extend to his younger brother, the Duke of Berry; if they both refused, the undivided inheritance would be offered to Archduke Charles.|$|E
25|$|The SSRIs are {{the first}} rationally {{designed}} class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design {{is to develop a}} new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications. An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine, which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs. Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were {{associated with the use of}} the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> SSRIs and was thought to be some kind of prototype. Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs). Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine), as demonstrated in table 1.|$|E

500|$|The game {{serves as}} a reboot of the Guitar Hero franchise, being the first new entry in the series since [...] in 2010 and the seventh {{installment}} overall. Activision wanted to bring back Guitar Hero <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> video game consoles but wanted the new game to be innovative. FreeStyleGames was given a free rein to revitalize the series by Activision, {{which led to the}} development of a new guitar controller featuring a 6 button, 3-fret layout in contrast to the 5 button controller of previous games. FreeStyleGames also wanted to bring a more immersive experience to the player, and developed the main career mode GH Live to have the note pattern displayed atop full motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist during a concert, with the crowd and other band members dynamically reacting to the player's performance. FreeStyleGames also wanted to forgo the traditional downloadable content model to provide new songs for the game, and created the GHTV mode which encompasses curated playlists in the style of music television channels that are streamed around the clock, allowing them to easily acquire and add new songs. Within GHTV, songs are presented with the note track overlaid atop their music video or from live concert footage. GHTV allows players to pick up and play currently-streamed songs at any time or use money and in-game credits to play any song within the library, forgoing traditional downloadable content. The game was shipped with forty-two songs on disc and 200 songs within the GHTV library; New content has been added to GHTV on a weekly basis, provided through premium shows that earn players unique rewards.|$|E
