Equally, if no further consumption occurred but {{they ought to have}} recognized that they were affected by an unknown substance, beginning an activity such as driving would not fall within the defense. In other words, the policy underpinning the operation of the law favors the protection of the public as against the interests of an individual who recklessly or with wilful blindness exposes the public to danger.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no record}} of Liston's birth. His family's home state of Arkansas did not make birth {{certificates}} mandatory until 1965. His family, but not Sonny Liston, {{can be found in}} the 1930 census, and in the 1940 census he was listed as 10 years old. It has been suggested Liston himself may not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>what</b> year he was born, as he was not precise on the matter. He finally settled on a date of birth of May 8, 1932 for official purposes but by the time he won the world title an aged appearance added credence to rumors that he was actually several years older. One writer concluded that Liston's most plausible date of birth was July 22, 1930, citing census records and statements from his mother during her lifetime.|$|E

However, it is unknown how Beardsley could <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>what</b> the island looked like from above. Hot air balloons existed at the time but the first air flight did not take place until the late 19th century. A third theory, and the most likely, claims that the county was named after the Shawnee Indian chief Elkhart, cousin of the famous Chief Tecumseh, and father of princess Mishawaka for whom neighboring Mishawaka is named.|$|E

After the credit markets began to tighten in August, Cerberus decided {{not to make the}} acquisition, agreeing to pay United Rentals a $100 million “reverse termination fee” that the parties had negotiated and included in their agreement. [...] United Rentals sued in the Delaware Court of Chancery for specific performance (i.e., a court mandate that Cerberus complete the deal). Cerberus cited the clear language contained in the deal agreement that capped its liability for not completing the transaction at $100 million. After a two-day trial, Delaware Chancellor William B. Chandler, III, ruled in favor of Cerberus, writing in his ruling that “URI knew or should <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>what</b> Cerberus’ understanding of the merger agreement was.” [...] In a statement, Cerberus said it was “gratified” by the court’s ruling and was “pleased that the court chose to decide the case on the merits and confirm that Cerberus acted in accordance with its rights and obligations.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Rundstedt {{was left}} in no doubt by Hitler and Himmler what German {{occupation}} would mean {{for the people of}} Poland and the Soviet Union, yet he applied his military talents to the conquest of both countries. He approved of the Reichenau Order or Severity Order and must <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>what</b> it portended for the Jews of Ukraine, yet [...] "sat silent and acquiescent" [...] while the Einsatzgruppen did their work. He claimed that the Army would have liked to feed the three million Soviet POWs, yet he apparently took no interest in their fate once they were taken to the rear. He asserted that he had an absolute duty as an officer to obey orders, yet claimed to have disobeyed both the Commissar Order in Russia and the Commando Order in France. These inconsistencies were exposed both at Nuremberg, in the trials of the Einsatzgruppen leaders (who also claimed they had a duty to obey distasteful orders) and in the 1947 trials of senior officers, and in Manstein's trial in 1949. They would certainly also have been exposed if Rundstedt had come to trial. On this basis his biographer concludes: [...] "If Rundstedt had stood trial, {{it is clear from the}} Manstein case that he would have been found guilty of some of the charges levelled against him." ...|$|E

[...] She continued, [...] "I never really thought about it before--it doesn’t occur to you that this medieval type of mentality occurs. It’s horrifying what happens." [...] Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. [...] "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," [...] she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, [...] "I would never <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>what</b> a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime.
