Due to the lack of any significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.|$|E
5|$|Governor of North Carolina Pat McCrory {{declared}} a state of emergency for 25counties in advance of the hurricane's arrival. Fourteen shelters were opened, and the deteriorating North Carolina Highway12 Bonner Bridge was closed as a precaution. Mandatory evacuations were declared for Hatteras Island and Richland Township in Beaufort County while voluntary evacuations were announced for Ocracoke Island, Aurora, Pamlico Beach, and Belhaven. Approximately 4,300individuals fled from Ocracoke Island via ferry despite only being under a voluntary evacuation, and while a mandatory evacuation had been encouraged by Hyde County's emergency management director, other officials turned down the request. Tornado watches were issued for 10North Carolina counties. In preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that Arthur's storm surge would make North Carolina Highway12 and Hatteras Island inaccessible, local officials deployed heavy equipment capable of removing sand and other debris.|$|E

5|$|Having {{attended}} the National Defence College, Jackson joined the directing {{staff at the}} Army Staff College and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1981. He served {{as a member of}} the directing staff at the Staff College, Camberley, for two and a half years. During his tenure at Camberley, he was seconded to a staff position at the Ministry of Defence in 1982 during the Falklands War, and thus missed the opportunity to serve in the conflict directly. He took command of 1 PARA in March 1984, who, at the time, were deployed in Norway, training <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a Soviet attack. Concerned that he was insufficiently prepared for the weather conditions, he left Camberley early to train with the Royal Marines. He was appointed Senior Directing Staff (Army) at the Joint Service Defence College from 1986 to 1988 and was promoted to colonel in 1987.|$|E
5|$|However, Jones' {{figure of}} 600,000 {{is based on}} {{assumptions}} about limitanei unit strengths which may be too high. Jones calculated unit-strengths in Egypt under Diocletian using papyrus evidence of unit payrolls. But a rigorous reassessment of that evidence by R. Duncan-Jones concluded that Jones had overestimated unit sizes by 2–6 times. For example, Jones estimated legions on the frontiers at c. 3,000 men and other units at c. 500. But Duncan-Jones' revisions found frontier legions of around 500 men, an ala of just 160 and an equites unit of 80. Even allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> {{that some of these}} units were detachments from larger units, it is likely that Diocletianic unit-strengths were far lower than earlier.|$|E

5|$|Large swells {{produced}} by the storm resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County, California. High temperatures in southern California, exceeding 100°F (37.7°C) in places, and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575,000 people going to beaches during the Labor Day weekend. One incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 810ft (2.43m) waves. Officials in San Bernardino County advised residents to take precautions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of flooding {{as a result of}} moisture from the remnants of Howard. Following wildfires in 2003, foothills were highly susceptible to flooding. Residents were advised to have sandbags ready, ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have an evacuation plan. Despite all the preparations undertaken, Howard did not produced any rainfall in California. The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona. This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|One {{group of}} Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. When the Japanese had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs to hear about the status of the war. A smuggled camera was used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of securing a handgun.|$|E

Instead of creating a whole system and competition, the United Football Clubs Association agreed to partner with the Football Alliance in operating the United Football League (UFL), a semi-professional league. After the league's second season, AKTV became its official TV broadcaster with the signing of a ₱150 million (~$3.3 million or ~€2.5 million), five-year deal, which ensures the airing of two live matches every week. The deal was further improved with a new TV arrangement in which four live matches would be aired every week on primetime television on AksyonTV.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Roy {{originated}} {{from an area}} of disturbed weather in early January 1988 in the central Pacific.
