5|$|Body {{piercing}} is an <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> with risks. In a 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 persons {{over the age}} of 16 in England, complications were reported in 31% of piercings, with professional help being necessary in 15.2%. 0.9% had complications serious enough to require hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices emphasize {{the use of}} safe {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.|$|E
5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E
40|$|Background: Minimally <b>invasive</b> {{cardiovascular}} <b>procedures</b> {{have been}} progressively used in heart surgery. Objective: To describe the techniques and immediate results of minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in 5 years. Methods: Prospective and descriptive {{study in which}} 102 patients were submitted to minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct and video-assisted forms. Clinical and surgical variables were evaluated {{as well as the}} in hospital follow-up of the patients. Results: Fourteen patients were operated through the direct form and 88 through the video-assisted form. Between minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct form, 13 had aortic valve disease. Between minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in video-assisted forms, 43 had mitral valve disease, 41 atrial septal defect and four tumors. In relation to mitral valve disease, we replaced 26 and reconstructed 17 valves. Aortic clamp, extracorporeal and procedure times were, respectively, 91, 6 ± 21, 8, 112, 7 ± 27, 9 e 247, 1 ± 20, 3 minutes in minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct form. Between minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in video-assisted forms, 71, 6 ± 29, 99, 7 ± 32, 6 e 226, 1 ± 42, 7 minutes. Considering intensive care and hospitalization times, these were 41, 1 ± 14, 7 hours and 4, 6 ± 2 days in minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct and 36, 8 ± 16, 3 hours and 4, 3 ± 1, 9 days in minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in video-assisted forms procedures...|$|R
40|$|Minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in pain {{treatment}} {{are an important}} supplement to conservative pain treatments, to pharmacotherapy {{as well as to}} non-pharmacological procedures when these are insufficient as pain treatments. The level of success depends on a careful pick of patients, {{as well as on the}} skill and proficiency of the doctor performing the minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures.</b> Up to this point the results of many studies on minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in pain treatment have been opposed, with the epidural placement of the suringe being unsuccessful in 40 % of the cases, even with an experienced anaesthesiologist performeng the procedure. Not using the flouroscope is certainly one of the reasons to such a high level of set-back. The fluoroscope, which has become a standard part of many <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures,</b> is held responsible for the greater efficiency and fewer complications during <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures,</b> all resulting in the increase of minimally <b>invasive</b> pain treatment <b>procedures</b> over all...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that local <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> may alter the natural course of (pre) malignant cervical disease. This could be due to partial excision of the lesions, or via induction of cellular immunity against human papillomavirus (HPV) by the local <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures.</b> We studied the influence of local <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> on HPV- 16 E 7 specific immune responses in patients with different grades of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and different stages of cervical cancer. Blood was obtained at intake and after <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> from patients with CIN or cervical cancer. Antigen specific T-cell responses were measured by IFN-gamma ELISPOT analysis, after stimulation with recombinant HPV- 16 E 7 protein. As expected, HPV- 16 E 7 specific IFN-gamma T cell responses were more frequent in HPV- 16 DNA positive patients compared with that in HPV- 16 DNA negative patients (39 / 50 vs. 16136, (p = 0. 006, x(2) test). After <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures,</b> a small number of HPV- 16 DNA positive CIN patients, but a considerable proportion of HPV- 16 DNA positive cervical cancer patients, showed an enhancement of T cell responses against HPV- 16 E 7. Induction of T cell reactivity was most pronounced in cervical cancer patients who had undergone previous <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures.</b> Both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells showed E 7 specific IFN-gamma production upon in-vitro stimulation. Our study shows that <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> may enhance HPV-specific cell-mediated immunity in a considerable number of patients with cervical cancer, but in only a minority of CIN patients. Our data indicate that <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> should be considered as possible confounding factors when analyzing the effectiveness of therapeutic immunization studies, especially, when induction of HPV-specific immune responses is used as intermediate end-point.

5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E

5000|$|Minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> are a {{more common}} {{alternative}} {{due to the}} decreased risk of damaging significant muscle tissue. The difference between invasive and minimally invasive spinal surgeries is that minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> involves {{a series of small}} incisions. Minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> can be performed anywhere along the spine, and have been used to treat various abnormalities. The percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique allows for a procedure that presents minimal risk to the patient. Fluoroscopic image guided navigation through these portals allows for surgeons to perform more efficient <b>procedures.</b> Minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> often yield a much faster recovery time than fully invasive surgeries, making them more appealing to patients. Laminectomies have always been the gold standard when treating lumbar spinal stenosis, but recently, less invasive surgeries have emerged as a safer alternative treatment that helps maintain the postoperative structural integrity of the spine.|$|R
25|$|Treatment of DIC is {{centered}} around treating the underlying condition. Transfusions of platelets or {{fresh frozen plasma}} can be considered in cases of significant bleeding, or those with a planned <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure.</b> The target goal of such transfusion depends on the clinical situation. Cryoprecipitate can be considered in those with a low fibrinogen level.|$|E
25|$|BPH can {{be treated}} with medication, a {{minimally}} <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. Minimally invasive procedures include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA) and transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT). These outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary prostatic stent, to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The Ex-Maze is a {{minimally}} <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{first reported}} in 2007, that also creates a lesion pattern across both atria epicardially on the beating heart. As with other procedures off-bypass, the surgeon can confirm that AF corrects to normal sinus rhythm during the procedure. Laparoscopic instruments {{are used to}} access the pericardium through the diaphragm. Like many heart-cauterizing instruments, the Ex-Maze device uses heat generated by a radiofrequency coil. The coil is inside a plastic tube that uses suction to maintain contact against the beating heart’s surface.|$|E

25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> {{for treatment}} of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E
25|$|Gagné battled several {{injuries}} in early 2005. Although {{he was still}} an effective pitcher, 2.70 ERA and 8 for 8 in save opportunities, Gagné was only able to appear in 14 games that season. On June 21, 2005, {{it was announced that}} Gagné would undergo season-ending Tommy John surgery to repair a sprained ligament in his right elbow. Recovery would take a year or more; furthermore, a return to major league pitching after a second Tommy John operation (Gagné's first was in 1997) is nearly unheard of, having since been achieved by another Dodger reliever, the Taiwanese left-hander Hong-Chih Kuo. However, as surgeons began to perform the operation, they discovered instead a nerve entrapped by scar tissue and were able to release it with a less <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure.</b> Gagné was still unable to play {{for the remainder of the}} 2005 season.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if patients allow medical students to perform less <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> compared to more <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures,</b> {{and how this}} is related to patient demographics and previous experience with medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in six areas of Birmingham, UK. All members {{of the general public}} over the age of 18 were eligible, excluding non-English speaking people and those with cognitive impairments. Respondents were asked to rank their willingness for medical students to perform history taking/examinations and clinical procedures of varying degrees of invasiveness. Results: We received a total of 293 responses. For both history taking/examinations and clinical procedures, people were more willing to allow medical students to perform less <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> rather than more <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures.</b> White and older people were more willing to allow all history taking/examinations procedures; additionally, women were more willing to allow history taking. White, female, and older participants were more willing to allow blood pressure measurement; whilst older people and those with previous experience were more willing to allow venepuncture. No significant associations were found for intubation. Conclusions: The public is less willing for medical students to perform more <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures.</b> This may severely limit opportunities to attain clinical competencies...|$|R

25|$|Mixing {{of fetal}} cells {{carrying}} paternal RhD antigens into maternal blood {{may result in}} the sensitization of an RhD-negative mother. Rhesus blood group (D antigen) is {{used to determine the}} risk of hemolytic disease in the fetus. In hemolytic disease, the maternal antibodies destroy RhD-positive fetal red blood cells. This leads to lethality for the fetus. A significant amount of blood can be exchanged between mother and infant during birth, CVS, amniocentesis and accidents. 50 defined antigens on the surface of red blood cells indicate Rhesus blood group and E antigens {{are one of the most}} important. RHD gene determines the Rhesus D status. Chinen et al. 2010 shows that 15% of Caucasian females, 3-5% of black African females and <3% of Asian females are RhD-negative. In the United Kingdom and other countries, cffDNA tests are now routinely being offered to RhD-negative patients at increased risk of isoimmunization. Anti-RhD immune globulin, a blood derivative, is only offered in the event of a RhD-positive fetus for these women (21, 48, 54). In United States, prophylactic treatment is recommended for all RhD-negative pregnant women to prevent isoimmunization in case of RhD incompatibility. In the United States, amniocentesis still serves as the gold standard diagnostic tool for those women who require antenatal fetal blood genotyping, but it has been suggested that technology using cell-free fetal DNA may ultimately replace this <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E

500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} modalities {{exist to}} demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without digital subtraction angiography). This involves puncture {{of a large}} artery (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear stenotic (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), or as an aneurysm (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as [...] "rat's tail" [...] or [...] "string sign". Cerebral angiography is an <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure,</b> and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below).|$|E
