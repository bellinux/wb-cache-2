In addition to sickness, social disorder could cause sterility of land or other disasters. Harmony could be restored only by confession and apology.|$|E
25|$|Skinner {{believed}} that effective teaching {{must be based}} on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of rote learning and punitive discipline in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it is hard to know <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E

2500|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> not {{diagnosed}} {{during the}} routine newborn screening test (typically performed 2–7 days after birth, using samples drawn by neonatal heel prick), and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine {{levels in the}} blood will increase over time.

The disease may present clinically with seizures, [...] hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a [...] "musty odor" [...] to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed.|$|E
2500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{is supported by}} Jocasta's repetition of the oracle at lines 854–55: [...] "Loxias declared that the king should be killed by/ his own son." [...] In the Greek, Jocasta uses the verb chrênai: [...] "to be fated, necessary." [...] This iteration of the oracle {{seems to suggest that}} it was unconditional and inevitable. Other scholars have nonetheless argued that Sophocles follows tradition in making Laius's oracle conditional, and thus avoidable. They point to Jocasta's initial disclosure of the oracle at lines 711–14. In the Greek, the oracle cautions: hôs auton hexoi moira pros paidos thanein/ hostis genoit emou te kakeinou para. The two verbs in boldface indicate what is called a [...] "future more vivid" [...] condition: <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> born to Laius, his fate to be killed by that child will overtake him.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rajneesh, one has {{no right}} to knowingly inflict a {{lifetime}} of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, [...] "If a child is born deaf, dumb, and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep" [...] rather than [...] "take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child." [...] He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: [...] "Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body." ...|$|E

50|$|In recent years, {{the small}} town {{had to deal with}} a {{substantial}} increase in teen vandalism. In August 2004 a controversial municipal bylaw went into effect that placed a 10:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew on unsupervised children aged 15 and under. The controversial bylaw held parents responsible for their children's activities through fines <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> caught in violation of the curfew.

2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most children know that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They know that these words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> able to master this skill, called phonological awareness, {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another way to teach a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E

6000|$|Clearly {{it is not}} {{along these}} lines that the capable men-makers we suppose to be attacking the problem will {{spend much of their}} energies. All the {{experiences}} of Charities and Poor-Law Authorities simply confirm our postulate of the necessity of a standard of comfort <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> to have a really good initial chance in the world. The only conceivable solution of this problem is one that will ensure that no child, or only a few accidental and exceptional children, will be born outside these advantages. It is no good trying to sentimentalize the issue away. This is the end we must attain, to attain any effectual permanent improvement in the conditions of childhood. A certain number of people have to be discouraged and prevented from parentage, and a great number of homes have to be improved. How can we ensure these ends, or how far can we go towards ensuring them? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} {{of corporal punishment}} is important. It is no use roughly smacking a shrinking, sensitive child. And yet, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> too shrinking, too sensitive, it may do it a world of good cheerfully to spank its posterior. Not brutally, not cruelly, but with real sound, good-natured exasperation. And let the adult take the full responsibility, half humorously, without apology or explanation. Let us avoid self-justification at all costs. Real corporal punishments apply to the sensual plane. The refined punishments of the spiritual mode are usually much more indecent and dangerous than a good smack. The pained but resigned disapprobation of a mother is usually a very bad thing, much worse than the father's shouts of rage. And sendings to bed, and no dessert for a week, and so on, are crueller and meaner than a bang on the head. When a parent gives his boy a beating, there is a living passionate interchange. But in these refined punishments, the parent suffers nothing and the child is deadened. The bullying of the refined, benevolent spiritual will is simply vitriol to the soul. Yet parents administer it with all the righteousness of virtue and good intention, sparing themselves perfectly.|$|E
60|$|And why? Because, {{it seems}} to me, they were what Englishmen ought to be--what too many Englishmen are too apt to boast of being in these days, while they are not so, or {{anything}} like it--and that is, honest men and practical men. They had taught the children {{to say that they}} were members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven; and they had taught the children, when they said that, to mean what they said; for they had no notion that 'I am,' meant 'I may possibly be;' or that 'I was made,' meant 'There is a chance of my being made some time or other.' They would not have dared to teach children to say things which were most probably not true. So believing really what they taught, they believed also that the children were justified. For <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> not justified in being a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, what is he justified in being? Is not that exactly the just, right, and proper state for him, and for every man?--the very state in which all men were meant originally to be, in which all men ought to have been? So they looked on these children as being in the just, right, and proper way, on which God looks with satisfaction and pleasure, and in which alone a man can do just, right, and proper things, by the Spirit of Christ, which He gives daily and hourly to those who belong to Him and trust in Him and in His Father.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> born in wedlock, the <b>child</b> <b>was</b> considered, {{and raised}} as, {{a member of}} the {{prominent}} parent's ethnicity. (See Hyperdescent and Hypodescent.) Because of this, the term [...] "Mestizo" [...] was associated with illegitimacy. Mestizos do not appear in large numbers in official censuses until {{the second half of the}} 17th century, when a sizable and stable community of mixed-race people with no claims to being either Indian or Spanish appeared, although, of course, a large population of biological Mestizos had already existed for over a century in Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Among the Yisi group, {{after the}} birth of <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> both {{paternal}} and maternal parents would cook a meal and exchange it between themselves. It is also a tradition that <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>be</b> shaved within 10 - 30 days from the day of birth. Whereas, Akhegwo group performs this on the second day after birth. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> born at dawn before the cock crows, the <b>child</b> has to <b>be</b> shaved on the day of birth.

50|$|If there <b>is</b> {{suspicion}} that <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> being bullied or is a bully, there are warning signs in their behavior.

60|$|Provided--and {{there is}} that second reason why people do not love God, for which I {{said there was no}} excuse--provided only that we wish to be good, and to obey God. If we do not wish to do what God commands, we shall never love God. It must be so. There can be no real love of God which is not based upon a love of virtue and goodness, upon what our Lord calls a hunger and thirst after righteousness. 'If ye love Me, keep My commandments,' is our Lord's own rule and test. And it is the only one possible. If we habitually disobey any person, we shall cease to love that person. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> in the habit of disobeying its parents, dark and angry {{feelings}} towards those parents are sure to arise in its heart. The child tries to forget its parents, to keep out of their way. It tries to justify itself, to excuse itself by fancying that its parents are hard upon it, unjust, grudge it pleasure, or what not. If its parents' commandments are grievous to a child, it will try to make out that those commandments are unfair and unkind. And so shall we do by God's commandments. If God's commandments seem too grievous for us to obey, then we shall begin to fancy them unjust and unkind. And then, farewell to any real love to God. If we do not openly rebel against God, we shall still try to forget Him. The thought of God will seem dark, unpleasant, and forbidding to us; and we shall try, in our short- sighted folly, to live {{as far as we can}} without God in the world, and, like Adam after his fall, hide ourselves from the loving God, just because we know we have disobeyed Him.|$|E
60|$|True piety, in a word, which {{consists}} in entering into and steadily maintaining the right {{moral and spiritual}} relations with God and man, marks the highest condition which the possibilities of human nature allow, and must rest in the soul which attains to it on a very different foundation from any thing like hope or fear. That there is a function which it is the province of these motives to fulfill, is abundantly proved by the use that is sometimes made {{of them in the}} Scriptures. But the more we reflect upon the subject, the more we shall be convinced, I think, that all such considerations ought to be kept very much in the back-ground in our dealings with children. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> sick, and is even likely to die, it is a very serious question whether any warning given to him of his danger will not operate as a hindrance rather than a help, in awakening those feelings which will constitute the best state of preparation for the change. For a sense of gratitude to God for his goodness, and to the Saviour for the sacrifice which he made for his sake, penitence for his sins, and trust in the forgiving mercy of his Maker, are the feelings to be awakened in his bosom; and these, so far as they exist, will lead him to lie quietly, calmly, and submissively in God's hands, without anxiety in respect to what is before him. It is a serious question whether an entire uncertainty as to the time when his death is to come is not more favorable to the awakening of these feelings, than the state of alarm and distress which would be excited by the thought that it was near.|$|E
60|$|If it {{be asked}} how it happens {{that there have}} been {{recorded}} multitudinous instances of variations fortuitously arising and re-appearing in offspring, while there have not been recorded instances of the transmission of changes functionally produced, there are three replies. The first is that changes of the one class are many of them conspicuous, while those of the other class are nearly all inconspicuous. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> born with six fingers, the anomaly is not simply obvious but so startling as to attract much notice; and if this child, growing up, has six-fingered descendents, everybody in the locality hears of it. A pigeon with specially-coloured feathers, or one distinguished by a broadened and upraised tail, or by a protuberance of the neck, draws attention by its oddness; and if in its young the trait is repeated, occasionally with increase, the fact is remarked, and there follows the thought of establishing the peculiarity by selection. A lamb disabled from leaping by the shortness of its legs, could not fail to be observed; and the fact that its offspring were similarly short-legged, and had a consequent inability to get over fences, would inevitably become widely known. Similarly with plants. That this flower had an extra number of petals, that that was unusually symmetrical, and that another differed considerably in colour from the average of its kind, would be easily seen by an observant gardener; and the suspicion that such anomalies are inheritable having arisen, experiments leading to further proofs that they are so, would frequently be made. But it is not thus with functionally-produced modifications. The seats of these are in nearly all cases the muscular, osseous, and nervous systems, and the viscera--parts which are either entirely hidden or greatly obscured. Modification in a nervous centre is inaccessible to vision; bones may be considerably altered in size or shape without attention being drawn to them; and, covered with thick coats as are most of the animals open to continuous observation, the increases or decreases in muscles must be great before they become externally perceptible.|$|E

50|$|Unlike medieval royalty, the Romans {{were more}} {{concerned}} with continuity of family name than with bloodline. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> man recognized <b>a</b> <b>child</b> as his, this was accepted by law, {{and the issue of}} who the biological father was did not arise. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> not recognized, it could be exposed or brought up as a slave. For example, Emperor Claudius initially accepted a girl as his daughter, but later rejected her and had her exposed. Emperors often adopted their successors. There are no recorded examples of aristocrats in classical times accusing other aristocrats of being illegitimate, as was common among in later periods.|$|R
3000|$|In contrast, the {{conscience}} {{aspect of the}} superego relates more to the disapproval of the parents—what is considered morally bad: whatever experiences result in punishment.
