50|$|The {{polarization}} dependent isolator, or Faraday isolator, is made {{of three}} parts, an input polarizer (polarized vertically), a <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotator,</b> and an output polarizer, called an analyser (polarized at 45°).|$|E
50|$|Optical {{isolators}} {{are different}} from 1/4 wave plate based isolators because the <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotator</b> provides non-reciprocal rotation while maintaining linear polarization. That is, the polarization rotation due to the <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotator</b> is always in the same relative direction. So in the forward direction, the rotation is positive 45°. In the reverse direction, the rotation is −45°. This {{is due to the}} change in the relative magnetic field direction, positive one way, negative the other. This then adds to a total of 90° when the light travels in the forward direction and then the negative direction. This allows the higher isolation to be achieved.|$|E
50|$|Light {{traveling}} in the forward direction becomes polarized vertically by the input polarizer. The <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotator</b> will rotate the polarization by 45°. The analyser then enables the light to be transmitted through the isolator.|$|E
50|$|Faraday {{rotation}} is {{an example}} of non-reciprocal optical propagation. Unlike what happens in an optically active medium such as a sugar solution, reflecting a polarized beam back through the same Faraday medium does not undo the polarization change the beam underwent in its forward pass through the medium. This allows <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotators</b> to be used to construct devices such as optical isolators to prevent undesired back propagation of light from disrupting or damaging an optical system.|$|R
25|$|The Faraday {{effect has}} {{applications}} in measuring instruments. For instance, the Faraday effect {{has been used}} to measure optical rotatory power and for remote sensing of magnetic fields (such as fiber optic current sensors). The Faraday effect is used in spintronics research to study the polarization of electron spins in semiconductors. <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotators</b> can be used for amplitude modulation of light, and are the basis of optical isolators and optical circulators; such components are required in optical telecommunications and other laser applications.|$|R
50|$|In many {{applications}} {{it is possible}} to use a quarter-wave plate to produce circularly polarized light, but this is only possible for light of a limited range of wavelengths which is linearly polarized to start with. It is also possible to use a rotating half-wave plate to produce polarization which is periodic in time, and therefore effectively scrambled for sufficiently slow responses. Other methods have been demonstrated, {{such as the use of}} <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotators</b> and liquid crystals. It is also possible to depolarize light using fiber optics.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} optical element in an isolator is the <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotator.</b> The characteristics that one looks {{for in a}} <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotator</b> optic include a high Verdet constant, low absorption coefficient, low non-linear refractive index and high damage threshold. Also, to prevent self-focusing and other thermal related effects, the optic should be as short as possible. The two most commonly used materials for the 700-1100 nm range are terbium doped borosilicate glass and terbium gallium garnet crystal (TGG). For long distance fibre communication, typically at 1310 nm or 1550 nm, yttrium iron garnet crystals are used (YIG). Commercial YIG based Faraday isolators reach isolations higher than 30 dB.|$|E

50|$|Ring lasers are {{sometimes}} modified to allow only one {{direction of propagation}} by placing a device into the ring which leads to different losses for different propagation directions. For instance, {{this could be a}} <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotator</b> combined with a polarizing element.|$|E
