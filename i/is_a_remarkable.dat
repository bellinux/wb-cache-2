5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version {{of the country in}} which it was written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plants are}} {{immediately}} evident to the visitor. Banyan (Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> tree with a buttressed trunk and pendulous aerial roots: {{it can be}} seen on the track to Clear Place and near Ned's Beach. Pandanus tree (Pandanus forsteri) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas like creek beds and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. There are ten species of orchid on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (Dendrobium macropus subsp. howeanum) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream flowers from August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red flowers of mountain rose (Metrosideros nervulosa and Metrosideros sclerocarpa), the massed small yellow flowers of corokia (Corokia carpodetoides), orange plump flowers of pumpkin tree (Negria rhabdothamnoides), and white spikes of Fitzgerald tree (Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii). The kava bush has large, aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. After heavy rain the endemic glowing mushrooms Mycena chlorophanos and Omphalotus nidiformis {{can be found in the}} palm forests.|$|E

25|$|The {{octagonal}} baptismal font at {{the centre}} dates from 1246 and {{was made by}} Guido Bigarelli da Como. The bronze sculpture of St. John the Baptist at {{the centre of the}} font <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> work by Italo Griselli.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{physiological}} {{interpretation of}} the Garden of Eden that evinces {{a certain amount of}} anatomical knowledge on the part of Simon or his followers. Here, Paradise is the womb, and the river going out of Eden is envisioned as the umbilical cord.|$|E
25|$|The mosque's mihrab, whose decor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{witness of}} Muslim {{art in the}} early centuries of Islam, is {{distinguished}} by its harmonious composition {{and the quality of}} its ornaments. Considered as the oldest example of concave mihrab, it dates in its present state to 862-863 AD.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} Sneferu’s massive {{undertakings}} is the Pyramid at Meidum. There is some debate among scholars as to Sneferu’s {{claim to the}} Meidum pyramid, and many credit its origin to King Huni. Nonetheless, the pyramid <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> example of the progression of technology and ideology surrounding the king’s burial site.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} store of John Lewis Reading (formerly known as Heelas) {{is located on}} Broad Street. There are also branches of many chain stores, including Bhs, Boots, H, Marks and Spencers, Next, Sainsbury's, schuh and W H Smith. The Broad Street branch of booksellers Waterstone's is of particular interest, as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> conversion of a nonconformist chapel dating from 1707.|$|E
25|$|Among Alan Pritsker’s diverse {{contributions}} to engineering practice, {{perhaps the most}} prominent was his {{development and use of}} large-scale simulation models to support policy analysis for organ transplantation by the United Network for Organ Sharing. In particular, his work was used to formulate more effective and equitable protocols for assigning liver transplants to waiting patients. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> example of the definitive practice of system simulation in addressing ultimate questions of life and death.|$|E

25|$|Warwickshire Schools GAA Board was {{originally}} {{set up in}} September 2000. It has grown at a very healthy rate such that by May 2007 WSGAA worked in partnership with 28 primary schools, 15 Secondary schools, 2 HE/FE Colleges and 5 local GAA clubs and in total an estimated 2385 young people. The aims of the WSGAA include competition by their elite team in the All-Ireland underage championships. This initiative <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> departure from the traditional way in which British GAA clubs have been organised.|$|E
25|$|Considering the {{steepness}} {{of much of}} {{the terrain}} there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> lack of erosion, primarily because human access has been historically low, and vegetative cover has been kept intact. The headwaters of Santa Rosa Creek rise on the northern slopes of Mount Hood, whereas the central and eastern portions of the mountain contribute to the watershed of Sonoma Creek which rises in the Sugarloaf area. Hood Creek and Graywood Creek, draining portions of Mount Hood, are smaller tributaries that feed Sonoma Creek. Precipitation amounts to approximately 30inches (76.2cm) per annum on Mount Hood.|$|E
25|$|This {{stone is}} notable because it commemorates that Ulf had taken three danegelds in England. The {{first one was}} with Skagul Toste in 991, the second one with Thorkel the High in 1012 {{and the last one}} with Canute the Great in 1018. Since there were many years between the danegelds, it is likely that Ulfr {{returned}} to Sweden after each danegeld to live as a wealthy magnate. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> feat in itself to summarize Ulf's adventurous life in so few unsentimental words.|$|E

25|$|Dating {{shortly after}} the Palatine Chapel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> 9th-century Swiss {{manuscript}} known as the Plan of Saint Gall and showing a very detailed plan of a monastic complex, with all its various monastic buildings and their functions labelled. The largest building is the church, the plan of which is distinctly Germanic, having an apse at both ends, an arrangement not generally seen elsewhere. Another feature {{of the church is}} its regular proportion, the square plan of the crossing tower providing a module {{for the rest of the}} plan. These features can both be seen at the Proto-Romanesque St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim, 1001–1030.|$|E
25|$|Eady's chief {{claim to}} being remembered <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> innings {{played in a}} club match between the Tasmanian club Break o' Day and the Wellington club, which was another Tasmanian team and not the current side from New Zealand, in 1902, when he scored 566 not out from a total of 908. This is the third highest score in any form of cricket, behind Pranav Dhanawade's 1009 not out in 2016 and A. E. J. Collins' 628 not out in 1899. Eady also took all 10 wickets for 42 runs in an innings for South Hobart versus East Hobart in 1906.|$|E
25|$|San Carlos is a beachfront {{subdivision}} {{within the}} port city of Guaymas, in the northern state of Sonora in Mexico. It is noted for the exceptional clarity and warmth of the ocean water in its shallow bays. It lies on the body of water known as the Gulf of California. Given the size of the city, with nearly 7,000 inhabitants, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> number of RV parks, resorts and stores. There is also a very large and active diving community. There are also other outdoors activities like climbing, sailing, horseback riding, aquatic sports, and others.|$|E

25|$|Adama ɓii Ardo Hassana (1786 – 1847), more {{commonly}} known as Modibo Adama, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior, who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adama's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in Northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which {{considering the fact that}} they weren't from the area, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{characterization}} of Cohen–Macaulay rings, sometimes called miracle flatness or Hironaka's criterion. Let R be a local ring which is finitely generated as a module over some regular local ring A contained in R. Such a subring exists for any localization R at a prime {{ideal of a}} finitely generated algebra over a field, by the Noether normalization lemma; it also exists when R is complete and contains a field, or when R is a complete domain. Then R is Cohen–Macaulay {{if and only if}} it is flat as an A-module; it is also equivalent to say that R is free as an A-module.|$|E
25|$|St Martin's {{is in the}} Cathedral Close; {{the plan}} is odd, and there are {{numerous}} items of church furniture, though these are not of high aesthetic value. St Mary Arches is a Norman church with aisles. St Mary Steps was originally by the West Gate of the city; the font is Norman, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> early clock. St Michael, Heavitree was built in 1844–46 and extended later in the century. St Pancras is of the 13th century and has a nave and chancel only; the font is Norman. The plan of St Petroc's church is highly unusual: a second chancel has been added facing north while the original chancel has another use and faces east. There are two aisles on the south, one of 1413 and another of the 16th century.|$|E
