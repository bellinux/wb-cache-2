40|$|In {{response}} {{to human rights}} abuses, local activists “throw ” information boomerangs into the transnational sphere through written reports, emails, phone calls, protests and study tours. Then, transnational activists accelerate the boomerang through its repackaging, dissemination, and targeted delivery to key <b>journalists</b> <b>and</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders.</b> Eventually, these forces may cumulatively push Western governments and IGOs to “pitch ” the boomerang back to the originating country through diplomatic pressures for reform. Human rights boomerangs are launched from every continent and world region, but are local activists in all places equally capable of success? Our answer, in short, is no. We use a three-stage research design combining quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze the experiences of nearly 150 countries from 1980 to 2000. We find (1) that the Western media {{was more likely to}} catch boomerangs from countries where abuses are more severe, local activists are more numerous and media savvy, and where transnational activists are heavily involved; but (2) that Latin America’s boomerangs received special media attention {{since the beginning of the}} global market for human rights boomerangs in the 1970 s and 80 s, while equally compelling boomerangs from other countries were ignored or underpublicized. This “Latin American advantage ” stems from an early lead in boomerang supply and demand that was later bolstered through path dependent mechanisms. As pioneers in the global market for human rights boomerangs, Latin American countries secured first mover advantages that endured throughout the 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} how and what Wattana-dharm Thai [Thai culture] has influenced Thai PR practice {{through the eyes}} of Thai PR managers and practitioners. It also provides some background information about the evolution of Thai PR practice to link to the current Thai PR practice. The study employs a qualitative paradigm with in-depth interviews as the main method. Documentary sources are mostly used as a supplement. This thesis provides detailed qualitative data describing how Thai public relations (PR) practitioners operate in Thailand both offline and online. The findings highlighted that Wattana-dharm Thai has a strong influence on Thai PR practice. There are eight main Wattana-dharm Thai aspects that influence Thai PR practice: 1) Relationship orientation (relationships in a Thai style including Bunkhun, Pen-Mitr, and Alum aluay relationships); 2) Community-based orientation; 3) Sanook orientation; 4) Hierarchical structure; 5) Buddhist orientation, 6) Monarchy institution respect; 7) Face and eyes in society; and 8) Form over the content. Thai PR practice has an emphasis on Saang Kwaampratabjai [impression building] through Wattana-dharm Thai. For example, historically, Thais accepted westerners because they did Saang Kwaampratabjai by bringing technology and development to the country. Thais have a positive attitude toward westerners because of this history of impression. Thai PR practitioners also try to use Saang Kwaampratabjai influence the public, such as <b>journalists</b> <b>and</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> by offering incentives altruistically (e. g. Namjai, Bunkhun, etc). Thai PR practice Saang Kwaampratabjai based on Buddhism and their respect of the monarchy. Thai PR place an importance on details of public’s personal information to instigate Saang Kwaampratabjai. For online PR, Thai PR use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support Saang Kwaampratabjai. It would appear that ICTs, in part, are used to promote company’s image rather than having any practical use. Hence, the core of Thai PR is how to practice Saang Kwaampratabjai based solely on personal and social relationship. This thesis aims to fill in the gaps in knowledge relating to PR and culture. It will make a contribution to the academic literature on culture and public relations, not only in the West but globally. This will also provide a framework for Thai PR practitioners to improve and develop their work. This thesis examines culture and PR through the lens of Thai terminology and discourse facilitated by a native inside-out view moderated by the distance obtained by leaving my country for a substantial proportion of the period of the study. This distance allowed me to re-consider many taken-for-granted aspects of my own culture, as well as allowing me to take on board other cultural perspectives available in a Western but international university. Thus this thesis is in part autobiographical, product of my research journey that allowed me to engage with a range of fundamental issues central to cross-cultural living such as hierarchy, religion, political and regal institutional frameworks, and gender...|$|E

Although the scientific record contradicts these assertions, the news media have ignored a critical evaluation of what, exactly, the new technologies purport to explain. The article which follows presents a critical analysis of the theoretical, practical, and philosophical limitations of the functional neuroimaging modalities (fMRI, PET, SPECT), and why these methods are not used outside of the research setting in the clinical practice of psychiatry today...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor´s Thesis „Recession Agenda in Estonian Daily Newspapers in 2008 “ was {{to examine}} the {{coverage}} of recession agenda in the print media. To do this, I conducted an empirical study with the aim to find out how the issue is constructed in the media and how is it defined. The theoretical basis of my thesis consisted agenda-setting theory and media roles from normative theory. In order to find the answers I reviewed the media coverage in the daily newspapers Eesti Päevaleht and Postimees of 2008 when the dramatic recession in economy and the assumed rise of the topic in the media took place. Altogether 160 articles were analysed and on the basis of those I carried out the content-anaysis and the qualitative analysis of the essence. In the content analysis I observed the topic of recession in the context, the essence of the media coverage and the changes in the coverages. In the qualitative analysis of the essence it was observed how the economic recession was defined in the articles reflecting the opinion of different politicians and which solutions were offered in the course of those discussions in order to normalise the economic situation. As it resulted from the content analysis, during the period of observation, the topic of the economic recession claimed a significant position among the <b>journalists</b> <b>and</b> the <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders.</b> In comparison with {{the beginning of the year}} the topic had become more significant by the end of the year. The analysis also showed the media not being consistent and persistent in keeping the public discussion of the recession. The issue was sensational when initial facts of the drop in economy appeared, however, the same kind of attention was not achieved in the further course of events. Different representatives of various status groups were given the possibility to express themselves, which activity is considered a presumption for a public debate. The most of space in the given newspapers was given to experts and therefore we can assume that in the given period constructive criticism was offered by the media. Apparently, the most passive group to give their opinion were the politicians. Concerning the reasons for the economic recession, the most frequent reasons which were drawn and pointed out were the shortsightedness and the inability of the government to handle and manage with these problems. The qualitative analysis of the content revealed that the dominant characteristics of the interpretations of the recession by politicians and the offered solutions by them would be characterized with the acts of populistic contrasting and opportunism. While the coalition interpreted the negative situation and recess in economy as a natural phase in the market economy and a good opportunity to change political directions, among the members of the opposition parties the recession was mainly treated as the crisis and the result of the operation and activities of the government. The analysis made clear that there was practically no unison in the further economic-political problems and issues. The review also brought out the principal difference between the solutions offered by the opposition and the coalition parties, whereas the members of the opposition found that the economical situation demanded the state interference, the coalition excluded the state interference on the principles of free market economy. In addition the opposition found that the initiative step to make, in order to improve the economic situation, is to change the government...|$|R
