Here, the LabSystem is introduced for integrated, automated DNA purification and amplification. It {{consists of a}} disposable, centrifugally-driven DNA purification platform (LabTube) and the subsequent amplification in a low-cost UV/vis-reader (LabReader). In this paper, food safety {{was chosen as the}} first sample application with pathogenic verotoxin-producing (VTEC) Escherichia coli (E. coli) in water and milk, and the product-spoiler Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris (A acidoterrestris) in apple juice as sample organisms.

By optimizing manual purification protocols inside the LabTube, as little as 45 inserted DNA copies were extracted from E. coli and A. acidoterrestris lysates in real samples (milk, juice and water). To run isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) and PCR inside the LabReader, temperature control as well as data analysis methods were implemented.

40|$|Abstract Germline {{mutations}} in the TP 53 gene {{are associated with}} Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-Like Syndromes, characterized by increased predisposition to early-onset cancers. In Brazil, the prevalence of the TP 53 -p. R 337 H germline mutation is exceedingly high {{in the general population}} and in cancer-affected patients, probably as result of a founder effect. Several genotyping methods are used for the molecular diagnosis of LFS/LFL, however Sanger sequencing is still considered the gold standard. We compared performance, cost and turnaround time of Sanger sequencing, PCR-RFLP, TaqMan-PCR and HRM in the p. R 337 H genotyping. The performance was determined by analysis of 95 genomic DNA samples and results were 100 % concordant for all methods. Sequencing was the most expensive method followed by TaqMan-PCR, PCR-RFLP and HRM. The overall cost of HRM increased with the prevalence of positive samples, since confirmatory sequencing must be performed when a sample shows an abnormal melting profile, but remained lower than all other methods when the mutation prevalence was less than 2. 5 %. Sequencing had the highest throughput and the longest turnaround time, while TaqMan-PCR showed the lowest turnaround and <b>hands-on</b> <b>times.</b> All methodologies studied are suitable for the detection of p.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{further the}} accuracy of the COBAS AMPLICOR (Roche) (CA) PCR-based system in detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in endocervical specimens. Endocervical specimens collected for any indication for testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae among a university hospital health system population were included. Testing for C. trachomatis was done by two PCR methods, CA and manual microwell AMPLICOR (Roche) (MWA), and by culture; testing for N. gonorrhoeae was done by CA and culture. Discrepancy resolution was performed. Reproducibility testing and <b>hands-on</b> labor <b>time</b> measurements for CA were done. Among 654 C. trachomatis samples, the prevalence of true positivity was 9. 2 %, and among the 618 N. gonorrhoeae samples, the prevalence of true positivity was 4. 4 %. For detection of C. trachomatis, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were, respectively, as follows for each test: CA, 93. 3, 99. 7, 99. 3, and 96. 4 %; MWA, 91. 7, 99. 7, 99. 2, and 96. 5 %; and culture, 65. 0, 100, 96. 6, and 100 %. For detection of N. gonorrhoeae those values were as follows: CA, 96. 3, 100, 99. 8, and 100 %; and culture, 92. 6, 100, 99. 7, and 100 %. <b>Hands-on</b> labor <b>time</b> for each clinical result was estimated to be at 7. 5 min.

40|$|The Abbott RealTime human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) assay (ART) and the Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV- 1 test (CTM) are commercially available assays for quantification of HIV- 1 RNA in plasma. We evaluated performance characteristics, workflow, throughput, reliability, and direct costs of these assays. Both assays yielded good correlation of quantitative results (r = 0. 95) among clinical specimens, with a mean difference of − 0. 34 log 10 copies/ml. Testing of healthy donor plasma specimens yielded “target not detected” results by ART, with “HIV- 1 RNA detected, < 40 copies/ml” results for 3. 3 % (3 of 90 samples) of these specimens by CTM. Both the m 2000 sp/m 2000 rt (ART) and docked CAP/CTM 96 (CTM) instrument systems were capable of operating with continuous, uninterrupted workflow. When daily maintenance and cleaning were included, ART and CTM run durations (5 h 52 min and 6 h 4 min, respectively) and <b>hands-on</b> <b>times</b> (53 min and 46 min, respectively) were similar for a run batch size of 24. While ART was more flexible in terms of run batch size, CTM required fewer user interventions and consistently produced higher specimen throughput rates at 8, 16, and 24 h. Assay run failure rates were 6. 3 % (1 of 16 runs) and 4. 2 % (1 of 24 runs) for ART and CTM, respectively (P = 1. 000), with invalid specimen result rates of 1. 0 % (5 of 495 specimens) and 2. 8 % (11 of 399 specimens), respectively (P = 0. 073).

40|$|Reliable {{analytical}} {{tools are}} important for time efficient and economical process development, production and batch release of pharmaceuticals. Therapeutics recovered from human plasma, called plasma protein products, involve a large pharmaceutical industry of plasma fractionation. In plasma fractionation of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) and albumin (HSA) recommended analysis techniques are regulated by the European Pharmacopoeia and are including total protein concentration assays and zone electrophoresis for protein composition and purity. These techniques are robust, but more efficient techniques with higher resolution, specificity and less <b>hands-on</b> <b>time</b> are available. Surface plasmon resonance is an optical method to study biomolecular interactions label-free in real time. This technology {{was used in this}} master thesis to set up assays using Biacore systems for quantification of HSA and hIgG from all steps of chromatographic plasma fractionation as a tool for process development and in-process control. The analyses have simplified mass balance calculations to a high extent as they imply specific detection of the proteins compared with using total protein detection. The assays have a low <b>hands-on</b> <b>time</b> and are very simple to perform and the use of one master calibration curve during a full week decreases analysis time to a minimum. Quick, in-process control quantification of one sample is easily obtained within < 10 minutes. For final QC of hIgG or for process development, an assay to quantify the distribution of the IgG subclasses (1 - 4) was set up on Biacore and showed significantly lower <b>hands-on</b> <b>time</b> compared with a commercial ELISA.
