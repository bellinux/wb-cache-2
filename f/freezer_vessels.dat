5000|$|In South Africa, hake is {{targeted}} by four distinct fisheries: the offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries, and the hake longline and hake handline sectors. The offshore demersal trawl fishery {{is by far}} the biggest of the four. Approximately 84% of the hake total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated to the offshore demersal trawl fishery. The inshore trawl and hake longline fisheries are each allocated approximately 6% of the TAC and the handline fishery presently accounts for about 3% of the allocation, although this has not been caught in recent years. [...] Trawling for hake takes place in a near continuous band on well-established grounds that extend from the Namibian border on the west coast to the extreme eastern part of the Agulhas Bank off the south-east coast. [...] Exploitation is predominantly at depths of between 300 to 800m on the west coast and less than 200m on the south coast. [...] The offshore demersal trawl fleet consists of 52 trawlers. Twenty-seven fresh fish trawlers preserve hake on ice and return it to shore for processing, while 18 <b>freezer</b> <b>vessels</b> produce frozen headed and gutted (H&G) hake. Seven more sophisticated freezer trawlers produce frozen fillets at sea [...] The gear configuration consists of “otter trawls” - gear towed along the seabed with trawl doors (or otter boards) keeping the mouth of the net open. Trawlers generally tow their nets at 3.5 knots for one to three hours, mainly in daylight when targeting hake [...] Trawling occurs mainly over sandy sediments, but areas of muddy substrate and coarser, gravely substrates are also trawled [...] A five-year (2014-2019) benthic trawl experiment is currently underway [...] The purpose of the experiment is to determine the environmental impact of demersal trawling in South African waters. It is being implemented by SADSTIA in partnership with the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries, the University of Cape Town, the South African Environmental Observation Network and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. The catch of the offshore demersal trawl sector amounts to approximately 130 000 tonnes per year (2013 catches) [...] although this has varied between 118 and 166 000 tonnes, and consists of approximately 90% M. paradoxus and 10% M. capensis. The main bycatch species are kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monk (Lophius vomerinus). Trawler owners and operators produce a mix of fresh and frozen products, supplying them to retail and food-service markets both locally and internationally. The main export markets are in Europe, Australia and the United States.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} different management tools, particularly input and quality controls on Bangladesh’s industrial trawl fishery. Results show that the efficiency of industrial trawl fishery comes from multiple owner managed vessels, export oriented vessels and registered vessels that are mainly engaged in double rigger trawling. Results also indicate that <b>freezer</b> <b>vessels</b> with small storage capacity, using small gear are relatively less efficient. This study shows {{that there is no}} depletion or reduction in marine fish stock over the period and shrimp vessels are technically more efficient than fish vessels.

40|$|The {{technique}} {{that allows the}} preservation of all natural body color {{was developed by the}} German Walther Thiel in 1992. After applying the formula, you can keep the body out of the liquid, taking care not to dry out and storing it in a closed container, making the logistic of using the body much easier and convenient, there's not emanation of harmful or irritating gases such in other methods. The technique was tested in November 2008, in an adult body, caucasian, male, thawed, without formolized, who was given the solution described by Thiel for intravascular injection, and then the material was immersed in a pool prepared with the dip solution. The body has now been 37 months in perfect condition. It was a nonirritating dead body and nearly odorless, with a large passive joint motion, with no stiffness. Maintains color, flexibility and plasticity of the tissues at a level equivalent to fresh material. The vascular filling with latex is done without difficulty and reaches the smallest vessels (< 1 mm), as in the fresh corpse. The method of fixation and preservation of Walther Thiel allows longer storage, keep the color, texture, plasticity and flexibility of the fresh specimen. Storage is simple and not requires the use of sinks, refrigerators or <b>freezers.</b> <b>Vessels</b> can be filled and canaliculi to their finest branches. This allows use to great advantage against formolized material, and even on fresh material for its simplicity and durability. Its many uses are applicable in anatomical research, for teaching at the undergraduate (prossection and dissection) and surgical skills training at the graduate (laparoscopy, arthroscopy, endoscopy) ...|$|R
