Fifty four sand samples were collected from the windward, crest and slip face of coastal and desert dunes (barchan, transverse, aeolian sand sheets). Onshore winds generates fi ne, well sorted, near symmetrical dune sands with mesokurtic distributions in the El Vizcaíno Desert inherited from beach sands from the Vizcaíno bay. The coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> sands are derived from nearby sand sources like the beach sands and also from alluvial deposits originated from sedimentary-volcanic and schists, granitic and granodiorite sources. This is evidenced by the presence of high quartz content, shell debris, carbonates, mica and hornblende that are constituents of the both coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> sands and are probably derived from the action of longshore drifts and onshore winds. The El Vizcaíno coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> sands are placed in the craton interior and recycled orogen fi elds in the Q-F-L diagram suggesting intrusive, sedimentary and partly metamorphosed sources in the composition of the sand.

The chronology proposed as an alternative by Baeteman and Mauz (2012) is not based on radiometric ages directly derived from this <b>inland</b> <b>dune.</b> Baeteman and Mauz (2012) propose a sea-level-driven mechanism of coastal evolution that fails to demonstrate how this dune was formed, and they do not provide any evidence in support of what they refer to as a 'surge drift line' involved in the formation of this dune, nor of the mechanisms of dune formation. We highlight numerous flaws in the comments and interpretations of Baeteman and Mauz (2012) that demonstrate failure to take into account recent findings on the main sediment-transport mechanisms and morpho-sedimentary outcomes characterising the shallow, sediment-rich, mixed storm- and tide-dominated macrotidal shoreface of the southern North Sea, compounded by an inadequate understanding of morphodynamic processes and sediment-supply conditions involved in coastal progradatio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>dune</b> {{ecosystems}} are harsh environment for long-lived woody plants {{because of poor}} water and nutrient availability and frequent sand. As a result, long-lived woody plants have {{a high risk of}} being killed by sand movement or a long period of drought and this may occur even before they reach reproductive size. As dunes become more fixed, the increased coverage of annual plants with shallow root systems and the formation of microbiotic crusts reduces water percolation to deeper soil. Woody plants which typically possess deep rooting systems may then suffer from water shortage. Finally, growth of woody plants may be strongly impeded by herbivores (browsers) which can remove a large share of a plant’s seasonal growth in these habitats. Thus, long-lived woody species can only maintain populations in such a dune environment if they possess particular life history strategies that enable to overcome these stresses. In this thesis, I studied the demography of three dominant shrubs in Mu Us Sandland, in Inner Mongolia, China, to investigate how woody plants manage to colonize (semi-) mobile sand dunes, to maintain populations across different dune fixations stages and to cope with grazing activities of large herbivores. I analyzed the differences in life history traits and demographic adaptations of my study species and discuss these differences in relation to the ecology of woody plants in dune ecosystems in general. I also evaluate the advantage of using Integral Projection Models (IPMs), the type of models used in this thesis.

40|$|Question: Does the {{neophyte}} moss Campylopus introflexus invade {{more often}} in drift sand pioneer vegetations under high nitrogen (N) deposition? Location: Fourteen <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> reserves in The Netherlands over a gradient of atmospheric N deposition. Methods: A transect study, dispersal experiment and culture experiment were carried out. In the transect study, the establishment of C. introflexus and lichens was measured in pure mats of Polytrichum piliferum, an early succession stage. The overall presence of C. introflexus in the area was also estimated. In the dispersal experiment, fragments of C. introflexus and lichen species were sown in P. piliferum mats at two sites with high and low N deposition. In the culture experiment C. introflexus fragments were grown on soil with different carbon (C) content and N dose. Results: The Campylopus:lichen ratio was positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 61) with the atmospheric ammonia concentration. Campylopus began to dominate at an ammonia air concentration of 7 μg m− 3, correlated with the overall presence of the species in the sites investigated. Survival of sown Campylopus fragments was significantly higher and the endangered lichen Cladonia strepsilis significantly lower in the site with a high ammonia concentration. Survival of Cladonia coccifera and Cladonia portentosa was high at both sites. Experimental growing of C. introflexus showed significant responses to both C content and N, although C content showed the strongest effect. Conclusions: Growth of C. introflexus is affected by soil C content and N deposition. <b>Inland</b> <b>dune</b> reserves under high N deposition risk loss of lichen-dominated vegetations because of moss encroachment...|$|E

30|$|The {{treatments}} {{documented in}} this study, prescribed burning and thinning, were undertaken to restore aspects of {{structure and composition}} that had been diminished through species conversion and long-term fire exclusion (Andreu et al. 2008, Nowacki and Abrams 2008, Ryan et al. 2013). Historic vegetation assemblages on these sites straddle the designations of Coastal Plain Oak-Loblolly Pine Forest and Inland Sand Dune and Ridge Woodland community types in Maryland (Harrison 2011), and these community types are known to harbor fire tolerant or pyrogenic vegetation supporting the use of prescribed burning as a management tool for restoration. Similarly, fire exclusion has led to tree densification with negative consequences for associated understory vegetation and wildlife (Taft 2009). We viewed the retention of off-site pines, noting that shortleaf pine would probably be more abundant than loblolly on the <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> sites, as desirable, at least over the short term, because the highly flammable needle litter represents {{an important source of}} fuel that facilitates burning (sensu Kirkman et al. 2007).|$|E

40|$|Geomorphological and archeological {{evidence}} indicates potential linkages between Plains aboriginal occupation and dune {{activity in the}} Elbow Sand Hills of southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Vegetation encroachment has rapidly outpaced migration of an active dune complex over the last 65 years. Optical ages of stabilized dune remnants indicate that dune activity predates Euro-Canadian settlement (ca. AD 1900). Early Euro-Canadian explorers observed local occupation and exploitation of the sand hills by aboriginal groups for herding and impounding bison. Mapping of archeological sites in relation to physiography reveals that sand dunes, {{in close proximity to}} permanent water resources, were preferred areas of occupation. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that aboriginal occupation disturbance may have perpetuated dune activity in the Elbow Sand Hills until the late 19 th century, and that Euro-Canadian settlement and land use emphasizing conservation may have encouraged recent stabilization. We propose that similar aboriginal occupation disturbances may have been responsible for perpetuating dune activity in other dune fields in the Great Plains. To this end, climatic variability should not be considered exclusive of other drivers of dune activity in semivegetated <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> fields of the Great Plains...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In November 2011 archaeologists of City of Rotterdam Archaeological Service (BOOR) {{conducted}} underwater {{research in}} the Yangtze harbour, Rotterdam Maasvlakte, The Netherlands. The research {{was carried out by}} order of Port of Rotterdam Authority and supervised by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands. The results of geological, botanical, zoological and archaeological analyses of the retrieved material generated new information on the occupation of a relatively high river dune by prehistoric hunter-gatherers, and on the development history of the surrounding landscape ca. 9, 000 years ago. Methods Rather than employing divers the underwater investigations were carried out on board a vessel using a wire-operated, horizontal closing grab. Three small trenches (total area ca. 375 m²) were excavated in layers in a fairly controlled fashion. Underwater excavations cannot achieve the same level of precision as is possible on land, but the many soil core samples taken in the project’s preliminary phase allowed detailed descriptions of the geomorphological stratigraphy. The excavation resulted in 316 bulk bags of soil. All soil was sieved on land, using sieves with mesh sizes of 10 and 2 mm, after which archaeologists and volunteers carefully sorted the residues, documenting a total of ca. 46, 000 finds. Results Plenty of Mesolithic occupation remains were retrieved at all three grab locations, from depths ranging between 17 to 21 m below modern MSL. The finds span the age range from ca. 8400 to 6500 BC, when the site transformed from dryland (an <b>inland</b> <b>dune)</b> to wetland (drowned delta subsurface). At the foot of the <b>inland</b> <b>dune,</b> the depositional conditions allowed for excellent preservation of bone, charcoal and plant material as well as stone artefacts. The site provides an unusually rich and detailed body of evidence on environmental conditions and the Middle Mesolithic palaeo-economy. The landscape ecotones around the site yielded an abundance of food while gradually being transformed, due to rising sea levels, from a valley containing the rivers Rhine and Meuse into the mouth area of those rivers. At 6500 BC, the site was finally transgressed: drowned in an estuary and swallowed up by the sea. Conclusion The Rotterdam Yangtze Harbour research project demonstrates the preservation of Mesolithic sites along the river Rhine, at depths in nowadays coastal and offshore areas. Furthermore, it demonstrates the feasibility of archaeological investigation of such submerged sites, even at depths of 18 to 20 m beneath sea, lake and harbour floors. Never before had such a submerged site been excavated at such a great depth. The scientific report (in English) will appear in the autumn of 2014, providing a full description of all finds as well as their landscape context...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) investigations of sediment samples collected from ongoing University of Southern Maine archaeological excavations at the Links of Quendale, southern Shetland, investigating the early-modern township of Broo. 11 sediment samples were submitted to the luminescence laboratory at SUERC for OSL dating by Ian Simpson. This report summaries the protocols, and laboratory analysis, employed in quartz single aliquot regenerative (SAR) OSL dating, as used to construct an OSL chronology for wind-blown sands in proximity to the Broo excavations, in association with archaeological structures (5 samples), and for sands in the coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> systems (6 samples). The chronology established for the inland sands, in contexts associated with the Broo 2 building and enclosure, spans from AD 1540 ± 40 (SUTL 2441) through to AD 1810 ± 25 (SUTL 2519), encompassing the archaeological period of interest. The dates obtained for sands within the enclosed and unenclosed areas to the immediate east and southwest of the excavated Broo site, are AD 1760 ± 30 - AD 1760 ± 25, and AD 1810 ± 25 (SUTL 2517 - 2518 and 2519, respectively), {{are consistent with the}} expectation that the clean sands which infill these structures, post-date the period in which the Broo township was abandoned. The coastal sand accumulations, as so far dated, yielded luminescence ages of 2380 ± 230 BC (SUTL 2526), 1510 ± 270 BC (SUTL 2527), AD 1030 ± 80 (SUTL 2528), AD 1690 ± 50 (SUTL 2529), AD 1720 ± 20 (SUTL 2530) and a mixed-age sample with youngest component at AD 1955 ± 15 (SUTL 2531), implying periods of sand mobilisation, synchronous with sand deposition in Orkney and northern Scotland, in the late Neolithic, the Early Bronze Age, the Norse period, the early-modern, and modern periods. This work suggests that the present-day physio-geographical setting of the Quendale Links, comprised of the coastal sand barrier, and the <b>inland</b> <b>dune</b> fields, is a product of a prolonged history of sand mobilisation, erosion and deposition from the Neolithic to the present day. Furthermore, the emerging temporal framework, coupled with the spatial distribution of dune forms across the Links, raises questions as to whether Little Ice Age storms were responsible for deposition, or erosive destruction of older dune-forms, and the re-mobilisation of this sediment. To test these ideas, profiling methods, both field- and laboratory- based, could be employed to obtain a more complete temporal and spatial characterisation of the dune systems and excavated sequences. Further OSL sampling and dating would be needed to define the vertical and lateral chronostratigraphies of the environmental features in the landscape and their relationships to archaeological structures...|$|E
