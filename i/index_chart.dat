Heavy water and other deuterated solvents are commonly used in chemistry, and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases. The practice also continues with tritium compounds. When the name of the solvent is given, a lowercase d is sometimes used. For example, d6-benzene and C6D6 can be used instead of 2H6C6H6.|$|E

50|$|Time-series data {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of data visualization. It {{documents}} sets of values over time. Examples of graphics in this category include <b>index</b> <b>charts,</b> stacked graphs, small multiples, and horizon graphs. <b>Index</b> <b>charts</b> are ideal to use when raw values are less important than relative changes. It is an interactive line chart that shows percentage changes for a collection of time-series data based on a selected index point. For example, stock investors could use this because they are less concerned with the specific price and more concerned with the rate of growth. Stacked graphs are area charts that are stacked on top of each other, and depict aggregate patterns. They allow viewers to see overall patterns and individual patterns. However, they do not support negative numbers and make it difficult to accurately interpret trends. An alternative to stacked graphs is small multiples. Instead of stacking each area chart, each series is individually shown so the overall trends of each sector are more easily interpreted. Horizon graphs are a space efficient method to increase the data density of a time-series while preserving resolution.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the quality index of two Al- 1 %Cu- 4. 5 %Si [...] -Mg alloys as the materials are aged is examined. When underaged {{and up to the}} peak ageing condition the yield strength of the alloys increases while the ductility decreases. The quality index is high and remains approximately constant. At moderate overageing the strength of the alloys decreases rapidly without increase in the ductility and the quality index falls. As the degree of overageing increases the ductility increases again and the quality index tends to increase marginally. The quality index has been related to the material properties using an analytical model. Using this model it is possible to generate a quality <b>index</b> <b>chart</b> that takes into account the change in strain hardening characteristics of the materials with ageing...|$|E

40|$|Market {{segmentation}} presents {{one of the}} {{key concepts}} of the modern marketing. The main goal of market segmentation is focused on creating groups (segments) of customers that have similar characteristics, needs, wishes and/or similar behavior regarding the purchase of concrete product/service. Companies can create specific marketing plan for each of these segments and therefore gain short or long term competitive advantage on the market. Depending on the concrete marketing goal, different segmentation schemes and techniques may be applied. This paper presents a predictive market segmentation model based on the application of logistic regression model and CHAID analysis. The logistic regression model was used for the purpose of variables selection (from the initial pool of eleven variables) which are statistically significant for explaining the dependent variable. Selected variables were afterwards included in the CHAID procedure that generated the predictive market segmentation model. The model results are presented on the concrete empirical example in the following form: summary model results, CHAID tree, Gain chart, <b>Index</b> <b>chart,</b> risk and classification tables...|$|E

The assessment index weight is assessed by entropy weight and the model is ultimately applied to the assessment on {{the vulnerability of the}} groundwater in Weining Plain of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Firstly, based on the seven assessment index attribute partition charts, the assessment index weight is calculated by entropy weight; then, by the ARCGIS grid image overlay tool to overlay the seven index grid images, the composite <b>index</b> <b>chart</b> of the assessment on the vulnerability of the groundwater in the study area is developed; finally, according to the classification standard, a partition chart of the assessment on the vulnerability of the groundwater in the study area is made to carry out the result analysis of the assessment on the vulnerability of the groundwater in the study area.

Applications of the method are illustrated with case studies involving Al-Si-Mg, Mg-Al-Zn, and Al-Si-Cu-Mg casting alloys.

40|$|Ground and {{structural}} responses to presence of trees can be detrimental if their probable interactions are not duly considered. For example, trees growing in swelling/shrinking clays {{can lead to}} damage of buildings that are in close proximity. Very often {{the problem is not}} identified until appreciable damage has occurred. Guidelines relating to acceptable distances of trees to buildings are available, but these usually require specialist knowledge of trees. Current practices concerning tree protection and the subject of assessing potential structural damage from trees are reviewed and shortcomings are identified. Following this, two new risk methods to assess likelihood of damage to structures are explained. One covers damage occurring from direct growth of tree roots and the other is associated with settlement/heave above shrink/swell clay. Both systems are intended to provide a basis for identifying situations where advice by tree specialists should be sought, ideally in advance of occurrence of damage. The former was tested by field surveys at several locations in and around London and the latter by well-documented case studies. Both demonstrated that the systems have broad applications.
