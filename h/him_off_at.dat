Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.|$|E
5|$|After {{the heavy}} 4–1 {{defeat in the}} {{previous}} Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour, and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder {{was one of the}} three selectors and advocated his own retention, but his two colleagues had voted <b>him</b> <b>off.</b> <b>At</b> first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised. He was unanimously selected by the board. Woodfull had limited leadership experience and in his brief captaincy duties had been the first captain to declare his team's second innings in Shield history.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{returned}} from his injury on February 19, 2012 at Elimination Chamber to show support for John Laurinaitis. Christian returned on the March 16 episode of SmackDown, hosting an episode of the 'Peep Show' and given a spot on Laurinaitis' team in a 12-man tag match at WrestleMania XXVIII. On the March 26 episode of Raw, {{as part of a}} storyline, Christian was injured once again after (kayfabe) re-aggravating his neck and shoulder in a match with CM Punk. This was to write <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> WrestleMania as it was later reported that Christian has not yet been fully medically cleared to compete due to a history of shoulder injuries. Despite the injury, Christian still appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct long-time friend Edge.|$|E
50|$|In July 1991, O'Shaughnessy joined Exeter City for £10,000. After {{a disappointing}} three-game spell at St James Park under 1966 FIFA World Cup winner Alan Ball, which saw <b>him</b> sent <b>off</b> <b>at</b> Huddersfield Town, O'Shaughnessy joined Darlington in January 1992.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Ross did not add what he {{afterwards}} {{told his}} daughter, that Guy {{seemed not to}} {{know whether it was}} raining or not; that he had put an umbrella into his hand, and seen <b>him</b> march <b>off</b> <b>at</b> full speed, through the pouring rain, with it under his arm.|$|R
5|$|The knights and {{the entire}} town mourn over Niren's death. Flynn realizes that the blastia used in the {{fortress}} where the aer abnormality originated, along with the piece he spotted on the floor, were a specialized type used only by Garista. Yuri and Flynn confront Garista with this information, and Garista reveals that he was attempting to illegally create {{a new kind of}} blastia, but failed and decided to leave the blastia to destroy itself, therefore destroying Shizontonia and killing any and all witnesses. Yuri and Flynn attempt to arrest Garista, but a fight ensues and Yuri kills him. In the aftermath, Shizontonia is evacuated due to the failure of the barrier blastia. Yuri leaves the knights, taking Niren's blastia as a keepsake and bringing Repede along with him, saying his goodbyes to everyone in the town. Flynn sees <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the gates, and the two share a fond farewell, swearing to meet again one day.|$|E
25|$|As a young boy, Gould {{decided he}} {{wanted nothing to do}} with farming which was what his father did, and so his father dropped <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a nearby school with 50 cents and a sack of clothes.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, Emile's leave {{ended and}} he {{returned}} to Afghanistan. Friends who came to see <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the airport noted that unlike previous such occasions, Bethany was not there. They attributed her absence to the couple's marital problems.|$|E
5000|$|September 21, 2008: A {{young man}} was {{attacked}} by another passenger on a Greyhound Canada schedule in northwestern Ontario. Police arrested a 28-year-old man {{near the town of}} White River, about 300 km north of Sault Ste. Marie, shortly after the bus driver let <b>him</b> get <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the side of the highway.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't {{stay here}} alone," [...] shivered the half-witted boy. Then, before Dick could stop <b>him,</b> he set <b>off</b> <b>at</b> {{the top of}} his speed, yelling discordantly as he went.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; nor shake <b>him</b> <b>off.</b> I did <b>at</b> last do that, {{but it was}} {{by turning}} round and riding {{backwards}} when we were coming home. I had just invited him to ride on while I stood still,--but he wouldn't." ...|$|R
25|$|Richmond's {{campaign}} team {{erupts in}} cheers when they learn Richmond and Adams are now {{close in the}} poll numbers. He receives a phone call, asking what the caller wants as he watches Gwen and Jamie talk. Richmond's driver drops <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the house of Jamie's grandfather, Ted Wright (Marcel Maillard). Jamie later arrives and asks his grandfather what was so important {{that he needed to}} talk to him, then he sees Richmond, who asks Jamie why he lied to him.|$|E
25|$|Miami {{continued}} to whittle away the Bills {{lead in the}} third quarter with an 8-play, 62-yard scoring drive, featuring a 17-yard run by Sammie Smith on third and 2. Stoyanovich finished the drive with a 22-yard field goal that cut their deficit down to one score, 27-20. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Dolphins 27, but this time their defense was up to the task and Kelly was intercepted by safety Jarvis Williams on the 2. However, Miami could not pick up a first down pinned deep in their own territory. Marino tried to go deep on third down, but Bills safety Mark Kelso picked <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the Dolphins 48, leading to a 28-yard Norwood field goal that gave the Bills a 30-20 lead.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better write a pretty note for me to take; Phil is so sensitive, you know, the least thing might frighten <b>him</b> <b>off</b> coming <b>at</b> all, and we had hard work to get him.

50|$|Her {{affair with}} Phil is {{revealed}} by Minty to Garry, who jilts Dawn {{on their wedding}} day and decides to leave Walford for good. Dawn is persuaded to go after him, and sees <b>him</b> sailing <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a canal. She runs alongside him, telling him that she loves him. He lets her and Summer on the boat and they leave together.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's not a {{great deal}} more, sir," [...] I answered, looking apprehensively at Major Colfax, who still stood. [...] "The man vowed I lied, but Tom laid hold of him and was for hurrying <b>him</b> <b>off</b> to Harrodstown <b>at</b> once." ...|$|R
25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E
25|$|Scherzer did {{not allow}} a baserunner until the fourth inning, when he hit John Jay with a pitch, and threw a no-hitter for 6⅓ innings – the deepest no-hit bid by an {{opponent}} in Cubs postseason history – and struck out seven Cubs before finally giving up a double to Zobrist with one out {{in the bottom of}} the seventh inning. With Scherzer having thrown 98 pitches, Dusty Baker came out to relieve him, choosing lefty Sammy Solis to face the left-handed Schwarber. Maddon countered by pinch-hitting for Schwarber, bringing right-hander Albert Almora Jr. to the plate. Solis, although he had posted a 5.88 ERA during the season, actually had fared better against right-handed batters than left-handers, but on Solis′s seventh pitch, Almora singled – his first career postseason hit in 15 at-bats – to score Zobrist and tie the game at 1–1. Solis then gave up a single to right fielder Jason Heyward that advanced Almora to second before Brandon Kintzler relieved Solis and got shortstop Addison Russell to line out to Taylor in center field. Heyward made a rare baserunning mistake by attempting to advance to second on Russell′s liner, allowing Taylor to double <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> first base to end the inning.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

6000|$|... 'How did I? How did I not?' cried she, {{clutching}} {{him by the}} arm. 'Where is it? All {{depends on}} that! Fool!' she went on, throwing <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from her <b>at</b> arm's length, as a sudden suspicion stung her--'you have not given it to the heathen woman?' ...|$|R

500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E
500|$|Ron {{particularly}} despises {{talking to}} members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him, a claymore mine (front-pointed toward enemy), and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him, and that his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself. Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for April's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the [...] "Ron Swanson Scholarship" [...] ($940) so Andy can attend one college course: Women's Studies, after Andy and April couldn't afford to pay it. In the voiceover while Ron drops Andy off for his first day of class, he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the steel mill. His father thought he shouldn't bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway.|$|E
6000|$|When the {{companion}} came, his domestic duties became very light. His wife {{encouraged him to}} dine abroad: she would let <b>him</b> <b>off</b> duty <b>at</b> the opera. [...] "Don't stay and stupefy yourself at home to-night, my dear," [...] she would say. [...] "Some men are coming who will only bore you. I would not ask them, but you know it's for your good, and now I have a sheep-dog, I need not be afraid to be alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts {{said during}} one of his shoot interviews: [...] "If I had a gun and was sitting inside a tank with one shell left and Meng is 300 yards away, he's mine, right? Well the first thing I'm going to do is jump out of the tank and shoot myself because I don't want to wound {{that son of a bitch}} and have <b>him</b> pissed <b>off</b> <b>at</b> me." ...|$|R

"When I lifted you up, sir, I {{certainly}} {{intended to}} get up behind you; but the Afridis were so close that I {{felt that it was}} impossible to do so, and that we should both be shot down before we got out of range; so I gave the horse a prod with my sword and, as I saw <b>him</b> go <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a gallop, I threw down my arms, as I told you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Leloir {{was known}} for his humility, focus and consistency, {{described}} by many as a [...] "true monk in science". Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their Fiat 600 and drop <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> 1719 Julián Alvarez Street, location of Fundación Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls. He worked sitting on the same straw seat for decades and encouraged colleagues to eat lunch in the laboratory to save time, bringing enough meat stew to share with everyone. Indeed, despite Leloir's frugality and extreme dedication to his research, he was a sociable man, claiming not to like working alone.|$|E
2500|$|Elliott {{asked the}} man if he killed Betty Jo Booker, he replied [...] "no". He then {{asked him if he}} knew who did; the man said [...] "no". On {{the night of the murder}} of Booker and Martin, it was {{revealed}} that the suspect spent some time with a friend, dropped <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> home, then pulled over to the side of North Park road to urinate. He then visited his paramour, but after the plans did not work out, he went home and then to bed. Sheriff Presley and his officers then checked the details of the man's story and cleared him as a suspect. He lied during the polygraph test because of the love affair he was having with a married woman.|$|E
2500|$|Bizos {{was the son}} of Antonios (known to {{his family}} and friends as [...] "Antoni") Bizos, the mayor of the small village of Vasilitsi, south of Koroni and Kalamata on the Messenia {{peninsula}} of the Peloponnese, Greece. In May 1941 at the age of thirteen, George Bizos and his father helped seven New Zealand soldiers (Don Gladding, Mick Karup, Peter Martin, John Lewis and three others) who were hiding in the hills to escape Nazi-occupied Greece to Crete. He says the escape did not go well and he was adrift for three days until he managed {{to attract the attention of}} crew on the British destroyer, HMS Kimberley, which was on its way to the Battle of Crete. After the battle HMS Kimberley dropped <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> Alexandria, Egypt.|$|E
