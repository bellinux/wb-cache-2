5|$|In 2011, {{director}} Steven Soderbergh {{revealed that}} he had also {{been working on a}} biopic of Riefenstahl <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months. He eventually abandoned the project over concerns of its commercial prospects.|$|E
5|$|In February, Clarke {{suffered}} from {{an attack of}} jaundice that put him out of action <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> weeks. He was visited regularly by Maunsell who was, by that time, a firm friend.|$|E
5|$|Amy Dudley {{was buried}} at St. Mary's, Oxford with full pomp, which cost Dudley some £2,000. He wore {{mourning}} <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months but, as was within custom, {{did not attend}} the funeral, where Lady Dudley's half-brothers, neighbours, as well as city and county prominence played the leading parts. The court went into mourning for over a month; Robert Dudley retired to his house at Kew.|$|E

5000|$|The Béarnaise was {{formerly}} a triple-purpose breed, kept for milk, for meat and for draught work. It was traditionally milked <b>for</b> only <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months; the milk {{was used to}} make mixed cows'-milk/sheep's-milk cheeses. Milk production is low, approximately [...] in a lactation of 200 days.|$|R
5000|$|Port Leon, Florida was a {{river port}} town located {{in what is}} now Wakulla County, Florida, which existed <b>for</b> only <b>about</b> <b>six</b> years {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. Port Leon is {{classified}} as an [...] "extinct city" [...] by the State Library and Archives of Florida and only remnants can be found today.|$|R
5|$|The storm first struck Mayotte, {{affecting}} the island with gale-force gusts <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> hours. Sustained winds reached 78km/h (48mph), and wind gusts peaked at 98km/h (61mph). Effects {{on the island}} were minimal. Cyclone Ernest indirectly affected Malawi, located inland in southeast Africa. The storm's circulation removed moisture from the country and prevented any rainfall from occurring {{in the southern part}} of the country during a nine-day period.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, {{and over a}} period of 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, {{most of whom were}} arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the final two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire took control. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, the {{exchange}} lasted <b>for</b> just <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months {{with a maximum}} local traffic of 690 kbit/s (quite significant, considering the very low local content in the country) passing through {{the exchange}} while it was running. The exchange was indirectly shut down due to Fisayo Adeleke's exit from Steineng, and subsequent exit of the technical contact at SKANNET, Bolanle Akinpelu.|$|R

5|$|Anderson {{was shown}} footage of James Cameron's Avatar which sold {{him on the}} idea to shoot Resident Evil: Afterlife in digital 3D. He shot in high-definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using Cameron's Fusion Camera System, or more {{specifically}} a Sony F35 camera. The crew spent two weeks in pre-production learning the 3D camera system. With a budget of about $60 million, principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29, 2009 to December. Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget. Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009. The final showdown scene was filmed <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> days. During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.|$|E
5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including Oberon) {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was in darkness. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. One such event, which lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.|$|E
5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months and attempted {{to pursue a career}} as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E
25|$|O'Keefe was air-lifted back to Sydney <b>for</b> treatment, but <b>about</b> <b>six</b> weeks later, against doctors' orders, he {{returned}} to work on Six O'Clock Rock.

5000|$|In 1969 Bellmer had {{a stroke}} that left him paralyzed, {{and the next year}} he {{informed}} Zürn that he could no longer [...] "be responsible" [...] <b>for</b> her. <b>About</b> <b>six</b> months later, in October 1970, the 54-year-old Zürn committed suicide by leaping from the window of their Paris apartment while on a five-day leave from a hospital. At his request, Bellmer was buried next to Zürn upon his death in 1975.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} between April and September {{and there may}} be two to four litters in a year. A nest of dried grasses is {{constructed}} in a concealed position and a litter of three to nine young are born after a thirty one day gestation period. The young grow rapidly, suckle <b>for</b> <b>about</b> twenty <b>six</b> days and become sexually mature at forty days.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, {{the ship}} was re-commissioned by the U.S. Navy as USS Catlin (AP-19) <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months and was {{operated}} by the British under Lend-Lease, but her old coal-fired engines were too slow for effective combat use. After conversion to oil-fired boilers, {{the ship was}} chartered to the U.S. Army as USAT George Washington and sailed {{around the world in}} 1943 in trooping duties. The ship sailed in regular service to the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean from 1944 to 1947, and was laid up in Baltimore after ending her Army service. A fire in January 1951 damaged the ship severely, and she was sold for scrapping the following month.|$|E
5|$|Einstein was {{now without}} a {{permanent}} home, unsure {{where he would}} live and work, and equally worried {{about the fate of}} countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of her}} career, U-16 {{operated}} in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December. U-16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water leak in March flooded U-16s batteries and put the U-boat out of action <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> weeks of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking. In all U-16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only U-10-class submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5000|$|The one {{lieutenant}} that W.W. sent to Boston, James [...] "Pep" [...] Cooper, {{came back}} to Detroit after W.W.'s death and took over {{what was left of}} Y.B.I.

50|$|From 1606 onwards, {{his style}} started {{to show the}} {{influence}} of Caravaggio. It is believed {{that this was a}} response to new tendencies in the Antwerp school of painting around this time. He painted in this style <b>for</b> <b>about</b> five to <b>six</b> years.|$|R
5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|White {{obtained}} {{his primary}} education in local common schools, including the Romney Classical Institute, which was {{presided over by}} Dr. William Henry Foote. Beginning {{at the age of}} 14, he worked in his father's Clerk of the County Court office <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> years. Following his law apprenticeship under his father, White studied jurisprudence under John White Brockenbrough at his Lexington Law School in Lexington. Following the completion of his legal studies, White was admitted to the bar on March 30, 1854, and immediately began practicing law in Romney. Along with his relative Alfred P. White, his father, and his brother Christian Streit White, Robert White became an active and influential member of the Hampshire County bar. Prior to the American Civil War, White was enrolled {{as a member of the}} Romney Literary Society.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got away without {{incident}} and with no changes in position. On the outside of turn three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from the rear end of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not go well, as his car was stationary <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
50|$|The 386th EACS began focused {{preparations}} <b>for</b> {{the deployment}} <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months earlier. Their wartime {{mission was to}} deploy to potentially austere environments, so the base here was {{not much of a}} departure. The 386th EACS also conducted field training in the desert environment of Western Utah to practice chemical warfare, security and other combat skills.|$|R
50|$|Below the Calawah {{confluence}} the Bogachiel River widens considerably {{and takes}} a meandering course westward through a broad valley. The Sol Duc River enters this valley from the north, and the two streams meander alongside one another for several miles before joining. The Quillayute River, formed by the confluence, flows west <b>for</b> only <b>about</b> <b>six</b> miles more before reaching the Pacific Ocean at La Push. In its lower reach the Quillayute River enters the coastal wilderness of Olympic National Park. The mouth of the Quillayute is contained within the Quileute Indian Reservation.|$|R
50|$|On {{its second}} {{formation}} in late 1941 under Yakov Cherevichenko, it remained in existence <b>for</b> only <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months, being redesignated Voronezh Front on 7 July 1942. By {{the time of}} Operation Blau, the German summer offensive of 1942, the Front comprised the 3rd, 13th, 40th, 48th Armies, the 5th Tank Army, and the 2nd Air Army. It was then reformed, then disbanded on 11-12 March 1943 and its headquarters became HQ Kursk Front after a short time expecting to be the headquarters and {{the basis of the}} new Reserve Front.|$|R
5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve {{that he had to}} learn more and gain more experience. So when he returned to Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family during those years indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, but he soon moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> days, Ginger {{maintained}} minimal hurricane status. As it meandered {{over the}} central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained {{an unusually large}} eye, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter. On September 18, Ginger turned {{to the south and}} slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.|$|E
5|$|In April 1931, Siamese King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambai Barni {{traveled}} from Bangkok to Ophir Hall (currently Reid Hall of Manhattanville College). The couple had flown from Japan to Vancouver {{and took a}} train to Chicago. From Chicago, they took another train, departing at 10:30a.m. on the 21st and arriving at noon on the 22nd, and the trip took 25 hours; the king had requested the train travel slowly, as he was recovering from bronchitis and malaria. The train arrived at the Scarborough station, where journalists, spectators, and video and still photographers met them, along with one of their hosts; they were later driven across the county to stay at Ophir Hall <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> weeks {{in order for a}} cataract operation could be performed by a New York doctor on the king's left eye. State troopers and a squad of New York Central policemen were stationed at Scarborough to ensure a smooth transfer.
