50|$|As {{a culinary}} herb, {{it is used}} mainly in salads. The flavour of <b>French</b> <b>sorrel</b> is {{slightly}} bitter or tangy, spiced {{with a hint of}} lemon; the sharp flavour is due to oxalic acid. <b>French</b> <b>sorrel</b> is hardy in most regions, tolerating frost, full sun and short dry spells. It grows quickly to a clump up to 1 m in diameter, with long leaves up to 10 cm in width. It is sometimes preferred for culinary uses to Rumex acetosa, garden sorrel.|$|E
5000|$|Rumex scutatus is a {{plant in}} the {{buckwheat}} family, used as a culinary herb. Its common names include <b>French</b> <b>sorrel,</b> buckler sorrel, shield-leaf sorrel, and sometimes the culinary name [...] "green-sauce".|$|E
50|$|These {{plants are}} edible. The leaves of most species contain oxalic acid and tannin, {{and many have}} {{astringent}} and slightly purgative qualities. Some species with particularly high levels of oxalic acid are called sorrels (including sheep's sorrel, Rumex acetosella, common sorrel, Rumex acetosa, and <b>French</b> <b>sorrel,</b> Rumex scutatus), {{and some of these}} are grown as leaf vegetables or garden herbs for their acidic taste.|$|E
40|$|Tuberculous {{infection}} of the ischium is rare. Between the years 1901 - 1936 only seven cases were reported, all in <b>French</b> (Coeuilliez 1909, <b>Sorrel</b> and Sorrel-Dejerine 1932). In 1936 Kaplan described the first case in English, and later Magnusson (1938) reported further cases, also in English, from Sweden. He reported eight cases of osteitis of the ischium treated at Varberg between 1928 - 1936, seven in adults and one in a child aged six years. Five of these cases were, however, of uncertain etiology. Magnusson assessed the incidence of tuberculosis of the ischium as 02 per cent of all cases of bone tuberculosis. All the above authors {{drew attention to the}} insidious onset and invariable previous gluteal injury. Unexplained sciatic pain was often the first symptom. For extensive lesions, Milch (1935) of New York described excision of the ischium and its ramus by subperiosteal resection from the perineum. CASE REPORT A girl aged twenty years, a costing clerk, reported to her doctor complaining of an aching pain in the groin. The pain was of gradual onset and was present both during activity and at rest, but more particularly on walking. She had been treated for epilepsy, but otherwis...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{because the}} miners threw their apple or pear cores into the wagons, the spoil tips became colonised with fruit trees. One can even observe the {{proliferation}} of buckler-leaved sorrel (<b>French</b> <b>sorrel</b> - Rumex scutatus), the seeds {{of which have been}} carried within the cracks in the pine timber used in the mines. Furthermore, on account of its dark colour, the South face of the spoil tip is significantly warmer than its surroundings, which contributes to the diverse ecology of the area. In this way, the spoil tip of Pinchonvalles, at Avion, hosts 200 different varieties of higher plants. Some thirty species of birds nest there.|$|E
40|$|Plant growth {{promoting}} rhizobacteria produce chemical compounds with different {{benefits for the}} plant. Among them, HCN is recognized as a biocontrol agent, based on its ascribed toxicity against plant pathogens. Based on several past studies questioning the validity of this hypothesis, we have re-addressed the issue by designing {{a new set of}} in vitro experiments, to test if HCN-producing rhizobacteria could inhibit the growth of phytopathogens. The level of HCN produced by the rhizobacteria in vitro does not correlate with the observed biocontrol effects, thus disproving the biocontrol hypothesis. We developed a new concept, in which HCN does not act as a biocontrol agent, but rather is involved in geochemical processes in the substrate (e. g. chelation of metals), indirectly increasing the availability of phosphate. Since this scenario can be important for the pioneer plants living in oligotrophic alpine environments, we inoculated HCN producing bacteria into sterile mineral sand together with germinating plants and showed that the growth of the pioneer plant <b>French</b> <b>sorrel</b> was increased on granite-based substrate. No such effect could be observed for maize, where plantlets depend on the nutrients stored in the endosperm. To support our concept, we used KCN and mineral sand and showed that mineral mobilization and phosphate release could be caused by cyanide in vitro. We propose that in oligotrophic alpine environments, and possibly elsewhere, the main contribution of HCN is in the sequestration of metals and the consequential indirect increase of nutrient availability, which is beneficial for the rhizobacteria and their plant hosts...|$|E
