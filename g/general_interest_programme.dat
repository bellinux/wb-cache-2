In the afternoon of August 9, 2011 he was re-elected ORF Director General with 29 out of 35 votes cast, making him only the second ORF Director after Gerd Bacher since 1967 to be elected for a second term in office. He announced that one of his priorities during his second term in office would be founding ORF III as a special-interest channel for culture. ORF III, a special-interest channel for culture went on air on October 26, 2011 at the initiative of Alexander Wrabetz. ORF III, sometimes also referred to as ORF 3, is an Austrian special-interest channel that was conceived as a complement to the <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> <b>programmes</b> of ORF 1 and ORF 2, and which focuses in particular on cultural topics. Under Wrabetz, the ORF launched its in-house online television media library, the ORF TVThek on November 13, 2009. Alexander Wrabetz believes that [...] "venturing into smart television is an essential element of ORF’s strategy".In February 2013, Wrabetz presented the ORF second-screen application [...] "Schladming APP". It was followed by the presentation of the [...] "Nationalratswahl APP 2013" [...] in the summer of 2013. After the successful second-screen application, available during the ski world championship in Schladming, and the one during the 2013 National Council elections, Wrabetz continued ORF’s venture into the smart television age with the [...] "ORF Ski Weltcup APP". He introduced the [...] "ORF Ski Weltcup APP" [...] at the Ski World Cup Opening in Sölden, Tyrol, on October 26, 2013.|$|R

40|$|Services of <b>general</b> <b>interest,</b> such as {{telecommunications}} services, postal services, and {{the supply}} of electricity and gas have received much attention over the last decade. Welfare-oriented public service models have come {{under the pressure of}} market-oriented approaches. Whilst access to services of <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> is frequently regarded as an important element of citizenship in the EC, recent consumer law programmes have placed them into the context of consumer law. This article discusses the implications that a consumer law approach could have on services of <b>general</b> <b>interest.</b> It concludes that consumer law cannot deal with services of <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> in a comprehensive manner but that their citizenship dimension requires special instruments that safeguard access to services of <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> where market failure is predictable.
