50|$|The {{internal}} passive is lost almost everywhere. Instead, {{the original}} reflexive/mediopassive augmentations (e.g. <b>Forms</b> <b>V,</b> VI, VII) serve as both reflexive and passive. The passive of Forms II and III is generally constructed with a reflex of <b>Forms</b> <b>V</b> and VI, using a prefix it- {{derived from the}} Classical prefix ta-. The passive of Form I uses either a prefix in- (from Form VII) or it- (modeled after <b>Forms</b> <b>V</b> and VI). The other forms often have no passive.|$|R

2500|$|In the Ukrainian {{language}} both na Ukrajini (with the preposition na - [...] "on") and v Ukrajini (with the preposition v - [...] "in") {{have been}} used. Linguistic prescription in Russian dictates usage of na. Russian-language media in Ukraine are increasingly using the parallel <b>form</b> <b>v</b> Ukraine. The {{difference between the}} two prepositions is not clear and mostly relies on tradition. There are a number of examples for use of both prepositions. The preposition na continues to be used with Ukraine (and with Rus') in other Slavic languages, including Polish, Czech, and Slovak. However, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene languages never use na Ukrajini, u/v Ukrajini being the proper form.|$|E
