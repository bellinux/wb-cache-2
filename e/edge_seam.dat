40|$|We {{present a}} new {{efficient}} method for cubemap filtering which alleviates the <b>edge</b> <b>seam</b> artifacts that occur with standard cubemap filtering methods. This approach works with current cubemapping hardware since {{it does not}} require rarely supported texture border hardware used in other approaches [1]. Despite the fact that cube maps are defined on the spherical domain, standard cubemap filtering techniques perform filtering independently on each cube face. The main problem with this approach is that no information is propagated across edges, thus creating undesirable discontinuities along the cube face edges. A limitation of nearly all cubemapping hardware which makes the seam problem substantially worse {{is the fact that the}} bilinear texel filtering is not able to fetch across cube faces thus producing a hard seam artifact. The seam problem also causes aliasing artifacts. These two compounding problems limit the usefulness o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTGFβ 3 {{signaling}} initiates and completes sequential {{phases of}} cellular differentiation {{that is required}} for complete disintegration of the palatal medial <b>edge</b> <b>seam,</b> that progresses between 14 and 17 embryonic days in the murine system, which is necessary in establishing confluence of the palatal stroma. Understanding the cellular mechanism of palatal MES disintegration in response to TGFβ 3 signaling will result in new approaches to defining the causes of cleft palate and other facial clefts that may result from failure of seam disintegration. We have isolated MES primary cells to study the details of MES disintegration mechanism by TGFβ 3 during palate development using several biochemical and genetic approaches. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of MES disintegration where MES, independently yet sequentially, undergoes cell cycle arrest, cell migration and apoptosis to generate immaculate palatal confluency during palatogenesis in response to robust TGFβ 3 signaling. The results contribute to a missing fundamental element to our base knowledge of the diverse roles of TGFβ 3 in functional and morphological changes that MES undergo during palatal seam disintegration. We believe that our findings {{will lead to more}} effective treatment of facial clefting...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{canonical}} Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays {{essential role}} in development and diseases. Previous studies have implicated the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the regulation of normal palate development, but functional Wnt/β-catenin signaling and its tissue-specific activities remain to be accurately elucidated. In this study, we show that functional Wnt/β-catenin signaling operates primarily in the palate epithelium, particularly in the medial edge epithelium (MEE) of the developing mouse palatal shelves, consistent with the expression patterns of β-catenin and several Wnt ligands and receptors. Epithelial specific inactivation of β-catenin by the K 14 -Cre transgenic allele abolishes the canonical Wnt signaling activity in the palatal epithelium and leads to an abnormal persistence of the medial <b>edge</b> <b>seam</b> (MES), ultimately causing a cleft palate formation, a phenotype resembling that in Tgfβ 3 mutant mice. Consistent with this phenotype is the down-regulation of Tgfβ 3 and suppression of apoptosis in the MEE of the β-catenin mutant palatal shelves. Application of exogenous Tgfβ 3 to the mutant palatal shelves in organ culture rescues the midline seam phenotype. On the other hand, expression of stabilized β-catenin in the palatal epithelium also disrupts normal palatogenesis by activating ectopic Tgfβ 3 expression in the palatal epithelium and causing an aberrant fusion between the palate shelf and mandible in addition to severely deformed palatal shelves. Collectively, our results demonstrate an essential role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the epithelial component at the step of palate fusion during palate development by controlling the expression of Tgfβ 3 in the MEE...|$|E

40|$|The use of hot-dip {{galvanized}} steel sheets as base material for laser brazing {{led to the}} formation of spatter and a wavy appearance of the seam. High-speed imaging revealed that spatter formation occurs mainly close to the <b>seam</b> <b>edges.</b> Thermography of the brazing process showed that the type of zinc coating affects the resulting temperature distribution and thereby changes the conditions for the zinc evaporation. Higher temperatures were observed at the <b>seam</b> <b>edges</b> on electro galvanized and phosphated substrates. The cross sections and the process analysis indicate that the zinc evaporation on electro galvanized substrates takes place prior to the wetting with the molten filler material. On the other hand a merely partial evaporation of the zinc coating and the accumulation of zinc at the <b>seam</b> <b>edges</b> takes place during the brazing of {{hot-dip galvanized}} substrates. The formation of spatter is caused by the zinc dissolution and the subsequent evaporation of the zinc rich alloy at the <b>seam</b> <b>edges.</b> The optical properties of the base material are considered to be a crucial factor for the temperature distribution and the resulting zinc evaporation.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a robotic cell to perform assembly and handling operations on cloth. - A flexible automation approach was adopted, in which the robot was required to control the cloth panel during both handling and sewing operations, without the aid of hard automation attachments which might limit the flexibility of the system. The cell consisted of an adaptively controlled robot, a hierarchy of controllers, a conventional sewing machine, a two-fingered fabric steering end-effector, and several sensor systems. A technique was developed for producing a seam parallel to an edge of arbitrary contour, in which two cameras, a cloth tension sensor and the sewing machine's shaft encoder provided the sensory input. Two sensory servo control systems were required, one control system generated the robot's trajectory to maintain a small constant cloth tension, and the other directed the robot to manipulate the cloth panel to maintain a constant seam width. The design of the cloth tension control was based on the measured frequency response of the open loop system. The seam width control was designed using simulation studies, which accounted for the control transfer function, and nonlinearities such as camera pixel resolution, time delays and robot motion limitations. Several robotic handling techniques were developed, so that a cloth panel placed arbitrarily on the sewing table could be set up for an <b>edge</b> <b>seaming</b> operation, and the cloth could be rotated about the needle. The system's flexibility was demonstrated in the assembly of an irregularly shaped cloth panel, in which three adjacent sides were sewn up. ...|$|R
50|$|Roof {{shingles}} {{are almost}} always highly visible and so are {{an important aspect of}} a building's aesthetics in patterns, textures and colors. Roof shingles, like other building materials on vernacular buildings, are typically of a material locally available. The type of shingle is taken into account before construction because the material affects the roof pitch and construction method: Some shingles can be installed on lath where others need solid sheathing (sheeting) on the roof deck. All shingle roofs are installed from the bottom upward beginning with a starter course and the <b>edge</b> <b>seams</b> offset to avoid leaks. Many shingle installations benefit from being placed on top of an underlayment material such as asphalt felt paper to prevent leaks even from wind driven rain and snow and ice dams in cold climates. At the ridge the shingles {{on one side of the}} roof simply extend past the ridge or there is a ridge cap consisting of boards, copper, or lead sheeting. An asphalt shingle roof has flexible asphalt shingles as the ridge cap. Some roof shingles are non-combustable or have a better fire rating than others which influence their use, some building codes do not allow the use of shingles with less than a class-A fire rating to be used on some types of buildings. Due to increased fire hazard, wood shingles and organic-based asphalt shingles have become less common than fiberglass-based asphalt shingles. No shingles are water-tight so the minimum recommended roof pitch is 4:12 without additional underlayment materials.|$|R
