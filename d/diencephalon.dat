5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the <b>diencephalon</b> (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently not visible). The <b>diencephalon</b> performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the <b>diencephalon.</b> This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior <b>diencephalon.</b> The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The <b>diencephalon</b> gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), <b>diencephalon</b> (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the <b>diencephalon</b> (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the <b>diencephalon,</b> {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the <b>diencephalon</b> part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
25|$|Acquired achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia is a {{condition}} associated with damage to the <b>diencephalon</b> (primarily the thalamus of the mid brain) or the cerebral cortex (the new brain), specifically the fourth visual association area, V4 which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in colour processing.|$|E
25|$|Irregular respirations {{occur when}} injury {{to parts of}} the brain {{interfere}} with the respiratory drive. Biot's respiration, in which breathing is rapid for a period and then absent for a period, occurs because of injury to the cerebral hemispheres or <b>diencephalon.</b> Hyperventilation can occur when the brain stem or tegmentum is damaged.|$|E
25|$|Another case {{described}} {{the onset of}} anterograde amnesia {{as a result of}} cell death in the fornix, another structure that carries information from the hippocampus to the structures of the limbic system and the <b>diencephalon.</b> The patient in this case did not show any disconnection syndrome, which is unexpected since the structures involved divide the brain hemispheres (both sides of her brain were able to communicate). Instead, she showed signs of amnesia. The final diagnosis was made by MRI. This particular amnesic syndrome is difficult to diagnose and often is misdiagnosed by physicians as an acute psychiatric disorder.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} subcommissural organ is not highly {{permeable}} {{and does not}} possess fenestrated capillaries like other subventricular organs, it {{has emerged as a}} major site of congenital hydrocephalus. It is suggested that this is related to immunological blockage of SCO secretions and Sylvian's aqueduct malformation and obliteration or turbulent cerebrospinal fluid flow due to the absence of Reissner's fibers. There is evidence that in transgenic mice the overexpression of Sox3 in the dorsal midline of the <b>diencephalon</b> in a dose-dependent manner and that the conditional inactivation of presenilin-1 or the lack of huntingtin in wnt cell lineages leads to congenital hydrocephalus, which highlights the role of these proteins mediating the relation between the SCO and the condition. A more recent study using HTx rats reinforced the idea that the abnormal and dysfunction of the SCO precedes the development of the hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep {{demonstrate}} that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) {{have been found to}} have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and <b>diencephalon</b> tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was conducted to examine the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual rams than in heterosexual rams, so it is with the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams.|$|E
500|$|The {{parts of}} the brain most {{affected}} by rotational forces are the midbrain and <b>diencephalon.</b> [...] It is thought that the forces from the injury disrupt the normal cellular activities in the reticular activating system located in these areas, and that this disruption produces the loss of consciousness often seen in concussion. [...] Other areas of the brain that may be affected include {{the upper part of the}} brain stem, the fornix, the corpus callosum, the temporal lobe, and the frontal lobe. Angular accelerations of 4600, 5900, or 7900 radian/s2 are estimated to have 25, 50, or 80% risk of MTBI respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosencephalon}} divides {{into the}} telencephalon, which forms the cortex {{of the developed}} brain, and the <b>diencephalon.</b> The ventricles contained within the telencephalon become the lateral ventricles, and the ventricles within the <b>diencephalon</b> become the third ventricle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is located}} below the thalamus and {{is part of}} the limbic system. [...] In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the <b>diencephalon.</b> [...] All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is the size of an almond.|$|E
2500|$|The four {{cavities}} of {{the human}} brain are called ventricles. The two largest are the lateral ventricles in the cerebrum; the third ventricle is in the <b>diencephalon</b> of the forebrain between the right and left thalamus; and the fourth ventricle is located {{at the back of the}} pons and upper half of the medulla oblongata of the hindbrain. The ventricles are concerned with the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{areas of}} the human brain are not on the brain side of the BBB. [...] Some {{examples}} of this include the circumventricular organs, the roof of the third and fourth ventricles, capillaries in the pineal gland {{on the roof of the}} <b>diencephalon</b> and the pineal gland. The pineal gland secretes the hormone melatonin [...] "directly into the systemic circulation", thus melatonin is not affected by the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
2500|$|Nearly all {{vertebrate}} species {{possess a}} pineal gland. [...] The most important {{exception is the}} hagfish, which is often {{thought of as the}} most primitive extant vertebrate. [...] Even in the hagfish, however, there may be a [...] "pineal equivalent" [...] structure in the dorsal <b>diencephalon.</b> [...] The lancelet Branchiostoma lanceolatum, the nearest existing relative to vertebrates, also lacks a recognizable pineal gland. [...] The lamprey (considered almost as primitive as the hagfish), however, does possess one. [...] A few more developed vertebrates lost pineal glands over the course of their evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Anterograde amnesia is the {{inability}} to create new memories due to brain damage, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. The brain damage {{can be caused by}} the effects of long-term alcoholism, severe malnutrition, stroke, head trauma, encephalitis, surgery, [...] Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, cerebrovascular events, anoxia or other trauma. The two brain regions related with this condition are medial temporal lobe and medial <b>diencephalon.</b> Anterograde amnesia cannot be treated with pharmacological methods due to neuronal loss. However, treatment exists in educating patients to define their daily routines and after several steps they begin to benefit from their procedural memory. Likewise, social and emotional support is critical to improving quality of life for anterograde amnesia sufferers.|$|E
2500|$|In general, neuroglial {{cells are}} smaller than neurons; there are about 86 billion neurons and 85 billion [...] "nonneuronal" [...] (glial) cells in the human male brain. Glial cells make up about half the total volume {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. The ratio differs from one part of the brain to another. The glia/neuron ratio in the {{cerebral}} cortex is 3.72 (60.84 billion glia (72%); 16.34 billion neurons), while that of the cerebellum is only 0.23 (16.04 billion glia; 69.03 billion neurons). The ratio in the cerebral cortex gray matter is 1.48 and for the combined gray and white matter is 3.76. The ratio of the basal ganglia, <b>diencephalon</b> and brainstem combined is 11.35.|$|E
2500|$|Case {{studies also}} show that amnesia is {{typically}} associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe. [...] In addition, specific areas of the hippocampus (the CA1 region) are involved with memory. [...] Research has also shown that when areas of the <b>diencephalon</b> are damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss. Scientists {{were able to find}} that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice. In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still retained, and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition, priming (both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge. Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes. The term is [...]|$|E
2500|$|In central herniation, the <b>diencephalon</b> {{and parts}} of the {{temporal}} lobes of both of the cerebral hemispheres are squeezed through a notch in the tentorium cerebelli. [...] Transtentorial herniation can occur when the brain moves either up or down across the tentorium, called ascending and descending transtentorial herniation respectively; however descending herniation is much more common. [...] Downward herniation can stretch branches of the basilar artery (pontine arteries), causing them to tear and bleed, known as a Duret hemorrhage. The result is usually fatal. Other symptoms of this type of herniation include small, dilated, fixed pupils with paralysis of upward eye movement giving the characteristic appearance of [...] "sunset eyes". Also found in these patients, often as a terminal complication is the development of diabetes insipidus due to the compression of the pituitary stalk. [...] Radiographically, downward herniation is characterized by obliteration of the suprasellar cistern from temporal lobe herniation into the tentorial hiatus with associated compression on the cerebral peduncles. [...] Upwards herniation, on the other hand, can be radiographically characterized by obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern. Intracranial hypotension syndrome has been known to mimic downwards transtentorial herniation.|$|E
