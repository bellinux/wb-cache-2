5000|$|The {{shortage}} of multiproduct replenishment {{ships in the}} early 1970s {{led to the development}} of an improvised system for dispensing fuel from ammunition and stores ships that allowed them to transfer fuel to smaller combatants. Neither type of ship had cargo fuel, but each could share its own fuel with destroyers and frigates in an emergency. The lack of sufficient numbers of AOEs or AORs precluded the deployment of these types in support of any of the surface warfare groups, which were generally composed of destroyers and frigates. The old saw that necessity is the mother of invention proved to be true when Rear Admiral John Johnson devised a practical solution to the {{shortage of}} fuel-carrying UNREP ships based on the modification of existing cargo transfer gear on ammunition and stores ships. As commander Task Force 73 (the service force of the Seventh Fleet) in 1973, Admiral Johnson had to contend with the problem of how to provide logistic support for the two Seventh Fleet destroyers deployed to the Indian Ocean for an extended period of time. The answer was to turn the [...] into a mini multiproduct ship by adding two cargo reefer boxes as deck cargo and outfitting it with a jury-rigged fuel station. The latter was achieved by temporarily rigging a 7-inch fuel hose to the starboard side cargo stationâ€”the one closest to the ship's fuel receiving raiser. The highline was used as a span wire, and fuel hose saddles were supported from a wire whip from a nearby <b>hauling</b> <b>winch</b> or a fiber whip from a nearby gypsy. Fuel was pumped from the ship's own fuel bunkers to the receiving ship alongside using the fuel-transfer pump normally carried aboard the AE. The pumping rate was considerably less than that of a fleet oiler and, while workable, contained many drawbacks.|$|E
40|$|When {{developing}} a simulator for cutter suction dredges, the different processes {{have to be}} considered non-stationary and dynamical. A simulator usually consists of a combination of input by a user and hard- and software processing this input and generating output. In the case of a cutter suction dredge simulator the manual control of the swing winches, by means of joysticks, is one of the important inputs for the simulation process. The position of the joysticks determines a set point for either the swing velocity or the revolutions of the hauling swing winch. By means of a control algorithm the <b>hauling</b> <b>winch</b> will generate a hauling torque, while the braking winch exerts a brake torque. This results in pulling forces in both the swing wires. These forces, combined with the cutting forces and the current forces, result in a rotation around the active spud. This rotation can be described with the equilibrium equation of the dredge around the active spud...|$|E
50|$|The tractor when {{tethered}} to a lifeboat carriage has {{the capability of}} towing and pulling such carriages at {{a top speed of}} up to 12.0 km. In addition to its original design intent, the tractor has the advantages of having a varied performance range and can be used for <b>hauling,</b> <b>winching</b> and heavy recovery operations either on dry land or in flood conditions. There are 30 Talus MB-H machines in the RNLI fleet in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The complex {{includes}} a slipway, carriage, boiler, steam engine and <b>hauling</b> gear and <b>winch</b> house.|$|R
2500|$|When the gap was opened, {{a torrent}} of water would spill out, {{carrying}} a [...] "downstream" [...] boat with it, or allowing an [...] "upstream" [...] boat to be man <b>hauled</b> or <b>winched</b> through against the flow. When the boat was through, the opening would be quickly closed again. The [...] "gate" [...] could also be opened to release a 'flash' downstream to enable grounded boats to get off shoals, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|Other {{exhibits}} {{include a}} working steam <b>winch,</b> <b>hauling</b> a narrow gauge incline railway using side tipping skip wagons {{to assist with}} the ash removal; various other engines (steam and otherwise); a print room with a large collection of old printing technology including a Linotype machine; a large collection of electrical apparatuses and more.|$|R
50|$|Akaflieg Karlsruhe has a {{workshop}} {{on the west}} campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The students usually work off the required 300 hours per year there. The DG-1000 with a 400-N-Turbine (AK-9) is finished and in flight trials. The main project is the construction of AK-X, a pure wing 15-class glider. The flying activities, with <b>winch</b> <b>hauling,</b> are held on the glider field of Rheinstetten, close to the fair of Karlsruhe since the airport of Karlsruhe-Forchheim was closed.|$|R
60|$|It {{went over}} with a mighty splash, the {{platform}} rose with a jerk under them; then, as they backed clear, there was a rattle of cable, and they seized the wire. The lashed craft swung like a pendulum athwart the stream, the rattling <b>winch</b> <b>hauled</b> them back fathom by fathom to the Cumbria, while, when he had crawled on board her, Austin dropped limply, and a trifle grey in face, on to the settee in the skipper's room.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} her hand, {{and kept the}} glove with the dark grease stain. Then, seeing {{there was no more}} to be said, she looked about. Ragged clouds rolled up from the Southwest, and the {{disturbed}} swell that splashed about the dock gates indicated wind down channel. A shower beat upon the engine skylights and Barbara moved beneath the bridge. A great rope rose out of the water as the men at the <b>winch</b> <b>hauled</b> up the clumsy hulk. Two or three others, dragging a thin, stiff wire rope, floundered unsteadily across the deck.|$|R
50|$|Like all the Tyne Class Lifeboats, the Spirit of Lowestoft was {{designed}} as a fast slipway boat (FSB) and featured a semi-planing hull fabricated from steel. This hull had a shallow draught and a long straight keel with a flared bow above the waterline. To protect the propellers they were housed in tunnels with substantial bilge keels, and a straight wide keel ending at a <b>hauling</b> shoe enabling <b>winching</b> for the boat when it was returned up the slipway, or to operate in shallow waters where hitting the bottom was a concern as is the case at Lowestoft.|$|R
50|$|Ruby and Arthur Reed II was {{designed}} as a fast slipway boat (FSB) and featured a semi-planing hull fabricated from steel. This hull had a shallow draught and a long straight keel with a flared bow above the waterline. To protect the propellers they were housed in tunnels with substantial bilge keels, and a straight wide keel ending at a <b>hauling</b> shoe enabling <b>winching</b> for the boat when it was returned up the slipway back into the boathouse. The wheelhouse had a low profile so as to fit into existing boathouses. Amidships there was a flying bridge with a separate cabin aft of the upper steering position.|$|R
5000|$|NASA {{marked a}} major {{milestone}} in the agency's program to reestablish America's manned space program when it carried out EFT-1 with Orion on 5 December 2014. Orion launched atop a Delta IV rocket from Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, made two orbits {{of the planet}} during a {{four and a half}} hour mission, and splashed down in the Pacific. Anchorage, Military Sealift Command-manned salvage ship , Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 8 (HSC-8), EODMU-11, Mobile Diving and Salvage Company 11-17, Fleet Weather Center San Diego, and Fleet Combat Camera Pacific took part in the recovery when the spacecraft splashed down. Anchorage recovered Orion's crew module, forward bay cover, and parachutes. A bridge team especially trained for the operation maneuvered Anchorage alongside Orion, and lowered small boats to retrieve her. Divers attached lines from the small boats to guide the capsule toward Anchorage, where a NASA-designed <b>winch</b> <b>hauled</b> the module into the well deck. [...] "We practiced this recovery many times with safety as the number one priority," [...] Anchorages Chief Boatswain's Mate Jason B. Roberts explained. [...] "The sailors were focused and completed the mission at hand successfully." ...|$|R
5000|$|The boom is {{connected}} with {{the lower part of}} the mast which is shaped like a [...] "Y" [...] or a bipod and therefore it is a single swinging derrick. On the cross trees, two guys are fastened using swivel outriggers which are stayed vertically and horizontally. In order to maintain a good controlling angle between guys and derrick, the outriggers cannot pass the inboard parallel of the centerline. Looking at the illustration, one can easily see that the right outrigger stays in the centerline and the left outrigger has moved outboard. This derrick will lower or heave cargo as both guys are veered or <b>hauled.</b> Three <b>winches,</b> controlled by joystick, are necessary to operate the Hallen Derrick; two for the guys and one for the purchase. To avoid an over-topping or over-swinging limit-switches are used. However, the limits can be modified if a different working range or a special vertical stowage is required. The safe working load (SWL) of the Hallen is between 10 and 80 tonnes. In a Hallen Universal derrick, which has no Hallen D-Frame, the halyard has an extended length since it runs through further blocks on the centerline. The Universal Hallen derrick, replacing the D-frame option, is a kind of traditional topping lift. The Hallen D-Frame is a steel bracket welded on the mast in the centerline. For an observer standing a beam, the frame has a [...] "D"-shape. The D-Frame supersedes the outriggers and provides a good controlling angle on the guys. The Hallen derrick has a good purpose for e.g. containers, logs, steel rail, sawn timber and heavy lifts and doesn't lend itself for small, general cargo. It keeps the deck clear of guy ropes and preventors. Only one winchman is needed and within a few minutes the Hallen is brought into use. It is less expensive than a crane. A disadvantage is the low working range of the Hallen Derrick, it is able to swing 75Â° from the centerline and can work against a list of up to 15Â°.|$|R
