40|$|Abstract � Transportation {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} disaster relief are generally divided into evacuation problems and rescue problems. Despite {{the differences between}} {{these two types of}} difficulty, they both require the use of a common road network. Therefore, when examining the <b>emergency</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of damaged road networks, it is preferable to take the transportation requirements of both rescue and evacuation into account rather than examining each problem independently. The occurrence of natural disasters is often accompanied by large-scale damage to transportation networks and quickly restoring the basic functions of the transportation network system within the disaster zone is crucial to post-disaster relief efforts. The process of designing and reconstructing emergency networks requires a model capable of meeting the time constraints associated with evacuation and rescue, while minimizing travel costs. This study employed bi-level programming to construct a network reconstruction model, and imposed lane-based constraints to deal with the practical needs related to road repair. Mathematically, the model was a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, for which we used simulated annealing in conjunction with the Lagrangian gradient projection method to solve the problem. This paper also discusses the operational procedures that provide the <b>emergency</b> network <b>reconstruction</b> model with high practicality and operability...|$|R

The five phases of disaster response (non-disaster, pre-disaster, impact, <b>emergency,</b> <b>reconstruction)</b> and the individual, local, state, and federal level model served as conceptual frameworks. Using purposive sampling, 30 {{individuals with}} chronic illnesses and 10 lay caregivers were recruited from Florida and New Orleans. Data sources included interviews and media data. Constant comparative analysis techniques were used to build the theoretical framework. Transcript analysis suggested that participants used four unique ways to shift priorities from illness to disaster-related challenges.

40|$|Following El Nino {{phenomena}} that occurred between November 1997 and March 1998, heavy rainfall {{all over the}} country caused floods that impacted thirty-five of the seventy-six administrative districts and the provincial city of Nairobi – Kenya. Many parts of the country were isolated due to transport system failure, and many essential services such as water supplies and health facilities were destroyed. There was loss of human lives and thousands of households were displaced. After the floods, there was an immediate need for <b>emergency</b> <b>reconstruction</b> works for vital infrastructure such as health services, water supplies, roads and bridges. The recovery funds were given by the World Bank, African Development Bank and Agense Franscaise de Developpement. A reconstruction management team was set-up in the Office of the President comprising private sector professionals under the special program, Project Management Unit (PMU). The management unit recorded a considerable reduction of implementation time and cost compared to normal project implementation procedures. This management system proved easily adoptable in any disaster situation for provision of immediate needs as well as the long-term reconstruction programs.

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Approaches were {{examined}} to the structural retro-fitting (strengthening) of 369 apartment {{buildings in the}} municipality of Bakirkoy in Istanbul that were classified as high or very high risk in a previous, less detailed, study. Key issues included highly variable construction quality; physical, planning and legal constraints; an imperfect building controls regime; cost and benefits of retrofitting; owner attitudes; {{and the challenge of}} finding viable funding mechanisms. The study included a review of regional seismology, geotechnical investigations, as-built condition surveys, structural analyses, earthquake performance assessment, retrofitting solutions, social impacts, and analysis of the benefits and costs of retrofitting. The integration of social and community considerations into the choice of retrofitting techniques was an important and unique aspect of the study. The study was funded by the Government of Turkey through a World Bank loan as part of the Marmara Earthquake <b>Emergency</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> project. The overall aim is to mitigate seismic risks in the municipality of Istanbul and reduce the social, economic and financial impacts of potential future earthquakes. By formulating technical solutions that take account of social and economic conditions, and providing detailed analyses of benefits and costs, the study provides an invaluable resource to help owners and authorities to decide on approaches for retrofitting in Turkey and elsewhere. ...|$|R
25|$|The World Bank has {{supported}} the Lebanese water and sanitation sector since 1993 when it approved an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> and Rehabilitation Project. With {{the help of the}} project water systems in 97 communities were rehabilitated or built, as were 98 small sewerage systems. After the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, 5 additional water and sewerage systems were rehabilitated benefiting 140 communities. The project also rehabilitated or expanded three large water productions and distribution systems and wastewater treatment plants Baalbek, Metn and Barouk. Because complementary works, to be financed by other sources, had not been completed on time, these facilities were inoperative as of 2006. In particular, the Baalbek wastewater treatment plant (13,000 m3/day capacity), completed in early 2002, was not connected to the sewerage system. The World Bank continued to support water supply and sanitation in Baalbek through a US$43.5m loan approved in 2002. This was followed by a US$15m emergency grant in 2007 to support the rehabilitation and expansion of water supply systems in five villages in the Western Bekaa Valley. In December 2010, the World Bank approved a US$200m loan to support the Greater Beirut Water Supply Project. The World Bank had to cancel a previous loan for submarine treated wastewater outfalls in Kesrouan and Sour approved in 1998 after the government had not ratified the corresponding loan agreements.|$|R
40|$|In {{the three}} years after the 2012 {{earthquake}} in Emilia-Romagna, through the enactment of more than 350 ordinances, the Commissioner has structured interventions to cope with <b>emergency</b> and <b>reconstruction.</b> The intense law-making, essential to fill a legal vacuum, has enabled to overcome the uncertainties of the difficult phase of recovery. There is agreement among experts and policy makers {{that a large number of}} those ordinances was due to the absence of national rules governing the urgent intervention in case of natural disasters. On the push of actions taken in Emilia-Romagna, the Italian Parliament has reopened the debate on a national law on emergency after natural disasters. Through a systematic content analysis of the corpus of ordinances issued in Emilia-Romagna, in this paper we propose a contribution in drafting the decrees related to the law on emergency. Two main strands of analysis have been developed. In the first one, an automatic text analysis, supported by Taltac 2, has provided inputs for a factor analysis and a cluster analysis of the thematic areas covered by the ordinances. Four main topics have been singled out: Contribution grant criteria; management of allocation of resources; urgent works for municipalities, schools and churches buildings; interventions to support population. Having associated each ordinance to one of the four topics, a temporal analysis of the issues addressed during the <b>emergency</b> and <b>reconstruction</b> phase highlights the sequence of actions that were undertaken in Emilia. In a second step, the set of terms characterizing each cluster it is used to obtain a redefinition of disjunctive classification towards a fuzzy multi-class. Furthermore, by adopting an hybrid system of text mining, it is possible to extract the legislation (and other ordinances) cited in the ordinances and identify clusters of regulatory areas of reference to meet the <b>emergency</b> and <b>reconstruction</b> following natural disasters. In this second strand, clusters of citations are detected with an algorithm of network analysis (Infomap) based on information theory (Rosvall & Bergstrom, 2008; De Domenico et al, 2015). This analysis highlights subsets of nodes and allows to outline which are the most relevant issues involved in the areas of intervention after a natural disaste...|$|R
