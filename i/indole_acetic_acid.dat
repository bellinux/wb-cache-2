Despite the devastating consequences of this disease, very little is known about the mechanisms of resistance in the host. We employed the open 2 architecture transcriptome profiling technique deepSuperSAGE, coupled with next 2 generation sequencing, to identify pea 2 specific genes involved in the resistance to this important disease in the resistant Pisum sativum ssp. syriacum accession P 665. Two deepSuperSAGE libraries were constructed from leaf RNA of infected and control plants, yielding a total of 17, 561 different UniTags. 70 % of them could be assigned to known sequences from pea or other plants. 509 UniTags were significantly differentially expressed (p < 0. 05; fold change ≥ 2, ≤ 2) in inoculated versus control plants.

The bacteria identification based on 16 S r-RNA and gyrase-A genes analysis, revealed strains closely related to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. velezensis, B. subtilis sub sp spizezenii and Paenibacillus polymyxa species. The electro-spray mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (ESI-LC MS) analysis showed that most of the Bacillus isolates produced the three lipopeptides families. However, the P. polymyxa (18 SRTS) didn't produce any type of lipopeptides.

Different concentrations of feathers supported {{the production of}} <b>indole</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> by strain PF 1. Strain PF 1 produces maximum <b>indole</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (46.2  ±  0.21  µg/ml) {{in the presence of}} 2.0  % feathers at 120  h of incubation. The <b>indole</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> production was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. However, increased concentration of feathers exhibited negative effect on phosphate solubilization due to increased alkalinity. HCN production also exhibited positive correlation with concentration of feathers. Finally, plant growth of Vigna radiata in the presence of strain PF 1 with chicken feathers in soil was investigated, which showed good plant growth promotion activity. Increased ratio of C/N in soil also supported the plant growth promotion activity of feathers.|$|E
40|$|Effect of Indole- 3 -Acetic Acid (IAA) on fruit {{drop and}} fruit quality of date palm cultivars was {{assessed}} during 2011 at Agriculture Research Institute, Rata Kulachi D. I. Khan, Pakistan. The experiment {{was laid out}} in Randomized Complete Block (RCB) Design with two factors factorial arrangement and replicated three times. The concentrations of <b>Indole</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> (IAA) were used as 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm at Hababuke stage (immature green stage) and the cultivars used were Dhakki and Gulistan. The application of IAA significantly influenced the growth, yield components and reduced the fruit drop of date palm cultivars. Among cultivars, Dhakki cultivar showed more fruit length (4. 97 cm), fruit diameter (3. 03 cm), fruit weight (30. 8 g) and pulp weight (29. 16 g) when treated with 150 ppm <b>Indole</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid,</b> while the lower percent fruit drop (23. 00 %) and higher bunch weight (21. 27 kg) was recorded in cultivar Gulistan with application of 150 ppm <b>Indole</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> concentration. Cultivars effect was also significant for percent fruit drop, fruit length, fruit diameter, fruit weight, pulp weight and bunch weight. In case of interactions only length and pulp weight was found significant among all other parameter in both cultivars. Results revealed that application of <b>Indole</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> as foliar spray @ 150 ppm showed good result to minimize the percent fruit drop of date palm cultivars and also affects other desirable parameters significantly. Therefore, the concentration of <b>Indole</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> (IAA) @ 150 ppm should be applied as foliar spray at kimri stage (unripe stage) to minimize the fruit drop and to improve the fruit quality attributes of date palm cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The Carotenoid {{compounds}} (antioxidants) synthesis in spirulina platennsis was {{studied in}} vitro {{under the influence}} of the <b>Indole</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> (IAA). Spirulina platensis is grown in Zarrouks medium supplemented with different concentration of <b>Indole</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> (1 μg/ml– 10 μg/ml). The gradual increase in the total Carotenoidscontent was recorded from 1 - 6 μg/ml of IAA. Inhibition in the synthesis of Carotenoids compounds was noticed in 7 μg/ml- 10 μg/ml the similar trend was also observed with synthesis of chlorophyll a. Growth of Spirulina was also inhibited at higher level of IAA. Maximum production of Carotenoid compounds noticed at 6 μg/ml IAA...|$|E
40|$|Wood and wood-based panels emanate formic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> The {{amount of}} <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> release {{is high in}} {{comparison}} to its concentration in cold water extracts of wood-based panels containing both formic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids.</b> This is most {{probably due to the}} fact that formic acid is a stronger acid (pKa 3. 77) than <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (pKa 4. 76). Insofar the dissociation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is suppressed by the presence of formic acid and the undissociated <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> emanates in higher amounts than formic acid in the vapour phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{contribution of}} <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> to methane production was studied {{by use of}} C 14 -labeled <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Samples of domestic sewage sludge were incubated anaerobically in Warburg vessels. The rate of methane production in the vessels was 0. 033 μmoles per ml per min. C 14 -labeled <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was added, and the turnover rate was calculated. The pool size of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> in the sludge was 4. 7 μmoles/ml. The turnover rate was 0. 0052 min- 1, giving a rate of formation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> of 0. 024 μmoles per ml per min. Under these conditions, <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> would account for approximately 73 % of the methane produced by the sludge. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was found to exist primarily in an extracellular pool. The turnover rate of the extracellular pool was rapid, and {{it was concluded that}} most of the <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> must be metabolized to methane by a specialized microflora not involved in the formation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R
