5|$|Beach Thomas {{was the son}} of a rural clergyman. He {{attended}} Shrewsbury School and the University of Oxford before {{embarking on}} a short-lived career as a schoolmaster.

5|$|Their first target, the isle of Saint Vincent, fell on June 18th, and d'Estaing {{turned his}} {{attention}} to other islands.

5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist. For a time <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence {{he was able to}} complete his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Mercury's orbit, however, did {{not match}} that {{predicted}} by Newton's Law of Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> {{to the problem of}} Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy. This {{was the first time that}} Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, golf {{became a}} varsity sport, and Trueblood was the school's first {{official}} coach. In 1926, Trueblood {{retired as a}} professor emeritus at age 70. At that time, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> full-time to coaching. His coaching record at Michigan was 71-9-2.

He coached two NCAA individual champions, John Fischer (1932) and Chuck Kocsis (1936). Trueblood continued as golf coach until he was 80, when athletic director Fielding H. Yost named him emeritus coach.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1868, a Progressive cabinet led by Zacarias {{resigned}} {{following a}} political crisis and PedroII asked the Conservatives {{to form a}} new government. As always when a party returned to power, new elections were held, though marked by fraud. The two main wings of the Progressive Party (Progressive, to which Porto Alegre belonged, and Historical) set aside their disputes, became more disciplined in their unity and renamed their party the Liberal Party. When Porto Alegre's term as general deputy ended in 1866, the ongoing war precluded elections in Rio Grande do Sul. Predictably, in the elections organized under the Conservative Party's direction in early 1869, he was not elected. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to organizing a Liberal stronghold in his native province. At the request of the national Liberal Center, Porto Alegre created and became president of the province's Liberal board of directors.|$|E

50|$|In 1909, Ziegfeld {{began an}} affair with the actress Lillian Lorraine; Held {{remained}} hopeful that his fascination would pass, and {{he would return to}} her, but instead <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> to another actress Billie Burke, whom he would marry in 1914.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to television, {{writing and}} {{interpreting}} fifteen character roles (both male and female), {{in the most}} successful TV series on Greek television to date, entitled Deka mikroi Mitsoi.

25|$|During the 1960s <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> {{again to}} politics, {{becoming}} involved in the Labour movement, standing as an unsuccessful Labour party candidate at the 1965 general election for the Clare constituency, polling 2.362 1st preferences, or 6.9%.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to astrology, {{which he}} criticizes for {{stereotyping}} without evidence. Having put astrology {{to the test}} and referred to larger-scale experiments, he then briefly describes the mechanics of astronomy, and then expresses frustration that 50% of the UK population – more than are members of one religion – believe in the paranormal.|$|R
50|$|Now she {{is faced}} {{with the task of}} {{defeating}} Hobb. She calls out to the rat god and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to her.

25|$|In {{the studio}} at Olana he made {{hundreds}} of pencil and oil technical drawings for stencils, mantels, banisters, and other architectural {{elements of the}} main house. With the onset of rheumatism in the 1870s, Church's painting became severely curtailed. Increasingly, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to Olana itself, improving the landscape, buying artwork for the house, and building the studio wing.|$|E
50|$|In his {{southern}} expansion Arnulf inevitably had {{conflict with}} the Normans, {{who were trying to}} secure their northern frontier. This led to the 942 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf's men.

5000|$|Locus magazine's {{review of}} the book said that the novel centres around the {{possibilities}} and limits of technology, and fills the gap between [...] "can-we and should-we".
