5000|$|This type {{includes}} {{helical gear}} limited-slip <b>differentials</b> and <b>clutch,</b> cone (an alternative type of clutch) where the engagement {{force of the}} clutch {{is a function of}} the input torque applied to the differential (as the engine applies more torque the clutches grip harder and Trq d [...] decreases).Torque sensing LSDs respond to driveshaft torque, so that the more driveshaft input torque present, the harder the clutches, cones or gears are pressed together, and thus the more closely the drive wheels are coupled to each other. Some include spring loading to provide some small torque so that with little or no input torque (trailing throttle/gearbox in neutral/main clutch depressed) the drive wheels are minimally coupled. The amount of preload (hence static coupling) on the clutches or cones is affected by the general condition (wear) and by how tightly they are loaded.|$|R
50|$|The DPC <b>differential</b> {{features}} <b>clutch</b> packs on both output sides {{that are}} actuated by an electric motor. The clutch pack activates a planetary gearset which causes one wheel to be overdriven. A conventional control system, such as BMW's typical xDrive system without Dynamic Performance Control, relies on brakes {{to reduce the}} speed of the faster-moving wheel (which is the one with less traction) and reduce engine power to limit slip at that wheel. This leads to increased brake wear, and slows the vehicle's optimal progress. By contrast, xDrive when integrated with DPC will speed up the slower-moving, not slipping wheel (the one with the most traction) in order to maintain stability when needed. For example, during vehicle turning, the outer wheel is overdriven to provide greater acceleration, using the traction advantage through the dynamic loading of the outboard wheel in cornering. Meanwhile, in an oversteer situation, the inner wheel is overdriven to regain traction balance. This provides additional traction across the axle of the vehicle, {{while at the same time}} maintaining more of the vehicle's optimal progress through turns.|$|R

40|$|In birds, {{the annual}} mean clutch size is often {{negatively}} correlated with population density. This relationship is {{at least in part}} due to adjustment by individuals. We investigated whether this response is adaptive in two ways. First we used an optimality model to predict how optimal clutch size (the clutch size that maximizes the number of breeding birds [recruits and surviving parents] in the next season) varies with density. We parameterized the model using data on fitness consequences of experimental variation in brood size and natural variation in population density in a Great Tit (Parus major) population. Predicted optimal clutch size decreased with density, but the predicted relationship was stronger than the observed relationship. Second, we investigated the relationship between the annual selection <b>differential</b> for <b>clutch</b> size and density. We found no relationship, indicating that there is no selection for a steeper than observed relationship between clutch size and density. This implies that the observed response is adaptive, and that the prediction of the optimality model lacks some important constraints or selection pressures. We further used the optimality model to examine the sensitivity of the optimal clutch size to density at different stages in the reproductive cycle. This analysis suggested that the nestling stage was most important. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first study that makes quantitative predictions of optimal clutch size in relation to population density. ...|$|R

The engine and all of the ancillary components - starter, generator/alternator, radiator, distributor, carburettor and all others - must be inspected and corrected to factory specifications. The engine itself, plus the transmission, clutch, overdrive unit, and even the driveshaft must be meticulously inspected, cleaned, and measured for wear. This will show up as deviation from original factory specifications. All of the parts - block, crankcase, head, transmission housing, etc. - should be inspected for cracks or other damage.

40|$|For migratory birds, {{the earlier}} arrival of males to {{breeding}} grounds is often {{expected to have}} fitness benefits. However, the selection differential on male arrival time has rarely been decomposed into the direct effect of male arrival and potential indirect effects through female traits.

Using structural equation modeling, {{we were able to}} take into account the temporal structure of the breeding cycle and the hierarchy between the examined traits. We found directional selection differentials for earlier male arrival date and earlier female laying date, as well as strong selection <b>differential</b> for larger <b>clutch</b> size. These selection differentials were due to direct selection only as indirect selection for these traits was nonsignificant. When decomposing the direct selection for earlier male arrival into direct and indirect effects, we discovered that it was almost exclusively due to the direct effect of male arrival date on fitness and not due to its indirect effects via female traits. In other words, we showed for the first time that there is a direct effect of male arrival date on fitness while accounting for those effects that are mediated by effects of the social partner. Our study thus indicates that natural selection directly favored earlier male arrival in this flycatcher population...|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{effects are}} {{important}} {{mechanisms by which}} mothers’ may influence the phenotype of their offspring. Females may vary in the resources they can provide during offspring development and understanding the factors responsible for this variation is key to understanding offspring success- in early {{life as well as}} later life. Differential allocation has been reported to occur, however how it impacts on offspring and mother’s future reproduction still remains unclear. This is also true for maternal transferred substances like maternally transferred immunity. Contributions to date have been limited to snapshots in time, mean level of transfer and/or limited information regarding other maternal traits. For my thesis, I aim to further the understanding of maternal allocation effects and explore the transfer of maternal antibodies over an immune response of a mother, across multiple breeding attempts and accounting for embryo, maternal and paternal traits. Furthermore, I determine the effect of key male traits on general egg traits along with maternal antibodies. I examine this at the individual level using Chinese painted quail (Coturnix chinensis) who are prolific layers and sexually dimorphic. To date the majority of differential allocation studies have not necessarily addressed the assumptions of differential allocation theory. In Chapter 2 of this thesis I attempt to address some of these assumptions and explore the impact of male characteristics across a number of clutches and find separate effects of initial pairing and subsequent pairings. I found that mothers can create, by <b>differential</b> allocation, <b>clutches</b> of varying size but egg components (egg mass) appears to be largely influenced by initial clutch pairing and not by paternal traits. Furthermore, the effect on egg mass appears to be a secondary effect mediated by females adjusting their condition based on their initial pairing. I demonstrate that unlike general clutch traits (clutch size, egg mass) maternal antibodies are not affected by male characteristics (Chapter 3) carry-over effects of egg size means antibody levels may be influenced throughout life by early experiences. However, maternal immune response may be detrimentally linked to viability of offspring. Whereas maternally transferred antibodies appear to have no relationship with maternal or paternal traits, oocyte yolk antibodies during development were found to correlate with female antibodies up to 48 hr prior to lay. In Chapter 4, I examine a neglected area regarding maternal effect- exploring variation between female in their transfer of antibodies. Individual females were highly consistent in the relative level of specific blood antibodies transferred to eggs across different phases of their immune response, across challenge types (bacterial and viral) and that some females consistently transfer significantly more than others. The relative level of circulating antibody transferred was independent of the individual’s overall strength of antibody response and related to the female’s body condition (while the individual’s own antibody responses were not). We found no evidence for any trade-offs between the amount transferred and overall reproductive investment in this chapter. In Chapter 5, I discuss the wider implications of my findings and suggest future research directions...|$|R

40|$|Four Wheel Drive (4 WD) {{vehicles}} {{are almost as}} old as the automobile itself, however {{for more than half a}} century the main use case of a 4 WD system was to improve traction on off-road terrains. The advancement in technology over the recent decades resulted in more advanced and light weight solutions shifting the focus more towards sports cars and performance passenger vehicles. Furthermore, the advancements in electronic actuators paved the way for more attractive 4 WD solutions for such vehicles. The trend continues to progress as top racing formulas, such as Formula 1 and Le Mans Prototypes, have embraced 4 WD systems over the past few years and all major car manufactures recently brought road vehicles with 4 WD systems to the market. In many of these vehicles, the drivelines are electronically controllable introducing new possibilities and engineering challenges. In this thesis a control system for an Active Central Differential (ACD) will be developed in order to improve the handling and performance of a 4 WD vehicle. The central differential distributes the engine torque to the front and rear axle; the ACD is a controllable central differential for which the front to rear torque distribution can be varied electronically. Three different vehicle models are used in this work with varying complexity: single track model, two track model and multibody dynamics model. The single track model is used to study the influence of the actuator on the longitudinal and lateral dynamics in Quasi Steady State (QSS). Furthermore, this model is used for the sensitivity analysis of potentially varying vehicle parameters. The two track model forms the basis for the presented control system and vehicle state estimator. The multibody dynamics model is a close virtual representation of a real passenger vehicle and hence used for validation of the proposed control system. All models use a nonlinear tyre model (Magic Formula (MF) based), longitudinal and lateral load transfer (single track only longitudinal). The multibody dynamics model also simulates engine characteristics, drive train and <b>differential</b> inertia, <b>clutch</b> dynamics, suspension characteristics, pitch and roll dynamics, etc. These effects are neglected for obvious simplicity reasons in the single and two track models. The most relevant dynamics for the handling and stability of the vehicle lie in the vehicle yaw plane. Unlike differential braking or torque vectoring, the ACD can not directly generate a yaw moment; instead any yaw moment obtained from torque distribution changes is the result of combined slip effects (i. e. indirect actuation). Nonetheless, the torque distribution can significantly influence the performance, stability and understeer characteristics of the vehicle. To develop a better understanding of the complex dynamics involved, the system dynamics are studied by means of a QSS analysis and linearization. By studying the system at hand in QSS, key aspects (i. e. torque distribution) of the complete dynamic system can be isolated and analyzed without being affected by coupled dynamics. Furthermore, linearization of the nonlinear system is employed to study the dynamic system poles of the resulting linear parameter varying system. These system poles give insight in the stability of the system for a variety of torque distributions. A novel control system for the central differential is presented which improves the handling and performance of the vehicle for (combined) acceleration maneuvers. The control system is composed of a slip reference generator and a closed loop slip controller. Since only one control variable is available, the system controls the portion of the engine torque which is redirected to the rear axle in order to reduce the slip error of said axle in finite time. The controller type is a gain scheduled proportional integral controller with an anti integrator wind-up scheme to deal with actuator saturation. The classical problem of vehicle control systems, namely the inability to measure essential signals for the control system (i. e. tyre slip, stiffness and peak friction) is addressed with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based vehicle state estimator. The dynamic model of the state estimator is composed of a two track model and nonlinear normalized MF tyre model. The performance of the control system was assessed on a multibody vehicle model and the state estimator was assessed on experimental data.

40|$|Avian mothers convey {{significant}} {{quantities of}} androgens (i. e. ?male? steroids) to their eggs, which {{are known to}} positively influence embryonic development, post-natal growth and competitive behaviour of the offspring. However, there is large inter-female variation {{in the amount of}} androgens transferred to the eggs. Recent studies suggest that this variation may be maintained because the positive effects on growth and behaviour are counterbalanced by negative effects on the immune function of the offspring. This thesis deals with the causal and functional aspects of maternal androgen transfer in birds. In a study on a wild pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) population, I investigated female plasticity in androgen transfer with respect to the timing of breeding. Eggs of replacement clutches produced late in the season contained on average lower levels of androgens compared to first clutches produced early in the season. Within clutches, androgen concentration increased over the laying sequence in the first clutch, but decreased or remained more constant over the laying sequence in the replacement <b>clutch.</b> <b>Differential</b> androgen transfer with respect to timing of breeding is discussed as an adaptive female tactic to optimize reproductive output. To examine the effects of egg androgens on offspring phenotype, I compared offspring hatched from eggs with experimentally elevated androgen levels with offspring hatched from eggs with sham-manipulated androgen levels (controls). I found that exposure to elevated egg levels of testosterone (T) increased metabolism in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) chicks. Extra egg T also enhanced growth in male zebra finch chicks, {{but at the same time}} reduced their ability to resist oxidative stress during the early growth phase. These results are the first to demonstrate that high levels of egg androgens can entail costs in terms of increased energy expenditure and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. To evaluate whether there are any long-term effects of egg T on offspring physiology and behaviour, I followed a cohort of zebra finches hatched from manipulated eggs. Although no effects of egg T on adult immunity were found, there appeared to be a positive effect of high levels of egg T on oxidative stress resistance in adult males when they were subjected to an immunization with a pathogen. Furthermore, egg T influenced adult behaviour in males and females. High levels of egg T facilitated the ability of adult zebra finches to habituate to a novel situation. The effects of egg androgens on growth and immunity were also investigated in a study on wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula). In this study, there was a clear negative effect of high egg androgen levels on nestling immunity. The study shows that the effect is present during different developmental periods of the nestlings, and most interestingly, still present just before fledging. The results from these experimental studies add to our understanding of how transgenerational transmission of hormones affect the formation of the offspring phenotype...|$|R
