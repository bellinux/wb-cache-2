5|$|Metis lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Adrastea), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces slowly cause its orbit to decay. If its <b>density</b> <b>is</b> similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E

Astroglial cell <b>density</b> <b>was</b> determined after the cells were stained immunohistochemically. Microvessel and astroglial cell <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> determined in 10 different hippocampal structures. Microvessel and astroglial cell <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> strongly correlated in all layers except the pyramidal cell layers. The highest density of perfused microvessels was found in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, compared with other regions, and the lowest values were found in the stratum lucidum and dentate granular cell layer.

5|$|Thebe is irregularly shaped, {{with the}} closest {{ellipsoidal}} approximation being 116×98×84km. Its surface area is probably between 31,000 and 59,000 (~45,000) km2. Its bulk density and mass are not known, but assuming that its mean <b>density</b> <b>is</b> {{like that of}} Amalthea (around 0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated at roughly 4.3kg.|$|E
40|$|Carbon (C) {{densities of}} the tree biomass and soil (0 - 50 cm) in {{indigenous}} forest and plantations of eucalyptus, cypress and pine in the Taita Hills, Kenya were determined and compared. The cypress and pine plantations were about 30 -years-old and eucalyptus plantations about 50 -years-old. Biomass C <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> estimated from breast height diameter and wood density using allometric functions developed for tropical species and an assumed C content of 50 %. Belowground biomass C <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> estimated using root:shoot biomass ratios. Soil organic C (SOC) <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> calculated from measured organic carbon contents (0 - 20 and 20 - 50 cm layers) and modelled bulk density values. Mean total biomass C and SOC densities for indigenous forest were greater {{than those of the}} plantations, and the difference was significant (p< 0. 05) in the cases of cypress and pine biomass and pine SOC. The correlation between biomass C and SOC <b>densities</b> <b>was</b> nearly significant in the case of indigenous forest, but negative. Biomass C <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> not significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature or potential evapotranspiration, but pine biomass C <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> significantly correlated to actual evapotranspiration. SOC <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> more strongly correlated to mean annual precipitation than biomass C densities, but only significantly so in the case of pine. Neither biomass C nor SOC <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> correlated to plant available water capacity of the soil. Indigenous forest SOC <b>densities</b> <b>were</b> significantly correlated to soil clay contents, but negatively. Indigenous forests sequester more C in biomass and soil than do 30 to 50 -year-old plantations of exotics, but it remains unclear if this is an intrinsic difference between indigenous forest and plantations of exotics or because of insufficient time for SOC levels in plantations to recover after clearance of original indigenous forest...|$|R

Anharmonic contributions to the energy-level <b>density</b> <b>are</b> considered approximately using a literature model for the transition from harmonic to free motions. The present analytic energy-level density formulation for rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator systems is validated against the well-studied CO+O˙H system.

5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean <b>density</b> <b>is</b> like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The <b>density</b> <b>is</b> high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the <b>density</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E
5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron <b>density</b> <b>is</b> perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, {{and there may be}} disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass {{is not in}} the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the <b>density</b> <b>is</b> above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water <b>density</b> <b>is</b> negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
