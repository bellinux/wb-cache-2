25|$|Inside ISS, around 12:00 UTC a <b>false</b> <b>smoke</b> {{and fire}} alarm {{triggered}} by the Japanese Kibo laboratory sounded for about 4 minutes. Mission Control in Houston concluded that stirred up dust particles due to transfer operations aboard the station might have sounded the alarm. This was the third false station alarm during the STS-129 mission. The two previous alarms originated in the new Russian Poisk module.|$|E
2500|$|At about 04:30 on 28 October, Emden {{appeared}} off the George Town {{roads and}} attacked {{the harbor and}} vessels lying therein. Captain von Müller had disguised his ship by rigging a <b>false</b> <b>smoke</b> stack, which made Emden resemble the British cruiser [...] Once he had entered the harbor, however, he ran up the German naval ensign and revealed what ship the newcomer actually was. Before any of the Allied naval vessels could respond, a torpedo was fired at the Russian protected cruiser , followed up with a salvo of shells which riddled the ship. As Zhemchug returned fire, a second torpedo was fired. The torpedo penetrated the forward magazine, causing an explosion that sank the Russian ship. Casualties amongst Zhemchugs crew of 250 amounted to 88 dead and 121 wounded.|$|E

5000|$|At the German headquarters, four of Bertorelli's men are {{equipped}} with British uniforms (complete with <b>false</b> moustaches and <b>smoke</b> pipes) and aniseed balls. They also show that they can speak English, by saying [...] "fa, fa, fa, fa, fa" [...] repeatedly.|$|R

50|$|False alarms woke {{the crews}} aboard space shuttle Atlantis and the Space Station at 01:36 UTC on 20 November 2009 {{and once again}} at 02:53 UTC on 21 November. An {{erroneous}} indication of a rapid depressurization led to the automatic shutdown of ventilation fans throughout the station, which stirred up dust {{and led to a}} <b>false</b> <b>smoke</b> detection alarm in the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory. Mission control Capcom Frank Lien in Houston told Expedition 21 Commander Frank De Winne it might have originated with the Poisk module.|$|E
50|$|The {{existing}} environmental {{solutions in}} telecommunications facilities have inherent limitations. For example, most mature central offices have limited space available for large air duct installations {{that are required}} for cooling high heat density equipment rooms. Furthermore, steep temperature gradients develop quickly should a cooling outage occur; this {{has been well documented}} through computer modeling and direct measurements and observations. Although environmental backup systems may be in place, there are situations when they will not help. In a recent case, telecommunications equipment in a major central office was overheated, and critical services were interrupted by a complete cooling shut down initiated by a <b>false</b> <b>smoke</b> alarm.|$|E
50|$|Hookah {{smoking is}} known to be the sociallyacceptable way to smoke tobacco, however this claim is <b>false.</b> Hookah <b>smoke</b> cancontain {{concentrations}} of toxins, such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, tar, andheavy metals. All of these toxins are as high, or higher than those that areassociated with cigarette smoke. This is due to the result when physically inhaling the shisha, as water in the basin does not get rid of the toxins in the shisha, it only enhances them. Several types of cancer and infectiousdiseases are linked with smoking shisha. Health risks including: lung cancer,tuberculosis, aspergillus, helicobacter and Epstein-Barr virus, can becontracted from the way the shisha is prepared, the smoking of the shisha, andthe sharing around of the mouthpiece connected to the pipe.|$|R
40|$|In this article, a video base early {{fire alarm}} system is {{developed}} by monitoring the smoke in the scene. There are two major contributions in this work. First, {{to find the best}} texture feature for smoke detection, a general framework, named Histograms of Equivalent Patterns (HEP), is adopted to achieve an extensive evaluation of various kinds of texture features. Second, the Block based Inter-Frame Difference (BIFD) and a improved version of LBP-TOP are proposed and ensembled to describe the space-time characteristics of the smoke. In order to reduce the <b>false</b> alarms, the <b>Smoke</b> History Image (SHI) is utilized to register the recent classification results of candidate smoke blocks. Experimental results using SVM show that the proposed method can achieve better accuracy and less false alarm compared with the state-of-the-art technologies. Comment: 9 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} model algorithm {{for fire}} (flickering flame, {{in the infrared}} region) detection is presented. The model made use of a Pyro-electric infrared sensor (PIR) /Passive Infrared Detector (PID) for infrared fire detection. Sample analog signals (around flame flicker region) were generated and simulated {{within the framework of}} the modeled PIR sensor/PID. A Joint Time Frequency Analysis (JTFA) function, specifically the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was applied to model the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) of the generated signals. It was implemented as wavelet analyzer filters for “fire” and “non-fire” feature extraction. A Piecewise Modified Artificial Neural Network (PMANN) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were employed in the decision rule. The PMANN generated polynomials which analyzed and ‘memorized’ the signals from DSP. The ICC further categorized cases as 'fire' or 'non-fire' by comparing data from the PMANN analyzed. The results show that the model algorithm can be implemented in modern day fire detectors and be used to detect industrial hydrocarbon fires with fewer <b>false</b> alarms than <b>smoke</b> detectors or ultraviolet detectors...|$|R

60|$|The fifth trumpet {{sounded to}} the wars, which the King of the South, {{as he is}} called by Daniel, made {{in the time of}} the end, in pushing at the King who did {{according}} to his will. This plague began {{with the opening of the}} bottomless pit, which denotes the letting out of a <b>false</b> religion: the <b>smoke</b> which came out of the pit, signifying the multitude which embraced that religion; and the locusts which came out of the smoke, the armies which came out of that multitude. This pit was opened, to let out smoke and locusts into the regions of the four monarchies, or some of them. The King of these locusts was the Angel of the bottomless pit, being chief governor as well in religious as civil affairs, such as was the Caliph of the Saracens. Swarms of locusts often arise in Arabia fælix, and from thence infest the neighbouring nations: and so are a very fit type of the numerous armies of Arabians invading the Romans. They began to invade them A.C. 634, and to reign at Damascus A.C. 637. They built Bagdad A.C. 766, and reigned over Persia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt, Africa and Spain. They afterwards lost Africa to Mahades, A.C. 910; Media, Hircania, Chorasan, and all Persia, to the Dailamites, between the years 927 and 935; Mesopotamia and Miafarekin to Nasiruddaulas, A.C. 930; Syria and Egypt to Achsjid, A.C. 935, and now being in great distress, the Caliph of Bagdad, A.C. 936, surrendred all the rest of his temporal power to Mahomet the son of Rajici, King of Wasit in Chaldea, and made him Emperor of Emperors. But Mahomet within two years lost Bagdad to the Turks; and thenceforward Bagdad was sometimes in the hands of the Turks, and sometimes in the hands of the Saracens, till Togrul-beig, called also Togra, Dogrissa, Tangrolipix, and Sadoc, conquered Chorasan and Persia; and A.C. 1055, added Bagdad to his Empire, making it the seat thereof. His successors Olub-Arflan and Melechschah, conquered the regions upon Euphrates; and these conquests, after the death of Melechschah, brake into the kingdoms of Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Cappadocia. The whole time that the Caliphs of the Saracens reigned with a temporal dominion at Damascus and Bagdad together, was 300 years, viz. from the year 637 to the year 936 inclusive. Now locusts live but five months; and therefore, for the decorum of the type, these locusts are said to hurt men five months and five months, as if they had lived about five months at Damascus, and again about five months at Bagdad; in all ten months, or 300 prophetic days, which are years.|$|R
