The EU agencies and other bodies are located all across the union, but usually not fixed in the treaties.

Over the years, Brussels has become the principal seat, with each major institution and now the European Council being based wholly or in part there, leading to it being popularly known as [...] "the capital of the EU".|$|E

It is necessary also to extend Positivist Fetishism to purely abstract existence; to [...] "animate" [...] the laws as well as the facts of nature. It is not sufficient to have made physics sentimental, mathematics must be made so too. This does not at first seem easy; but M. Comte finds the means of accomplishing it. His plan is, to make Space also an object of adoration, under the name of the Grand Milieu, and consider it as the representative of Fatality in general. [...] "The final unity disposes us to cultivate sympathy by developing our gratitude to whatever serves the Grand Etre. It must dispose us to venerate the Fatality on which reposes the whole aggregate of our existence." [...] We should conceive this Fatality as having a <b>fixed</b> <b>seat,</b> and that seat must be considered to be Space, which should be conceived as possessing feeling, but not activity or intelligence. And in our abstract speculations we should imagine all our conceptions as located in free Space. Our images of all sorts, down to our geometrical diagrams, and even our ciphers and algebraic symbols, should always be figured to ourselves as written in space, and not on paper or any other material substance. M. Comte adds that they should be conceived as green on a white ground.|$|E
6000|$|When Mr. Fenwick {{reached the}} mill, he found old Brattle sitting {{alone on a}} fixed bench {{in front of the}} house door with a pipe in his mouth. Mary Lowther was quite right in saying that the mill, in spite of its dilapidations,--perhaps by reason of them,--was as pretty as {{anything}} in Bullhampton. In the first place it was permeated and surrounded by cool, bright, limpid little streams. One of them ran right through it, as it were, passing between the dwelling-house and the mill, and turning the wheel, which was there placed. This course was, no doubt, artificial, and the water ran more rapidly in it than it did in the neighbouring streamlets. There were sluice-gates, too, by which it could be altogether expelled, or kept up to this or that height; and it was a river absolutely under man's control, in which no water-god could take delight. But there were other natural streams on each side of the building, the one being the main course of the Avon, and the other some offspring of a brooklet, which joined its parent two hundred yards below, and fifty yards from the spot at which the ill-used working water was received back into its mother's idle bosom. Mill and house were thatched, and were very low. There were garrets in the roof, but they were so shaped that they could hardly be said to have walls to them at all, so nearly were they contained by the sloping roof. In front of the building there ran a road,--which after all was no more than a private lane. It crossed the smaller stream and the mill-run by two wooden bridges; but the river itself had been too large for the bridge-maker's efforts, and here there was a ford, with stepping-stones for foot passengers. The banks on every side were lined with leaning willows, which had been pollarded over and over again, and which with their light-green wavy heads gave the place, from a distance, the appearance of a grove. There was a little porch {{in front of the house}}, and outside of that a <b>fixed</b> <b>seat,</b> with a high back, on which old Brattle was sitting when the parson accosted him. He did not rise when Mr. Fenwick addressed him; but he intended no want of courtesy by not doing so. He was on his legs at business during nearly the whole of the day, and why should he not rest his old limbs during the few mid-day minutes which he allowed himself for recreation? ...|$|E

Admiration seis'd [...] All Heav'n, what this might mean, & whither tend [...] Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd: [...] O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace [...] Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou [...] My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, [...] To me are all my works, nor Man the least [...] Though last created, that for him I spare [...] Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, [...] By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. [...] 280 [...] Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme, [...] Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne; [...] And be thy self Man among men on Earth, [...] Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, [...] By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room [...] The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son.

[...] Direct against which op'nd from beneath, [...] Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, [...] A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, [...] Wider by farr then that of after-times [...] Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, [...] 530 [...] Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear, [...] By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, [...] On high behests his Angels to and fro [...] Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard [...] From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood [...] To Beersaba, where the Holy Land [...] Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; [...] So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set [...] To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. [...] Satan from hence now on the lower stair [...] 540 [...] That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate [...] Looks down with wonder at the sudden view [...] Of all this World at once. As when a Scout [...] Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone [...] All night; at last by break of chearful dawne [...] Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, [...] Which to his eye discovers unaware [...] The goodly prospect of some forein land [...] First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis [...] With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, [...] 550 [...] Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. [...] Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, [...] The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd [...] At sight of all this World beheld so faire.

[...] There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps [...] Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe [...] Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. [...] 590 [...] The place he found beyond expression bright, [...] Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; [...] Not all parts like, but all alike informd [...] Which radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; [...] If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; [...] If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, [...] Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon [...] In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides [...] Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, [...] That stone, or like to that which here below [...] 600 [...] Philosophers in vain so long have sought, [...] In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde [...] Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound [...] In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, [...] Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. [...] What wonder then if fields and regions here [...] Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run [...] Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch [...] Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote [...] Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt [...] 610 [...] Here in the dark so many precious things [...] Of colour glorious and effect so rare? [...] Here matter new to gaze the Devil met [...] Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, [...] For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, [...] But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon [...] Culminate from th' Aequator, as they now [...] Shot upward still direct, whence no way round [...] Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, [...] No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray [...] 620 [...] To objects distant farr, whereby he soon [...] Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, [...] The same whom John saw also in the Sun: [...] His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; [...] Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar [...] Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind [...] Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings [...] Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd [...] Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. [...] Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope [...] 630 [...] To find who might direct his wandring flight [...] To Paradise the happie seat of Man, [...] His journies end and our beginning woe. [...] But first he casts to change his proper shape, [...] Which else might work him danger or delay: [...] And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, [...] Not of the prime, yet such as in his face [...] Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb [...] Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; [...] Under a Coronet his flowing haire [...] 640 [...] In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore [...] Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, [...] His habit fit for speed succinct, and held [...] Before his decent steps a Silver wand. [...] He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, [...] Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, [...] Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known [...] Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n [...] Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne [...] Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes [...] 650 [...] That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth [...] Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, [...] O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; [...] Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand [...] In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, [...] The first art wont his great authentic will [...] Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, [...] Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; [...] And here art likeliest by supream decree [...] Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye [...] 660 [...] To visit oft this new Creation round; [...] Unspeakable desire to see, and know [...] All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, [...] His chief delight and favour, him for whom [...] All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, [...] Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim [...] Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell [...] In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man [...] His <b>fixed</b> <b>seat,</b> or <b>fixed</b> <b>seat</b> hath none, [...] But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; [...] 670 [...] That I may find him, and with secret gaze, [...] Or open admiration him behold [...] On whom the great Creator hath bestowd [...] Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; [...] That both in him and all things, as is meet, [...] The Universal Maker we may praise; [...] Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes [...] To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss [...] Created this new happie Race of Men [...] To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. [...] 680 [...] So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; [...] For neither Man nor Angel can discern [...] Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks [...] Invisible, except to God alone, [...] By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: [...] And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps [...] At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie [...] Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill [...] Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd [...] Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held [...] 690 [...] The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; [...] Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule [...] In his uprightness answer thus returnd. [...] Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know [...] The works of God, thereby to glorifie [...] The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess [...] That reaches blame, but rather merits praise [...] The more it seems excess, that led thee hither [...] From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, [...] To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps [...] 700 [...] Contented with report heare onely in heav'n: [...] For wonderful indeed are all his works, [...] Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all [...] Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; [...] But what created mind can comprehend [...] Thir number, or the wisdom infinite [...] That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. [...] I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, [...] This worlds material mould, came to a heap: [...] Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar [...] 710 [...] Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; [...] Till at his second bidding darkness fled, [...] Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: [...] Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then [...] The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, [...] And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n [...] Flew upward, spirited with various forms, [...] That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs [...] Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; [...] Each had his place appointed, each his course, [...] 720 [...] The rest in circuit walles this Universe. [...] Look downward on that Globe whose hither side [...] With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; [...] That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light [...] His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere [...] Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon [...] (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide [...] Timely interposes, and her monthly round [...] Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; [...] With borrowd light her countenance triform [...] 730 [...] Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, [...] And in her pale dominion checks the night. [...] That spot to which I point is Paradise, [...] Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. [...] Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. [...] Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, [...] As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, [...] Where honour due and reverence none neglects, [...] Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, [...] Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, [...] 740 [...] Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, [...] Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.|$|E
