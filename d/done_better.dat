5|$|Joe Law of GameFocus {{criticized the}} Rage Gage system, stating {{that it had}} been <b>done</b> <b>better</b> in other games. However he cited the game's overall length a good thing as he felt the game had no replay value. Nick Valentino of GameZone praised the game, calling it the best RPG {{to make use of the}} Dragon Ball label, and the game was the perfect {{introduction}} into the franchise. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer cited the games as not being perfect, but was superior to the Super Famicom game Legend of the Super Saiyan. Kat Bailey of 1UP.com felt the game was made with children in mind, stating that the vibrant colors and the fast-paced gameplay would keep kids interested in the game.|$|E
5|$|The dump {{months are}} what the film {{community}} calls the two periods {{of the year}} when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases. Audiences during these periods are smaller {{than the rest of the}} year, so no tentpole movies are released. January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August and September sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they <b>done</b> <b>better</b> at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home.|$|E

At its debut in the United Kingdom, it performed poorly, reaching only #38 in the charts. According to Xseed, the game's sales in North America were favorable, although they were not on the same level as The Last Story.

25|$|When the Conservatives {{replaced}} the Liberals {{in power in}} 1984, they began to reverse the nationalization process. In 1991, they passed legislation allowing privatization and began selling shares to the public. The Liberals returned to power in 1993, but had lost interest in having a national oil company, and continued the privatization process. In 1995 the federal government reduced its interest to 20 percent, and in 2004 sold the remaining shares. Petro-Canada has <b>done</b> <b>better</b> since privatization because oil price increases since 2003 make its high-cost production profitable, and consolidation of its refining operations to fewer but larger refineries reduced its downstream costs even as prices increased.|$|E

The next action in the theater occurred on 12 and 13 July in the Battle of the Vosges or Schänzel. After this victory, the French recaptured Kaiserslautern on 17 July and moved forward to the Speyerbach again, wiping out all of the Coalition's recent gains.|$|E

Woods left Brighton College in 1886, aged 19, and shortly after, in August of the same year, he made his first-class cricket debut. Playing for GN Wyatt's XI against the touring Australians, Woods opened the bowling in both innings for the English side which was termed a 'South of England XI'. Woods made scores of 21 and 11 with the bat, and took 2/45 and 0/40 bowling. He claimed that he strained his side trying to bowl too fast, and would have <b>done</b> <b>better</b> otherwise.|$|E

25|$|Murray became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 26 September 1915. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. After the war he wrote to Ian Hamilton, criticising Kitchener in harsh terms, writing that “He seldom told the absolute the truth and the whole truth” {{and that it was}} not until Kitchener left for his inspection of the Dardanelles that Murray was able to inform the Cabinet that volunteering had fallen far below the level needed to maintain a BEF of 70 divisions, requiring the introduction of conscription. The Cabinet insisted on proper General Staff papers being presented in Kitchener's absence. Murray wrote that “I have never in my forty years’ service <b>done</b> <b>better</b> work than I did during the three months I was CIGS”. Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey praised Murray highly as a real “St John the Baptist” to Sir William Robertson, his successor as CIGS.|$|E
25|$|Nationwide, the RealClearPolitics tally counted one caucus {{participant}} {{as equal}} to one primary participant. However, turnout is generally lower in caucuses, {{and as a}} result, the popular vote may overweight the influence of primary states. For example, Hawaii and Rhode Island have similar populations, but the opinion of Rhode Islanders is weighted more heavily in the popular vote total. Clinton won the Rhode Island primary 58-40% and received 33,600 more votes than Obama. In contrast, Obama won the Hawaii caucuses 76-24%, but received only 19,500 more votes than Clinton. Thus, some researchers argue that the popular vote underestimates the depth of Obama's support in caucus states. If these states were to hold primaries and Obama were to win by a similar margin, his popular vote total would be considerably higher. However, Clinton argued {{that she would have}} <b>done</b> <b>better</b> in these states if primaries were held.|$|E
25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} <b>done</b> <b>better</b> acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E

25|$|The {{block system}} handles all control and {{supervision}} of routes through interlockings including switch (point) control and switch status, for broken rail protection, and tracking of trains with failed (or not equipped for) CBTC. CBTC lines are fully track circuited with power frequency, single-rail track circuits. (Broken-rail protection is only guaranteed {{on one of}} the two rails, however.) Equipment aboard every train identifies the location of the train using wayside transponders as a basis. Once the Zone Controller has determined, based on track circuit information and train localization, that the CBTC train is a single discrete train ("sieved"). The Wayside Zone Controller uses this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead. The CBTC Zone Controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from the Wasyide (Legacy) Signaling system. Trains, with CBTC, can then operate closer together, although as before, platform dwell times and train performance are the true limiting factors in terms of headway performance. With the new system, signals and interlockings are still absolutely required, their job being <b>done</b> <b>better</b> by relay interlockings or Solid State Interlocking controllers. The ATS system at the Control Center is not a vital (life-safety) system and serves only to automate the routing of trains based on the overall timetable. The location of the train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times. The MTA's form of CBTC uses a reduced form of the old fixed-block signaling system, requiring that both be maintained at high cost.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have <b>done</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
