50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was constructed}} during 1955-1956, during the Soviet era. It provides water to Narva Hydroelectric Station (installed capacity 125 MW, {{located on the}} Russian side and owned by the power company TGC-1) and cooling water to the Estonian Narva Power Plants. Its surface area at normal <b>headwater</b> <b>level</b> of 25 m is 191 km2, of which 40 km2 belongs to Estonia. Its drainage basin is 55848 km2.|$|E
50|$|The {{power plant}} is {{operated}} {{so as to}} use {{as much of the}} water flow as possible for power production. During periods of high stream flow, the spillway gates are opened to pass the water in excess of the capacity of the turbines, and as necessary for retention and regulation of floodwaters through surcharge operation. The upper portion of the reservoir, corresponding to a five-foot depth above the normal <b>headwater</b> <b>level,</b> is provided for surcharge storage. This storage space is utilized by raising all of the spillway gates in small equal increments, thus permitting passage of some water under them, but retaining or forcing into storage all inflow to the reservoir in excess of the spillway discharge and power releases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Culverts are {{important}} hydraulic structures whose main {{purpose is to}} safely convey water through infrastructures crossing streams (e. g. roads). Several design guidelines exist for clear water conditions, {{but none of them}} takes into account the sediments. Therefore, in the framework of the Natural hazards Infrastructure for floods and landslide (NIFS) project, five student-theses have been prepared in order to bridge this knowledge gap, and contribute to development of new guidelines for culvert design. The theses were based on model tests (1 : 10) which were designed to specifically study the effect of sediment transport. The culvert s hydraulic capacity was investigated with different boundary conditions, under both clear water condition and sediment load. The present study is the first joint analysis of all the data from these studies, which identifies the favourable culvert inlet design, under sediment transport. The experiments were carried out with three different inlet types (cut, projecting, wingwalls) under inlet control focusing on the effects of the expansion section geometry, the installation of reserve barrel, sediment countermeasures, feeding method, sediment size and sediment amount. The main findings of the thesis were the followings: under jet dominated flow, the wingwall-inlet provided the highest capacity while in case of milder slope (1 : 9) and installed energy dissipation, the projecting inlet. The energy dissipator blocks have been installed for generation of a hydraulic jump. Both width and length of the expansion section influenced the culvert s hydraulic capacity. The culvert showed generally the highest performance for the shortest expansion section length (315 mm; model scale), and for the widest expansion section width (876 mm; model scale). Sediment experiments showed that sediment load generally decreased the culvert s hydraulic capacity as the deposited sediment obstructed the flow through the barrel. From the two sediment feeding methods (gradually, all at once) the all at once feeding resulted in higher <b>headwater</b> <b>levels</b> as more sediment deposited in the basin. Although sediment size and amount had only a slight effect on the culvert performance, the water level was generally higher when more sediment (7 kg) was fed to the model. The installation of a reserve barrel, located at a higher level compared to the main culvert, increased the safety of the structure as it was less prone to be blocked by sediments. Experiments with sediment countermeasures showed that both trash racks and debris deflectors are efficient in sediment retention. However, installation of these structures decreased the culvert s hydraulic capacity. Based on these results, an analysis was carried out focusing on hydraulic capacity, embankment safety and costs to find the optimal configuration. The identified configuration is presented and corresponding sketches have been developed...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable flood {{management}} is increasingly {{looking to the}} role of catchment land use in alleviating downstream flooding. Woodland presents a number of opportunities that are dependent on its location within the landscape. One way that woodland can attenuate flooding is through the greater water use by trees. The overall impact on the generation of flood flows, however, depends on the interaction of many factors and is most marked at the <b>headwater</b> <b>level.</b> Another way relies on the ‘sponge effect’. Improved infiltration resulting from the targeted planting of sensitive soils or the use of down-slope woodland buffers could attenuate rapid run-off at the local scale. Finally, the greater hydraulic roughness associated with riparian and floodplain woodland can aid the retention and delay the passage of flood waters, potentially assisting downstream flood defence in larger catchments. This paper examines each of these opportunities and considers whether woodland can make a significant contribution to tackling future flooding as part of a whole-catchment approach to sustainable {{flood management}}...|$|E
40|$|Francis {{turbines}} {{that are}} directly coupled to a synchronous generator operate at constant rotational speed around a design point {{characterized by a}} given water head, flow and guide vane aperture. When important changes occur in <b>headwater</b> <b>level</b> in power stations with large reservoirs, the turbines suffer a significant loss of efficiency. By applying variable speed technology {{it may be possible}} to adapt the runner speed and to operate with a higher efficiency over a wide range of water heads. This investigation is intended to reveal the possible benefits of using variable speed operation in regard to gains in efficiency and power output. Based on model test data it is possible to determine the characteristic curves of unitary speed and unitary flow of the respective prototype turbine for varying guide vane apertures. By varying rotor speed it is possible to maintain values that correspond to maximum efficiency. An analysis is made keeping guide vane aperture constant and introducing a proportionality factor of water flow to corresponding power output. The results show that for guide vane apertures and heads different from the design point, best efficiencies can be kept by adjusting rotor speed. At heads lower than the design head, significant efficiency gains can be achieved. Consequently, a significant proportion of the flow can be saved while generating the same amount of power...|$|E
50|$|The long, narrow Redwood Creek {{drainage}} basin encompasses 280 mi2 km2 {{on the western}} slopes of the California Coast Ranges, entirely within Humboldt County. It stretches about 56 km {{from north to south}} and ranges from 4.5 to 7 mi wide. Most of the stream flows in a broad, 1500 ft-deep valley sandwiched between the Mad River basin to the west, and the Klamath River drainage to the east. Elevations range from over 5000 ft on higher peaks of the mountains near the <b>headwaters</b> to sea <b>level</b> at the creek's mouth at the Pacific. The small town of Orick and the narrow strip of surrounding farmland are the only significant development in the entire basin. The river is free flowing and has no dams, only a few agricultural diversions in the last 3 mi above the mouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Burn of Monboys rise on the southern and western slopes of the Meikle Carewe Hill where the stream flows downslope at a first westerly and thence southerly as it makes its way to discharge to the Cowie Water. The southwestern flanks of Craggie Cat, a hill in the northeast part of the Burn of Monboys drainage basin, drain to the Burn of Monboys. The stream has a greenish brown appearance and generally has lush vegetation growing {{all the way to}} its margins throughout most of its course of the middle and downstream reaches. The turbidity typically measures approximately 10 JTU and the July flow rate is roughly five cubic feet per second in the <b>headwaters</b> reach. pH <b>levels</b> have been measured at 7.27, very slightly alkaline, but undoubtedly less basic than other area streams due to the drainage from the higher elevation peat moorlands of Meikle Carewe and Curlethney Hills.|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a first national-scale {{assessment of the}} nutrient status of British headwater streams within the wider river network, by joint analysis of the national Countryside Survey Headwater Stream and Harmonised River Monitoring Scheme datasets. We apply a novel Nutrient Limitation Assessment methodology to explore {{the extent to which}} nutrients may potentially limit primary production in headwater streams and rivers, by coupling ternary assessment of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) depletion, with N:P stoichiometry, and threshold P and N concentrations. P limitation was more commonly seen in the rivers, with greater prevalence of N limitation in the <b>headwater</b> streams. High <b>levels</b> of potential P and N co-limitation were found in the headwater streams, especially the Upland-Low-Alkalinity streams. This suggests that managing both P and N inputs may be needed to minimise risks of degradation of these sensitive headwater stream environments. Although localised nutrient impairment of headwater streams can occur, there were markedly lower rates of P and N impairment of headwater streams relative to downstream rivers at the national scale. Nutrient source contributions, relative to hydrological dilution, increased with catchment scale, corresponding with increases in the extent of agricultural and urban land-use. The estimated nutrient reductions needed to achieve compliance with Water Framework Directive standards, and to reach limiting concentrations, were greatest for the Lowland-High-Alkalinity rivers and streams. Preliminary assessments suggest that reducing P concentrations in the Lowland-High-Alkalinity headwater streams, and N concentrations in the Upland-Low-Alkalinity rivers, might offer greater overall benefits for water-quality remediation at the national scale, relative to the magnitude of nutrient reductions required. This approach could help inform the prioritisation of nutrient remediation, as part of a directional approach to water quality management based on closing the gaps between current and target nutrient concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{environmental}} {{changes on the}} emergence and dispersal of anatomically modern humans (AMH) is particularly important in North Africa, since the Straits of Gibraltar might have served as western migration route for AMH from Africa to Europe. The prehistoric rock shelter of Ifri n’Ammar in NE Morocco reveals discontinuous Middle and Late Palaeolithic occupation phases since ~ 170 ka. Our study focuses on Wadi Selloum deposits to unravel palaeoenvironmental features and geomorphological aspects of the direct vicinity of Ifri n’Ammar. As {{a tributary of the}} Moulouya River, the catchment area of this ephemeral stream amounts to ~ 290 km², spanning elevations between ~ 700 and 200 m above sea <b>level.</b> <b>Headwaters</b> of the 35 km long Wadi Selloum drain Mesozoic limestone and dolomite. The application of luminescence dating techniques on Wadi Selloum deposits yielded burial ages between 1. 3 ± 0. 2 ka and 78 ± 7 ka, covering morphodynamically stable and active phases. Overbank fines include well-developed soil horizons as evidence of stability and of more humid periods than today around 80 ka and during the Holocene. This is supported by pedofeatures discovered in thin sections as well as the composition of clay minerals of the wadi sediments. Disordered clay minerals and partly illite/chlorite mixed-layer characterize the soil levels. Levels relatively rich in chlorite, illite, ankerite and quartz are interpreted as corresponding to relatively dry periods, while more humid periods lead to more intensive weathering and consequently to the dominance of clay minerals more advanced in the relative stability scale, such as kaolinite. Smectite is taken to indicate a climate with contrasting seasons and a pronounced dry season. In contrast, coarse-grained deposits, which are partly characterised by calcrete layers, point to drier conditions after 80 ka and 14 ka. In addition, the lack of palaeosols confirms morphodynamic activity during these periods. Acknowledgement.
