5|$|After {{a three-week}} trial, in late July a twelve-person jury {{unanimously}} found both Owen and West guilty of murder. The state prosecutors, Kathy Pryce and Karen Seymour Johnson, requested that Owen and West <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation that up to 27 more prisoners could <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished the death penalty in all circumstances.|$|E

25|$|In February 2003 the Norwegian {{government}} ordered Krekar to {{be deported}} to Iraq, {{but as of}} July 2009 the order had not been implemented because of the security environment in Iraq, and the risk that Krekar could <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty there, as Norway will not deport people in these circumstances. Krekar has unsuccessfully challenged the expulsion order in court, with the order being confirmed in September 2005. Norway's government {{has said that the}} new government to be elected in Iraq in December 2005 might permit discussion on whether Krekar's expulsion order can be implemented.|$|E
25|$|Most nations do not {{prohibit}} consensual sex between unrelated persons {{above the}} local age of consent. Some jurisdictions further recognize identical rights, protections, and privileges {{for the family}} structures of same-sex couples, including marriage. Some nations mandate that all individuals restrict themselves to heterosexual relationships; that is, in some jurisdictions homosexual activity is illegal. Offenders can <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty in some fundamentalist Muslim areas such as Iran and parts of Nigeria. There are, however, often significant differences between official policy and real-world enforcement.|$|E
25|$|Officers and troopers alike {{were usually}} given a wide leeway by their {{superiors}} {{in carrying out}} their orders, {{so long as the}} larger objectives of the plan were well served and the orders promptly obeyed. The Mongols thus avoided the pitfalls of overly rigid discipline and micromanagement, which have impeded armed forces throughout history. However, all members had to be unconditionally loyal {{to each other and to}} their superiors, and especially to the Khan. If one soldier ran from danger in battle, he and his nine comrades from the same arban would <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty together.|$|E

25|$|Vicky Austin {{is about}} {{two years older than}} Polly O'Keefe, her contemporary. Adam Eddington meets first Polly and then, a year later, Vicky. Conversely, Zachary Gray meets and pursues a {{relationship}} with Polly a few years after alienating Vicky. Both heroines are caught up in international intrigue (Polly in The Arm of the Starfish, Vicky in Troubling a Star), and both are aided by Canon Tallis when their families fall victim to conspiracy and kidnapping. Vicky and Polly are each characterized as loving and somewhat naive, and each must <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of a beloved mentor. Each of them keeps a journal, is given an international trip by an older woman to whom she is not related, and has difficulty deciding on a career path.|$|E
25|$|In March 2005, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Roper v. Simmons that the Eighth Amendment prohibits {{execution}} for crimes committed when {{under the age}} of 18. In light of this Supreme Court decision, the prosecutors in Prince William County decided not to pursue the charges against Malvo. Prosecutors in Maryland, Louisiana, and Alabama were still interested in putting both Malvo and Muhammad on trial. As Malvo was 17 when he committed the crimes, he could no longer <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty but still could be extradited to Alabama, Louisiana, and other states for prosecution. At the time of the Roper v. Simmons ruling, Malvo was 20 years old and was held at Virginia's maximum security Red Onion State Prison in Pound in Wise County.|$|E
25|$|During {{a hearing}} on August 10, 2006, Haq {{surprised}} the court by indicating that he wished to enter a guilty plea on all charges. The judge refused to accept this plea before a competency hearing had been conducted. Additionally, experts consulted by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer expressed doubts as to whether Haq {{would be allowed to}} plead guilty at such an early point in the legal process because the prosecution had not yet decided whether Haq would <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. On August 16, C. Wesley Richards, Haq's attorney, told the court that Haq had changed his mind and chosen to plead not guilty. Additionally, Richards said that Haq was mentally competent to stand trial since he understood the charges against him and was capable of assisting in his own defense.|$|E

50|$|McCrory {{signed into}} law a bill that {{repealed}} the state's Racial Justice Act of 2009, which allowed inmates <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty to challenge their sentences {{on the basis of}} racial discrimination.

25|$|Although his {{sentence}} {{was not the}} death penalty, Einhorn's defense attorneys argued that Einhorn would <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty if he was returned to the United States. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance {{that the death penalty}} will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed out that when the murder occurred, Pennsylvania did not have the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the US and the Pennsylvania constitutions forbid ex post facto law. Einhorn's next strategy involved French law and the European Court of Human Rights, which require a new trial when the defendant was tried in absentia and unable to present his defense. On this basis, the court of appeals of Bordeaux rejected the extradition request.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, any Muslim person—including {{any person}} {{born to a}} Muslim family or any person who became a Muslim at a given point {{in his or her}} life—who {{converts}} to Christianity or re-converts to it, is considered an apostate. Apostasy, the conscious abandonment of Islam by a Muslim in word or deed, including conversion to Christianity, is punishable as a crime under applications of the Sharia (countries in the graph). There are, however, cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith, secretly without declaring his/her apostasy. As a result, they are practising Christians, but they are still legally Muslims, and they can <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty according to the Sharia. Meriam Ibrahim, a Sudanese woman, was sentenced to death for apostasy in 2014, because the government of Sudan classified her as a Muslim, even though she was raised as a Christian.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Tara A. Osborn was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} judge for the trial {{on the same day}} that Gross was removed. In 2011 Osborn presided over a death penalty case, the court martial of SGT Joseph Bozicevich, who was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for killing his squad leader and another soldier. In January 2013, Osborn was deliberating whether to remove the death penalty, due to the Defense attorney's claim that LTG Campbell was not impartial when it was decided that Hasan would <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. On January 31, Osborn ruled that a capital murder trial was constitutional, based on a 1996 Supreme Court case regarding Dwight J. Loving; Osborn additionally ruled that her court did not have jurisdiction regarding Hasan's beard, and it was a matter to take up with Hasan's chain of command. As of February 2013, the court-martial had been set to start in May 29, 2013, with jury selection to begin on July 1, 2013.|$|E
