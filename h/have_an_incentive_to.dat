5|$|The Labour Party {{noted that}} the {{allocation}} of credits to emitters on a 'intensity' basis, with no cap on emissions, meant that emitters would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> continue to emit greenhouse gases. Taxpayers would have to fund the long period of assistance by allocation of free units to industry {{at a cost of}} up to $NZ2 billion by 2030.|$|E
5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E

25|$|According to {{this model}} the firms <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> form a cartel, {{effectively}} turning the Cournot model into a Monopoly. Cartels are usually illegal, so firms might instead tacitly collude using self-imposing strategies to reduce output which, ceteris paribus {{will raise the}} price and thus increase profits for all firms involved.|$|E
25|$|If the MBS was not {{underwritten by}} the {{original}} real estate and the issuer's guarantee, the rating of the bonds would be much lower. Part {{of the reason is}} the expected adverse selection against borrowers with improving credit (from MBSs pooled by initial credit quality) who would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> refinance (ultimately joining an MBS pool with a higher credit rating).|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} the bank to borrow money {{reliably}} and economically is crucial, which is why confidence in the bank's creditworthiness is important to its liquidity. This means that the bank needs to maintain adequate capitalisation and to effectively control its exposures to risk {{in order to continue}} its operations. If creditors doubt the bank's assets are worth more than its liabilities, all demand creditors <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> demand payment immediately, causing a bank run to occur.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, in {{many cases}} investors have <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> {{coordinate}} their choices. For example, someone who thinks other investors want to buy lots of Japanese yen may expect the yen to rise in value, and therefore <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> buy yen too. Likewise, a depositor in IndyMac Bank who expects other depositors to withdraw their funds may expect the bank to fail, and therefore <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> withdraw too. Economists call <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> mimic the strategies of others strategic complementarity.|$|R
25|$|Proposition 13 reduces {{property}} tax revenue for municipalities in California. They {{are forced to}} rely more on state funding and therefore may lose autonomy and control. The amount of taxes available to the municipality {{in any given year}} largely depends on the number of property transfers taking place. However, since existing property owners <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> remain in their property and not sell, there are fewer property transfers under this type of {{property tax}} system.|$|E
25|$|That is, {{the authors}} {{describe}} a two-stage sequential game (diagrammed below) {{in which the}} rich first decide on the taxation rate {{and the level of}} redistribution and then the poor decide whether revolution is the optimal choice.

25|$|Crocodiles are {{protected}} {{in many parts}} of the world, and are farmed commercially. Their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy. The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles. Farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> conserve their habitat. Crocodile leather is made into wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes. Crocodile oil has been used for various purposes.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of papers in the {{economics}} literature suggest that carbon taxes should be preferred to carbon trading (Carbon Trust, 2009). Counter-arguments to this are usually based on the possible preference that politicians may have for emissions trading compared with taxes (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). One of these is that emission permits can be freely distributed to polluting industries, rather than the revenues going to the government. In comparison, industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from a carbon tax. It is therefore argued that with emissions trading, polluters <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> cut emissions, {{but if they are}} exempted from a carbon tax, they have no incentive to cut emissions (Smith, 2008, pp.56â€“57). On the other hand, freely distributing emission permits could potentially lead to corrupt behaviour (World Bank, 2010, p.268).|$|E
25|$|Oil sands {{operations}} {{differ from}} conventional oil {{in that the}} initial profitability is somewhat lower, but the geological and political risks are low, the reserves are vast, and the expected lifetime of production extends for generations rather than just a few years. Governments <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> subsidize the start-up costs since they will recover their initial subsidies from tax revenues {{over a long period}} of time. From the standpoint of federal-provincial revenues, they also differ in that the federal government will receive larger higher share and higher return on its incentives than it would from conventional oil, while the provincial share, although substantial, will be proportionally smaller. Consequently, there has tended to be much less intergovernmental conflict and more agreement on how these projects should be handled.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} urban {{planning}} theorist was Sir Ebenezer Howard, who initiated the garden city movement in 1898. This {{was inspired by}} earlier planned communities built by industrial philanthropists in the countryside, such as Cadburys' Bournville, Lever's Port Sunlight and George Pullman's eponymous Pullman in Chicago. All these settlements decentralised the working environment from {{the centre of the}} cities, and provided a healthy living space for the factory workers. Howard generalised this achievement into a planned movement for the country as a whole. He was also influenced by the work of economist Alfred Marshall who argued in 1884 that industry needed a supply of labour that could in theory be supplied anywhere, and that companies <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> improve workers living standards as the company bears much of the cost inflicted by the unhealthy urban conditions in the big cities.|$|E
40|$|We {{solve for}} the optimal {{mechanism}} for selling two goods when the buyerâ€™s demand characteristics are unobservable. In {{the case of}} substitutable goods, the seller <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> offer lotteries over goods in order to charge the buyers with large differences in the valuations a higher price for obtaining their desired good with certainty. However, the seller also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> countervailing <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> make the allocation of the goods among the participating buyers more efficient {{in order to increase}} the overall demand. In the case when the buyer can consume both goods, the seller <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> underprovide one of the goods in order to charge the buyers with large valuations a higher price for the bundle of both goods. As in the case of substitutable goods, the seller also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> countervailing <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> lower the price of the bundle in order to increase the overall demand. ...|$|R

25|$|Although {{periphery}} {{nations are}} exploited by core countries, {{there is a}} purpose to the unequal exchanges of goods. For instance, the core countries <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> gain a profit and this enables the world market to further grow. At times, there {{is a change in}} the balance of trade between the periphery and core countries. This occurs when the prices of exports from periphery countries decrease at a faster rate than the exports from core nations. In this case, the governments of the periphery nation are affected in several ways. For instance, there is an increase in unemployment as well as a decrease in state income. This type of interaction is unique because the core country involved is somewhat weaker than normal. An example of this occurring is the growth of the industrial capabilities of Italy and Russia {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. This has also occurred in other periphery nations such as Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|The {{new system}} is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on the {{regulation}} of international trade, in order to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> reduce it, {{and in doing so}} they would automatically clear other nations deficits. He proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency - the bancor - which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand â€“ countries running surpluses exert a [...] "negative externality" [...] on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} {{transport}} costs and trade barriers hinder {{the expansion of}} the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties, exchange controls, import quotas and other non-tariff barriers to trade are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing. More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> export their commodities. As a result, the amount of capital accumulation remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view. Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of [...] "inward looking growth" [...] as opposed to [...] "outward looking growth".

2500|$|The congressional {{district}} method {{can more easily}} be implemented than other alternatives to the winner-takes-all method, in view of major party resistance to relatively enabling third parties under the proportional method. State legislation is sufficient to use this method. Advocates of the {{congressional district}} method believe the system would encourage higher voter turnout and incentivize presidential candidates to broaden their campaigns in non-competitive states. Winner-take-all systems ignore thousands of popular votes; in Democratic California there are Republican districts, in Republican Texas there are Democratic districts. Because candidates <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> campaign in competitive districts, with a district plan, candidates <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> actively campaign in over thirty states versus seven [...] "swing" [...] states.
