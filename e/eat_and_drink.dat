5|$|On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Bombay (Mumbai). Upon arrival, {{he stayed}} with the local Modh Bania {{community}} {{while waiting for the}} ship travel arrangements. The head of the community knew Gandhi's father. After learning Gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> in Western ways. Gandhi informed them of his promise to his mother and her blessings. The local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him an outcast. But Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London. His brother saw him off.|$|E
5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E

The Persians were hedonists who declared {{that the purpose of}} life is to pursue indulgence and lusts—”Let us <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink,</b> for tomorrow we may die.” They were lopsided towards the quality of Chesed, attraction and kindness (albeit to the self).|$|E

Halal foods are food items that Muslims {{are allowed to}} <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> under Islamic dietary guidelines.

25|$|These {{restrictions}} are waived {{in the case}} of health issues but a competent Posek, a rabbi who decides Jewish Law, must be consulted. For example, those who are seriously ill will be allowed to <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink.</b> On other fast days almost any medical condition may justify breaking the fast; in practice, since many cases differ, consultation with a rabbi is often necessary. Ritual washing up to the knuckles is permitted. Washing to cleanse dirt or mud from one's body is also permitted.|$|E

25|$|Jezebel, enraged that Elijah {{had ordered}} the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah. Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, {{continues}} alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the Lord touches him and tells him {{to wake up and}} eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> because he has a long journey ahead of him.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sellers of}} {{religious}} goods, named Paternostrari or Coronari (rosary makers) had their shops here. At {{the edge of}} the quarter, in Vicolo degli ombrellari, a small lane near Borgo Pio, were the shops of the Roman umbrella makers, gathered there because of the bad smell coming from the oiled silk. In Borgo Vecchio several small foundries were active, where artistic objects made of bronze were cast. Particularly characteristic was the making of bells: the last foundry, located in Vicolo del Farinone, closed around 1995, after an activity lasted about 450 years. In the Borgo were also located many famous osterie, where Romans and pilgrims could <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> wine.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{sent his}} wife Charlotte to Europe to plead against the {{withdrawal}} of French troops. After an unsuccessful attempt at negotiating with Napoleon III, Charlotte then traveled to Rome to plead with Pius in 1866. As the days passed Charlotte's mental state became overtly paranoid. She sought refuge with the pope, and she would <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> only what was prepared for him, fearful that everything else might be poisoned. The pope, though alarmed, was accommodating to her and even agreed to let her stay in the Vatican one night after she voiced anxiety about her safety. She and her assistant were the first women to stay the night inside the Vatican.|$|E

25|$|Marcello is {{painting}} while Rodolfo gazes {{out of the}} window. They {{complain of}} the cold. In order to keep warm, they burn the manuscript of Rodolfo's drama. Colline, the philosopher, enters shivering and disgruntled at not having been able to pawn some books. Schaunard, the musician of the group, arrives with food, wine and cigars. He explains {{the source of his}} riches: a job with an eccentric English gentleman, who ordered him to play his violin to a parrot until it died. The others hardly listen to his tale as they set up the table to <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink.</b> Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{a working-class}} neighborhood, Wrigleyville is the {{nickname}} {{to the neighborhood}} directly surrounding Wrigley Field. Also known as Lakeview West, its borders run from Cornelia Avenue and Grace Street, to Halsted Street and Racine Avenue. Wrigleyville features low-rise brick buildings and houses, some with rooftop bleachers colloquially called Wrigley Rooftops where people can purchase seats to watch baseball games or concerts that, while generally more expensive than tickets for seats within the park itself, come with all you can <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> service. Proprietors {{are able to do}} so under special agreements with the Chicago Cubs organization. Many Wrigleyville bars and restaurants (particularly on North Clark Street) feature sports-oriented themes. Bars such as Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers, Casey Moran's, Rockwood Place, Sports Corner and The Cubby Bear host the Cubs crowds near the Wrigley Field intersection of North Clark Street and West Addison Street.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his {{servants}} prepare a table, and they all merrily <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink.</b> As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor {{says that he is}} unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.|$|E

500|$|In 1881, O'Connell {{published}} Lyrics, a book {{of poetry}} evincing a [...] "Celtic strain." [...] The poetry displays O'Connell's sense of sunt lacrimae rerum, {{that there will be}} tears with trials, and it expresses his bittersweet joy in life's evanescent pleasures. O'Connell wrote an Irish-themed play, The Red Fox, which was staged with moderate success in San Francisco about 1882. O'Connell wrote [...] "Ghoul's Quest" [...] for The Argonaut. In 1891, he published The Inner Man: Good Things to <b>Eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drink</b> and Where to Get Them, a collection of anecdotes and advice for the epicurean who finds himself in the San Francisco area, and a cautionary description of common 19th century food adulterants such as chemical dyes and powdered lead.|$|E
500|$|The final track, [...] "Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast", {{is divided}} into three segments, each with its own {{descriptive}} title, joined by dialogue and sound effects of then-roadie Alan Styles preparing, discussing, and eating breakfast. The idea for the piece came about by Waters experimenting with the rhythm of a dripping tap, which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by Mason in his kitchen with musical pieces recorded at Abbey Road. A slightly re-worked version was performed on stage on 22 December 1970 at Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, England with the band members pausing between pieces to <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> their breakfast. The original LP ends with the sound of the tap which continues into the inner groove, and thus plays on indefinitely.|$|E
