30|$|In the European Union, maximum {{working hours}} and the minimum {{duration}} of paid vacation are {{laid down in}} the European Working Time Directive (2003 / 88 /EC) from 2003. This directive, inter alia, requires four weeks of paid annual leave. In Germany, the Federal Vacation Law (Bundesurlaubsgesetz) <b>establishes</b> <b>entitlements</b> which {{are consistent with the}} Directive. The law was introduced in 1963 and created an entitlement to 18  days of paid vacation on the basis of six working days per week. This minimum overall vacation period was raised to 4 weeks in 1994. The Federal Vacation Law rules out the possibility to substitute additional wage payments for such vacation entitlements if they are not used, unless the employment relationship is terminated. For the first 6 months of an employment contract, often matching the probationary period, the right to take paid vacation only exists on a pro rata basis. Since vacation entitlements are based on calendar years, employees can generally use remaining entitlements in the first months of the subsequent year. In addition to paid vacation entitlements, there are between 9 and 13 public holidays in Germany. Their number varies across federal states and regions and also depends on calendar dates (see Ray et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|The file {{associated}} with this record is under embargo while permission to archive is requested from the publisher. The historiography of English literacy {{has been dominated by}} a singular myth: the poor had an oral culture that fused slowly and imperfectly into a written culture only by the mid- and late nineteenth-century. While it is certainly true that the English poor had a strong oral culture, it is misleading to point to low literacy levels. My research on pauper letters suggests that the poor could and did write, either as an individual or collective endeavour. They sent letters to potential advocates, magistrates and above all to the officials who controlled the welfare system. These were more than petitions, often embodying sophisticated rhetorical and claims-making processes and fulfilling the intertwining purposes of communicating fact, <b>establishing</b> <b>entitlement</b> and navigating a discretionary welfare system. These letters – examples of oral writing – survive in their hundreds of thousands {{and in the absence of}} any organised or recognised class of scribes we can be confident that they approximate to the words, experiences and thoughts of the poor themselves.

40|$|Social {{security}} {{is one of}} the most important areas of social policy. As part of its social policy, the government of Lesotho has promulgated various pieces of legislation and introduced an assortment of public assistance programmes for the benefit of the people of the country. There are also various informal social security measures which are the result of coordinated activities by individuals and groupings in Lesotho. These initiatives together provide a broad spectrum of social security provisioning for the people of Lesotho. This article sets out to discuss the said social security provisioning measures and appraises the efficacy of their interventions. Lesotho is a constitutional state. The Constitution of Lesotho came into force on 2 April 1993. It provides for a Bill of Rights as well as principles of state policy. There is, however, no express provision in the Constitution for a right to social security. This is regrettable. Thus, the intersection between constitutional law and social security within the context of Lesotho can be achieved only through the interpretation of the fundamental rights as well as the principles of state policy provided in the Constitution. While the provisions relating to fundamental rights help to <b>establish</b> <b>entitlements</b> to social security, the principles of state policy play an important role in giving direction to service delivery. Understanding the link between the various governmental and social initiatives is crucial if interventions are to be designed which will enhance the provision of social security for the benefit of the people of Lesotho. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the motives that people with type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) have in seeking information about their condition, and how information is used in self-care. Semi-structured interviews (N = 25), focus groups (3 × N = 12 participants) and open-ended questionnaires (N = 6) were used to collect qualitative data. Data were analysed thematically using framework analysis. In total, 37 participants took part, all recruited from a community-based diabetes participation group. The majority of respondents were older people (aged 60 +) living in a socioeconomically deprived area. Information seeking is usually preceded by different types of uncertainty. Patients' motives for information-seeking varied, and included (1) only when necessary, (2) for reference, (3) to gain an understanding of ‘changes to their body,’ (4) to gain understanding of biomedical information and research and (5) to <b>establish</b> <b>entitlement</b> to health services and service quality. These motives influenced the information sought, and how the information was applied in diabetes self-care efforts. The types of information sought also corresponded to patients' socioeconomic status, educational level and distance from diagnosis. The findings suggest that information-seeking behaviour is differentiated – a priori – by the type of information sought. This process is informed by experiential knowledge and access to social resources. The data also suggest that socio-contextual issues are a strong influence on how information is sought and applied by those self-managing T 2 D, and that this needs to be taken into account in the provision of information to patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{business}} judgment rule is a judicially created {{doctrine that}} protects directors from personal civil liability for the decisions they make {{on behalf of}} a corporation. In today’s era of corporate scandals, global financial meltdowns, and directorial malfeasance, it has become especially important in setting the bar for when directors are appropriately responsible to shareholders for their actions. Traditionally the business judgment rule has been regarded as a standard of liability, although it has never really been explored or enunciated as such. This view determines eligibility for business judgment rule protection of a directorial decision after an examination of certain preconditions. An alternate view has developed that posits the business judgment rule is actually an abstention doctrine, and should be applied automatically absent the establishment of the same preconditions as the liability standard approach, only to be used as nullifying factors, to shield directors from having to account. The difference between the two positions essentially comes down to the order of the requirements, and who has the burden of establishing the existence of the factors that would grant or deny business judgment rule protection. This Article disagrees with both of the above approaches, and instead explores the business judgment rule as a type of immunity by comparing it to selected public and private immunities. The policy underpinnings of the business judgment rule mirror those of immunities, as does the practical impact. This means that the business judgment rule, properly construed, would require the director to <b>establish</b> <b>entitlement</b> to protection by proving that all preconditions for application of the rule are met. Much of the confusion between the courts and circuits could be alleviated by approaching the business judgment rule as a type of immunity, where the procedures and philosophies are much more enunciated. This helps place the business judgment rule back as a crucial part in the balancing act between directorial autonomy and accountability, which is especially timely given the current economic climate...|$|R

40|$|Troy Anthony Foster, appellant, {{was charged}} with four counts of sexual assault and one count of kidnapping. A jury found Foster guilty of three counts of sexual assault and acquitted him on one count of sexual assault and of kidnapping. Foster appealed his {{conviction}} asserting five assignments of error. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected Foster’s contentions concluding in part the evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict. Foster then filed a post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court, claiming ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel. The district court appointed counsel to represent Foster and conducted an evidentiary hearing. On January 28, 2004 the district court entered an order rejecting all of Foster’s claims and denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Foster again filed {{an appeal to the}} Nevada Supreme Court asserting a number of claims of error in the district court’s denial of Foster’s post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Although Foster asserted a number of claims, the Nevada Supreme Court focused primarily on Foster’s claim that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated. Foster claimed his counsel failed to assign any error on direct appeal with regard to the trial court’s finding that defense counsel violated Batson v. Kentucky. 2 The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s order denying Foster’s postconviction habeas petition. The court concluded Foster’s contentions that the district court erred in rejecting his claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel were without merit. The court reasoned that Foster had failed to show the prejudice necessary to <b>establish</b> any <b>entitlement</b> to relief on any of his claims relating to his trial counsel’s failure to object to the trial court’s Batson decision and remedy or appellate counsel’s decision to assert any claims of error on appeal with the trial court’s remedy of the Batson issue.

However, the court did reserve for a more appropriate case a more definitive decision of what remedy best serves to vindicate in Nevada courts the multiple interests that Batson protects...|$|R
40|$|Since the Federal Circuit’s {{adoption}} of Panduit’s causation standard for <b>establishing</b> <b>entitlement</b> to lost profits damages in patent litigation, application of its noninfringing alternatives prong has lacked consistency. The court’s decision in Grain Processing Corp. v. American Maize-Products Co., however, created an additional {{contribution to the}} Panduit standard, thereby raising the evidentiary bar while significantly altering the noninfringing-alternative inquiry. Grain Processing has given the infringer a potentially powerful defensive mechanism in {{an area in which}} patentees are generally favored, even when some infringement may be socially desirable. Grain Processing allows for the potential avoidance of lost profit damages, so long as the alleged infringer shows that it had the necessary equipment, know-how, and experience to produce an acceptable, noninfringing substitute during the alleged infringement period. The Grain Processing decision, however, raises some debate. As a judicially interjected gloss on damages, the added ability to limit damage awards to a reasonable royalty could have been too drastic. A closer look demonstrates a precarious policy balance. On the one hand, increases in patent litigation might justify implementing an additional hurdle to potential damage awards in order to further incentivize innovation. Added rigor provided by Grain Processing may deter frivolous and expensive litigation that might be asserted by patentees to keep new innovators out of the market. But on the other hand, if a market participant does unlawfully infringe, it is certainly reasonable to believe that the infringer should pay appropriate damages for the encroachment on another’s intellectual property. Grain Processing’s lost-profit-limiting defense against a patentee’s claim of entitlement to lost profits damages may serve to deter potentially useful innovation by increasing costs shouldered by patentees in defending their patent rights. This Note analyzes six Federal Circuit cases appealing lost profits determinations, decided both before and after Grain Processing, and attempts to discern the impacts that Grain Processing has had on patentees’ entitlements to lost profits. This Note is organized in four parts. Part I provides the historical and substantive context necessary to understand the Grain Processing decision and examines important statutory changes, especially their subsequent interpretation, both before and after Grain Processing. Part II summarizes three pre-, as well as three post-Grain Processing cases. Parts III and IV dissect and analyze the holdings in these cases and evaluate Grain Processing’s impact on patent damages...|$|R

40|$|In the SSP Applicant Experiment, {{a random}} sample of new welfare {{entrants}} was informed that if they remained on welfare for a year they would become eligible for a generous earnings subsidy. Those who satisfied the waiting period and then left welfare and began working full time within the following year were entitled to receive payments for up to 36 months whenever they were off welfare and working full time. A simple optimizing model suggests that the program rules created an unusual sequence of incentives to: (1) prolong the initial spell on welfare for at least 12 months to become eligible for the subsidy offer; (2) <b>establish</b> subsidy <b>entitlement</b> by finding full time work and leaving welfare in the 12 to 24 month period after initial entry; and (3) choose work over welfare during the three years that subsidies were available. Consistent with these implications, comparisons between the experimental treatment group and a randomly assigned control group show that the program increased welfare participation in the first year after initial entry and lowered it over the following 5 years. We develop an econometric model of welfare participation and program eligibility status that allows us to identify the behavioral effects associated with the program rules. We find important responses to all three incentives. We also find that the impact of the program persisted after subsidy payments ended, although the effect decayed over time. ...|$|R
40|$|Rights-based {{approaches}} to advocacy {{on behalf of}} homeless persons have long sought to vindicate important dignitary, liberty, and equality interests, as well as <b>establish</b> to <b>entitlements</b> to housing, mental health, substance abuse, and other services. This advocacy has had some success in shaping the systems that define the interaction between homeless persons and the state. Rights paradigms, however, can be undermined by the day-to-day reality {{of the lives of}} homeless individuals and families that are often shaped by profound need less for protection from the state than for meaningful support, and entitlement advocacy remains circumscribed by the reality of severely limited resources at all levels of government. Given these constraints, this essay argues that rights at the center of homeless advocacy can serve an additional function. The values underlying core rights asserted on behalf of those without shelter can provide a functional tool for providers of services to homeless individuals and families. Deploying rights in this way would serve less to hone an adversarial relationship between clients and service providers, and more as a set of guiding principles for program design and implementation.
