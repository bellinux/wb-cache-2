Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{goes on the}} run from The Black Crusaders. Liz discovers that Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) fiancée, Phoebe (Emily Mortimer), is keeping some deceiving secrets.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Chicago {{metropolitan}} area and was raised there until the age of 13, at which point he moved to live with an uncle in North Carolina so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> a better life. He attended four different high schools, but eventually became one of the top ten high school basketball prospects in the class of 2011. He played for USA Basketball in the 2010 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship. Early in his senior year, he tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rendering him incapable of playing the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving into}} politics, {{he worked for}} the Insurance Company of North America from 1948 to 1955. Starting in 1955, he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> well just from the interest from his savings.|$|E

50|$|He {{recently}} {{turned down}} the position of scrum coach for the South African Springboks. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>live</b> with himself if he helped the Boks beat the Argentinian Pumas.|$|R
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, he asked his mother if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> abroad for a while. His mother wanted {{him to go to}} university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his {{education}} later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in Railway and Travel Monthly on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.|$|E
5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Wetherall {{was born}} in Sheffield. He was capped by England at schoolboy level, and in 1989, when he left school, he signed for Sheffield Wednesday under the {{management}} of Howard Wilkinson. Wetherall had attended Rotherham sixth form college where he achieved four A-levels at grade A, and chose to study for his BSc in chemistry at the University of Sheffield, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> {{at home with his}} parents and combine his education with playing for Sheffield Wednesday's reserve team. He graduated with a first-class honours degree in 1992, becoming the first Premier League player to achieve such a qualification. In 1990, he was part of a British squad which travelled to Italy for the world student five-a-side football championship, and represented Great Britain as they won the association football bronze medal at the 1991 World Student Games hosted in Sheffield.|$|E
60|$|Non. He did indeed, Mr Failer. But {{why should}} I suspect him? his {{carriage}} is fair, and his means great; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>live</b> after this rate, {{if it were}} not.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed in}} a desperate condition, but he got neither better nor worse. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> neither <b>live</b> nor die; he {{suffered}} horribly, and called loudly on Death {{to put an end}} to his pains.|$|R
60|$|If Cardinal Beaufort had any hand in this matter, it did him no good, for he {{died within}} six weeks; {{thinking}} {{it very hard}} and curious--at eighty years old!--that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>live</b> to be Pope.|$|R
5|$|After {{visiting the}} near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors {{go to the}} Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and {{retrieve}} the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over. With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) {{back in time and}} he sent the Fiends to the future to do so, creating a time loop by which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> forever. The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed the future to one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 2013, Duncan Smith said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> on £53 {{per week}} as Work and Pensions Secretary, after a {{benefits}} claimant told the BBC he had £53 per week after housing costs.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} the major as he drove away from Barchester that {{everybody}} was against him; and yet {{he was sure that}} he himself was right. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not give up Grace Crawley; and unless he were to do so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>live</b> at Cosby Lodge.|$|R
25|$|Zuo Ci studied atop Mount Tianzhu, practiced {{medicinal}} alchemy and nourished his vital essence by controlled {{breathing and}} Taoist sexual practices.

25|$|The {{same year}} (1931), Muriel {{told us that}} Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall....when he arrived, I think {{all the people in}} East London waited outside to see him.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, Graham {{was hospitalized}} due to liver problems. Afterward, he {{announced}} that he probably only had one year left to live without another liver transplant. Graham reserved a burial spot at the Green Acres cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona, next to Eddie Guerrero. On March 31, 2011, The Phoenix New Times reported that Graham's doctor, Hector Rodriguez-Luna, acknowledged that Graham's advanced fibrosis may be early cirrhosis and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> for two more years if he took Interferon—a drug to help slow his Hepatitis C—and stayed in shape. By 2012, Graham was diagnosed with third-stage liver disease and cirrhosis.|$|E

50|$|The lord of Linne wastes all his money, {{and sells}} his land to his steward to get more, and wastes that money as well. No one will lend him money, and he realizes his folly: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>lived</b> comfortably on his lands.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{an eagle}} with a King's heart in his breast {{is apt to}} be bold, and {{accordingly}} he instantly {{made up his mind}} to carry off the lovely damsel, feeling sure that having once seen her <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>live</b> without her.|$|R
500|$|However, {{the legend}} of his death is untrue. After twelve years of service at the monastery, Barry was brought by a monk to Bern, Switzerland so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> {{out the rest of}} his life. He {{died at the age of}} 14. His body passed into the hands of the Natural History Museum of Bern. [...] A special exhibit was held in his honor at the museum to commemorate his 200th Anniversary.|$|E
500|$|His {{original}} goal {{had been}} to become self-sufficient so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> autonomously. He taught himself survival skills such as tracking game, edible plant identification, organic farming, and [...] bow drilling and other primitive technologies. He used an old bicycle to get to town; a volunteer at the local library said he visited frequently and read classic works in their original languages. Other Lincoln residents said later that such a lifestyle was not unusual in the area.|$|E
500|$|While free on bail, Vicious smashed a {{beer mug}} {{in the face}} of Todd Smith, Patti Smith's brother, and was arrested again on an assault charge. On 9 December 1978 he was sent to Rikers Island jail, where he spent 55 days and {{underwent}} enforced cold-turkey detox. He was released on 1 February 1979; sometime after midnight, following a small party to celebrate his release, Vicious died of a heroin overdose, aged 21. Reflecting on the event, Lydon said, [...] "Poor Sid. The only way <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> up to what he wanted everyone to believe about him was to die. That was tragic, but more for Sid than anyone else. He really bought his public image." ...|$|E
50|$|From {{an early}} age Friedrich Franz {{suffered}} from asthma and severe breathing difficulties. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>live</b> {{in the north of}} Europe and lived instead on the shores of the Mediterranean, where the mild climate agreed with him.

500|$|Executive Producer Sara Colleton {{said it was}} {{difficult}} to kill off a long-standing character, but they felt [...] "this is where Dexter needed to be taken".

Michael C. Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> with an emotional connection to his wife and family. Hall also said of the ending, [...] "More than anything I felt for the audience. I think {{this is the kind of}} thing that's really going to tie people in knots." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1868, Ludwig's {{grandfather}} Ludwig I died, {{freeing the}} considerable sums {{that were previously}} spent on the abdicated king's appanage.
