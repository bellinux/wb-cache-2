5|$|Between 1996 and 2010 Buckton Castle was {{investigated}} by archaeologists, first the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford's Centre for Applied Archaeology {{as part of}} the Tameside Archaeology Survey.

5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are <b>heather</b> <b>and</b> gorse, shaped by the prevailing wind; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include <b>heather</b> <b>and</b> mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
5|$|At {{morning they}} find that three cairns have been built around their tent during the night, which unnerves them. As they continue, Heather realizes her map is missing and Mike later reveals he kicked it into a creek the {{previous}} day out of frustration, which prompts <b>Heather</b> <b>and</b> Josh to attack him in a rage. They realize they are now lost and decide simply to head south. They eventually reach a section where they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear sounds again, including the sound of children laughing among other strange noises. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.|$|E
5|$|The alpine meadows {{continue}} into the harsh alpine tundra zone, where poor soil, heavy snowfall, cold temperatures, {{and a very}} short growing season discourage all but the hardiest sedge grasses, <b>heathers,</b> <b>and</b> lichens.|$|R

5|$|In the 2012 film , the Pyramid Head, {{once more}} portrayed by Roberto Campanella, {{is both a}} monster and a guardian. More than once, it saves Sharon from the forces of Silent Hill. This is {{explained}} by its loyalty to Alessa: since Heather is the good half of Alessa's soul, it sees them as the same being and is thus bound to protect both from harm. Pyramid Head is also seen controlling the carousel where <b>Heather</b> <b>and</b> Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature.|$|E

5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, <b>heather</b> <b>and</b> small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E

5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. <b>Heather</b> <b>and</b> her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E
