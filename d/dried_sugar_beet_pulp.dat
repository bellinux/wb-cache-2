40|$|Growing {{demand for}} better quality and cheaper {{products}} {{put on the}} need to industry to balance between the two kinds of needs, which are the reduction of production costs and to ensure a high quality product. This is the case with <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> as a byproduct of sugar refining process. One of the possibilities to reduce energy consumption is savings in the process of thermal dehydration in the process of the conventional drying of pulp. Pulp drying is one third of total energy consumption in the sugar factory. Acidification of water extraction result in pulp that could be pressed better and in other hand in the juice with less non-sucrose compounds. Keeping the extraction process under certain conditions, directly affects {{on the quality of the}} extracted pulp and on effects of their further processing. This paper examines the impact of the extraction parameters of sugar from sugar beet and agents of acidification for water extraction (sulphurous acid, hydrogen peroxide) on the quality of <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> Extraction of sugar from sugar beet cossettes by hydrogen peroxide at pH 5. 5 to 8. 5 does not cause changes in mechanical properties of sugar beet cossettes and in water retention coefficient, but increases the brightness of <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> for about 5 - 7 units, which solubility in water does not depend on the applied concentration of extracting agents, but increases in dependence on the duration of the extraction. Sugar beet pulp extracted at pH 11. 0 has reduced strength, they are highly hydrated, and under the force they lose their shape, binding a larger amount of water thus reducing the effect of their pressing. The changes in microstructure were probably accompanied by segmenting the linear parts of macromolecules and are reflected in the increase of water retention capacity and increase the solubility of <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> for two to three times. Under the same conditions of extraction, sulphurous acid produces similar but relatively mild changes in the characteristics of extracted and <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> compared to conditions when hydrogen peroxide is used. From the point of the quality of the product of extraction, the most favorable results are obtained when the extraction is carried on at pH 5. 5 for a period of 1 h at 70 Â°C, using water for extraction with sulphourus acid with the addition of 5 % hydrogen peroxide. Under these conditions no significant degradation of sugar beet tissue is detected, do not change the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the extracted pulp. But there is an average increase of lightness of dried noodles for about 7 units, which represents a significant improvement of their quality, since there is difficult to sell on the market the <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> with increased colour...|$|E

Their recalcitrant structure prevents a broader use {{and asks for}} the development of sustainable techniques that can efficiently separate, recover and valorize the constituting components. In a cascading concept, residual streams of such processes can be further exploited in an attempt to valorize the largest possible fraction of the initial material. Three lignocellulosic substrates, namely <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp,</b> wheat bran and miscanthus straw, were upstream fractionated by steam explosion to extract the hemicellulose fraction.

Batch experiments have been conducted for the reference material (non-treated) and the solid fraction remaining after steam explosion, with and without the addition of an external mixed inoculum. Steam explosion residues contained less hemicellulose than the initial materials. The difference in the fermentation profile between steam explosion residues and non-treated substrates is dependent on the substrate.

Animals weighed 106 kg at start and 167 kg {{at the end of}} the experiment. Feeding was restricted (2. 5 kg DM/head, on average). The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the influence of high levels of beet pulp in the diet of fattening heavy pigs on some endocrine/metabolic traits, on the slaughter dressing percentage and on some parameters related to meat quality, composition and on the ham quality, after 14 months of seasoning. During the experimental period, jugular vein blood samples were collected from C and BP 30 -fed pigs and plasma was analysed for several metabolic traits. BP 30 diet initially increased the plasma glucose level and decreased free amino acids (P< 0. 05), but this difference disappeared {{at the end of the}} experimental period, when insulin level was decreased (P= 0. 06) by beet pulp administration. During the entire period, 30 % beet pulp diet increased total protein and albumin levels (P< 0. 001) and decreased urea (P< 0. 05) without affecting plasma leptin. At slaughter, pigs fed BP 30 diet were lighter (P< 0. 001) and with a lower dressing percentage (P< 0. 001) in comparison with the other two treatments. Pigs fed BP 30 diet also had lower ham and loin weights (P< 0. 05) (but similar ham and loin percentages) and higher liver weight (P< 0. 05), liver/carcass ratio (P< 0. 001), gastrointestinal- tract weight (P< 0. 001) and gastrointestinal-tract/carcass ratio (P< 0. 001). Pigs fed C diet had a higher dressing percentage in comparison with pigs fed BP 15 diet (P< 0. 01), but no other significant difference was found between pigs fed diets C and BP 15. At slaughter, liver samples were taken from C and BP 30 -fed pigs in order to evaluate the effect of the diet on liver composition. BP 30 diet increased dry liver weight (P< 0. 05) and liver fat content (P< 0. 01). The iodine value and the fatty acid composition of the backfat revealed no significant difference between pigs fed the control diet and those fed the high fibre diets. Finally, considering the economic importance of ham production, the characteristics of the seasoned hams were evaluated. No difference was observed on ham quality.

40|$|An in vivo {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} determine the effect of level of maize starch in the diet on digestion and site of digestion of organic matter, starch and neutral detergent fibre (NDF). In a repeated change-over design experiment, three cows fitted with a rumen cannula and T-piece cannulae in duodenum and ileum received a low-starch (12 % of ration dry matter) and a high-starch (33 % of ration dry matter) diet. Starch level was increased by exchanging <b>dried</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> by ground maize. After a 2 -week adaptation period, feed intake, rumen fermentation parameters (in vivo and in situ), intestinal flows, faecal excretion of organic matter, starch and NDF were estimated. When the high-starch diet was fed, dry matter intake was higher (19. 0 kg/day vs. 17. 8 kg/day), and total tract digestibility of organic matter, starch and NDF was lower when the low-starch diet was fed. Maize starch concentration had no significant effect on rumen pH and volatile fatty acid concentration nor on the site of digestion of organic matter and starch and rate of passage of ytterbium-labelled forage. On the high-starch diet, an extra 1. 3 kg of maize starch was supplied at the duodenum in relation to the low-starch diet, but only an extra 0. 3 kg of starch was digested in the small intestine. Digestion of NDF was only apparent in the rumen and was lower on the high-starch diet than on the low-starch diet, mainly attributed to the reduction in sugar beet pulp in the high-starch diet. It was concluded that without the correction for the reduction in NDF digestion in the rumen, the extra supply of glucogenic (glucose and propionic acid) and ketogenic nutrients (acetic and butyric acid) by supplemented starch will be overestimated.

The rpCLA supplement (12 g/d per ewe plus 4 g/d for each lamb older than 30 d) was mixed into the diet of 1 pen per sheep breed (3 pens/treatment) to provide an average of 0. 945 and 0. 915 g/d per ewe of the cis - 9, trans - 11 C 18 : 2 and trans - 10, cis - 12 C 18 : 2 conjugated linoleic acid isomers, respectively. The trial started at 38 Â± 23 d after parturition, and individual morning milk samples were collected on d 16, 23, 37, 44, and 59 of the trial. Milk samples were analyzed for composition, and duplicate samples were assessed for milk coagulation properties (MCP). A total of 180 CF measures for each sample (1 every 15 s) were recorded. Model parameters were the rennet coagulation time, the asymptotic potential CF, the CF instant rate constant, the syneresis instant rate constant, the maximum CF achieved within 45 min (CF max), and the time at achievement of CF max. The data were analyzed using a hierarchical model that considered the fixed effects of breed, diet, lamb birth, and initial days in milk, which were tested on individual ewe (random) variance; the fixed effect of sampling day, which was tested on the within-ewe sample (random) variance; and the fixed effect of instrument or cuvette position (only for MCP), which was tested on the residual (replicates within samples) variance. The local Alpine sheep breeds displayed similar milk compositions, traditional MCP, and CF modeling parameters. Supplementation with rpCLA triggered changes in milk composition and worsened MCP (e. g., delayed rennet coagulation time, slower CF instant rate constant, and a doubling of syneresis instant rate constant), but did not influence potential CF. Overall, our results indicate that rpCLA supplementation reduced the actual maximum CF (CF max) but did not modify the interval between rennet addition and CF max or time to CF max...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} experiment was to quantify {{the effects of the}} degree of mixing of <b>dry</b> molassed <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> (BP) with grass on silage conservation characteristics. Herbage from a timothy (Phleum pratense) sward was precision chopped and treated with a formic acid based additive (3 l/t grass). Units of 50 kg grass, without or with 2. 5 kg BP were randomly allocated among four replicates on each of seven treatments. The treatments were (1) no BP (NONE), (2) BP evenly mixed through the grass (EVEN), (3) BP evenly mixed through the lower 25 kg grass (LOWH), (4) BP evenly mixed through the lower 12. 5 kg grass (LOWQ), (5) 0. 625 kg BP mixed through the top 25 kg grass and 1. 875 kg SBP mixed through the lower 25 kg grass (25 / 75), (6) BP placed in 0. 5 kg layers beneath each 10 kg grass (LAYR), and (7) BP placed in a single layer under all of the grass (BOTM). Laboratory silos were filled and sealed, and stored at 15 Â°C for 163 days. Effluent was collected and weighed from each silo throughout the ensilage period. At opening, silage composition and aerobic stability measurements were made. Total outflow of effluent was reduced (P< 0. 001) by the addition of BP; LAYR had a greater effect (P< 0. 001) {{than any of the other}} treatments. Effluent dry matter (DM) concentration was highest (P< 0. 05) for BOTM and lowest (P< 0. 01) for NONE. All treatments underwent similar lactic-acid dominant fermentations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the air {{distribution}} system in a fluidised bed combustor {{is to provide a}} reasonably uniform spread of combustion air over the entire horizontal cross-sectional area of the bed. One of the simplest, and hence cheapest, forms of air distributor is the sparge pipe design, in which an array of horizontal pipes is fitted {{at the base of the}} bed. Combustion air is then supplied to one end of each pipe and is subsequently distributed to the bed through a series of downward facing holes. The paper describes the development of an improved sparge pipe system for a large coal fired fluidised bed producing hot combustion gases for <b>drying</b> of pressed <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> The air flow out of the holes varied by a factor of three along the length of the pipes with the existing system and in addition the overall flow and hence the thermal output of the bed was unduly restricted. Excessive erosion of the pipe walls near some of the holes was also a problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was undertaken of the flows along the pipes using FLUENT and the results validated by flow and pressure measurements on full scale laboratory models. The flow distribution was substantially improved and the overall flow rate increased by approximately 9 % by varying the hole diameters and pitches. Wear tests were also undertaken in near ambient temperature fluidised beds using multiple thin layers of different coloured paints on the outside of the pipes to assess the erosion patterns. These patterns were found to be similar to those observed on actual sparge pipes removed from the combustor at the end of an operating campaign. The rate of wear can be substantially reduced by reducing the angle of inclination of the downward facing holes in the pipes. Consequently an improved sparge pipe air distributor was designed for this large fluidised bed combustor. 1...|$|R

The bioplastic is manufactured from both <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> and a biodegradable polymer called polylactic acid, or PLA, using a twin screw extruder. PLA is a commercially available polymer derived from the sugars in corn, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> sugarcane, switchgrass and other plantsârenewable feedstocks. Extrusion is a cost-effective manufacturing process that is popularly used in large-scale production of food, plastics, and composite materials. Many biopolymers and their composite materials with petroleum-based polymers also can be extruded. The scientists showed that up to 50 percent <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> can be incorporated with PLA, and the resulting thermoplastic composites retain mechanical properties similar to those of polystyrene and polypropyleneâthe compounds used to make white, spongy food packages.

The treatments were control treatment: Corn-SBM basal diet + ZnO (phase 1 : 0. 05 %; phase 2; 0. 03 %) and four different levels of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> were supplemented in Corn-SBM basal diet (3, 6, 9 or 12 %). Two phase feeding programs (phase 1 : 1 â 2 Â weeks; phase 2 : 3 â 5 Â weeks) were used for 5 Â week of growth trial. Results In feeding trial, there were no significant differences in growth performance and incidence of diarrhea among treatments. The E. coli counts were not significantly different among dietary treatments but linear response was observed in Lactobacillus counts as <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> supplementation increased (PÂ <Â  0. 05). In addition, IGF- 1, IgA and IgG were not affected by dietary treatments. However, the BUN concentration was decreased when pigs were fed the treatments of diets with SBP compared to that of control treatment (PÂ <Â  0. 05). In nutrient digestibility, crude fiber and NDF digestibilities were improved as the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> increased (PÂ <Â  0. 05). However, digestibilities of crude ash, crude fat, crude fiber and nitrogen retention were not affected by dietary <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> levels. Conclusion This experiment demonstrated that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> can be supplemented in weaning pigsâ diet instead of ZnO to prevent postweaning diarrhea without any detrimental effect on growth performance...|$|R

40|$|Background Enzymatic {{degradation}} of plant biomass requires a complex mixture {{of many different}} enzymes. Like most fungi, thermophilic Myceliophthora species therefore have a large set of enzymes targeting different linkages in plant polysaccharides. The majority of these enzymes have not been functionally characterized, and their role in plant biomass degradation is unknown. The biotechnological challenge is to select the right set of enzymes to efficiently degrade a particular biomass. This study describes a strategy using sexual crossing and screening with the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora heterothallica to identify specific enzymes associated with improved <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> saccharification. Results Two genetically diverse M. heterothallica strains CBS 203. 75 and CBS 663. 74 were used to generate progenies with improved growth on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> One progeny, named SBP. F 1. 2. 11, had a different genetic pattern from the parental strains and had improved saccharification activity after the growth on 3 % <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> The improved SBP saccharification was not explained by altered activities of the major (hemi-) cellulases. Exo-proteome analysis of progeny and parental strains after 7 -day growth on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> showed that only 17 of the 133 secreted CAZy enzymes were more abundant in progeny SBP. F 1. 2. 11. Particularly one enzyme belonging to the carbohydrate esterase family 5 (CE 5) was more abundant in SBP. F 1. 2. 11. This CE 5 -CBM 1 enzyme, named as Axe 1, was phylogenetically related to acetyl xylan esterases. Biochemical characterization of Axe 1 confirmed de-acetylation activity with optimal activities at 75 â 85 Â°C and pH 5. 5 â 6. 0. Supplementing Axe 1 to CBS 203. 75 enzyme set improved release of xylose and glucose from <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> Conclusions This study identified beneficial enzymes for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> saccharification by selecting progeny with improved growth on this particular substrate. Saccharification of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> was improved by supplementing enzyme mixtures with a previously uncharacterized CE 5 -CBM 1 acetyl xylan esterase. This shows that sexual crossing and selection of M. heterothallica are the successful strategy to improve the composition of enzyme mixtures for efficient plant biomass degradation...|$|R
30|$|PG {{production}} by A. sojae was optimized applying crude plant compounds, such as wheat bran and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp,</b> as substrate in SSF. The present study demonstrated a {{great potential for}} cost-efficient pectinolytic enzyme {{production by}} Aspergillus sojae ATCC 20235. Production under optimized conditions in laboratory scale yielded high exo-PG activity and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> was identified as significant pectinase inducer substrate. Utilization of agricultural and agro-industrial by-products developed an attractive sustainable bioprocess for enzyme production.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, to {{demonstrate}} the importance of an inducer substrate for pectinase production, A. sojae ATCC 20235 was cultivated under conditions of the center point experiments on pure wheat bran and the obtained enzyme activity was about five times lower {{in comparison to the}} highest activity obtained with <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> as inducer substrate (data not shown). This result strongly favored utilization of pectin-rich inducer substrates, such as <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp,</b> in SSF process for pectinolytic enzyme production.|$|R
30|$|High PG {{activities}} were obtained at trial 4 and 18 using 35 % <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> as inducer substrate. Prediction for high PG activity values was obtained for inducer concentrations of 15 to 34 % and moisture levels of 157 to 165 % applied by 0.2 Â M HCl (FigureÂ  1). Highest PG activity of 613 U/g was predicted at an inducer concentration of 25 % and a moisture level of 160 %. Therefore, an experimental trial including the predicted optimal conditions for PG production, {{as well as}} a slightly higher inducer concentration of 30 % closer to the highest results of the optimization experiments were tested. The media were wetted at 160 % with 0.2 Â M HCl and cultivation was performed at 28 Â°C for 5 Â days. Under the predicted optimal conditions 634.0 [*]Â±[*] 44.6 U/g PG activity was obtained which is very close to the predicted result. This represented a very good correlation between the experimental data and the predicted value of the PG activity indicating a good fit of the model. Nevertheless, using 30 % of inducer substrate in the medium resulted in a slightly higher PG activity of 648 [*]Â±[*] 22.3 U/g. The first optimization step provided an optimized medium composition of wheat bran and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> in the ratio 70 : 30, wetted at 160 % with 0.2 Â M HCl. The combination of wheat bran and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> in optimized ratio is essential for a productive SSF process by A. sojae ATCC 20235. Extracting water soluble proteins and carbohydrates from media blanks containing pure wheat bran or the optimized ratio of wheat bran and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp,</b> yielded higher soluble protein content and higher total soluble carbohydrate concentration in the extract of the mixture with <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> (data not shown). This indicated that besides stimulation of pectinolytic enzyme production, the presence of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> as inducer substrate increased also the amount of soluble proteins and carbohydrates available for the fungal metabolism.|$|R
30|$|Maximal PG {{activity}} of 407.5 [*]Â±[*] 13.9 U/g was obtained {{at the center}} points of the experimental setup using <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> as inducer substrate, which was 1.4 times superior to activities obtained with molassed <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> SSF processes are known to overcome the effect of catabolite repression (Nandakumar et al. 1999, HÃ¶lker et al. 2004, Viniegra-GonzÃ¡lez and Favela-Torres 2006). However, {{the presence of an}} additional carbon source, like in the case of molasses, might have triggered other metabolic processes than stimulating exo-PG production.|$|R

Also, Sarhan (2005) showed that dressing percentages of rabbits fed pea vines hay or pea pods hulls supplemented diets were higher than the control group. However, in contrast, Amber et al.

The influence of six mild sulfuric acid or water pretreatments at different temperatures on the enzymatic degradability of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> was examined. An optimal pretreatment of 15 min at 140 Â°C in water greatly facilitates the subsequent enzymatic cellulose degradation. Enzymatic degradation of pectin requires an array of different enzyme activities. To this end, cell wall degrading enzymes of the filamentous fungus Chrysosporium lucknowense C 1 (C 1) were purified and characterized. Four arabinohydrolases from C 1 were characterized that released up to 80 % of the arabinose present in <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> arabinan as monomers. A combination of three arabinohydrolases also released unknown branched arabinose oligomers, which were purified and identified using NMR analysis. With the help of these complex arabinose oligomers the mode of action of four C 1 Î±-L-arabinohydrolases was determined to enable controlled and tailored degradation of arabinan. Complete degradation of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>pulp</b> also requires ferulic acid esterase activity.
