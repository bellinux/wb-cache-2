50|$|The {{origin of}} the term cloud {{can be found in}} the old English clud or clod, meaning a hill or a mass of rock. Around the {{beginning}} of the 13th century, it was extended as a metaphor to include rain clouds as masses of evaporated water in the sky because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and a cumulus <b>heap</b> <b>cloud.</b> Over time, the metaphoric term replaced the original old English weolcan to refer to clouds in general.|$|R

Death the divider, the unmerciful, That digs his pitfalls under Love and Youth, And covers Beauty up in the cold ground; Horrible Death! bringer of endless dark; Let him not see me! hide me in thy breast!'

60|$|Sometimes come pauses of calm, {{when the}} rapt bard, holding his heart back, Over his deep mind muses, as when o'er awe-stricken ocean Poises a <b>heapt</b> <b>cloud</b> luridly, {{ripening}} the gale and the thunder; Slow rolls onward the verse {{with a long}} swell heaving and swinging, Seeming to wait till, gradually wid'ning from far-off horizons, Piling the deeps up, heaping the glad-hearted surges before it, Gathers the thought as a strong wind darkening and cresting the tumult. Then every pause, every heave, each trough in the waves, has its meaning; Full-sailed, forth like a tall ship steadies the theme, and around it, Leaping beside it in glad strength, running in wild glee beyond it, Harmonies billow exulting and floating the soul where it lists them, Swaying the listener's fantasy hither and thither like drift-weed.|$|R

'All along the sky to the south-west' and of a red glare beneath these at night. Parts of Paris were still burning, and numbers of people were camped in the fields even at this distance watching over treasured heaps of salvaged loot.

60|$|I {{found myself}} looking out upon {{a scene that}} was {{altogether}} strange to me. The night was overcast, and through the flocculent grey of the <b>heaped</b> <b>clouds</b> there filtered a faint half-light of dawn. Just {{at the edge of}} the sky the cloud-canopy had a blood-red rim. Below, everything was dark and indistinct, dim hills in the distance, a vague mass of buildings running up into pinnacles, trees like spilt ink, and below the window a tracery of black bushes and pale grey paths. It was so unfamiliar that for the moment I thought myself still dreaming. I felt the toilet-table; it appeared to be made of some polished wood, and was rather elaborately furnished--there were little cut-glass bottles and a brush upon it. There was also a queer little object, horse-shoe shape it felt, with smooth, hard projections, lying in a saucer. I could find no matches nor candlestick.|$|R

50|$|Altocumulus Castellanus (ACCAS) {{is named}} for its tower-like {{projections}} that billow upwards {{from the base of}} the cloud. The base of the cloud can form as low as 2,000 metres (6,500 feet), or as high as 6,000 metres (20,000 feet), or 3296 Nm. They are very similar to cumulus congestus clouds, but at a higher level and with the <b>cloud</b> <b>heaps</b> joined at the base.|$|R
5000|$|Clouds in the troposphere, the {{atmospheric}} layer closest to Earth, are classified {{according to the}} height at which they are found, and their shape or appearance. [...] There are five forms based on physical structure and process of formation. Cirriform clouds are high, thin and wispy, and are seen most extensively along the leading edges of organized weather disturbances. Stratiform clouds are non-convective and appear as extensive sheet-like layers, ranging from thin to very thick with considerable vertical development. They are mostly the product of large-scale lifting of stable air. Unstable free-convective cumuliform clouds are formed mostly into localized <b>heaps.</b> Stratocumuliform <b>clouds</b> of limited convection show a mix of cumuliform and stratiform characteristics which appear {{in the form of}} rolls or ripples. Highly convective cumulonimbiform clouds have complex structures often including cirriform tops and stratocumuliform accessory clouds.|$|R

60|$|But {{it is not}} {{the outline}} only which is thus {{systematically}} false. The drawing of the solid form is worse still, for it is to be remembered that although clouds of course arrange themselves more or less into broad masses, with a light side and dark side, both their light and shade are invariably composed of a series of divided masses, each of which has in its outline as much variety and character as the great outline of the cloud; presenting, therefore, a thousand times repeated, all that I have described as characteristic of the general form. Nor are these multitudinous divisions a truth of slight importance in the character of sky, for they are dependent on, and illustrative of, a quality which is usually in a great degree overlooked,--the enormous retiring spaces of solid clouds. Between the illumined edge of a <b>heaped</b> <b>cloud,</b> and that part of its body which turns into shadow, there will generally be a clear distance of several miles, more or less of course, according to the general size of the cloud, but in such large masses as in Poussin and others of the old masters, occupy the fourth or fifth of the visible sky; the clear illumined breadth of vapor, from the edge to the shadow, involves at least a distance of five or six miles. We are little apt, in watching the changes of a mountainous range of cloud, to reflect that the masses of vapor which compose it, are huger and higher than any mountain range of the earth; and the distances between mass and mass are not yards of air traversed in an instant by the flying form, but valleys of changing atmosphere leagues over; that the slow motion of ascending curves, which we can scarcely trace, is a boiling energy of exulting vapor rushing into the heaven a thousand feet in a minute; and that the toppling angle whose sharp edge almost escapes notice in the multitudinous forms around it, is a nodding precipice of storms, 3000 feet from base to summit. It is not until we have actually compared the forms of the sky with the hill ranges of the earth, and seen the soaring Alp overtopped and buried in one surge of the sky, that we begin to conceive or appreciate the colossal scale of the phenomena of the latter. But of this {{there can be no doubt}} in the mind of any one accustomed to trace the forms of clouds among hill ranges--as it is there a demonstrable and evident fact, that the space of vapor visibly extended over an ordinarily cloudy sky, is not less, from the point nearest to the observer to the horizon, than twenty leagues; that the size of every mass of separate form, if it be at all largely divided, is to be expressed in terms of miles; and that every boiling heap of illuminated mist in the nearer sky, is an enormous mountain, fifteen or twenty thousand feet in height, six or seven miles over an illuminated surface, furrowed by a thousand colossal ravines, torn by local tempests into peaks and promontories, and changing its features with the majestic velocity of the volcano.|$|R
40|$|C louds are {{the most}} {{familiar}} aspect of our atmo-spheric environment. Schoolchildren around theworld learn {{the names of the}} different cloud types, names that were devised just over 200 yr ago by the amateur meteorologist, Luke Howard. Clouds take their names—cirrus, cumulus, and stratus—from Latin terms that describe the way clouds appear to someone standing on the ground. Cirrus clouds re-semble curls of hair, cumulus clouds look like piled-up <b>heaps,</b> and stratus <b>clouds</b> are spread out like blan-kets. While individual clouds may take innumerable forms, Howard’s system works because the shape of clouds is not completely random, but is instead gov-erned by some organizational principle. Because clouds also {{play a significant role in}} de-termining the radiation budget of the planet and serve as an important link in the hydrological cycle, they are studied using a variety of ground-based and sat-ellite techniques. Ground-based observers often use Howard’s cloud classification system, but clouds look very different when viewed from space. This is be-cause satellites are able to see, much more easily than a single observer on the ground, the range of scales at which clouds occur within the atmosphere. The scale of satellite observations falls within the mesoscale, defined by Orlanski (1975), to range from a few to a few thousand kilometers. Cloud organiza-tion at the mesoscale comes about because clouds act as tracers of vertical motion within the atmosphere, which is primarily due to convection. Depending on the strength of the vertical motion, convection can be deep or shallow. Deep convection extends through the depth of the troposphere and includes mesoscale con-vective systems and hurricanes. Shallow convection is much weaker and typically occurs within the low-est few kilometers of the atmosphere. While deep con-vective systems have been extensively studied due to their impact on human life and property, shallow con...|$|R
