40|$|This masters thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} to estimate the ethanol content in the fuel using ion currents. Flexible fuel cars can be run on gasoline-ethanol blends with an ethanol content from 0 to 85 percentage. It {{is important for the}} engine control system to have information about the fuel. In todays cars the measurements of the fuel blend are done by a sensor. If it is possible to do this with ion currents this can be used to detect if the sensor is broken, and then estimate the ethanol content until the sensor gets fixed. The benefit of using ion currents is that the signal is measured directly from the spark plug and therefore no extra hardware is needed. To be able to see how the ethanol ratio affects the ion currents, the dependencies of the operating point have been investigated. This has been done by a literature review and by measurements in a Saab 9 - 3. <b>Engine</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>load,</b> ignition timing, lambda and spark plugs effects on the ion currents are especially studied.

40|$|Academic Year : 2007 The {{objective}} of the research was to {{study the effects of}} intake valve timings (Miller cycle), injection timings and ignition timings on the efficiencies and emissions in a natural gas dedicated diesel engine. The engine was dedicated to natural gas usage by modifying piston, fuel system and ignition system. The engine was installed on a dynamometer and attached with various sensors and controllers. Intake valve timing, <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>load,</b> injection timing and ignition timing are main parameters. The results of engine performances and emissions are present in form of graphs. Miller Cycle without supercharging can increase brake thermal efficiency 1. 08 % and reduce brake specific fuel consumption 4. 58 %. The injection timing must be synchronous with valve timing, speed and load to control the performances, emissions and knock margin. Throughout these tested speeds, camshaft no. 1 is recommended to obtain high volumetric efficiency.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the performance and emissions characteristics of a turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine operated with natural gas as primary fuel, and diesel fuel as ignition source. In such dual fuel operation, much of the energy released comes from the combustion of the gaseous fuel, while only a small amount of diesel fuel provides ignition through timed cylinder injection. The effects of diesel-natural gas substitution ratios, engine speed, and load on the equivalent brake specific fuel consumption and gaseous emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides are examined for natural gas-diesel fuel operation and, afterward, compared with the original diesel operation. The results show that, over a wide range of operating conditions (<b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>load),</b> the dual fuel engine clearly shows the benefits of reduced NOX emissions. However, under low loads, the results indicate high CO and HC emissions and a higher BSFC when compared to those of the corresponding diesel engine...|$|E
5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{electrical}} ignition system also reduces the parasitic load on the engine, as the engine {{does not have to}} produce the necessary electricity to ignite the fuel. A significant amount of electricity is required by a spark ignition system, and as <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>loads</b> increase, the ignition system consumes proportionately more electricity, while simultaneously becoming less efficient. Higher cylinder pressure require a [...] "hotter" [...] spark with more current present to overcome the pressure and jump the gap from electrode to electrode in the spark plug. Increased <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>loads</b> also require the spark to occur more rapidly, resulting in additional electrical system loads and demands and more engine power required to meet them. As diesel <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>loads</b> increase, the higher cylinder temperatures after compression of the intake charge result in increased injection and ignition efficiency due to increased fuel atomization. Regardless of fuel system design, a mechanical diesel fuel injection system and rapid rise of fuel pressure and flow will result in injection nozzle opening pressure being reached more rapidly and also earlier in the 4-stroke cycle with more precise fuel delivery, more precise injection timing and built-in timing advance. Additional power is required to operate the injection system as <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>loads</b> increase, but the increase is more offset than in spark-ignition engines. Modern diesel engines with electronic injection systems use a large amount of electricity for injection, but the ability to precisely time injection and even perform multiple injection events per cycle result in generally increased fuel efficiency compared to mechanically-injected diesel engines of similar size and power.|$|R

40|$|Automotive {{industries}} made {{a paradigm}} shift in selection of viscometrics of engine lubricant, from higher to lower viscosity grade, for improving fuel economy of vehicles. Engine fuel consumption is influenced by friction between the various engine components. Engine friction power (FP) of a direct injection diesel engine is calculated from the measured value of in-cylinder pressure signals at various operating conditions. For predicting FP, {{as a function of}} <b>speed,</b> <b>load,</b> and lubricant viscosity, a full factorial design of experiments (DOE) was formulated and an empirical correlation was developed. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for analyzing the dominant parameters and their interactions, which influence engine friction power significantly. Predicted results of engine FP are in good agreement with measured values at all operating points. ANOVA and RSM analysis revealed that the significant parameters influencing <b>engine</b> FP are <b>speed,</b> <b>load,</b> viscosity, speed-load, and speed-viscosity. The effect of engine lubricant viscosity on friction power of a diesel engine was insignificant at low speed, whereas, at high speed, it played a vital role.

40|$|While the {{technique}} of auralization has been in use {{for quite some time}} in architectural acoustics, the application to environmental noise has been discovered only recently. With road traffic noise being the dominant noise source in most countries, particular interest lies in the synthesis of realistic pass-by sounds. This article describes an auralizator for pass-bys of accelerating passenger cars. The key element is a synthesizer that simulates the acoustical emission of different vehicles, driving on different surfaces, under different operating conditions. Audio signals for the emitted tire noise, as well as the propulsion noise are generated using spectral modeling synthesis, which gives complete control of the signal characteristics. The sound of propulsion is synthesized as a function of instantaneous <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>load</b> and emission angle, whereas the sound of tires is created in dependence of vehicle speed and emission angle. The sound propagation is simulated by applying a series of time-variant digital filters. To obtain the corresponding steering parameters of the synthesizer, controlled experiments were carried out. The tire noise parameters were determined from coast-by measurements of passenger cars with idling engines.

Using internal {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (IEGR) as an indirect control method, CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically, this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap a large quantity of exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next.

At high loads, the IEGR is much hotter. The CAI combustion is so strong that it may potentially be converted into detonation combustion. It is difficult to control the CAI combustion quality without external interferences. Engine coolant controls engine heat transfer performance.

We present, {{for the first}} time, how high spatiotemporal resolution data products allow transient features associated with internal combustion engines to be examined in detail during on-road driving. Such data is both useful to examine the circumstances leading to high emissions, and reveals the accurate position of urban air quality “hot spots” as deposited by the candidate vehicle, useful for source attribution and dispersion modelling. The fast response time of the analyzers also enabled accurate time-alignment with the vehicle’s Engine Control Unit (ECU) signals enabling correlation with transient air fuel ratio, <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>load,</b> and other engine parameters. This helps to explain {{the causes of the}} emissions “spikes” which conventional slow response analyzers would smooth out due to mixing within their sampling systems.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and laser-induced incandescence (LII) measurements of diesel particulate matter (PM) was performed. The results reveal {{the significance of}} the aggregate nature of diesel PM on interpretation of size and volume fraction measurements obtained with an SMPS, and the accuracy of primary particle size measurements by LII. Volume fraction calculations based on the mobility diameter measured by the SMPS substantially over-predict the space-filling volume fraction of the PM.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a spark ignition engine strongly depends on the phase of the combustion process with respect to piston motion, and hence on the spark advance; this fundamental parameter is actually controlled in open-loop by means of maps drawn up on the test bench and stored in the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Bi-fuel engines (e. g. running either on gasoline or on natural gas) require a double mapping process {{in order to obtain}} a spark timing map for each of the fuels. This map based open-loop control however does not assure to run the engine always with the best spark timing, which can be influenced by many factors, like ambient condition of pressure, temperature and humidity, fuel properties, engine wear. A feedback control instead can maintain the spark advance at its optimal value apart from operative and boundary conditions, so as to gain the best performance (or minimum fuel consumption). Such a control can be realized using as pilot variable a combustion phase indicator, i. e. a parameter which depends exclusively on the phase of the heat release process and assumes a fixed value for optimal spark timing. The purpose of the present work is to compare the behaviour of the most used combustion phase indicators using two different fuels one after the other (common gasoline and Compressed Natural Gas, CNG) on the same engine, in order to assess the influence of different heat release progress and to verify the possibility to feedback control the spark timing apart from the fuel used.
