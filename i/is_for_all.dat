This can include removing pollution after {{it has already been}} emitted into air, water, or soil. These measures are not implemented into law, but they do make it possible for certain parties to voluntarily become more efficient. The purpose of this policy <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of mitigation.|$|E

Like Matthew, Luke insists that salvation offered by Christ <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>all,</b> and not only for the Jews.|$|E

25|$|When {{the funeral}} service has ended, the mourners {{come forward to}} fill the grave. Symbolically, this gives the mourners closure as they observe, or {{participate}} in, the filling of the grave site. One custom <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the antithesis of death to life and that this use of the shovel is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.|$|E

25|$|Communion {{practices}} and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice {{is to have}} small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.|$|E
25|$|The name 'Peshitta' {{is derived}} from the Syriac mappaqtâ pšîṭtâ (ܡܦܩܬܐ ܦܫܝܛܬܐ), {{literally}} meaning 'simple version'. However, it is also possible to translate pšîṭtâ as 'common' (that <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> people), or 'straight', as well as the usual translation as 'simple'. Syriac is a dialect, or group of dialects, of Eastern Aramaic, originating around Edessa. It is written in the Syriac alphabet, and is transliterated into the Latin script in a number of ways, generating different spellings of the name: Peshitta, Peshittâ, Pshitta, Pšittâ, Pshitto, Fshitto. All of these are acceptable, but 'Peshitta' is the most conventional spelling in English.|$|E

25|$|The {{message is}} taken to the Samaritans, a people {{rejected}} by Jews, and to the Gentiles. Saul of Tarsus, one of the Jews who persecuted the Christians, is converted by a vision to become a follower of Christ (an event which Luke regards as so important that he relates it three times). Peter, directed {{by a series of}} visions, preaches to Cornelius the Centurion, a Gentile God-fearer, who becomes a follower of Christ. The Holy Spirit descends on Peter and Cornelius, thus confirming that the message of eternal life in Christ <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> mankind. The Gentile church is established in Antioch (north-western Syria, the third-largest city of the empire), and here Christ's followers are first called Christians.|$|E
25|$|As a result, widely varying principles, emphases, and {{definitions}} {{are used to}} determine local typologies among archaeologists working in the region. Attempts to identify and bridge the gaps made some headway at the Durham conference, though it was recognized that agreement on a single method of ceramic analysis or a single definition of a type may not be possible. The solution proposed by Dessel and Joffe <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> archaeologists {{in the field to}} provide more explicit descriptions of the objects that they study. The more information provided and shared between those in related sub-disciplines, {{the more likely it is}} that they will be able to identify and understand the commonalities in the different typological systems.|$|E

25|$|Assuming that an indeterministic {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena. This {{is not always the}} case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some hardware random number generators work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition), this in itself would mean that such traditional free will does not exist (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).|$|E
