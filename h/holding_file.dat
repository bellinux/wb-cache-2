5000|$|In Linux, {{and other}} Unix-like {{operating}} systems, the [...] directory <b>holds</b> <b>files</b> used in booting the operating system. The usage is standardized in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.|$|R
5000|$|App_Themes : Adds {{a folder}} that <b>holds</b> <b>files</b> related to themes, {{which is a}} new ASP.NET feature that helps ensure a {{consistent}} appearance throughout a Web site and {{makes it easier to}} change the Web site's appearance when necessary.|$|R
50|$|PVFS has {{an object}} based design, {{which is to}} say all PVFS server {{requests}} involved objects called dataspaces. A dataspace can be used to <b>hold</b> <b>file</b> data, file metadata, directory metadata, directory entries, or symbolic links. Every dataspace in a file system has a unique handle. Any client or server can look up which server holds the dataspace based on the handle. A dataspace has two components: a bytestream and a set of key/value pairs. The bytestream is an ordered sequence of bytes, typically used to <b>hold</b> <b>file</b> data, and the key/value pairs are typically used to hold metadata. The object-based design has become typical of many distributed file systems including Lustre, Panasas, and pNFS.|$|R
5000|$|Shortcuts: An {{update to}} Windows 95 and Windows NT 4 added a Quick Launch Bar that could <b>hold</b> <b>file</b> shortcuts, {{similar to the}} desktop. Windows 7 merged this area into the list of open windows by adding [...] "pinning" [...] and [...] "jump list" [...] features.|$|R
50|$|Freecad's own {{main file}} format is FreeCAD Standard file format (.FCStd). It is a {{standard}} zip <b>file</b> that <b>holds</b> <b>files</b> in a certain structure. Document.xml file has all geometric and parametric objects definitions. GuiDocument.xml then has visual representation details of objects. Other files include brep-files for objects and thumbnail of drawing.|$|R
50|$|In {{a cluster}} using PVFS nodes are {{designated}} as {{one or more}} of: client, data server, metadata server. Data servers <b>hold</b> <b>file</b> data, metadata servers hold metadata include stat-info, attributes, and datafile-handles as well as directory-entries. Clients run applications that utilize the file system by sending requests to the servers over the network.|$|R
5000|$|A {{directory}} is {{a logical}} section of a file system used to <b>hold</b> <b>files.</b> Directories may also contain other directories. The [...] command {{can be used to}} change into a subdirectory, move back into the parent directory, move {{all the way back to}} the root directory or move to any given directory.|$|R
50|$|On November 8, 2010, Ambac’s <b>holding</b> company <b>filed</b> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|Adam Coker {{was running}} unopposed for the Democratic {{nomination}} under the previous district map. After the new map was adopted, two candidates {{who had previously}} filed {{to run in the}} 13th district, like <b>Holding,</b> <b>filed</b> in the 2nd: John McNeil and Ron Sanyal. They were joined by three other candidates who had previously not filed for any seat.|$|R
50|$|If there isn't already enough {{contiguous}} {{free space}} to <b>hold</b> the <b>file,</b> use a copying collector to convert many {{little bits of}} free space into one contiguous free region big enough to <b>hold</b> the <b>file.</b> This takes {{a lot more time}} than breaking the file up into fragments and putting those fragments into the available free space.|$|R
5000|$|... exFAT is {{supported}} in OS X starting with version 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard). [...] Support in other operating systems is sparse since Microsoft has not published the specifications of the file system and implementing support for exFAT requires a license. exFAT {{is the only}} file system that is fully supported on both OS X and Windows that can <b>hold</b> <b>files</b> bigger than 4 GB.|$|R
50|$|Extended memory {{could also}} <b>hold</b> ASCII <b>files,</b> and a {{rudimentary}} text editor was added also.|$|R
50|$|PowerShell allows {{multiple}} named stacks to be used. Locations (directories) can {{be pushed}} onto/popped {{from the current}} stack or a named stack. Any stack can become the current (default) stack. Unlike most other shells, PowerShell's location concept allow location stacks to <b>hold</b> <b>file</b> system locations {{as well as other}} location types like e.g. Active Directory organizational units/groups, SQL Server databases/tables/objects, Internet Information Server applications/sites/virtual directories.|$|R

50|$|Trashy is {{a virtual}} trash can for the Linux and Unix command line, meant as a sane, {{portable}} intermediary for the rm command. Klaatu, in an episode of Hacker Public Radio, spoke {{of the dangers of}} teaching new Linux users about rm, a command that permanently and irreversibly deletes files, when most computer users are accustomed to having a virtual trash can or recycle bin that will <b>hold</b> <b>files</b> until the user specifically tells the system to delete the files.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{configuration}} for Linux desktop {{systems is}} to use two partitions: one <b>holding</b> a <b>file</b> system mounted on [...] "/" [...] (the root directory) and a swap partition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{instance}} subdirectory [...] "extensions" [...] can <b>hold</b> additional <b>files</b> {{which are}} needed for extended functionalities which can't (conveniently) be done with TAL; even totally new actions are possible.|$|R
5000|$|The System folder is the {{directory}} {{in the classic}} Mac OS that <b>holds</b> various <b>files</b> required for the system to operate, such as fonts, system extensions, control panels, and preferences.|$|R

5000|$|App_GlobalResources : <b>Holds</b> resx <b>files</b> with {{localized}} {{resources available}} to every page of the site. This is where the ASP.NET developer typically stores localized messages etc. used {{on more than one}} page.|$|R
25|$|The Finder is a file browser {{allowing}} {{quick access}} to {{all areas of the}} computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS. Quick Look is part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) and/or content. macOS makes use of a Dock, which <b>holds</b> <b>file</b> and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.|$|R
50|$|In computing, a {{temporary}} folder or temporary directory is a directory used to <b>hold</b> temporary <b>files.</b> Many operating systems and some software automatically delete {{the contents of}} this directory at bootup or at regular intervals.|$|R
40|$|NERSC's Global File system (NGF), {{accessible}} {{from all}} compute systems at NERSC, <b>holds</b> <b>files</b> and data from many scientific projects. A full backup of this file system to our High Performance Storage System (HPSS) is performed periodically. Disk storage usage by projects at NERSC has grown seven fold over a two year period, from ~;; 20 TB in June 2006 to ~;; 140 TB in June 2008. The latest full backup took about 13 days {{and more than}} 200 T 10 k tape cartridges (. 5 TB capacity). Petabyte file systems are becoming a reality {{in the next few}} years and the existing utilities are already strained in handling backup tasks...|$|R

50|$|Magnetic tape {{data storage}} {{has been used}} for over 50 years, but {{typically}} did not <b>hold</b> <b>file</b> metadata in a form easy to access or modify independent of the file content data. Often external databases were used to maintain file metadata (file names, timestamps, directory hierarchy) to hold this data but these external databases were generally not designed for interoperability and tapes might or might not contain an index of their content. In Unix-like systems, there is the tar interoperable standard, but this is not well-suited to allow modification of file metadata independent of modifying file content data - and does not maintain a central index of files nor provide a filesystem interface or characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Freenet's focus lies on {{free speech}} and anonymity. Because of that, Freenet acts {{differently}} at certain points that are (directly or indirectly) related to the anonymity part. Freenet attempts to protect the anonymity of both people inserting data into the network (uploading) and those retrieving data from the network (downloading). Unlike file sharing systems, {{there is no need}} for the uploader to remain on the network after uploading a file or group of files. Instead, during the upload process, the files are broken into chunks and stored on a variety of other computers on the network. When downloading, those chunks are found and reassembled. Every node on the Freenet network contributes storage space to <b>hold</b> <b>files</b> and bandwidth that it uses to route requests from its peers.|$|R

50|$|Equifax {{was founded}} in Atlanta, GA, as Retail Credit Company in 1899. The company grew quickly and by 1920 had offices {{throughout}} the US and Canada. By the 1960s, Retail Credit Company {{was one of the}} nation's largest credit bureaus, <b>holding</b> <b>files</b> on millions of American and Canadian citizens. Even though they still did credit reporting the majority of their business was making reports to insurance companies when people applied for new insurance policies including life, auto, fire and medical insurance. All of the major insurance companies used RCC to get information on health, habits, morals, use of vehicles and finances. They also investigated insurance claims and made employment reports when people were seeking new jobs. Most of the credit work was then being done by a subsidiary, Retailers Commercial Agency.|$|R
5000|$|Upon its introduction, DECtape was {{considered}} a major improvement over hand-loaded paper tapes, {{which could not be}} used to support swap files essential for practical timesharing. Early hard disk and drum drives were very expensive, limited in capacity, and notoriously unreliable, so the DECtape was a breakthrough in supporting the first timesharing systems on DEC computers. The legendary PDP-1 at MIT, where early computer hacker culture developed, adopted multiple DECtape drives to support a primitive software sharing community. The hard disk system (when it was working) {{was considered}} a [...] "temporary" [...] file storage device used for speed, not to be trusted to <b>hold</b> <b>files</b> for long-term storage. Computer users would keep their own personal work files on DECtapes, as well as software to be shared with others.|$|R
