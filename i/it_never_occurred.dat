Likewise, Anne Boleyn also {{publicly}} announced an intention of making a pilgrimage but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> Its wealth and prestige did not, however, prevent its being a disorderly house. The visitation of Bishop Nicke in 1514 revealed that the prior was leading a scandalous life and that, among many other things, he treated the canons with insolence and brutality; the canons themselves frequented taverns and were quarrelsome. The prior, William Lowth, was removed and by 1526 some decent order had been restored.|$|E

500|$|A failed early promotional attempt for {{the single}} took place after the Beatles' all-night {{recording}} session on 7–8 August 1968. With Apple Boutique having closed a week before, McCartney and his girlfriend, Francie Schwartz, painted Hey Jude/Revolution across its large, whitewashed shop windows. The words were mistaken for anti-Semitic graffiti (since Jude means [...] "Jew" [...] in German), leading to complaints from the local Jewish community, and the windows being smashed by passers-by. Discussing the episode in The Beatles Anthology, McCartney explained {{that he had been}} motivated by the location – [...] "Great opportunity. Baker Street, millions of buses going around…" [...] – and added: [...] "I had no idea it meant 'Jew', {{but if you look at}} footage of Nazi Germany, Juden Raus was written in whitewashed windows with a Star of David.

500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to me that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was sure that I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to me {{that it was going to}} become a trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E
