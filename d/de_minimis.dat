This treatise was much admired by his contemporaries and has recently been republished as an appendix to Mercator's 'Logarithmo-Technia' (1688).

2500|$|Substantial {{similarity}} is {{the term}} used by all courts to describe, once copying has been established, the threshold where that copying wrongfully appropriates the plaintiff's protected expression. It is found when similarity between the copyrightable elements of two works rises above the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> exception, reaching a threshold that is [...] "substantial" [...] both qualitatively and quantitatively. While actionable infringement {{is more likely to}} be found where greater levels of similarity exist, substantial similarity has also been found where the portion copied was small but constituted the [...] "heart" [...] of the work. In determining whether use is substantial, courts look not only at the proportion of duplication in comparison to the relative size of the works, but also to such considerations as the creativity of the copied material, its use in both works and its centrality to either. Only when a work rises to a level of [...] "substantial similarity" [...] does it infringe to the point of being legally actionable. As there is no clear line on how much duplication is necessary to reach [...] "substantial similarity", the question is determined on a case-by-case evaluation. A showing that features of the two works are not similar does not bar a finding of substantial similarity, if such similarity as does exist clears the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> threshold.|$|E
2500|$|The {{copyright}} {{status of}} visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous.

The <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> doctrine and the fair use exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement. The Second Circuit in October, 2006, held that artist Jeff Koons was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.|$|E
2500|$|On December 15, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court’s order denying {{a motion}} to {{overturn}} the Measure.

2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis. The aedeagus can be quite pronounced or <b>de</b> <b>minimis.</b> The base of the aedeagus may be the partially sclerotized phallotheca, also called the ...|$|E

What is most revealing of the frailty of today's opinion is that it relies upon nothing but that implication from a dictum, plus its own (quite irrefutable because entirely value laden) [...] "balancing" [...] of the competing demands {{of the individual and}} the State. With respect to the point at issue here, different times and different places — even highly liberal times and places — have struck that balance in different ways. Some Western democracies currently permit the Executive a period of detention without impartially adjudicated cause. In England, for example, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, 14(4), 5, permits suspects to be held without presentation and without charge for seven days. 12 Halsbury's Stat. 1294 (4th ed. 1989). It was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to put this matter beyond time, place and judicial predilection, incorporating the traditional common-law guarantees against unlawful arrest. The Court says not a word about these guarantees, and they are determinative. Gersteins approval of a [...] "brief period" [...] of delay to accomplish [...] "administrative steps incident to an arrest" [...] is already a questionable extension of the traditional formulation, though it probably has little practical effect and can perhaps be justified on <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> grounds. [...] To expand Gerstein, however, into an authorization for 48-hour detention related neither to the obtaining of a magistrate nor the administrative [...] "completion" [...] of the arrest seems to me utterly unjustified. Mr. McLaughlin was entitled to have a prompt impartial determination that there was reason to deprive him of his liberty — not according to a schedule that suits the State's convenience in piggybacking various proceedings, but as soon as his arrest was completed and the magistrate could be procured.” ...|$|E

[140] [Byron and Hobhouse sailed for Malta in the brig-of-war Spider on Tuesday, September 19, 1809 (Byron, in {{a letter}} to his mother, November 12, says September 21), and {{anchored}} off Patras on the night of Sunday, the 24th. On Tuesday, the 26th, they were under way at 12 noon, and on the evening of that day they saw the sun set over Mesalonghi. The next morning, September 27, they were in the channel between Ithaca and the mainland, with Ithaca, then in the hands of the French, to the left. [...] "We were close to it," [...] says Hobhouse, [...] "and saw a few shrubs on a brown heathy land, two little towns in the hills scattered among trees." [...] The travellers made [...] "but little progress this day," [...] and, apparently, having redoubled Cape St. Andreas, the southern extremity of Ithaca, they sailed (September 28) through the channel between Ithaca and Cephalonia, passed the hill of Ætos, on which stood the so-called [...] "Castle of Ulysses," [...] whence Penelope may have [...] "overlooked the wave," [...] and caught sight of [...] "the Lover's refuge" [...] in the distance. Towards the close of the same day they doubled Cape Ducato ("Leucadia's cape," [...] the scene of Sappho's leap), and, sailing under [...] "the ancient mount," [...] the site of the Temple of Apollo, anchored off Prevesa at seven in the evening.
