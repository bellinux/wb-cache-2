However, it remains unclear whether one type of dressing is {{better than any other}} type for preventing ulcer development during surgery. Therefore, we compared the effects of ceramide 2 -containing hydrocolloid dressing with film dressings in high-risk patients with regard to reducing the incidence of pressure ulcer development during surgery. Patients and methods: A prospective, randomized, open-label, clinical trial was conducted involving patients who were at a high risk of developing pressure ulcers at a Japanese hospital. The intervention group received ceramide 2 -containing hydrocolloid dressings (n= 66), and the control group received film dressings (n= 64). The primary end point was the incidence rate of pressure ulcer development in both groups; skin damage, such as blanchable erythema, skin discoloration, contact dermatitis, and stripped skin, was recorded as the secondary end point. The relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were assessed to compare the probability ratios of pressure ulcer development between the groups. Results: There were significantly fewer patients who developed pressure ulcers in the intervention group than in the control group (RR, 0. 37; 95 % CI, 0. 05 – 0. 99; P= 0. 04). In the post hoc subgroup analysis, the superiority of the intervention group was more marked when patients had a lower body mass index (P= 0. 02), lower albumin values (P= 0. 07), and operation time of 3 hours or more and less than 6 hours (P= 0. 03). There was no evidence of any statistically significant differences in the types of skin damage reported.

How Does Financial Liberalization Affect Economic Growth? assesses the effects of international financial liberalization and banking crises on investments and productivity in a sample of 93 countries (at its largest) observed between 1975 and 1999. I provide empirical evidence that financial liberalization spurs productivity growth and marginally affects capital accumulation. Banking crises depress both investments and TFP. Both levels and growth rates of productivity respond to financial liberalization and banking crises. The paper also presents evidence of conditional convergence in productivity across countries. However, the speed of convergence is unaffected by financial liberalization. These results are robust to a number of econometric specifications.

The {{purpose of this}} in vitro study {{was to assess the}} potential benefits of a new lubricant eye drop formulation containing the demulcents propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol and an HA/HPG dual polymer in models of the human corneal epithelium. Methods: Cultured human corneal epithelial or corneal-limbal epithelial cells were treated with the HA/HPG dual-polymer formulation or single-polymer formulations containing either HPG or HA. Desiccation protection by cell hydration and surface retention was assessed using cell viability assays. Sodium fluorescein perme-ability, transepithelial resistance, and cell viability assays were conducted using pretreated cells exposed to a surfactant/detergent insult to evaluate cell and cell barrier protection. Surface lubricity was assessed in tribo-logical experiments of pericardium–pericardium <b>friction.</b> Results: Hydration <b>protection</b> against desiccation and protection by surface retentionwere significantly greater with the HA/HPG formulation versus HPG or HA (P< 0. 001) alone and with HPG versus HA (P £ 0. 016).

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} is {{a highly}} efficacious water-based tribological system that is optimized to provide low <b>friction</b> and wear <b>protection</b> at both low and high loads (pressures) and sliding velocities that must last over a lifetime. Although many different lubrication mechanisms have been proposed, {{it is becoming increasingly}} apparent that the tribological performance of cartilage cannot be attributed to a single mechanism acting alone but on the synergistic action of multiple "modes" of lubrication that are adapted to provide optimum lubrication as the normal loads, shear stresses, and rates change. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid and widely thought to play a principal role in joint lubrication although this role remains unclear. HA is also known to complex readily with the glycoprotein lubricin (LUB) to form a cross-linked network that has also been shown to be critical to the wear prevention mechanism of joints. Friction experiments on porcine cartilage using the surface forces apparatus, and enzymatic digestion, reveal an "adaptive" role for an HA-LUB complex whereby, under compression, nominally free HA diffusing out of the cartilage becomes mechanically, i. e., physically, trapped at the interface by the increasingly constricted collagen pore network. The mechanically trapped HA-LUB complex now acts as an effective (chemically bound) "boundary lubricant"-reducing the friction force slightly but, more importantly, eliminating wear damage to the rubbing/shearing surfaces. This paper focuses on the contribution of HA in cartilage lubrication; however, the system as a whole requires both HA and LUB to function optimally under all conditions...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{an investigation by}} the Tribology Section of Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) into the use of near-frictionless carbon (NFC) coatings for spark-ignited, direct-injected (SIDI) engine fuel systems. Direct injection is being pursued in order to improve fuel efficiency and enhance control over, and flexibility of, spark-ignited engines. SIDI technology is being investigated by the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) as one route towards meeting both efficiency goals and more stringent emissions standards. Friction and wear of fuel injector and pump parts were identified as issues impeding adoption of SIDI by the OTT workshop on ''Research Needs Related to CIDI and SIDI Fuel Systems'' and the resulting report, Research Needs Related to Fuel Injection Systems in CIDI and SIDI Engines. The following conclusions were reached: (1) Argonne's NFC coatings consistently reduced friction and wear in existing and reformulated gasolines. (2) Compared to three commercial DLC coatings, NFC provided the best <b>friction</b> reduction and <b>protection</b> from wear in gasoline and alternative fuels. (3) NFC was successfully deposited on production fuel injectors. (4) Customized wear tests were performed to simulate the operating environment of fuel injectors. (5) Industry standard lubricity test results were consistent with customized wear tests in showing the friction and wear reduction of NFC and the lubricity of fuels. (6) Failure of NFC coatings by tensile crack opening or spallation did not occur, and issues with adhesion to steel substrates were eliminated.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to develop hybrid PVD {{technology}} of deposition wear resistant, multilayer coatings onto diffusion-hardened Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy. Titanium and its alloys are desirable materials in modern constructions and vehicles. They have a high specific strength and very good corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. On the other hand, they have a low load-bearing capacity and poor tribological properties, as, for example, high friction coefficient, low resistance to adhesive and abrasive wear and tendency to galling. Development of multiplex coatings depositions techniques is vital for expanding of areas of titanium alloys usage. Design/methodology/approach: In the present work a new approach to coatings deposition onto diffusion hardened in glow discharge plasma (in Ar+O 2 atmosphere) Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy was proposed by means of a hybrid PVD method including three coatings deposition methods: Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (RMS), Filtered Cathodic Arc Evaporation (FCAE) and Pulsed Cathodic Arc Deposition (PCAD). The main aim of the work was to develop multilayer coatings combined of sublayers of titanium or chromium carbonitrides or of pure, hard carbon ones. Findings: It was concluded from the results of investigations that not every proposed multilayer structure ensure good frictional properties of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy even when the coating posses very high hardness. The lowest value of wear and friction coefficient was determined for multilayer coating with (TiC/C) x 3 structure. Research limitations/implications: Further research is necessary for {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of friction and wear as well as the origin of superhardness of particular multilayers.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the performance of an industrial low-speed high-torque hydrostatic drive system. This type of hydrostatic transmission is commonly used in continuous operation {{in a wide range of}} heavy-duty drive applications. In many applications the transmissions have to compete with e. g. electromechanical drives, such as DC or AC electric motors combined with gearboxes. In such situations, energy efficiency is a key selection criterion in that even a small increase in the efficiency of high power industrial drives would give substantial savings. Apart from efficiency, lifetime and reliability requirements are important parameters for industrial drive systems, as unplanned stops in industrial working processes can be very costly. The work presented in this thesis is primarily focused on analysing the efficiency behaviour in the transmission, both on the system level and on the component level. Attention has also been paid to lifetime issues, with special emphasis on wear occurring in a sliding contact in a radial piston hydraulic motor. In Paper A the distribution of power losses in a variable axial piston swash plate pump is investigated. The pump under study is commonly used in stationary industrial hydrostatic transmission systems. The churning losses in the pump have been estimated experimentally by measurements in a test rig. The leakage flow and the power losses in the contacts between the piston and the cylinder and between the slipper and the swash plate respectively were simulated with the help of the simulation tool CASPAR. For the pump studied, the churning losses are significant under the operating conditions typically occurring in industrial drive applications. The simulation results indicate that the leakage to the pump casing mainly originates from the gaps between the pistons and their respective cylinders and between the slippers and swash plate. The aim of Paper B is to study two sliding contacts inside a radial piston hydraulic motor and investigate their influence on the torque and power losses. Moreover, it is investigated whether and when a change in the lubrication regime can be expected in these contacts. This is accomplished by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies, with a special focus on two lubricated sliding contacts: the distributor valve contact and the piston/cam roller contact. The theoretical analysis of the contacts indicates, among other things, that the piston/cam roller contact can enter the mixed lubrication regime at low motor speeds. At low running speeds, an increased wear rate has been noted in the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in a radial piston hydraulic motor. Paper C describes a comparative investigation into different hydraulic fluids' friction properties and wear protection abilities. To simulate the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in the hydraulic motor, tests were performed in a reciprocating test rig where the contact geometry was of the cylinder-plate type. In the model test a synthetic ester aimed at meeting the conditions in water turbine applications received a top ranking regarding both <b>friction</b> and wear <b>protection</b> properties.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis has two key motivations. The {{first is}} to {{undertake}} a comprehensive examination of the market characteristics and institutional features across nine ‘advanced emerging’ stock markets: Brazil, Czech Republic, Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Taiwan and Turkey. After identifying that these markets comprise characteristics that may restrict rational investors from arbitraging away identifiable mispricing, the second purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} level of market efficiency and the relation between mispricing and limits to arbitrage. Given limitations with the depth and quality of accounting information across emerging markets, the issue of market efficiency is examined by testing whether returns and volatility-based anomalies that have been identified in developed markets are also evidenced across this sample. More specifically, this thesis examines the prevalence of seasonality in both returns and volatility of returns with respect to five calendar anomalies that have been identified in the context of developed markets. In addition, this thesis examines whether there is evidence of a negative relationship between maximum one-day returns and subsequent monthly returns (referred to as the MAX effect) in advanced emerging markets. Despite an extensive number of studies documenting evidence of seasonal anomalies and the MAX effect in developed markets, which indicates that these markets are less than perfectly efficient, this thesis provides the first comprehensive examination of this issue across advanced emerging markets. This thesis also expands the existing literature by examining the potential sources of such anomalous returns and the existence of mispricing in these markets by testing whether the returns can be explained by risk-based pricing models or time series variation in limits to arbitrage. The results of this thesis provide evidence of the existence of strong anomalous returns, which indicates a high level of mispricing across advanced emerging stock markets. Specifically, this thesis finds that, on average, returns are higher during the month of December, the 44 th week of the year, Fridays and pre- and post-holidays; and these anomalous returns are not explained by seasonal variation in volatility. Moreover, this thesis reports evidence of a strong MAX effect that is persistent after controlling for size, book to market ratio, market beta, momentum, short-term return reversals and liquidity. The magnitude of the mispricing associated with the MAX effect appears to be higher in advanced emerging markets compared with developed markets. The zero-investment returns generated by the MAX effect are shown to co-vary with time series variation in limits to arbitrage. Taken as a whole, these results suggest a lower level of efficiency across advanced emerging markets that {{can be explained by the}} market characteristics and institutional features that restrict the ability of rational investors to arbitrage away mispricing. The results reported in this thesis can therefore allow investors to better understand the characteristics of risk and returns in advanced emerging markets in order to develop improved asset pricing models in the context of these markets. In addition, the demonstrable link between asset pricing anomalies and limits to arbitrage may provide policy makers with a framework for improving the efficiency of their stock markets by mitigating market <b>frictions</b> through investor <b>protection</b> measures, and relaxation of capital controls and short-selling restrictions, among others...|$|R
