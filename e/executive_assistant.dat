40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 94) Abstract WORKING ABOVE AND BEYOND: A LATE CAREER CONTINUATION PROGRAM FOR FEMALE, LONG-TERM EXECUTIVE ASSISTANTS By Wendi Tetsuko Meckler Master of Science in Counseling, Career Counseling In today???s cost-cutting, technology-driven economy, late career <b>Executive</b> <b>Assistants</b> face {{challenges and}} {{issues in their}} career development process as more companies decrease the number of support worker roles. These issues can include: low self-knowledge, neglecting to prioritize their own future as a priority, high occupational stress, and not enough alternative planning for their own futures. As a result, these late career <b>Executive</b> <b>Assistants</b> with no college degree could suffer from financial insecurity, crises of identity and job loss; this can be especially dire to a population without a plan or identified supports as they approach traditional retirement age. This proposed career continuation workshop series is aimed at identifying and meeting {{the specific needs of}} late career <b>Executive</b> <b>Assistants</b> with selected, targeted career interventions, such as increasing self-knowledge, understanding work transitions, and preretirement planning. Theoretical perspectives are outlined within this project, in addition to support materials necessary to prepare and implement this workshop series...|$|R

Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain the illusion that they were two separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees. Initially appearing as a supporting character, Valerie helps Ivy Winthrop in her attempts to break up Fox Crane and Kay Bennett and supports Chad during their job. She gains more prominence when Eve catches her having sex with Julian; they engage in a catfight with Eve accusing Valerie of using sex to climb the corporate ladder. During this time, Whitney Russell suspects that Valerie is {{having an affair with}} Chad. Vincent is first seen outside of his split-personality when he introduces himself as a tabloid reporter at Chad and Whitney's wedding on December 26, 2006.

5|$|Unbeknownst to Whitney, Chad {{previously}} began {{a sexual}} relationship with the tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson at an unspecified time around the Vendetta plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is intersex, and that Valerie Davis, the <b>executive</b> <b>assistant</b> to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald and Noah Bennett, Chad repeatedly insists that he is not gay, and that his relationship with Vincent is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex {{in the back of a}} gay bar; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from Vincent. The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and Ethan Winthrop reunite, but that possibility is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.|$|E
