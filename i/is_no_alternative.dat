5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{only true}} {{way to test}} GNSS {{receivers}} (commonly known as Sat-Nav's in the commercial world) is by using an RF Constellation Simulator. A receiver that may for example be used on an aircraft, can be tested under dynamic conditions without {{the need to take}} it on a real flight. The test conditions can be repeated exactly, and there is full control over all the test parameters. this is not possible in the 'real-world' using the actual signals. For testing receivers that will use the new Galileo (satellite navigation) there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative,</b> as the real signals do not yet exist.|$|E

Intracranial pressure may be increased due to medications such as high-dose vitamin A derivatives (e.g. isotretinoin for acne), long-term tetracycline antibiotics (for a variety of skin conditions) and hormonal contraceptives. There are numerous other diseases, mostly rare conditions, {{that may lead to}} intracranial hypertension. If there is an underlying cause, the condition is termed [...] "secondary intracranial hypertension". Common causes of secondary intracranial hypertension include obstructive sleep apnea (a sleep-related breathing disorder), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic kidney disease, and Behçet's disease.|$|E

[...] On August 2, Tōgō wrote to Satō: [...] "it should not be difficult for you to realize that... our time to proceed with arrangements of ending the war before the enemy lands on the Japanese mainland is limited, on the other hand it is difficult to decide on concrete peace conditions here at home all at once." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the cost of}} a new procurement program, industry officials stated that to merely extend the operating life of the current fleet is a risky choice because it is both less secure and costly to maintain. Lawmakers {{from both sides of the}} aisle, including Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Representative Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) have been outspoken critics of the Pentagon in the matter—Bartlett recently claiming that [...] "they had this conversation outside the partnership and we regret that." [...] Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Lexington Institute, stated [...] "I do not believe that the story of VH-71 is over...

500|$|In {{his role}} as {{professor}} for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book Unweaving the Rainbow considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do [...] "myths" [...] and [...] "pseudoscience". For John Diamond's posthumously published Snake Oil, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes. Dawkins states that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work." [...] In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film The Enemies of Reason, Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by [...] "an epidemic of superstitious thinking".|$|E

2500|$|UNICEF has {{a policy}} preferring orphanages {{only be used}} as {{temporary}} accommodation for children when there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative.</b> UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large-scale, permanent orphanages for children, preferring instead to find children places in their (extended) families and communities, wherever possible. [...] This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts {{as a solution to}} child care problems in developing countries; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents.|$|E

2500|$|She is {{a staunch}} critic of Iran {{and has written}} and spoken {{frequently}} about the threat she perceives it to be, particularly {{if it were to}} obtain nuclear weapons. The Iranian regime, she writes, [...] "has seen itself at war with the west ever since it came to power in 1979, and which has been involved in arguably every major terrorist atrocity against it". In her view, Iran's leaders are [...] "religious fanatics" [...] who are [...] "impervious to reason" [...] and who [...] "would be happy" [...] to bring about an apocalyptic end of days. Thus, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> to force {{if it is to be}} stopped." [...] She has drawn criticism for her hard-line approach from various commentators.|$|E
2500|$|The Trident nuclear missile {{system is}} based at Coulport weapons depot and naval base of Faslane in the Firth of Clyde area. While the SNP objects to having nuclear weapons on Scottish territory, British {{military}} leaders have said that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> site for the missiles; in April 2014, several British military leaders co-signed a letter stating that forcing Trident to leave Scottish waters would place the UK nuclear deterrent in jeopardy. Nowhere to Go, a report by Scottish CND, concluded that the removal of Trident from Scotland would force unilateral nuclear disarmament by the United Kingdom, as the weapons have no viable alternative base. A report by the Royal United Services Institute said that relocating Trident would be [...] "very difficult, but not impossible" [...] and estimated {{that it would take}} about 10 years and create an additional cost of around £3 billion.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 June 2008, fifteen EU ambassadors {{headed by}} EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Javier Solana {{completed}} a two-day visit to Abkhazia.

Their replacement {{with any other}} troops will not be discussed with anyone... If Georgia wants them out of its territory, we will do everything for them to remain in Abkhazia." [...] Solana said that the conflict could not be resolved without Russia and Russia was {{a key player in}} the peace process. Giorgi Baramidze, the Georgian deputy prime minister and minister on European and Euro-Atlantic integration said: [...] "Georgia is ready to sign a ceasefire agreement with Abkhazia if it is guaranteed by the European Union." [...] Baramidze said that earlier agreements without an effective guarantor had resulted in the loss of Gagra, Sukhumi and the main part of Abkhazia for Georgia. He added, [...] "We are ready for constructive dialogue both with the Russians and the separatists. We want to carry out our peace plan, which primarily entails the introduction of neutral and genuinely peace-oriented European and international peacekeepers, and decent, safe and unconditional return of refugees." ...|$|E
