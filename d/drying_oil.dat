25|$|A {{traditional}} wooden bat has {{its surface}} oiled with raw linseed oil before play, and regularly during the season. This has a protective {{effect on the}} wood, and also makes it less sensitive to humidity changes in the atmosphere, which could cause warping or splitting. Another important factor is that it increases the surface friction of the ball to bat surface, giving better control of the shot. A worn surface can be noticed by the player, indicating that re-oiling is needed. Raw linseed oil is used, rather than boiled linseed oil, as {{this is not a}} <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> to the same degree, and so the surface remains tacky.|$|E

5000|$|By definition, <b>drying</b> <b>oils,</b> such as linseed and tung oil, are {{not true}} {{varnishes}} though often in modern terms they accomplish the same thing. <b>Drying</b> <b>oils</b> cure through an exothermic reaction between the polyunsaturated portion of the oil and oxygen from the air. Originally, the term [...] "varnish" [...] referred to finishes that were made entirely of resin dissolved in suitable solvents, either ethanol (alcohol) or turpentine. The advantage to finishes in previous centuries was that resin varnishes had a very rapid cure rate compared to oils; in most cases they are cured practically {{as soon as the}} solvent has fully evaporated. By contrast, untreated or [...] "raw" [...] oils may take weeks or months to cure, depending on ambient temperature and other environmental factors. In modern terms, [...] "boiled" [...] or partially polymerized <b>drying</b> <b>oils</b> with added siccatives or dryers (chemical catalysts) have cure times of less than 24 hours. However, certain non-toxic by-products of the curing process are emitted from the oil film even after it is dry to the touch and over a considerable period of time. It has long been a tradition to combine <b>drying</b> <b>oils</b> with resins to obtain favourable features of both substances.|$|R

On {{the white}} surface thus prepared, the colors, ground finely with linseed oil, were applied, {{according}} to the advice of Theophilus, in not less than three successive coats, and finally protected with amber or sandarac varnish: each coat of color being carefully dried by the aid of heat or in the sun before a second was applied, and the entire work before varnishing. The practice of carefully drying each coat was continued in the best periods of art, but the necessity {{of exposure to the}} sun intimated by Theophilus appears to have arisen only from his careless preparation of the linseed oil, and ignorance of a proper drying medium. Consequent on this necessity is the restriction in Theophilus, St. Audemar, and in the British Museum MS., of oil-painting to wooden surfaces, because movable panels could be dried in the sun; while, for walls, the colors are to be mixed with water, wine, gum, or the usual tempera vehicles, egg and fig-tree juice; white lead and verdigris, themselves dryers, being the only pigments which could be mixed with oil for walls. But the MS. of Eraclius and the records of our English cathedrals imply no such absolute restriction. They mention the employment of oil for the painting or varnishing of columns and interior walls, and in quantity very remarkable. Among the entries relating to St. Stephen's chapel, occur--"For 19 flagons of painter's oil, at 3s. 4d. the flagon, 43s. 4d." [...] (It might be as well, in the next edition, to correct the copyist's reverse of the position of the X and L, lest it should be thought that the principles of the science of arithmetic have been progressive, {{as well as those of}} art.) And presently afterwards, in May of the same year, [...] "to John de Hennay, for seventy flagons and a half of painter's oil for the painting of the same chapel, at 20d. the flagon, 117s. 6d." [...] The expression [...] "painter's oil" [...] seems to imply more careful preparation than that directed by Theophilus, probably purification from its mucilage in the sun; but artificial heat was certainly employed to assist the drying, and after reading of flagons supplied by the score, we can hardly be surprised at finding charcoal furnished by the cartload--see an entry relating to the Painted Chamber. In one MS. of Eraclius, however, a distinct description of a <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> in the modern sense, occurs, white lead and lime being added, and the oil thickened by exposure to the sun, as was the universal practice in Italy.|$|E
