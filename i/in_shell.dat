5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> middens are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.|$|E

Southard published several books, including Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems with nearly 1,000 case histories.

5|$|The {{shell of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and the aperture is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
5|$|The suburb was {{originally}} three low lying islands that were covered <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> grit and saltbush {{and surrounded by}} mangrove and samphire swamps. Fishermen had established huts on the islands by 1865 and by 1873 there were 13 huts and a boathouse recorded when the area was surveyed by Thomas Evans. By the 1890s people were visiting the islands attracted to the supposed curative properties of the mangrove mud, using the beach for bathing and fishing for crabs.|$|E

5|$|The St Kilda Hotel, {{built out}} of {{limestone}} from east {{of what is now}} Elizabeth, opened in 1898 with Matthias Lucas as the first publican and remains the suburb's only hotel. A school opened in October 1902, where the tram museum is now sited, admitting students in November of the same year. The school was closed from 1917 to 1924 and finally closed permanently in 1949 with students moving to Salisbury North Primary School and the building eventually being used at Virginia Primary School. In 1924 a telegraph office opened <b>in</b> <b>Shell</b> Street and, due to the suburb of St Kilda in Melbourne having the same name, the post office service requested that the name be changed. Over some local objections the name was changed to Moilong (a Kaurna word for Where the tide comes in) but this was reversed after local protests. Moilong Telegraph Office opened in 1924, was upgraded to a post office in 1945, renamed Saint Kilda in 1965 and closed in 1974.|$|E

After being discharged in 1946, he too studied at Wheaton College, but quit after a year and joined the Mission Aviation Fellowship in 1948. He and his wife Marj traveled to Ecuador by the end of the year, and they settled at MAF headquarters <b>in</b> <b>Shell</b> Mera. Shortly after his arrival, Saint began transporting supplies and equipment to missionaries spread throughout the jungle. This work ultimately led to his meeting the other four missionaries, who he joined in Operation Auca.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before making}} landfall, the {{hurricane}} caused extensive damage in Louisiana, {{due in part}} to the hurricane's slow speed and close proximity to the state coast. Winds as high as 60mph (100km/h) brushed the coastline, causing extensive damage. Storm surge pushed coastal waters to near-record heights, inundating low-lying areas. Near Morgan City, Louisiana, 19people went missing after going on a fishing trip; they were later found marooned at Atchafalaya Basin. The schooner J.W. Clise was abandoned during the storm 135mi (215km) south of the Mississippi River Delta, though its crew was also later rescued. Storm surge peaked at 6.4ft (1.95m) above-average in western portions of Lake Pontchartrain. A bridge crossing Thunder Bayou, which extended west of the lake, was washed out by the waves. Similarly, a station at Calcasieu Pass reported a storm surge 4.8ft (1.46m) high. Conservation officials feared the disturbance would disrupt the seafood and muskrat production. After the storm, it was estimated 75,000muskrats were killed by the storm's effects. Offshore, Grand Isle was inundated by the strong waves. Around Houma, sugar cane crops were damaged. The hurricane was the strongest to impact Cameron since the tenth hurricane of the 1886 Atlantic hurricane season; strong gusts peaked at 70mph (115km/h), disrupting communication lines, thus isolating the city from other locations in the state. The high tides inundated town streets under 2ft (0.6m). Other areas extending from western Louisiana to Mobile, Alabama reported communication disruptions. In New Orleans, strong winds uprooted signboards and blew debris across the city streets. Several houses <b>in</b> <b>Shell</b> Beach and Delacroix Island were leveled by strong winds.|$|E

5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

50|$|The {{bombardment}} of the Hitachi area {{took place on}} the night of 17/18 July. Rain and fog made locating the targets difficult and prevented spotting aircraft from flying, but several carrier aircraft flew protective patrols over the bombardment force. The Allied warships opened fire at 11:10p.m., and aimed at their targets using radar and LORAN. The attackers targeted nine industrial facilities, and King George V was assigned similar targets to those engaged by the American battleships. By the time the bombardment ceased at about 1:10a.m., the American battleships had fired 1,238 16 <b>in</b> <b>shells,</b> and the British battleship 267 14 <b>in</b> <b>shells.</b> The two light cruisers also fired 292 6 <b>in</b> <b>shells</b> at radar and electronics installations south of Hitachi.

25|$|On April 29, 2009, Raiden (who {{operates}} briefly {{under the}} code name Snake) is tasked under a reformed FOXHOUND.

All members of SEAL Team 10 are killed by Dead Cell members Vamp and Fortune, and the Big Shell is patrolled by the surviving Russian mercenaries from the Tanker chapter, led now by Olga, who is unaware {{of the extent of}} Ocelot's betrayal, and believes Snake was responsible for her father's murder. The remaining members of the SEAL assault team, Iroquois Pliskin and Peter Stillman join Raiden to disable explosives planted on the Shell by Stillman's former pupil, Fatman, now a terrorist. Stillman is killed by Fatman's booby trap <b>in</b> <b>Shell</b> 2, though he manages to warn Raiden in time, who successfully disables the respective bomb <b>in</b> <b>Shell</b> 1, preventing the sinking of the facility.
