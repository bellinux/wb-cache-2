But the Second Circuit said the cases on which PepsiCo relied were price-fixing hub-and-spoke cases, such as Interstate Circuit and Parke, Davis, which were based on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> illegal conduct. But vertical exclusive dealing agreements are not <b>per</b> <b>se</b> illegal, so that hub-and-spoke conspiracies to establish exclusive dealing are mot <b>per</b> <b>se</b> illegal.

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court has {{employed}} the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> standard for illegality of tying arrangements under antitrust laws for some sixty years. The tying arrangement, once reviled by the House of Representatives as 2 ̆ 2 {{one of the}} greatest agencies and instrumentalities of monopoly ever devised by man, 2 ̆ 2 is now understood by many to have potentially redeeming, as well as condemning, qualities. As a result, scholars and judges alike have decried the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> standard as ineffective and called for its abandonment. However, the Supreme Court continues to endorse the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> standard when assessing tying arrangements. The Seventh Circuit, like other circuits, has struggled in applying the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s <b>per</b> <b>se</b> tying analysis; this is evident in its recent decision, Reifert v. South Central MLS Corp. While all three judges hearing the case agreed on the outcome, Judge Wood contended that the majority misstated the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s <b>per</b> <b>se</b> analysis by adding a factor (the economic interest requirement) never recognized by the Court as a requisite for <b>per</b> <b>se</b> illegality of tying arrangements. This Comment examines and critiques the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s <b>per</b> <b>se</b> tying standard, and assesses whether the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> test provides room for the additional factor approved by the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s Reifert majority...|$|R

40|$|Preemption {{has emerged}} as the leading {{contender}} for conceptual grounding of the patentable subject matter doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s exclusion of abstract ideas and natural phenomena from patentability. Despite the Supreme Courts frequent use of preemption rhetoric, however, the concept cannot provide a satisfactory explanation of the Courts patentable subject matter jurisprudence or a sound theoretical basis for the doctrine. Patentable subject matter jurisprudence has two distinct threads, one concerned with overly broad impact on downstream innovation and the other based on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion of abstract ideas and natural phenomena from patentability. Most of the Courts patentable subject matter decisions apply a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis. While preemption is conceptually related to the downstream impact thread, the term is misleading even in that context. When preemption rhetoric is employed in the majority of cases, which are based on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion, it leads to confusion and incoherence. This Article disentangles the preemption rhetoric from the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis in the Supreme Courts cases. <b>Per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis necessarily involves two steps: identifying the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements in a claim and applying some rule to determine whether additional claim limitations render the claim patentable. The Article identifies these two steps within the Supreme Courts cases and seeks to prepare the ground for coherent theoretical analysis. Preemption rhetoric is a distraction from important questions that must be answered to give patentable subject matter doctrine a firm theoretical grounding. First, what are the normative bases of the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusions? As the discussion of the cases shows, failing to answer this question leads to seemingly arbitrary (or result-driven) identification of the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements in a claim. Second, what rules should be used to determine whether a particular claim incorporating <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements along with other limitations is patentable subject matter? The current muddle in patentable subject matter analysis is due largely to failure to moor these second-step rules to the normative basis for <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion...|$|R

A <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violation requires no further inquiry into the practice's actual effect on the market or the intentions of those individuals who engaged in the practice. Conduct characterized as <b>per</b> <b>se</b> unlawful is that which {{has been found to}} have a [...] "'pernicious effect on competition' or 'lacks [...] [...] [...] any redeeming virtue'" [...] Such conduct [...] "would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output." [...] When a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> rule is applied, a civil violation of the antitrust laws is found merely by proving that the conduct occurred and that it fell within a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> category.

50|$|Most {{nuisance}} claims allege {{a nuisance}} in fact, {{for the simple}} reason that not many actions or structures have been deemed to be nuisances <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> In general, if an act, or use of property, is lawful, or authorized by competent authority, it cannot be a nuisance <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> Rather, the act in question must either be declared by public statute, or by case law, to be a nuisance <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> There are few state or federal statutes or case law declaring actions or structures to be a nuisance in and of themselves.

The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine how crosses of lines selected for yield <b>per</b> <b>se</b> perform, and to examine the relationship of <b>per</b> <b>se</b> and hybrid performance. The 192 hybrids were evaluated in two replications at each of six Iowa environments. There were significant differences among HH, HL, and LL hybrid group means for grain yield and they were ranked (HH 3 ̆e HL 3 ̆e LL) as expected under a model assuming partial to complete dominance. The data suggests that on the average overdominance was not important for yield in BSSS. Correlations of inbred line traits with the same traits of the hybrids were larger than correlations of inbred line traits with hybrid yield. The correlations of inbred traits with hybrid yield were too small to be of predictive value. The data suggested that selection among lines <b>per</b> <b>se</b> for yield could be used to separate a population into a group of high and low combining lines based on their <b>per</b> <b>se</b> performance. However, <b>per</b> <b>se</b> performance within groups was not related to either specific or general combining ability.

40|$|North Carolina’s “unfair or {{deceptive}} acts or practices” statute, section 75 - 1. 1 of the North Carolina General Statutes, is {{a central}} feature of North Carolina litigation. The statute allows lucrative remedies, but it defines prohibited conduct with only vague standards. Courts have difficulty applying these standards in any detail, so they often use analytical shortcuts in decisions under the statute. One key shortcut under section 75 - 1. 1 is the “per se violation. ” A <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violation arises when actions that violate a source of law outside section 75 - 1. 1 —a different statute, a regulation, or a nonstatutory doctrine—automatically violate section 75 - 1. 1 as well. A <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violation has a transformative effect: in one stroke, it turns a claim for single damages into a claim for treble damages and possible attorney fees. Courts in section 75 - 1. 1 cases have struggled to decide when to carry out, and when to refuse, this transformation. They have accepted and rejected <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theories with no explanation or with question-begging explanations. They have also sidestepped the problems with a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theory by applying a number of variations on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theories. This variety of approaches leaves courts and lawyers to guess at what analysis to apply in future cases. The courts can end this confusion by sharpening the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> theory and replacing parts of it. In many instances, the General Assembly has announced, directly or indirectly, that a violation of a given statute is also a violation of section 75 - 1. 1. Courts should continue to apply these <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violations. In all other cases, however, courts should ask whether the conduct that makes up a separate violation satisfies the tests for unfairness under section 75 - 1. 1. The tests for unfairness already address violations of separate statutes and other expressions of public policy. This streamlined approach will strengthen the analysis of <b>per</b> <b>se</b> and non-per-se violations alike...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen US {{states have}} amended their longstanding, effect-based DUI drug laws to <b>per</b> <b>se</b> or zero {{tolerant}} <b>per</b> <b>se</b> statutes {{in regard to}} cannabis. Other states are considering enacting similar legislation. Under these amended traffic safety laws, it is a criminal violation for one to operate a motor vehicle with trace levels of cannabinoids or their metabolites {{in his or her}} blood or urine. Opponents of <b>per</b> <b>se</b> cannabinoid limits argue that neither the presence of cannabinoids nor their metabolites are appropriate or consistent predictors of behavioral or psychomotor impairment. They further argue that the imposition of such <b>per</b> <b>se</b> limits may result in the criminal conviction of individuals who may have previously consumed cannabis at some unspecified point in time, but were no longer under its influence. As more states enact statutory changes allowing for the legal use of cannabis under certain circumstances, there is a growing need to re-examine the appropriateness of these proposed <b>per</b> <b>se</b> standards for cannabinoids and their metabolites because the imposition of such limits may, in some instances, inadvertently criminalize behavior that poses no threat to traffic safety, such as the state-sanctioned private consumption of cannabis by adults...|$|R
