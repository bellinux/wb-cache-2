In {{order to better}} consider this emission change pattern in future emission inventories, {{in the present study}} inland water transport emissions of NO x, CO 2 and PM were investigated under real world conditions on the river Rhine, Germany, in 2013. An average NO 2  ∕ NO x emission ratio of 0. 08  ±  0. 02 was obtained, which is indicative of ship diesel engines without <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. For all measured motor ship types and operation conditions, overall weighted average emission indices (EIs), as emitted mass of pollutant per kg burnt fuel of EI NO x [*]=[*]  54  ±  4  g kg − 1 and a lower limit EI PM 1 [*]≥[*]  2. 0  ±  0. 3  g kg − 1, were obtained.

Such sensors will be required in future <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems for the selective real time detection of pollutants such as nitric oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.

The principle feasibility of SiC and GaN based field effect gas sensors for automotive applications was tested under laboratory conditions using synthetic gas mixtures.

40|$|Particulate {{matter is}} formed during {{incomplete}} combustion in modern diesel and gasoline engines. These particulates start to grow from tiny carbonaceous structures or condensed volatiles and eventually form larger porous agglomerates. When emitted to the ambient air, they {{may end up}} in human lungs and eventually cause premature deaths among susceptible individuals. It is therefore imperative to remove as much (on a mass basis) and as many (on a number basis) of these particles before the exhaust exits the tailpipe. In the continued development and optimization of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems {{for the removal of}} diesel and gasoline particulate matter, computer-aided simulations can help both to cut the design and development time and to provide information that is otherwise difficult to access by direct measurements. In the present work, detailed mathematical models are used to investigate the motion and deposition of particulate matter in generic <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. It is shown that particulate matter from internal combustion engines can be divided into three groups depending on their size, and that these groups are transported differently in the aftertreatment system. This is reflected in the extent and location of particle deposition, and can be taken advantage of in emission control engineering. Furthermore, it is shown that the different sensitivity of the particles to the range of transport phenomena present have important consequences for the construction of computationally efficient models for describing the particle motion. In addition, the effects of turbulence on the motion of particulate matter are discussed. It has often been suggested that the turbulent-to-laminar flow transition {{in the first part of}} the channels enhance the mass transfer characteristics of a monolithic reactor. With the aid of comprehensive numerical models, the effects of the upstream turbulence on the extent of particle deposition inside the channels can be quantified.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of extremely {{high levels of}} engine efficiency combined {{with the use of}} cheap, low-quality fuels has resulted in significantly increased emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and particulate matter. Consequently the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and various national and local administrations have reacted by establishing policies to prevent and control air pollution from ships leading to a challenging task in understanding all legal and administrative requests. In the Revision of MARPOL Annex VI dated 2008 the International Maritime Organisation agreed to further tighten the limits on the emissions of nitrogen oxides. In the second stage (Tier II) a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by about 20 % compared to the previous values is required. The third stage of emission limits for nitrogen oxides (Tier III) shall apply to new buildings with keel laying from 1 January 2016 when navigating Emission Control Areas (ECAs). In particular, this third stage imposes a strong challenge for engine manufacturers, ship operators and certifiers (Recognised Organisations / classification societies) from a technical and operational point of view. As without specific treatment of the exhaust gases the third level of emission limits for nitrogen oxides is unlikely to be met. For this reason the International Maritime Organization recently published guidelines for the use of after-treatment systems.

40|$|Emissions from {{internal}} combustion engines contain many components {{that have a}} detrimental {{effect on the environment}} and on human health, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). In addition, the final product of any combustion of fossil fuel - carbon dioxide (CO 2) - contributes to global warming. In order to reduce the emissions of CO 2, more efficient engines are needed, and these typically necessitate the development of new <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. Lean-burn engines (e. g. the diesel engine) are more efficient than conventional petrol engines, but emit more PM and require addition of a reducing agent to reduce NOx. Usually, a urea-water solution or a hydrocarbon is sprayed into the system. In addition, the PM content of the exhaust must be reduced in terms of both mass and number. In the current work, detailed mathematical models are used to investigate the motion and deposition of PM and droplets in generic <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems.

Successful optimization of aftertreatment systems for pollution control relies {{on the existence of}} numerical tools to predict the momentum, heat and mass transfer between these types of particles and the surrounding gas phase. Such tools can only be readily obtained if our fundamental understanding of the phenomena pertaining to the particle behavior is correct.

The small nano-particulates present in automotive <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems are typically described as spherical and inert, closely following the gas phase streamlines apart from a superimposed Brownian motion. We will review when this picture provides a sound basis for the development of mathematical models of particle behavior, and when the underlying assumptions break down.

We will show that the deposition of such particles in an automotive catalyst substrate cannot in general be well described by the aforementioned modelling approach, as particle transformations become active inside the substrate channels, altering the apparent deposition efficiency. A conceptual model is proposed that is able to explain the initially observed discrepancies between measurements and simulations, by describing the particulate matter as a mixture of three different types of particles: truly inter particles, semivolatile particles and completely volatile particles. The conceptual model is corroborated by experimental and numerical investigations into the behavior of truly inert particles in automotive catalyst substrates.
