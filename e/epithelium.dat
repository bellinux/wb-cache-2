5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified squamous <b>epithelium</b> without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar <b>epithelium,</b> and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal <b>epithelium</b> is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} <b>epithelium</b> associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular <b>epithelium.</b> These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival <b>epithelium</b> is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional <b>epithelium,</b> composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular <b>epithelium</b> is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory <b>epithelium.</b> This is a ciliated <b>epithelium</b> interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of <b>epithelium.</b> The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous <b>epithelium,</b> which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by <b>epithelium</b> resembling the thyroidal acinar <b>epithelium.</b> Characteristically, next to the lining <b>epithelium,</b> there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous <b>epithelium</b> of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar <b>epithelium</b> is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal <b>epithelium</b> are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma, {{also known}} as {{olfactory}} neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the olfactory <b>epithelium</b> and its classification remains controversial. However, since {{it is not a}} sympathetic nervous system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and is {{not to be confused with}} neuroblastoma.|$|E
5|$|Mixed carcinomas {{are those}} that have both Type I and Type II cells, with one making up at least 10% of the tumor. These include the {{malignant}} mixed Müllerian tumor, which derives from endometrial <b>epithelium</b> and has a poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous <b>epithelium</b> without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The <b>epithelium</b> of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the <b>epithelium</b> contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal <b>epithelium.</b> The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E
5|$|An {{outline of}} the origins of the {{parasitic}} life style has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from <b>epithelium</b> to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E
5|$|Cervical cancer {{nearly always}} {{involves}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} cervical <b>epithelium,</b> particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for cervical cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} <b>epithelium,</b> modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous <b>epithelium</b> that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies {{form part}} of the <b>epithelium</b> but whose bases extend to form muscle fibers in {{parallel}} rows. The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run {{at right angles to}} the fibers of the inward-facing one. In Anthozoa (anemones, corals, etc.) and Scyphozoa (jellyfish), the mesoglea also contains some muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive <b>epithelium.</b> There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the <b>epithelium</b> of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} the gut, and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine, leading to structural and functional changes of the <b>epithelium.</b> The triple protein coats make them resistant to the acidic pH of the stomach and the digestive enzymes in the gut.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from {{saturated}} air and by eating damp sand. Water loss is minimised by the rectal <b>epithelium,</b> which absorbs water, ensuring that the faeces is drier than the food the animal consumed. Evaporation of water through the permeable exoskeleton may, however, provide a valuable cooling effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{data were}} {{published}} as {{a letter in}} The Lancet in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen. It reported {{significant differences in the}} thickness of the gut <b>epithelium</b> of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of tracheation of the wings begin before the wing histoblast form, {{as it is}} important to note that they develop near a large trachea. During the fourth instar, cells from the <b>epithelium</b> of this trachea become greatly enlarged extend into the cavity of the wing bud, with each cell having developed a closely coiled tracheole. Each trachcole is of unicellular origin, and is at first intracellular in position; while tracheae are of multicellular origin and the lumen of each is intercellular in position. The {{development of}} tracheoles, each coiled within a single cell of the <b>epithelium</b> of a trachea, and the subsequent opening of communication between the tracheoles and the lumen of the trachea, and the uncoiling and stretching out of the tracheoles, so that they reach all parts of the wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous <b>epithelium,</b> and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing <b>epithelium.</b> The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the <b>epithelium</b> forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular <b>epithelium</b> that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the <b>epithelium</b> of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal <b>epithelium.</b> The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause <b>epithelium</b> damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{contact with}} fish hosts and firing {{of the polar}} capsules, the sporoplasm {{contained}} within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the <b>epithelium</b> or gut lining. Firstly, this sporoplasm undergoes mitosis to produce more amoeboid cells, which migrate into deeper tissue layers, to reach the cerebral cartilage.|$|E
5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the <b>epithelium</b> of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
25|$|The {{secretory}} <b>epithelium</b> {{is mainly}} pseudostratified, comprising tall columnar cells and basal cells which {{are supported by}} a fibroelastic stroma - containing randomly oriented smooth-muscle bundles - that's continuous with the bladder. The <b>epithelium</b> is highly variable and areas of low cuboidal or squamous <b>epithelium</b> are also present, with transitional <b>epithelium</b> in the distal regions of the longer ducts.|$|E
25|$|The {{epithelial}} {{covering of}} the cervix is continuous with the epithelial {{lining of the}} vagina. The vaginal mucosa is absent of glands. The vaginal <b>epithelium</b> consists of three rather arbitrary layers of cells – superficial flat cells, intermediate cells and basal cells – and estrogen induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with glycogen. The superficial cells exfoliate continuously and basal cells replace them. Under the influence of maternal estrogen, newborn females have a thick stratified squamous <b>epithelium</b> for two to four weeks after birth. After that, the <b>epithelium</b> remains thin {{with only a few}} layers of cells without glycogen until puberty, when the <b>epithelium</b> thickens and glycogen containing cells are formed again, {{under the influence of the}} girl's rising estrogen levels. Finally, the <b>epithelium</b> thins out during menopause onward and eventually ceases to contain glycogen, because of the lack of estrogen. In abnormal circumstances, such as in pelvic organ prolapse, the vaginal <b>epithelium</b> may be exposed becoming dry and keratinized.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epithelium</b> forms fine lobules, and {{develops}} into a sponge-like structure. During this stage, hematopoietic bone-marrow precursors migrate into the thymus. Normal development {{is dependent on}} the interaction between the <b>epithelium</b> and the hematopoietic thymocytes.|$|E
25|$|The human {{mammary gland}} is {{composed}} of several cell types, including adipose (fat cells), muscle, ductal <b>epithelium,</b> and mammary <b>epithelium</b> (referred to sometimes as lactocytes). The mammary <b>epithelium</b> is the site for excretion of raw materials into the milk supply, including choline. This occurs, for the fat portion of the milk, by apocrine secretion, where vacuoles containing materials bud off the cell into the lumen (storage) of the alveolus (milk secretion gland). From here the milk will be released upon stimulation with oxytocin via suckling.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal <b>epithelium</b> {{may have}} formed, keratectomy may be appropriate.|$|E
25|$|KCNE2 {{protein is}} most readily {{detected}} in the choroid plexus <b>epithelium,</b> gastric parietal cells, and thyroid epithelial cells. KCNE2 is also expressed in atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, the pancreas, pituitary gland, and lung <b>epithelium.</b> In situ hybridization data suggest that KCNE2 transcript may also be expressed in various neuronal populations.|$|E
25|$|Mature human {{vocal folds}} are {{composed}} of layered structures which are quite different at the histological level. The topmost layer comprises stratified squamous <b>epithelium</b> which is bordered by ciliated pseudostratified <b>epithelium.</b> The inner lining surface of this squamous <b>epithelium</b> is covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorally and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated.|$|E
25|$|The {{ciliary body}} is {{triangular}} in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer, the ciliary <b>epithelium.</b> The inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body, and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina. The outer layer is highly pigmented, continuous with the retinal pigment <b>epithelium,</b> and constitutes {{the cells of}} the dilator muscle.|$|E
25|$|The thyomocytes and the <b>epithelium</b> of the thymus have {{different}} developmental origins. The <b>epithelium</b> of the thymus develops first, appearing as two flask-shape endodermal diverticula, which arise one on either side, {{from the third}} pharyngeal pouch, and extend outward and backward into the surrounding mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme {{in front of the}} ventral aorta.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} layers {{in the dog}} and cat cornea. The outer layer is the <b>epithelium,</b> which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven cell layers thick. The <b>epithelium</b> holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The <b>epithelium</b> sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the <b>epithelium</b> from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of {{the thickness of the}} cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium. The endothelium is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the aqueous humor.|$|E
