40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) results with patients suffering from vestibular migraine and healthy people, {{taking into consideration}} values of threshold and latency of occurrence of the characteristic wave complex, size of amplitude, and <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> ratio.

Information was collected during the diagnostic evaluation. General and otoneurological history of patients and bedside tests, audiological results, videonystagmography and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) were made.

Subjects and MethodZZTwenty-four normal subjects (48 ears) with normal hearing and no previous history of dizziness were included. cVEMP responses were recorded by surface el-ectrodes on sternocleidomastiod muscles in response to AC and BC stimuli sequentially.

ResultsZZcVEMP responses were clearly observed in all 48 ears in both AC and BC cVE-MP tests. There was no significant difference in latencies (p 1 and n 1). However, the thresholds in BC cVEMP testing were significantly lower than those in AC cVEMP testing, when com-pared to the maximum stimulation level. <b>Interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> difference ratios showed no sig-nificant difference in between the two tests, although amplitudes at maximum stimulation in-tensity in BC cVEMP testing were significantly larger than those in AC cVEMP testing...|$|E

The proposed algorithm is {{an adaptation of}} the well-known superdirective beamformer including postfiltering to the binaural application. In contrast to conventional beamformer processing, the proposed system outputs enhanced stereo signals while preserving the important <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> and phase differences of the original signal. Instrumental performance evaluations in a real environment with multiple speech sources indicate that the proposed computational efficient spectral weighting system can achieve significant attenuation of speech interferers while maintaining a high speech quality of the target signal.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{auditory}} {{system has}} ability to segregate signals emitted simultaneously by different sources. Sounds can overlap both temporally and spectrally. Some acoustic features as fundamental frequency (f 0), <b>interaural</b> cues, onset, <b>amplitude</b> an/or frequency modulation {{could be used}} to segregate different streams from the complex signals arriving to the two ears. This task allows a global measure of performances at the identification level but it implicates both primitive and categorization properties. Here, we would like to precise the influence of ITD in such a situation. The role of this localization cue is considered as a primitive characteristic. In this way, we duplicate Shackleton and Meddis' experiment (1992) of lateralized double vowels. Moreover, this experiment measures the influence of both DITD and Df 0 contrasts. To model these effects, we perform the fusion of AM map outputs (Berthommier...|$|R

Additionally, the effect of movement direction was investigated by varying this property systematically.

40|$|When {{the source}} of a tone moves with respect to a listener's ears, {{dichotic}} (or <b>interaural)</b> phase and <b>amplitude</b> modulations (PM and AM) are produced. Two experiments investigated the psychophysical characteristics of dichotic linear ramp modulations in phase and amplitude, and compared them with the psychophysics of diotic PM and AM. In experiment 1, subjects were substantially more sensitive to dichotic PM than diotic PM, but AM sensitivity was equivalent in the dichotic and diotic conditions. Thresholds for discriminating modulation direction were smaller than detection thresholds for dichotic AM, and both diotic AM and PM. Dichotic PM discrimination thresholds were similar to detection thresholds. In experiment 2, the effects of ramp duration were examined. Sensitivity to dichotic AM and PM, and diotic AM increased as duration was increased from 20 ms to 200 ms. The functions relating sensitivity to ramp duration differed across the stimuli; sensitivity to dichotic PM increased more rapidly than sensitivity to dichotic or diotic AM. This was also reflected in shorter time-constants and minimum integration times for dichotic PM detection. These findings support the hypothesis that the analysis of dichotic PM and AM rely on separate mechanisms. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|The barn owl's {{auditory}} system computes interaural {{differences in}} time and amplitude and derives from them the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the sound source, respectively. Within the external nucleus of its inferior colliculus are auditory neurones, called 'space-specific neurones', that have spatial receptive fields. To activate a space-specific neurone, a sound must originate from a circumscribed region of space, or, if the sounds are delivered to each ear separately, using earphones, the stimuli must have the combination of interaural time and amplitude difference that simulates a sound broadcast from their receptive field. The sound-localization cues are processed in parallel, non-overlapping pathways extending from the cochlear nuclei to the subdivision of the inferior colliculus that innervates the space-specific neurones. Processing in the time pathway involves the coding of monaural phase angle, the derivation of sensitivity for interaural phase difference, and the calculation of interaural time difference (ITD) from interaural phase difference. The last process involves groups of neurones in the inferior colliculus whose collective firing signals a unique ITD, even though the activity of each constituent neurone signals multiple ITDs. The projections of these ensembles to the space-specific neurone endow the latter with a selectivity for ITD. Processing in the amplitude channel, about which less is known, initially involves an inhibitory process that sharpens the directional sensitivity of neurones in a lateral lemniscal nucleus. The inhibition is mediated by a commissural projection from the same lemniscal nucleus of the opposite side. At higher levels of the auditory system, neurones that are tuned to a limited range of <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> differences are found. It is proposed that at these higher stages, <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> difference, like ITD, is coded amidst an ensemble of neurones...|$|E

40|$|Room {{reverberation}} degrades {{the quality}} and intelligibility of speech and also reduces the performance of automatic speech-recognition systems. Hence, blind or semi-blind dereverberation methods have been developed, utilising single or multiple input channels. Dereverberation is also important for binaural applications {{in the context of}} digital hearing aids, binaural telephony and hands free devices. However, the development of binaural dereverberation solutions is not trivial. Apart from the challenging task of reducing reverberation without introducing audible artifacts, binaural dereverberation should also at least preserve the <b>interaural</b> arrival-time and <b>amplitude</b> differences of the signals at the two ears, as these represent relevant cues for sound-source localization. In this chapter, an overview of auditory perception and physical features of reverberation is given. Further, a literature review of dereverberation methods is presented, leading to the more recent binaural techniques. Two specific binaural-dereverberation methods will be considered in more detail, one of them relying on binaural coherence and the other one on utilizing spectral subtraction for suppressing late-reverberation effects. The results of performance tests on these methods will be presented, along with a discussion of suitable objective and perceptual evaluation methods. 38 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Low-frequency {{sounds are}} {{advantageous}} for long-range acoustic signal transmission, but for small animals they constitute {{a challenge for}} signal detection and localization. The efficient detection of sound in insects is enhanced by mechanical resonance either in the tracheal or tympanal system before subsequent neuronal amplification. Making small structures resonant at low sound frequencies poses challenges for insects {{and has not been}} adequately studied. Similarly, detecting the direction of long-wavelength sound using <b>interaural</b> signal <b>amplitude</b> and/or phase differences is difficult for small animals. Pseudophylline bushcrickets predominantly call at high, often ultrasonic frequencies, but a few paleotropical species use lower frequencies. We investigated the mechanical frequency tuning of the tympana of one such species, Onomarchus uninotatus, a large bushcricket that produces a narrow bandwidth call at an unusually low carrier frequency of 3. 2. kHz. Onomarchus uninotatus, like most bushcrickets, has two large tympanal membranes on each fore-tibia. We found that both these membranes vibrate like hinged flaps anchored at the dorsal wall and do not show higher modes of vibration in the frequency range investigated (1. 5 - 20. kHz). The anterior tympanal membrane acts as a low-pass filter, attenuating sounds at frequencies above 3. 5. kHz, in contrast to the high-pass filter characteristic of other bushcricket tympana. Responses to higher frequencies are partitioned to the posterior tympanal membrane, which shows maximal sensitivity at several broad frequency ranges, peaking at 3. 1, 7. 4 and 14. 4. kHz. This partitioning between the two tympanal membranes constitutes an unusual feature of peripheral auditory processing in insects. The complex tracheal shape of O. uninotatus also deviates from the known tube or horn shapes associated with simple band-pass or high-pass amplification of tracheal input to the tympana. Interestingly, while the anterior tympanal membrane shows directional sensitivity at conspecific call frequencies, the posterior tympanal membrane is not directional at conspecific frequencies and instead shows directionality at higher frequencies...|$|R

Although the origin of these otoconia lies in the macula of the utricle, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) can be used assess saccular function.

Patients and method: Nineteen patients diagnosed with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal were included in this study.

Ipsilateral and contralateral VEMP thresholds, ipsilateral and contralateral p 13 and n 23 latencies at 100 dB, inter-peak amplitude and the <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> difference were determined. Results: We found a lack of VEMP response in 52 % of the ears with BPPV. When adjusted for bilateral absence, VEMP response was absent in 20. 3 % of ears.

40|$|The {{addition}} of a signal in the N 0 Sπ binaural configuration gives rise to fluctuations in interaural phase and amplitude. Sensitivity to these individual cues was measured by applying sinusoidal amplitude modulation (AM) or quasi-frequency modulation (QFM) to a band of noise. Discrimination between interaurally in-phase and out-of-phase modulation was measured using an adaptive task for narrow bands of noise at center frequencies from 250 to 1500 Hz, for modulation rates of 2 – 40 Hz, and with or without flanking bands of diotic noise. Discrimination thresholds increased steeply for QFM with increasing center frequency, but increased only modestly for AM, and mainly for modulation rates below 10 Hz. Flanking bands of noise increased thresholds for AM, but had no consistent effect for QFM. The results suggest that two underlying mechanisms may support binaural unmasking: one most sensitive to <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> modulations that is susceptible to across-frequency interference, and a second, most sensitive to interaural phase modulations that is immune to such effects...|$|E

In the latter experiment we studied the efficiency of binaural masking level differences. The results indicate that the bilateral CI-user tested in this study was highly sensitive to ILD, comparable to normal hearing listeners, but less sensitive and consistent to ITD.

Presenting the maskers diotically {{and the target}} tone {{with a variety of}} interaural differences (<b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> ratios and∕or interaural time delays) resulted in reduced detection thresholds relative to when the target was presented diotically (“binaural release from masking”). Thresholds observed when time and amplitude differences applied to the target were “reinforcing” (favored the same ear, resulting in a lateralized position for the target) were not significantly different from thresholds obtained when differences were “opposing” (favored opposite ears, resulting in a centered position for the target). This irrelevance of differences in the perceived location of the target is a classic result for energetic maskers but had not previously been shown for informational maskers. However, this parallellism between the patterns of binaural release for energetic and informational maskers was not accompanied by high correlations between the patterns for individual listeners, supporting the idea that the mechanisms for binaural release from energetic and informational masking are fundamentally different...|$|E

Narrow bands of noise (1 ERB wide) with a range of centre frequencies (250 - 1, 500 Hz) and of 500 -ms duration were sinusoidally modulated at 20 Hz using either amplitude or quasi-frequency modulation (AM or QFM). In a two-interval, forced-choice task, modulation was applied in both intervals, interaurally out of phase in the signal interval and in phase in the non-signal interval. To emulate a narrow-band binaural unmasking task, the bands were used in isolation. To emulate a broadband unmasking task, flanking bands of diotic noise were added, but separated from the target band by 1 -ERB-wide notches.

Such models intend to contribute to a deep comprehension of the perception or recognition mechanism which permits listeners to decide whether a source of a sound is located on the right or {{on the left side of}} their medial plane. Methods Numerous lateralization judgments are accomplished through a computer controlled experiment set-up in order to investigate the transduction mechanism beneath them. The statistical treatment of the psychoacoustic data obtained has been performed by Two and Three Factors – Probit (Probability Unit) Analysis. Results The Probit Analysis makes it possible to obtain the model coefficients and to fit ‘Probit Planes and Surfaces’ to the experimental data in order to study and predict the simultaneous effects produced by ITD and IAD in the listeners’ psychoacoustic perceptions at several Sensation Levels (SL). Conclusion The approach used here is appropriate for the analysis of this kind of binary response and it also offers a simple way to obtain psychophysical responses that can be related to neurophysiological phenomena. It is argued that this fact may lead to another way to access neural information through psychoacoustic experiments, without needing invasive methods...|$|E
40|$|Background: Auditory mate or prey {{localisation}} {{is central}} to the lifestyle of many animals and requires precise directional hearing. However, when the incident angle of sound approaches 0 u azimuth, interaural time and intensity differences gradually vanish. This poses a demanding challenge to animals especially when interaural distances are small. To cope with these limitations imposed by the laws of acoustics, crickets employ a frequency tuned peripheral hearing system. Although this enhances auditory directionality the actual precision of directional hearing and phonotactic steering has never been studied in the behaviourally important frontal range. Principal Findings: Here we analysed the directionality of phonotaxis in female crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) walking on an open-loop trackball system by measuring their steering accuracy towards male calling song presented at frontal angles of incidence. Within the range of 630 u, females reliably discriminated the side of acoustic stimulation, even when the sound source deviated by only 1 u from the animal’s length axis. Moreover, for angles of sound incidence between 1 u and 6 u the females precisely walked towards the sound source. Measuring the tympanic membrane oscillations of the front leg ears with a laser vibrometer revealed between 0 u and 30 u a linear increasing function of <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> differences with a slope of 0. 4 dB/u.

40|$|The primary {{physical}} cues {{animals can}} exploit to analyse {{the direction of}} a sound source are <b>interaural</b> <b>amplitude</b> differences and interaural time differences of a sound wave approaching each ear. Once processed by the biomechanics of the hearing system, mechanosensory transduction and coding by the auditory afferents provides the animal’s central nervous system with information to calculate {{the direction of a}} sound source (Lewis, 1983; Michelsen, 1998; Hennig et al., 2004). Female crickets are attracted by the males ’ calling song (Regen, 1913). From treadmill experiments with intact and single eared crickets (Gryllus campestris) the general rule ‘turn to the louder side ’ was proposed as the most simple rule to stabilize the direction during phonotactic walking (Huber et al., 1984; Schildberger, 1994). Any deviation {{from the direction of the}} sound source would initiate counter turnings and, thus, stabilize the animal’s path. This most parsimonious rule for auditory orientation, however, does not consider the significance of pattern recognition for orientation. The use of acoustic signals for intraspecific communication and mate attraction requires not only the localization of the sound source but also the recognition of the species-specific signal. Thus, the animal’s auditory orientation may additionally depend on the quality of the perceived pattern. The existence of two bilaterally paired recognisers that allow crickets to chose between two sound patterns was first proposed by Pollack (1986). In two-stimulus situations crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) preferred the conspecific pattern to a heterospecific song, which was seen as the result of two interacting recognisers. Stabel et al. (1989) and Wendler (1990) exposed walking crickets to two sounds simultaneously and demonstrated that the animals walk towards the side where the sound pattern is better represented in the activity of ascending auditory neurons. They concluded that the recognition process is based on the temporal pattern of the neuronal activity and postulated that recognition and localization are performed sequentially with two central nervous recognisers, one on each side of the body, whose output is compared either in the brain or at the thoracic motor networks. The selective response of identified auditory brain neurons to temporal patterns indicated that corresponding pattern recognition networks might be located in th...|$|E
