Harrison and McCartney later offered their apologies to the Maharishi (McCartney {{said that he did}} not believe the accusation at all). In 2010, Mardas issued a statement <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> he had spread rumours.|$|E

50|$|This makes ethical naturalism a definist form {{of moral}} realism, {{which is in}} turn a form of cognitivism. Ethical naturalism stands in {{opposition}} to ethical non-naturalism, which <b>denies</b> <b>that</b> moral terms refer to anything other than irreducible moral properties, {{as well as to}} all forms of moral anti-realism, including ethical subjectivism (which <b>denies</b> <b>that</b> moral propositions refer to objective facts), error theory (which <b>denies</b> <b>that</b> any moral propositions are true), and non-cognitivism (which <b>denies</b> <b>that</b> moral sentences express propositions at all).|$|R
5|$|Following the US {{entry into}} World War II Townsend {{was arrested for}} acting as a Japanese agent without {{registering}} under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He pleaded guilty, admitting that he had accepted payments before the war from a propaganda organization funded by the Japanese government, but <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> he was a Japanese agent. He received a prison sentence and while serving {{was involved in the}} Great Sedition Trial. After the war Townsend moved to Fairfax, Virginia, where he died on 25 January 1976. His writings continue to be influential in far-right circles.|$|E
5|$|While in Australia, Swannell {{was often}} {{approached}} by the sporting press for his opinion on rugby matters. Particularly on clashes between British and Antipodean teams, including the 1905 New Zealand tour. He was vocal in {{his support for}} maintaining the amateur nature of rugby, but did not side with Bedell-Sivright in <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> a stipend had been paid during the 1904 tour. In 1908 he was also hired to write {{a series of articles}} for the Star on the topic of forward play, and scrummaging.|$|E
5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> they have ever had seizures.|$|E

5|$|The rock {{supposedly}} {{found in}} the lake, said to be taken from the Park's garden wall, has been challenged as evidence in multiple places. Both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it, and he claimed {{that if he had}} found it, he would have placed it back. Professor Kenneth Pye, a defense witness, said that {{there was no evidence that}} the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all. The article in the Sunday Herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> he ever found it.|$|E
5|$|Three judges testified as {{character}} witnesses: John Peter Barnes (N.D. Ill.) {{on behalf of}} Glasser, Kretske, and Roth; Charles Edgar Woodward (N.D. Ill.) on behalf of Glasser and Kretske; and state judge John F. Haas on behalf of Kretske. Kaplan and Horton both took the stand, <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> they ever paid money to Glasser or Kretske. Two defense attorneys, Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess (who was representing Kaplan at the trial), who had also defended clients in cases the government's case-in-chief had alleged to be fixed, denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske (although the government had not accused them of this). Glasser's testimony took three hours, as he was cross-examined individually about every single case {{that the government had}} alleged to have been fixed.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, Richards {{continued}} to be champion into 2014. Richards was defeated by Luke Hawx in what was billed as a title match at an East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) show in Delaware. However, Extreme Rising said the match was not for the title and {{continued to}} recognize Richards as champion. Despite the statement, Hawx continued to proclaim himself champion and was to defend the title against Matt Hardy on July 20, 2014, at Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW). Extreme Rising owner Steve O'Neill issued a press release <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> they had sanctioned the match. According to Dan McDevitt of MCW, the match {{would be for the}} MCW Heavyweight Championship, but said it was up to Hardy or Hawx to bring other titles. Hawx lost to Hardy in the match, who retained the MCW Championship and obtained the Extreme Rising championship belt â€“ but was not officially recognized as champion.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Sullivan, ageing and unwell, {{resigned}} as {{conductor of the}} Leeds triennial music festival, a post which he had held since 1880. He believed that Stanford's motive for accepting the conductorship of the Leeds Philharmonic Society the previous year was to position himself {{to take over the}} festival. Stanford later felt obliged to write to The Times, <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> he had been party to a conspiracy to oust Sullivan. Sullivan was by then thought to be a dull conductor of other composers' music, and although Stanford's work as a conductor was not without its critics, he was appointed in Sullivan's place. He remained in charge until 1910. His compositions for the festival included Songs of the Sea (1904), Stabat Mater (1907) and Songs of the Fleet (1910). New works by other composers presented at Leeds during Stanford's years in charge included pieces by Parry, Mackenzie, and seven of Stanford's former pupils. The best-known new work from Stanford's time is probably Vaughan Williams's A Sea Symphony, premiered in 1910.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200m freestyle {{would be one of}} the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as The Race of the Century. With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events. Thorpe's increasing focus on the 100m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400m event. Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26s in a time three seconds outside his own world record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting that the controversy surrounding the event had taken a toll on him, but <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> any liquid had left his eyes.|$|E

5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by <b>denying</b> <b>that</b> the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12â€“14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
