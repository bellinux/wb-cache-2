5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism <b>first-hand,</b> he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any <b>first-hand</b> documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} <b>first-hand</b> {{criticism}} from riders following the race that the route was excessively difficult and dangerous, Zomegnan remained staunch {{in his defense}} of the route.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, Edward {{witnessed}} trench warfare <b>first-hand</b> {{and visited}} {{the front line}} {{as often as he}} could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict. Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.|$|E
5|$|Josephus Struthius {{became famous}} as a {{physician}} and medical researcher. Bernard Wapowski was a pioneer of Polish cartography. Maciej Miechowita, a rector at the Cracow Academy, published in 1517 Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis, a treatise on the geography of the East, {{an area in which}} Polish investigators provided <b>first-hand</b> expertise for the rest of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Six <b>first-hand</b> {{accounts}} of Karluk's last voyage have been published. These include Stefansson's account which only covers the June to September 1913 period. Expedition secretary Burt McConnell wrote {{an account of}} the Wrangel Island rescue which was published in The New York Times, 15 September 1914. A version of McConnell's account appears in Stefansson's book.|$|E
5|$|The proper METHOD for {{studying}} poetry and good letters is {{the method of}} contemporary biologists, that is careful <b>first-hand</b> examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another. No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.|$|E
5|$|The text of Barber's {{telegram}} to the President {{was printed}} {{on the front page}} of The New York Times on April 14, and a <b>first-hand</b> account of the siege at the T.A. appeared in The Times and the Chicago Herald and other papers.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} his Bachelor of Commerce degree at an Adelaide institution in 1996, Harley transferred to Deakin University and graduated 11 {{years later in}} 2007. Harley was one of 21 players from the Geelong Football Club who witnessed the 2002 Bali bombings <b>first-hand</b> during an off-season holiday to the popular tourist destination. Harley and his team mates were preparing to venture to the Sari night club just moments prior to the terrorist attack.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the first Halo novel, , {{publisher}} Del Rey and Halo publisher Microsoft signed a deal for new books based on Xbox games, including another entry in the Halo series. Del Ray approached author Dietz to write the next book. Dietz incorporated his <b>first-hand</b> experience in the military for the additional scenes of The Flood not found in the game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, {{he learned}} to fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that <b>first-hand</b> knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{account of}} all this (illustrated by his own pen and ink drawings) is the 550-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940). It was proof-read by Kerr, who commented on its {{publication}} 'It {{is by far the}} finest thing of the kind in existence'. His co-workers' <b>first-hand</b> accounts of his work in military camouflage {{can be found in the}} memoirs of two of his fellow camoufleurs: Julian Trevelyan and Roland Penrose.|$|E
5|$|Europeans first {{witnessed}} the Great Wall {{in the early}} 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de GÃ³is reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a <b>first-hand</b> encounter with the Great Wall, and mentions that {{in the course of}} the journey his embassy travelled alongside the Great Wall for ten days.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired <b>first-hand</b> experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, {{but there was no}} time to pass these lessons on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers was the key to the survival of his own task force.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman {{has written}} and co-written {{a series of}} books which {{summarize}} his work. These publications include raw data from various studies, their statistical interpretation, and possible conclusions presented with necessary background material. The books also include <b>first-hand</b> accounts of schizophrenic patients and relatives tending to them, giving an insight into jumbled thoughts, the disorder's primary symptom. Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause, transmission, and progression of the disorder, which is controlled by many genes acting {{in concert with the}} environment, with no cause sufficient by itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1801 while {{aboard the}} 74-gun HMS Ganges (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a {{personal}} friend), Brock {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were supposed to lead an assault on the forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such an assault unnecessary, and Brock was able to observe <b>first-hand</b> the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and Brock celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802 Brock and the 49th Foot were ordered to Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Manzanar At Dusk program {{became a}} part of the Pilgrimage. The program attracts local area residents, as well as {{descendants}} of Manzanar's ranch days and the town of Manzanar. Through small group discussions, the event gives participants the opportunity to hear directly about the experiences of former incarcerees <b>first-hand,</b> to share their experiences and feelings about what they learned, and talk about the relevance of what happened at Manzanar to their own lives.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, Hiddleston {{appeared}} with Benedict Cumberbatch, Gemma Arterton, Eddie Redmayne and Rose Byrne among others in Danny Boyle's one time production of The Children's Monologues, {{in which he}} played Prudence, a young girl upset with her mother for her father leaving and excited for her birthday. The play was a one time event of adapted stories of children's <b>first-hand</b> experiences in South Africa being re-interpreted by and performed by various actors.|$|E
5|$|In early 1787, Thomas Clarkson, {{a fellow}} {{graduate}} of St John's, Cambridge, {{who had become}} convinced {{of the need to}} end the slave trade after writing a prize-winning essay on the subject while at Cambridge, called upon Wilberforce at Old Palace Yard with a published copy of the work. This {{was the first time the}} two men had met; their collaboration would last nearly fifty years. Clarkson began to visit Wilberforce on a weekly basis, bringing <b>first-hand</b> evidence he had obtained about the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{within a few}} years to decades of the {{destruction}} of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics, two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of rongorongo tablets by Easter Islanders. Both accounts were compromised at best, and are often taken to be worthless, but they are the only accounts from people who may have been familiar with the script <b>first-hand.</b>|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie and Alexander {{researched}} <b>first-hand</b> accounts, photos, newsreels and texts. They {{also examined}} Gestapo and SS records, as the organizations had been meticulous in reconstructing {{the events of}} the conspiracy in its aftermath. A timeline of events was created, from which McQuarrie and Alexander shaped the script. After production began in Berlin, the writers were able to visit locations and meet with relatives of the conspirators; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and become independent. With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a <b>first-hand</b> view of the Japanese music world and valuable training {{both in and out}} of the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E
5|$|Although Crane {{was born}} after the war, {{and had not}} at the time {{experienced}} battle <b>first-hand,</b> the novel {{is known for its}} realism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1894, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by Century Magazine) as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane's original manuscript, was published in 1983.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable <b>first-hand</b> experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the band's {{specific}} {{legal issues}} and {{insight into the}} making of the new album, the film also examines the state of the modern music industry as a whole, focusing on the complex relationships between major labels and their artists. Other musicians give their <b>first-hand</b> accounts of their own experiences in the business. The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry insiders, including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists. They trace the impact of the growing American economic recession on the industry, wherein many companies were taken over by larger groups who thought they could save them. In this instance, Terra Firma Capital Partners sought to rescue EMI despite having little experience in music management.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} Bengali family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was {{inclined}} towards spirituality. He {{was influenced by}} his Guru, Ramakrishna Deva, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired <b>first-hand</b> knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds {{of public and private}} lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day.|$|E
5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or <b>first-hand</b> accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E
5|$|During the 14th and 15th centuries, a {{large number}} of these works were {{imported}} into northern Europe, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine â typified by the unknown artist responsible for the Cambrai Madonna â and 14th-century successors such as Giotto favoured presenting the Madonna on a monumental scale. Undoubtedly van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had <b>first-hand</b> exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428, before the Cambrai icon was brought to the North. Van Eyck's two Madonna panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the events}} of Resident Evil 2, Leon is a rookie police officer who arrives in the doomed Raccoon City late for his {{first day on the}} job, only to confront a zombie {{outbreak}} <b>first-hand.</b> During the course of the game, he teams up with civilian survivor Claire Redfield, rescues the young Sherry Birkin, and is aided by the mysterious Ada Wong. Six years later, in Resident Evil 4, Leon returns as a secret service agent for the U.S. federal government assigned to rescue the president's daughter from a sinister cult. In Resident Evil 6, he continues to work for the U.S. government and reunites with Ada and a grown-up Sherry.|$|E
5|$|GeoJourney was {{a special}} {{academic}} program conducted by the School of Earth, Environment, and Society that featured a nine-week field trip/camping trip/road trip across the United States to national parks and monuments granting 24 students a semester of college credit. The GeoJourney field program included Geology, Environmental Studies and Native American studies. Credits applied to the BG Perspective general education requirements. Students on the journey conducted interdisciplinary field investigations and gained <b>first-hand</b> experiences {{in a wide range}} of environments. In 2004 the first GeoJourney trip went to 24 states, 30 national parks and covered over 14,500 miles across the United States. The program was pulled from the University in 2013 by its creators Nichole and Ian Rodgers.|$|E
5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly {{to avoid the}} disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on <b>first-hand</b> personal communication.|$|E
5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} <b>first-hand,</b> and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1955, viewers {{were able}} to see <b>first-hand</b> what Perry did for a living before he was a {{professional}} singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new color television studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, {{making it one of the}} first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} and most important surveyors of KÄ«lauea was James Dwight Dana, who, staying with the missionary Titus Coan, studied the island's volcanoes in detail for decades <b>first-hand.</b> Dana visited KÄ«lauea's summit and described it in detail in 1840. After publishing a summary paper in 1852, he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider KÄ«lauea a separate volcano, instead referring {{to it as a}} flank vent of Mauna Loa; it was not until another geologist, C. E. Dutton, had elaborated on Dana's research during an 1884 expedition that KÄ«lauea came to be generally accepted as a separate entity.|$|E
5|$|Some stampeders were famous: John McGraw, {{the former}} {{governor}} of Washington joined, together with the prominent lawyer and sportsman A. Balliot. Frederick Burnham, a well-known American scout and explorer, arrived from Africa, only to be called back {{to take part in the}} Second Boer War. Among those who documented the rush were the Swedish-born photographer Eric Hegg, who took some of the iconic pictures of Chilkoot Pass, and reporter Tappan Adney, who afterwards wrote a <b>first-hand</b> history of the stampede. Jack London, later a famous American writer, left to seek for gold but made his money during the rush mostly by working for prospectors.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Barnet was an {{important}} engagement in the Wars of the Roses: it brought {{about the death of}} a prominent figure and secured the throne for another. Despite its importance to history, contemporary records about the battle are rare. The sole chronicle based on an eyewitness accountâThe Arrivall of Edward IVâwas written by someone within Edward's council, which presents a biased account of the battle. Another <b>first-hand</b> observation was found in the Paston Letters, written by the Lancastrian Sir John Paston. Other records, such as The Warkworth Chronicle, offer only bits and pieces about the battle. Therefore, deficits in historical understanding must be filled through field research and discoveries of mediaeval documents.|$|E
5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893. <b>First-hand</b> Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fightingâincluding Burnham, whom several of them recognisedâleft during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position.|$|E
