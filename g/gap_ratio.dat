According to various upper and bottom gap ratios, the force on the duct was calculated. When the bottom <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0, the drag force coefficient, lift force coefficient, and composite force reach their maximum values, and the azimuth reaches its minimum. With an increase of the bottom <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> from 0 to 1, the drag force coefficient and composite force decrease sharply, and the lift force coefficient does not decreases so much, but the azimuth increases dramatically. With a continuous increase of the bottom <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> from 1 upward, the drag force coefficient, lift force coefficient, composite force, and azimuth vary little. Thus, the bottom <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> is the key factor influencing the force on the circular duct.

40|$|Wake of two {{side-by-side}} square cylinders {{was investigated}} through {{direct numerical simulation}} at low Reynolds numbers (16 - 200). The {{gap between the two}} cylinders varied from 0 to 10 D, where D is the dimension of the square cylinder (edge length). 9 different wake patterns and their dependency on both the Reynolds number and gap spacing were identified and analysed. A system classification map, demarcated by the Reynolds number and <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> g* (g/D, where g is the gap spacing between 2 cylinders), was derived for these 9 wake modes. Steady-state wake (mode I) was observed when the Reynolds number is lower than the critical Reynolds number, which depends on g*. For the <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> less than 0. 7, only single vortex street was observed. The single vortex street wake can be either symmetric and periodic (mode II), or asymmetric and periodic (mode III), or irregular (mode IV). In this <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> range (less than 0. 7), shedding frequency decreases with the <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> due to the damping role of the gap flow. For the <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> larger than 0. 7, two vortex streets were also observed. For the <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> larger than 1, only two vortex streets were observed. Vortex shedding can be either synchronized and in-phase (mode V), synchronized and anti-phase (mode VI), in-phase dominated with low frequency modulation (mode VII), anti-phase dominated with low frequency modulation (mode VIII), asymmetric synchronized anti-phase (mode IX), or irregular (mode IV). For the <b>gap</b> <b>ratio</b> larger than 4, only synchronized anti-phase mode was observed under the conditions of this study. In the two vortex streets regime, shedding frequency is higher than that of a single cylinder, due to a stronger gap flow than that in the freestream side.

40|$|This {{research}} is particularly focused on studying heat transfer enhancement of a photovoltaic (PV) panel by putting an obstacle at the panel’s windward edge. The heat transfer enhancement is performed by disturbing the airflow {{over the surface}} and increasing the heat and momentum transfer. Different objects such as triangular, square, rectangular, and discrete rectangular ribs and partial grids were applied {{at the leading edge}} of a surrogate PV panel and flow and the heat transfer of the panel are investigated experimentally. This approach was selected to expand understanding of effect of these different objects on the flow and turbulence structures over a flat surface by analyzing the flow comprehensively. It is observed that, a transverse object at the plate’s leading edge would cause some flow blockage in the streamwise direction, {{but at the same time}} creates some velocity in the normal and cross stream directions. In addition to that, the obstacle generates some turbulence over the surface which persists for a long downstream distance. Also, among all studied objects, discrete rectangular ribs demonstrate the highest heat transfer rate enhancement (maximum Nu/Nu 0 of 1. 5). However, ribs with larger <b>gap</b> <b>ratios</b> are observed to be more effective at enhancing the heat transfer augmentation at closer distances to the rib, while at larger downstream distances from the rib, discrete ribs with smaller <b>gap</b> <b>ratios</b> are more effective. Furthermore, this work attempted to recognize the most influential flow parameters on the heat transfer enhancement of the surface. It is seen that the flow structure over a surface downstream of an object (flow separation-reattachment behaviour) has a significant effect on the heat transfer enhancement trend. Also, turbulence intensities are the most dominant parameters in enhancing the heat transfer rate from the surface; however, flow velocity (mostly normal velocity) is also an important factor...|$|R
