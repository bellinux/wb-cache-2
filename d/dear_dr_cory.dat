50|$|The {{novel is}} written {{in the form of}} diary entries by <b>Dr.</b> Patrick <b>Cory,</b> a middle-aged {{physician}} whose experiments at keeping a brain alive are subsidized by Cory's wealthy wife. Under investigation for tax evasion and criminal financial activities, millionaire megalomaniac W.H. Donovan crashes his private plane in the desert near the home of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Cory.</b> The physician is unable to save Donovan's life, but removes his brain on the chance that it might survive, placing the gray matter in an electrically charged, oxygenated saline solution within a glass tank. The brainwaves indicate that thought - and life - continue. Cory makes several futile attempts to communicate with it. Finally, one night Cory receives unconscious commands, jotting down a list of names in a handwriting not his own—it is Donovan's. Cory successfully attempts telepathic contact with Donovan's brain, much to the concern of <b>Cory's</b> occasional assistant, <b>Dr.</b> Schratt, an elderly alcoholic.|$|R
