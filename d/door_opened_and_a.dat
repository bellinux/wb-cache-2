60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> short, neutral-tinted {{young woman}} of about twenty-eight appeared.|$|E
60|$|Hal {{heard no}} more. The front <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{stranger}} hurried in.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} before a <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> woman beckoned him.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> officer of Holkar's {{irregular}} horse entered.|$|R
60|$|The man rang <b>a</b> bell, <b>and</b> the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> old {{man came}} out.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{flight deck}} of Kalinin showing the hangar <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Ka-25 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Ka-27.|$|R
60|$|A {{minute later}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> party {{of a dozen}} {{soldiers}} entered.|$|E
60|$|As if {{in answer}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> big burly form stepped forth.|$|E
60|$|Could {{it be the}} landlady? The <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{strange man}} entered the room.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> old man, stooped and bent, {{with long}} white hair, entered the room.|$|R
60|$|As Tom {{ran through}} the hallway {{on the third floor}} <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> old woman confronted him.|$|R
60|$|An {{hour later}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> officer entered, {{followed}} by a soldier with a large bowl of broth and some bread.|$|R
60|$|He {{had just}} regained his chair when the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gentleman stepped in.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> respectable, {{middle-aged woman}} entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl's clothes.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped {{off their}} hats.|$|E
6000|$|They all turn as the <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> FOOTMAN {{enters with}} a [...] tray of whiskey, gin, lemons, and soda water. In dead silence [...] the FOOTMAN puts the tray down.|$|R
6000|$|... [LADY ELLA, {{prepares to}} receive EDWARD. THE SQUIRE and RECTOR [...] stand transfixed. The <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bare arm gently pushes [...] EDWARD forth. He is bandaged {{with a smooth}} towel. There is a [...] snuffle--HANNIBAL has broken the scarf, outside.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is still}} {{three or four}} minutes before the time we agreed upon, Victor," [...] Harry said in a loud voice, for at this moment {{one of the other}} <b>doors</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> woman came out with a basket in her arms.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> slave girl {{brought in a}} basin of strong broth.|$|E
60|$|Terence now {{seized the}} bell and rung it vigorously. The <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> terrified face {{appeared}} at the window.|$|E
60|$|The cellar <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> man crept softly {{down the}} rickety steps. The crowd watches him with silent awe.|$|E
6000|$|Just {{then one}} of the outer <b>doors</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> man came in. He was an officer of the ship. A terrible gust of wind came in with him. The officer closed the door again immediately, and seeing the boys, he said to them,-- ...|$|R
60|$|The cab {{presently}} {{turned up}} <b>a</b> side road <b>and</b> approached {{the stone wall}} of a fair-sized estate, the mansion of which stood back {{in a patch of}} old trees. As they entered the gateway Dave saw <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> boy came out on a veranda.|$|R
60|$|In a few minutes, the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> elderly gentleman, with grayish hair, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mild <b>and</b> {{pleasant}} {{expression of}} countenance, came in. He nodded to Jonas as he entered, and Jonas rose to receive him. The gentleman {{then took a}} seat by the fire, and asked Jonas to sit down again.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> little girl, with bright eyes and flaxen hair, bounded into the room.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> clerk {{asked them to}} follow him, as Mr. Levine was now disengaged.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few words}} I told my story. I had hardly {{finished}} when the back <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gentleman stepped out.|$|E
60|$|Lucilla {{was still}} sitting in the place which she had {{occupied}} when I withdrew. On hearing the <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> man's footsteps entering, she of course assumed {{that the man was}} Oscar. She had penetrated his object in leaving her to follow me out, and it had not improved her temper.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> old woman entered. She uttered an exclamation of astonishment at seeing Harry, and turning angrily to the girl, {{spoke to her}} in the gypsy dialect. For two or three minutes the {{conversation}} continued in that language; then the old woman turned to Harry, and said in English: ...|$|R
60|$|Almost at {{once the}} <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> inward, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> curious personage stepped out.|$|R
60|$|At that moment, the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> girl rushed in. She {{looked at}} Hal, {{and then gave}} a cry of surprise.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> small, white face, out {{of which}} gleamed a pair of bright, black eyes, was thrust {{sideways}} into the room.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Shelby was {{standing}} before his dressing-glass, sharpening his razor; and {{just then the}} <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> colored boy entered, with his shaving-water.|$|E
60|$|They hoped now to {{be rewarded}} for their exertions with a few hours' repose. Vain hope! Scarcely had they closed their eyes when the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> old woman, with nose and chin of the {{nutcracker}} type, entered the room. This was the grandmother of the family; {{she had come to}} look at the strangers.|$|R
60|$|In {{a second}} the <b>door</b> was <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> stout <b>and</b> harsh-looking woman appeared.|$|R
60|$|Ere {{he could}} reply {{he heard the}} <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> {{observed}} <b>a</b> tall white figure approaching him.|$|R
