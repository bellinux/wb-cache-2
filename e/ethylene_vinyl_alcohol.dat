Microbiological analysis, permeability of the films to oxygen and fat loss, caused by melting, were assessed after pressure or thermal treatment. Microbiological analysis showed a noteworthy reduction in the total aerobic mesophilic flora and eradication of the coliform flora, whichever film or treatment was used. Nevertheless, a significant bacterial flora was observed during storage at 4 °C from 42 days with a polyethylene/polyamide/polyethylene film and a sample which had been treated with pressure. But, treatment at 550 MPa for 55 °C and 20 min, in combination with two low oxygen permeability films (<b>ethylene</b> and <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> copolymer) gave a product with long storage life (90 days) at 4 °C and {{a significant reduction in}} the melting of lipids...|$|R
30|$|Ethylene–vinyl acetate {{copolymers}} (EVA) are widespread materials, with hot-melt adhesives {{and plastic}} wraps being common applications [54]. Although free-radical copolymerizations usually produce gradient or block polymers, perfectly random copolymers are {{obtained from the}} polymerization of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>vinyl</b> acetate due to similar reactivities [55]. However, undesired and random branching is inherently promoted via a back-biting process, significantly altering the characteristics and performance of the copolymers. However, perfectly linear ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers can be prepared by means of ADMET polymerization [56]. A number of monomers with various methylene run lengths ranging from 8 to 12 were subjected to polymerization and subsequent hydrogenation, furnishing copolymers with different vinyl acetate contents (acetate branches separated by 18 – 26 carbons). Commercial samples with similar vinyl acetate ratios were compared with the ADMET copolymers. Similar to the commercial copolymers, the precision polymers displayed a linear relationship between the melting temperature and vinyl acetate content, but with dissimilar slopes. A larger slope, underlining the precision factor, evidenced the greater order in precision polymers. With a similar approach, copolymers of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> were made without difficulty.|$|R
40|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of biodegradable polymers obtained from renewable sources are their dominant hydrophilic character, fast degradation rate and, in some cases, unsatisfactory mechanical properties particularly under wet environments. One possible {{solution to this}} problem is to reduce the water-uptake ability of these materials and to enhance the respective mechanical behaviour by chemical modification. In this work, three based starch blends with: (i) a copolymer of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (SEVA-C), (ii) cellulose acetate (SCA), and (iii) poly-e-caprolactone (SPCL); were chemically modified by chain crosslinking. This modification is based on the reaction between the starch hydroxyl groups and tri-sodium tri-meta phosphate. The obtained compounds were characterized by FTIR and the respective properties were assessed and compared to the original materials by means of the hydration degree, the degradation behaviour, contact angle measurements and mechanical testing. The results show that the water-uptake of these blends could be reduced up to 15 % and that simultaneously stiffer materials with a less pronounced degradation rate can be obtained...|$|R

The Surface of HAp particles has been modified with 2 -carboxyethylphosphonic acid {{in order to}} enhance the interfacial bonding interaction between HAp and EVA, and hence to improve the mechanical properties of the composite. The interfacial modification has been investigated through Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal analyses. The Surface morphology of the composite and the homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix have been investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) respectively. The use of phosphonic acid coupling agent promotes the uniform dispersion of HAp particles in the polymer matrix with strong particle-polymer interfacial bonding, which leads to a significant improvement in mechanical properties of the composite. The cell viability test indicates that the HAp-EVA nanocomposite is cytocompatible. The developed HAp-EVA nanocomposite may be potentially used as bone substitutes. (c) 200...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} unravel synthetic routes to form three C 2 H 4 O isomers—acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO), ethylene oxide (c-C 2 H 4 O), and <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (CH 2 CHOH) —in extraterrestrial ices via electronic energy transfer processes initiated by electrons in the track of MeV ion trajectories. Here we present the results of electron irradiation on a 2 : 1 mixture of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ethylene (C 2 H 4). Our studies suggest that suprathermal oxygen atoms can add to the carbon-carbon bond of an ethylene molecule to form initially an oxirene diradical (addition to one carbon atom) and the cyclic ethylene oxide molecule (addition to two carbon atoms) at 10 K. The oxirene diradical can undergo a [1, 2]-H shift to the acetaldehydemolecule. Both the ethylene oxide and the acetaldehyde isomers can be stabilized in the surrounding icematrix. To aminor amount, suprathermal oxygen atoms can insert into a carbon-hydrogen bond of the <b>ethylene</b> molecule, forming <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Once these isomers have been synthesized inside the ice layers of the coated grains in cold molecular clouds, the newly formed molecules can sublime as the cloud reaches the hot molecular core stage. These laboratory investigations help to explain astronomical observations by Nummelin et al. and Ikeda et al. toward massive star-forming regions and hot cores, where observed fractional abundances of these isomers are higher than can {{be accounted for by}} gas-phase reactions alone. Similar synthetic routes could help explain the formation of acetaldehyde and ethylene oxide in comet C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale-Bopp) and also suggest a presence of both isomers in Titan’s atmosphere.

40|$|The {{relentless}} {{increase in}} the demand for useable power from energy-hungry economies continues to drive energy-material related research. Fuel cells, as a future potential power source that provide clean-at-the-point-of-use power offer many advantages such as high efficiency, high energy density, quiet operation, and environmental friendliness. Critical to {{the operation of the}} fuel cell is the proton exchange membrane (polymer electrolyte membrane) responsible for internal proton transport from the anode to the cathode. PEMs have the following requirements: high protonic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, impermeability to fuel gas or liquid, good mechanical toughness in both the dry and hydrated states, and high oxidative and hydrolytic stability in the actual fuel cell environment. Water soluble polymers represent an immensely diverse class of polymers. In this comprehensive review the initial focus is on those members of this group that have attracted publication interest, principally: chitosan, poly (<b>ethylene</b> glycol), poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol),</b> poly (vinylpyrrolidone), poly (2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic acid) and poly (styrene sulfonic acid).

50|$|The {{amount of}} shelf life {{enhanced}} by a vacuum bag {{is dependent on}} the structure in the material. A standard vacuum bag is composed of a PA/PE structure where PA is for puncture resistance and PE is for sealing. The high barrier category includes the usage of more layers focused on the prevention of oxygen permeability, and therefore shelf life protection. There are two materials used in high barrier structures, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) and <b>ethylene</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (EVOH). Shelf life indication can be effectively measured by how many cubic centimeters of oxygen can permeate through 1 square meter of material over a 24-hour period. A standard PA/PE bag allows on average 100 cubic centimeters, PVDC allows on average over 10, and EVOH on average 1 cubic centimeter. Multi-layer structures allow the ability to use strong oxygen-barrier materials for enhanced shelf life protection.

40|$|PURPOSE: The primary {{objectives}} {{of this trial}} were to evaluate the safety and feasibility of treatment and to gain a preliminary indication {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>ethylene</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> injections into the anal sphincters of faecally incontinent patients. METHODS: Between April 2004 and February 2006, we conducted a prospective, single-arm, procedure optimization study of <b>ethylene</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> injections in 21 subjects with well-characterized faecal incontinence and an intact external anal sphincter at two Australian hospitals. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the Cleveland Clinic Florida Faecal Incontinence Score (CCFFIS) (P= 0. 0005) and the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index score (P= 0. 005) after treatment. At 12 months post-treatment, the mean CCFFIS had decreased by 37 % (P= 0. 0021), and 47 % of subjects had a > or = 50 % improvement in CCFFIS. There were significant improvements in embarrassment (P= 0. 0455) and coping/behaviour (P= 0. 0056) domains of the Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life. At 12 months, the mean anal canal length had increased by 29 % (P= 0. 066), with 40 % of patients demonstrating increases of 50 % or more. There were no further improvements following retreatment.

By means of dead-end filtration the poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> solution deposited {{on the surface}} and entered the pores of porous substrate and thus an even poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> gel layer was formed on both the external and internal surface. The effects of poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> concentration, dynamic coating lime, additive concentration, cross-linking agent concentration, curing time and support membrane on pure water flux and protein rejection of the resultant membranes were studied.

The experimental results prove that modified membranes with an even poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> hydrogel layer show dramatically high anti-fooling characteristics compared to inadequately modified and unmodified membranes.

AJNR 1 U 63 - 168, January/February 1990 Some cerebral or dural arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are difficult or impossible to remove surgically because of their size and location. For these AVMs, embolization is the primary radical or adjunctive treatment and is performed by using cyanoacrylate derivatives such as isobutyl 2 -cyanoacrylate (IBCA) [1 - 4]. However, IBCA can glue the balloon to the artery and sometimes polymerize within the catheter, leading to an incomplete injection.
