The council answered that the will must first be discussed with the parliament, and at the following council in Stockholm on May 13, the council tried to keep her from attending. The parliament questioned whether it would be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> health or suitable for a widow to attend council, and that if not, {{it would be hard to}} keep sending a messenger to her quarters. Her reply that the council would be allowed to meet without her and only inform her when they considered it necessary was met with satisfaction from the council.
