5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> {{seed set}} must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> there are no {{problems}} with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E

Each of the three HypSys peptides in tomato is able to activate the synthesis and accumulation of protease inhibitors. When HypSys is silenced the production of protease inhibitors induced by wounding is halved compared to wild type plants <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> both systemin and HypSys are required for a strong defence response against herbivores in tomato.|$|E
