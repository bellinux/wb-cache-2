One is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall have <b>felt,</b> <b>I</b> myself, personally.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E

60|$|As {{we looked}} full at one another, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> my breath come quicker in my {{strong desire to}} get {{something}} out of him.

500|$|Relegation changed Gunn's {{mind about}} taking the Norwich job. He {{had decided not to}} {{continue}} in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship, and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family. However, [...] "Relegation was a failure and I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t quit then. I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had to do everything I could to put things right, if I was given the chance.

500|$|Two weeks {{following}} his announcement, Bayh {{withdrew from the}} race, citing that [...] "the odds were longer than I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could responsibly pursue".

500|$|Pitt {{lost its}} only game to the Cleveland Naval Reserves. On the Naval team was former Tech star Judy Harlan. Harlan stated: [...] "I intercepted a pass and {{returned}} it to midfield in the fourth quarter. I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> at least had evened {{up some of the}} losses we had at Tech." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{two columns}} were filled. When I read them {{over in the}} morning <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> had found my {{legitimate}} occupation at last. I reasoned within myself that news, and stirring news, too, was what a paper needed, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> was peculiarly endowed {{with the ability to}} furnish it. Mr. Goodman said that I was as good a reporter as Dan. I desired no higher commendation. With encouragement like that, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> could take my pen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and the interests of the paper demanded it.|$|R

500|$|Turner had a {{very close}} {{relationship}} with her only daughter, Cheryl (b. 1943).

I was never made to feel that it was anything strange." ...|$|E

500|$|Leto has {{described}} his adolescence as a troubled time, {{in which he}} used drugs and dropped out of school.

[...] Ultimately, Jared helped him recover from drugs.|$|E
500|$|All {{the other}} Beatles went on record about the {{dismissal}} of Best. McCartney stated that Best was [...] "good, but a bit limited." [...] Harrison said that [...] "Pete kept being sick and not showing up for gigs" [...] and admitted, [...] "I was quite responsible for stirring things up. I conspired to get Ringo in for good; I talked to Paul and John until they came round to the idea." [...] For his part, Starr said: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was a much better drummer than he [...] was." ...|$|E

500|$|John Rogers, {{described}} as a [...] "penny-pinching" [...] majority owner of the Phillies, assured Lajoie {{that he would make}} the same salary as Delahanty. However, Lajoie discovered that while he was earning $2,600 ($ in current dollar terms), Delahanty earned $3,000 ($ in current dollar terms) (contracts for NL players were not allowed to surpass $2,400). Rogers increased Lajoie's pay by $200 but the damage had already been done. [...] "Because I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had been cheated, I was determined to listen to any reasonable American League offer", Lajoie said.|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

500|$|The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: [...] "Barton Fink sort of {{washed out}} our brain {{and we were}} able to go back and finish Miller's Crossing." [...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a little further than they expected." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{three-way}} race between Nixon, Humphrey, and American Independent Party candidate former Alabama Governor George Wallace, Nixon defeated Humphrey by nearly 500,000 votes (seven-tenths {{of a percentage}} point), with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace. In his victory speech, Nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together.

500|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby's. There were various {{reasons for his}} disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and Peter Wilson, then {{chairman}} of Sotheby's, used this appeal to the auction house's advantage when using Chatwin {{to try to persuade}} wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become [...] "burnt out" [...] and said, [...] "In the end I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> might just as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour. One's whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead." ...|$|E
