50|$|The first iOS {{version of}} Media5-fone was {{released}} in June 2009. It was built to run iPhone and iPod devices on iOS 3, a non Multi-tasking operating system. Most IP PBX systems and Internet telephony service provider were compatible with the softclient. After this initial release, multiple features upgrade were made; VPN support, configurable ring-tone, Bluetooth, SIP-URI, and compatibility improvements. In January 2010, Media5-fone was released on the OVI Store for the Nokia Smartphones running the S60 3rd Symbian Operating System. This edition survived {{a short period of}} time because of the S60 deprecation. In mid 2010, Apple released iOS 4 and its Multi-tasking support. Media5-fone has since been able to run in the background while another app was in the foreground. This brought the iOS edition of the softclient on even ground with the Symbian OS that already supported Multi-tasking. In February 2011, SRTP, SDES and TLS were added as additional features. In September 2011, Media5-fone was released on the Android Market (today Google Play). Since 2012, minor improvements were made and a new edition (Media5-fone MPS) supporting remote <b>Device</b> <b>Provisioning</b> was released.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{deals with}} a design of a new {{automatically}} provisioned embedded system. Through the years of our active development a highly advanced platform has been created. This platform, called BEESIP, is meant for the embedded network devices, and allows them to act as telephony exchanges, secured access points, VPN concentrators, etc. As the key feature of the BEESIP platform a unique building and provisioning system of the network devices has been developed allowing the administrators to fully control the firmware and configuration of the devices even in the remote and inaccessible locations. The process of custom firmware building and <b>device</b> <b>provisioning</b> eases the mass deployment of the BEESIP based hardware to cover the needs of small to medium businesses in vast range of services.

40|$|Abstract: In this era, {{commercialization of}} IT and {{enterprise}} mobility has been envisaged where corporate employees utilized mobile {{devices such as}} laptops, smartphones and tablets, to work at anytime, anywhere and from any-device for personal and business purposes. In this way corporates improved productivity, employee retention, flexible work environment, IT value-added to business and reduced running costs. Nevertheless, it also culminated into critical risks to company’s systems since employees had uncontrolled access to the infrastructure as such vulnerable to security and data abuse. It was in view of that this work envisaged on the Telecom Namibia Enterprise Mobile Architecture (TNEMA), a system developed to enhance security measures, manage and control the use of {{bring your own device}} (BYOD) against the company’s infrastructure. The TNEMA architecture composed of five integrated functional components that included: User Interaction, User Mobile Devices, Access Networks, Enterprise Mobility Infrastructure and Enterprise Backend System.

50|$|The {{vulnerability}} {{exposed by}} the Hopkins team indicates potential security threats {{to millions of}} vehicles which are protected using DST-based immobilizer systems, and to the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass system. The ideal {{solution to this problem}} is to replace the DST transponder in these systems with a <b>device</b> <b>provisioned</b> with a more robust cryptographic circuit utilizing a longer key length. However, the cost of recalling these security systems is prohibitively high, and-- as of October 2005-- neither Texas Instruments, Exxon-Mobil or any vehicle manufacturer has announced such a recall. Currently the most effective protections against this attack rely on user vigilance, e.g., protecting transponder keys, auditing Speedpass invoices for fraud, and optionally using a metallic shield (such as aluminum foil) to prevent unauthorized scanning of DST tags. This vulnerability has also spawned the creation of the RSA Blocker Tag and RFID Blocking Wallets.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{burden of}} hearing {{impairment}} and disability is substantial {{in the developing}} world. This review outlines the associated need for amplification devices in low and medium income countries {{and some of the}} initiatives that have been taken to improve access to such devices, particularly hearing aids. The main observed barriers to access are listed and possible ways to improve access are considered. METHODS: Prevalence estimates for disabling hearing impairment are reviewed and a number of national and international examples of initiatives to facilitate use of hearing assistive devices in low and medium income countries are provided. Technologies that are potentially appropriate for hearing instruments in developing countries are suggested, as well as fitting programs that {{are more likely to be}} maintained over the long term. RESULTS: Challenges to successful hearing instrument fitting in low and medium income countries are many. However, some programs point the way to improved access to such devices. Successful hearing aid fitting programs in developing countries have typically combined appropriate technology with a sustainable local support base. CONCLUSIONS: With a rising middle class in many developing countries, advances in technology, and ongoing training programs for those involved in amplification fitting, hearing device usage rates may eventually reach parity with those in developed economies. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: The historical development of affordable hearing <b>device</b> fitting <b>provision</b> in low and middle income countries is outlined. Three key barriers to widespread access to hearing <b>device</b> <b>provision</b> in many low and middle income countries (LMICs) are identified: lack of trained personnel, the high cost of many existing devices marketed in LMICs and limited public awareness of the benefits of hearing assistive technologies.

40|$|A {{person in}} need of an active wheelchair, whether an {{emerging}} need or as a replacement, stands before a number of decisions, not only concerning how to gain a wheelchair with adequate properties, but also con-cerning these properties per se. In order to make informed decisions, one prerequisite is knowledge on the matters being decided, and another is cooperation with health care {{professionals in the field}} of assistive <b>devices</b> <b>provision.</b> Earlier research on provision has revealed that user experiences of having sufficient in-formation is closely related to user satisfaction. Lack of user involvement may result in discontinuance, or the continued use of a sub-optimal wheelchair due to not having any other choice, resulting in reduced health. Therefore, involvement of users in this process is warranted. In this chapter, provision of active wheelchairs is discussed in relation to HL (Health literacy) and PCC (Person-centered care) as means of increasing the quality of the supply process from a user-centered perspective.

40|$|Signatures are on file in the Graduate School. As {{processor}} speeds {{continue to}} advance {{at a rapid}} pace, accesses to the I/O subsystem are increasingly becoming the bottleneck {{in the performance of}} large-scale applications.
