[...] This was contradicted by Script coordinator Cath-Anne Ambrose who said [...] "I had to get Froot Loops cleared , and so the guy calls me back and says, 'Well how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about Eggo Waffles? Would you consider using Eggo Waffles instead of Froot Loops?' So I go to these guys [...] and ask, 'How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about waffles?' And they're like, 'No! It's Froot Loops! It's a time loop! No!' Waffle sales were down." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, {{the meaning}} to [...] "Talk" [...] {{is based on}} how Martin [...] "wants to teach us how to feel better about ourselves, and his lessons have the moral superiority {{disguised}} as sensitivity that marked Bono's mighty mullet period." [...] Tyrangiel interpreted the lyrics, [...] "Are you lost or incomplete/ <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece/ Tell me how you feel", with Martin begging in the song.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E
500|$|Later, Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa {{short and}} {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "literally the funniest thing 'd ever seen," [...] and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network. During the negotiations, Parker and Stone brought {{up the idea of}} a Mr. Hankey episode, with Parker claiming to have asked [...] "one thing we have to know before we really go any further: how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about talking poo?" [...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which {{would be one of the}} main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The first episode of the series, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".|$|E
500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One thing we have to know before we really go any further: how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about talking poo?" [...] The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said {{was one of the main}} reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.|$|E

500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This {{turned out to be a}} Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E

In 1840 she translated Ranke's History of the Popes, which was warmly praised by Thomas Babington Macaulay and Henry Hart Milman.

Lewis wrote to her saying, [...] "Murray is very desirous that you should undertake some original work. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> a 'Beruf' of this sort?"
