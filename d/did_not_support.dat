5|$|A {{photograph}} of the Rhoads' letter was published on January 27, 1932 in La Democracia, the Unionist newspaper of Antonio Rafael Barceló, with a translation in Spanish of the entire letter. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> Albizu Campos' theory of a US conspiracy against Puerto Rico. On February 13, El Mundo published the entire letter, in both Spanish and English.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> the coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> Jadid's actions. Later, {{in an interview with}} Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should have been resolved in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his view, to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E

5|$|Separated populations {{from the}} Danube Delta and the Pannonian Basin (see Distribution and habitats) were {{described}} as two subspecies, T.dobrogicus dobrogicus and T.dobrogicus macrosoma, in 2000.

5|$|The {{effect of}} his (and his advisors') {{policies}} {{was to make}} the Great Powers' parties more powerful, not less.

5|$|The phylogenetic {{analysis}} of Graham and Barrett (2004) supported the infrageneric division of Narcissus into two clades corresponding to Fernandes' subgenera, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> monophyly of all sections. A later extended analysis by Rønsted et. al. (2008) with additional taxa confirmed this pattern.|$|E

5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1780s, Catherine {{slightly}} favored Poniatowski {{over the}} opposition, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> {{any of his}} plans for significant reforms. Despite repeated attempts, Poniatowski failed to confederate the sejms, which would have made them immune to liberum veto. Thus, although he had {{a majority in the}} Sejms, Poniatowski was unable to pass even the smallest reform. The Zamoyski Code was rejected by the Sejm of 1780, and opposition attacks on the king dominated the Sejms of 1782 and 1786.|$|E

5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} Charles W. Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was not chosen as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma President David Boren wrote {{a letter}} to Big12 {{commissioner}} Kevin Weiberg asking for the loss to be erased from Oklahoma's record, something that Weiberg <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support.</b> Weiberg did say that he would raise concerns about the Pac-10 policy of using their own officials for inter-conference games in Pac-10 stadiums. Bob Stoops said that he may cancel the 2008 game scheduled at Washington if the Pac-10 officiating policy is not changed.|$|E
5|$|On immigration, Moran {{supported}} a pathway to citizenship {{for illegal immigrants}} and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> decreasing the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country or the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local police. He was a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform ASAP Act of 2009 (H.R.4321), which the House did not pass. He was given an overall immigration reduction grade of D by NumbersUSA. The American Immigration Lawyers Association scored him as having voted 31 times for the organization's position and 7 times against the organization's position.|$|E

Balthasar Báthory and his allies were captured and murdered in late August 1594. Sigismund also confiscated Andrew's Transylvanian estates. The Diet confirmed the prince's acts, convicting Andrew and his brother, Stephen, of treason.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by critics. Jeffrey Rosen, who reviewed {{the book for}} The New York Times, {{was surprised by the}} author's departure from traditional civil libertarian views. Rosen pointed out that Lewis <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> absolute protection for journalists from breaking confidentiality with their anonymous sources, even in situations involving criminal acts. Nat Hentoff called the book an engrossing and accessible survey of the First Amendment. Kirkus Reviews considered the book an excellent chronological account of the First Amendment, subsequent legislation, and case law.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} {{largely ignored}} the governor's message {{in favor of}} partisan concerns. A pure food and drug law was enacted without his signature. His veto of controversial legislation regulating railroad rates, however, was sustained. Both houses passed a resolution calling for the resignation of Senator William Lindsay, a Gold Democrat who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> William Jennings Bryan's presidential bid, on grounds {{that he no longer}} represented the interests of his party. Lindsay responded that he represented the people of Kentucky and refused to resign his seat.|$|E

5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of the}} hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in name only, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> the saquarema {{ideology and}} leadership. During {{the years following}} 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster {{a majority in the}} Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{abandoned}} their fortified camp on Mount Bábolna, most probably because they needed new provisions. They moved towards Dés, pillaging the noblemen's manors during their march. They threatened all who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> them with severe punishments. They established a new {{camp on the}} Szamos (Someș) River near the town. A new battle was fought between the rebels and their enemies near the camp in late September.|$|E
