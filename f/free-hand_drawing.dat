25|$|In 1890 Nyström won a state {{grant to}} travel and study abroad, {{studying}} at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890-91, and travelling throughout Europe. He travelled to Italy and Greece, exploring the ancient architecture, as well as around France and to England, where he was {{particularly interested in the}} medieval church architecture. During his time abroad he kept detailed notebooks and sketchbooks (nowadays held in the Museum of Finnish Architecture archives). In 1892, soon after returning to Finland, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Polytechnic Institute (founded 1879), where he himself had previously been a student, a position he held {{for the rest of his}} life, and where the head of the school at the time was Gustaf Nyström. He was a highly skilled draftsman and his talent was used first in teaching linear and <b>free-hand</b> <b>drawing.</b> In 1901 he was promoted to lecturer in architecture, teaching ancient and medieval architecture and their styles, along with exercises in design and drawing. For many years Nyström also taught ornamentation and style history at the Central School of Applied Arts in Helsinki (precursor to the present-day Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture). He received the honorary title of professor in 1922. It has often been noted by his former students how very popular he was as a teacher, in part due to his keen sense of humour but also in conveying something of his drawing skills to the students. He also had a significant role in spreading the Art Nouveau style to several generations of students.|$|E

Methods: A descriptive and qualitative study held in the municipal district of Acaraú - CE with 10 children aged 4 to 6 years old, who did not present strong pain between August and September, 2006. At first, we applied the modified VPT (Venham Picture Test), an instrument containing a set of figures of children in different emotional states, which were presented to each child so that he pointed to what he considered to be further identified at the time. The second test, held before the consultation, consisted in asking to the children to <b>free-hand</b> <b>draw</b> the dental office, the dentist and auxiliary personnel asking to each child: {{what do you think}} about the dental office and the dentist? The drawings were submitted to idiographic analysis and categorized in units of significance for interpretation. Results: Three children on VPT and nine children on the drawings presented an increased level of anxiety. Causing factors such as the motor (high speed rotation), tooth extraction and white clothes could be found. Final considerations: By means of drawing we were able to efficiently obtain results in identifying some factors that cause fear and anxiety to the child patient. The modified VPT showed to be quick, easy to apply and acceptable to children, but sometimes was contradictory with the drawings...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that asymmetries noted in certain nonlinguistic tasks used in {{laterality}} studies (e. g., facial affect judgment, line bisection) may in part be influenced by prior reading/writing habits. The present study examined the relative influence of reading/writing direction and handedness on the direction of stroke movement in <b>free-hand</b> figure <b>drawing.</b> One hundred twenty right and left handed brain-intact adult readers of scripts with opposing directionality (Hindi vs Urdu) and illiterate controls were observed while drawing a tree, a hand, a house, an arrow, a pencil, and a fish. Right-handers (including right-handed illiterates) and left-to-right readers drew most figures in a left-to-right direction, whereas left handers (including left handed illiterates) and right-to-left readers more often drew the figures from right to left. These results extend previous findings and contribute to {{a growing body of}} evidence demonstrating reading scan biases in nonlinguistic perception and production tasks.

40|$|Standard {{approaches}} for ellipse fitting {{are based on}} the minimization of algebraic or geometric distance between the given data and a template ellipse. When the data are noisy and come from a partial ellipse, the state-of-the-art methods tend to produce biased ellipses. We rely on the sampling structure of the underlying signal and show that the x- and y-coordinate functions of an ellipse are finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals, and that their parameters are estimable from partial data. We consider both uniform and nonuniform sampling scenarios in the presence of noise and show that the data can be modeled as a sum of random amplitude-modulated complex exponentials. A low-pass filter is used to suppress noise and approximate the data as a sum of weighted complex exponentials. The annihilating filter used in FRI approaches is applied to estimate the sampling interval in the closed form. We perform experiments on simulated and real data, and assess both objective and subjective performances in comparison with the state-of-the-art ellipse fitting methods. The proposed method produces ellipses with lesser bias. Furthermore, the mean-squared error is lesser by about 2 to 10 dB. We show the applications of ellipse fitting in iris images starting from partial edge contours, and to <b>free-hand</b> ellipses <b>drawn</b> on a touch-screen tablet...|$|R
40|$|Diagrams are ubiquitous; {{they are}} used to {{communicate}} ideas and are often used to model aspects of the real world. We teach with them and expect students to develop modelling skills using them. In conventional, paper-based assessment, we do not think twice about asking students to <b>draw</b> <b>free-hand</b> diagrams to express both their knowledge and drawing skills. In e-Assessment, the situation is very different. There is very little support for assessing diagramming skills and where students can draw free-form diagrams (with a drawing tool) the assessment has to be human. In this paper we discuss an approach to the automatic marking of a certain class of diagrams (almost graph-based) illustrating how we have incorporated domain knowledge, pedagogy and marking schemes into the process. In particular, the paper examines the general strategy for automatic marking based on meaningful units and how marking schemes are constructed. The paper concludes with the results of applying our method to a corpus of student diagrams and illustrates how the consistency afforded by automatic marking can overcome some of the deficiencies in human marking...|$|R
40|$|School {{curricula}} and teachers have traditionally suggested that creativity is only possible in {{subjects such as}} art, music, drama and dance. However the digital technology now available to schools can offer users opportunities to be creative in different ways and in other subject areas. Using ideas from recently published UK reports on creativity and creative thinking, grade 1 and 2 students in three classes used pencil and paper to draw houses and people, and then used a computer software package to draw other items. The software package allowed students to <b>draw</b> <b>free-hand,</b> to use built-in graphics features including colour for lines and fill, and to use text. No {{attempt was made to}} compare products from the two media forms for creativity.

40|$|The Problem: Sketching is {{a natural}} and {{integral}} part of software design. Software developers use sketching {{to aid in the}} brainstorming of ideas, visualizing programming organization, and understanding of requirements. Unfortunately, when it comes to coding the system, the drawings are left behind. We see sketch recognition as a way to bridge that gap. In addition to the vast amount of information given by a sketch, a plethora of other design information may be voiced during a software design meeting. We can capture the spoken and visual software design meeting information by videotaping the meeting and any white-boards used. By indexing these videos, we make it easy to retrieve the videotaped information without watching the entire video from start to finish. Motivation: We want to allow software design meetings to continue as they are, with software designers discussing the design and <b>drawing</b> <b>free-hand</b> sketches of these designs on a white-board. Using our system, designers can sketch naturally, as we place few requirements on the sketcher. We recognize and interpret these diagrams using sketch recognition. Because the diagrams are interpreted, we provide natural editing capabilities to the designers, allowing the users to edit their original strokes in an intuitive way. For instance, the designer can drag their drawn class from the center and move al...|$|R
40|$|Reproducibility of {{myocardial}} contour determination in cardiac {{magnetic resonance}} imaging is important, especially when determining T 2 * values per myocardial segment as a prognostic factor of heart failure or thalassemia. A method creating a composite image with contrasts optimized for drawing myocardial contours is introduced and compared with the standard method on a single image. A total of 36 short-axis slices from bright-blood multigradient echo (MGE) T 2 * scans of 21 patients were acquired at eight echo times. Four observers <b>drew</b> <b>free-hand</b> myocardial contours on one manually selected T 2 * image (method 1) and on one image composed by blending three images acquired at TEs providing optimum contrast-to-noise ratio between the myocardium and its surrounding regions (method 2).
