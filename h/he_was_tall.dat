25|$|Above medium {{pace and}} right-handed, Geary {{was able to}} swing the new ball very {{effectively}} but relied {{for most of his}} success on his amazing persistence and ability to bowl with slight yet well-disguised variations of pace and cut. He was able to bowl quite incredible numbers of overs on unresponsive pitches, as shown in the last Test of the 1928/1929 Ashes tour, when he bowled an amazing 81 overs on a typical billiard-table Australian wicket in very hot weather. Because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and very solidly built, he was able both to get bounce and to bowl the long spells required for success in Australian conditions which destroyed the reputations of all English bowlers of slighter build.|$|E
25|$|He is {{described}} as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a long beard. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and slender and his hair and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats and other foods he deemed unhealthy. He was seldom sick before his last decade when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself (to the approval of physicians). He {{had a sense of}} humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah and was able to recite this 7th century poet's work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah's name.|$|E
25|$|Peter Post (12 November 193314 January 2011) was a Dutch {{professional}} cyclist {{whose career}} lasted from 1956 to 1972. Post competed in road and track racing. As a rider {{he is best}} remembered for Six-day racing, having competed in 155 races and won 65. Because of this success {{he was known as}} “De Keizer van de Zesdaagse” or “The Emperor of the Six Days”. In road racing his main achievements were winning the 1964 Paris–Roubaix and becoming national road race champion in 1963. He was on the podium three times at the La Flèche Wallonne but never won. Post’s other nickname was “de Lange” or “Big Man” because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> for a cyclist. After retiring from racing he had success as a Directeur sportif. Peter Post died in Amsterdam on 14 January 2011.|$|E

25|$|Turgenev never married, but he {{had some}} affairs with his family's serfs, one of which {{resulted}} in the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Paulinette. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and broad-shouldered, but was timid, restrained, and soft-spoken. When Turgenev was 19, while traveling on a steamboat in Germany, the boat caught fire and Turgenev reacted in a cowardly manner. Rumors circulated in Russia and followed him for his entire career, providing the basis for his story A Fire at Sea. His closest literary friend was Gustave Flaubert, with whom he shared similar social and aesthetic ideas. Both rejected extremist right and left political views, and carried a nonjudgmental, although rather pessimistic, view of the world. His relations with Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were often strained, as the two were, for various reasons, dismayed by Turgenev's seeming preference for Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Book 2 of the Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus {{contains}} {{roughly the}} same information as the Chronicon Lethrense and the Annales Lundenses, i.e. that Ro (Hroðgar) and Helgo (Halga) were the son of Haldanus (Healfdene). When Haldanus died of old age, Ro took the land and Helgo the water. One day during his sea roving, Helgo arrived at Thurø, where he found and raped the young girl Thora, which resulted in Urse (Yrsa). When Helgo after many years returned to Thurø, Thora avenged her lost virginity by sending Urse to Helgo who, unknowingly raped his own daughter. This resulted in Roluo, who was a gifted man, both physically and intellectually and as brave as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall.</b> After some time Helgo repelled a Swedish invasion, avenged Ro by killing the Swedish king Hothbrodd, and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he committed suicide due to shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse. Roluo succeeded him.|$|E
25|$|Benaud {{was not a}} large spinner of the ball, but he {{was known}} for his ability to extract {{substantial}} bounce from the surface. In addition to his accurate probing consistency, he possessed a well-disguised googly and topspinner which tricked many batsmen and yielded him many wickets. In his later career, he added the flipper, a combination of the googly and top spinner which was passed to him by Bruce Dooland. Coupled with his subtle variations in flight and angle of the delivery, he kept the batsman under constant pressure. Benaud had the tendency to bowl around the wicket {{at a time when he}} was one of the first players to do so; it had an influence on spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Ashley Giles. Benaud was regarded as one of the finest close-fielders of his era, either at gully or in a silly position. As a batsman, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and lithe, known for his hitting power, in particular his lofted driving ability from the front foot.|$|E

25|$|Roope {{was born}} in Fareham, Hampshire. After {{spending}} five years developing his cricketing talent at St John's School in Porthcawl, he was educated at Bradfield College in Berkshire, and played for Public Schools against Combined Services at Lord's in 1963 and 1964. He played Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire in 1963, before making his county cricket debut for Surrey in 1964. He received his Surrey cap in 1969. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and wiry, with distinctive curly hair. He was an all-rounder: an outstanding slip fielder, often said {{to be one of}} the best of his generation, he was also an attacking middle-order batsman and a medium-pace bowler. He took fifty first-class wickets in 1968, and 5–14 against the touring West Indians in 1969, but bowled less later in his career. He was a member of the Surrey sides that won the County Championship in 1971; making a major contribution with 1,641 runs and an exceptional 59 catches in all first-class matches; and the Benson & Hedges Cup in 1974. He retired from full-time first-class cricket after the 1982 season, and played his last first-class match in 1986. In a career of 403 first-class matches, he scored 19,116 runs at 36.90, and took 225 wickets at 37.35, as well as holding 599 catches and making two stumpings as a substitute wicket-keeper. He scored over 1,000 runs in a season on eight occasions.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} and versatile player, Gullit epitomised {{the ethos of}} Total Football as he was naturally adept in several positions, and was capable of aiding his team defensively as well as offensively due to his work-rate, ball-winning abilities, and tactical intelligence {{in addition to his}} skill and physical qualities. Normally deployed as an attacking midifielder or as a second striker, he was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or along the front-line, on either wing or even in the centre, and could also play as a sweeper. Regarded {{as one of the greatest}} players of all-time, his foremost attribute was his athleticism, as he used his strength and speed, combined with his technique, to great effect; he was also strong in the air, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall,</b> powerful, and an excellent jumper. Yet, unusually for a man of his stature, Gullit was an elegant player, who also possessed outstanding natural balance, poise, technical ability, and dribbling skills, which gave a graceful style to his game. Gullit also was noted for his intelligence, creativity, vision, and spatial abilities, qualities that helped him score goals early in his career and enabled him to play in a deeper role as a playmaker late in his days, where he was known for creating chances for teammates. Gullit thus combined physical presence with flair, mental acuity, formidable technique and natural touch, to become an iconic figure in world football. Despite his talent, Gullit struggled with injuries throughout his career, which later affected his fitness.|$|E

500|$|Writer Neville Cardus {{described}} Chapman as [...] "the schoolboy's {{dream of}} the perfect captain of an England cricket eleven. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall,</b> slim, always youthful, and pink and chubby of face. His left-handed batting mingled brilliance and grace... His cricket was romantic in its vaunting energy but classic in shape." [...] While batting, Chapman always tried to attack the bowling; although this meant he made mistakes which resulted in his dismissal, it meant that he could {{change the course of}} a game in a short time. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow described him as: [...] "Tall, strong, and lithe, he was a left-handed hitter with orthodox defence, much of which was rendered unnecessary by a vast reach, and an ability to drive good-length balls over the head of mid-off, bowler, and mid-on. His cover-driving, too, was immensely strong." [...] Gibson notes that Chapman's career batting figures were good, but that critics believed that, with his talent, he should have scored more runs. Gibson writes: [...] "When Chapman was going well, he looked quite as good as Woolley [...] at the other end, and in the mid-1920s there was no other English left-hander, possibly no other England batsman at all except Hobbs, of whom that could be said." [...] His increased weight in the 1930s robbed him of confidence and slowed him down to the point where his batting declined. When batting, Chapman usually wore the Quidnuncs cap.|$|E
