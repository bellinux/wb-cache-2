Most of its voters sided with the ÖVP, which became the largest party in Austria with 43% of the vote. Nevertheless, the coalition government of the ÖVP and FPÖ was revived after the election; however, there was increasing criticism within the FPÖ against the party's mission of winning elections at any cost.|$|E

5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Port Arthur on {{the second}} day of the war, Poltava was hit twice in the aft hull, Petropavlovsk was hit three times in the bow and Sevastopol was hit once. Between them, the three ships lost two men killed and seven wounded and none of them {{suffered}} any significant damage. Tsar Nicholas II relieved Stark and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov who assumed command on 7 March. On 31 March, Petropavlovsk and Poltava sortied to support Russian cruisers and destroyers engaging their Japanese counterparts, but they headed back to Port Arthur to join the rest of the Pacific Squadron when the main Japanese battlefleet appeared. They ran into a newly laid minefield en route and Petropavlovsk struck at least one of the mines. Observers saw three explosions, one of which appeared to be that of her magazines, and the ship sank <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> minutes. Casualties included Admiral Makarov and his guest, Russian battle artist Vasily Vereshchagin, 26 officers and 652 enlisted men. Only seven officers and 73 crewmen were rescued.|$|E
5|$|July 1986 was {{an unusually}} active month for {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes in California, with three events occurring <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> weeks, each with {{mild to moderate}} effects. The first of these shocks came on July 8 with a M6.0 event on the Banning fault near Palm Springs and the second event occurred {{off the coast of}} Oceanside as a M5.8 shock on July 13. While the earthquake off the southern California coast occurred in an area thought to be capable of generating a tsunami, the earthquake near Palm Springs occurred on a portion of the southern San Andreas Fault system that has been designated a seismic gap, and is a likely location for a very large earthquake. The same seismic gap theory (regarding the potential for a future large earthquake) had also been presented for the White Mountains area near Chalfant.|$|E
5|$|Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7/708 {{declared}} against Hampshire {{and then}} made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 484 runs. The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey, which Macartney missed due to injury. In the latter match, Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first ball of the match, and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored {{while he was in}} the middle. Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in just over two hours of batting. Such was the dominance of Macartney and the rest of Armstrong's men that they disposed of Northamptonshire <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> days. However, his most famed innings was yet to come.|$|E

5|$|Menem {{began his}} {{presidency}} assuming a non-confrontational approach, and appointing {{people from the}} conservative opposition, and business people to his cabinet. To prevent successful legal cases against the projected privatizations, the Supreme Court's numbers were increased from five to nine judges; the new judges ruled in support of Menem and usually had the majority. Other institutions that restrained or limited executive power were controlled as well. When Congress resisted some of his proposals, he used the Necessity and Urgency Decree {{as an alternative to}} send bills to it. He even considered it feasible to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, but this step was never implemented. In addition, he developed a bon vivant lifestyle, taking advantage of his authority. For instance, he made a journey from Buenos Aires to Pinamar driving a Ferrari Testarossa <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> hours, violating speed limits. He divorced his wife Zulema Yoma and expanded the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence with a golf course, a small zoo, servants, barber, and even a buffoon.|$|E
5|$|Such mergers were theorized {{to produce}} kilonovae, and {{evidence}} for a kilonova associated with GRB 130603B was seen. The mean duration of these events of 0.2 seconds suggests (because of causality) a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms; less than 0.2 light-seconds (about 60,000km or 37,000 miles—four times the Earth's diameter). This further suggests a very compact object as the source. The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material (no longer neutronium) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, {{over a longer period}} of time. A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The Cheltenham Festival {{took place}} the {{following}} week with two matches on the College Ground: against Sussex starting on Monday, 19 August; and a return against Yorkshire starting on Thursday, 22 August. Gloucestershire made short work of Sussex, winning by an innings and 24 runs <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> days. Grace made only 2 of Gloucestershire's total of 198 but he was again outstanding with the ball and took 13 wickets in the match (6–18 and 7–88). The Yorkshire match was drawn after being ruined by the weather. Yorkshire had claimed a first innings lead after Grace was yet again dismissed by Tom Emmett, this time for 10, but he compensated by having taken 6–77 to restrict the Yorkshire lead to 39. He captured a further two wickets in the second innings before the match was washed out.|$|E
40|$|Outcome of renal {{transplantation}} <b>in</b> children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> {{years of}} age. Twenty-two renal transplants were performed <b>in</b> 21 children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> {{years of age}} at Children's Hospital. Fourteen were from living related donors and eight were from cadaveric donors. The five year patient and graft survivals of these recipients were compared to all other pediatric recipients between two and 18 years of age who received renal transplants over the same time period. Five year graft survival for recipients <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of age was 86 % following living-related donor transplantation and 38 % following cadaver donor transplantation. Older pediatric recipients aged between two and 18 years had a five year graft survival of 73 % following living-related donor renal transplantation, which {{was similar to that}} for recipients <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of age. Although older cadaveric recipients had a comparable five year graft survival to younger recipients, at 42 %, the patterns of graft loss were different. Graft failures in young recipients occurred within the first seven months post-transplant, whereas the older recipient's grafts failed more gradually. Actuarial five-year patient survival <b>in</b> recipients <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of age was 86 % following living-related donor renal transplantation and 70 % following cadaver-donor renal transplantation. Recipients <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of age had a poorer patient survival than older recipients following both living-related donor renal transplantation (P = 0. 06) and cadaver-donor renal transplantation (P < 0. 05). These findings suggest that the graft survival of living-related donor renal transplantation <b>in</b> recipients <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of age is better than that of cadaver-donor renal transplantation. Furthermore, graft survival of living-related donor renal transplantation <b>in</b> children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of age is the same as that in older children, although patient survival in the younger group may be slightly decreased...|$|R
