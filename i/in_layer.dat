5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E

25|$|As this {{subsurface}} {{movement of}} salt shaped the landscape, erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface.

Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off bits and pieces. Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out. Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches.|$|E

2500|$|Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract {{originate}} from pyramidal cells <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres {{arise from the}} primary motor cortex (about 30%), supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form {{the bulk of the}} pyramidal tracts. [...] The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata. Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as decussation. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. [...] About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract.|$|E

[...] In Japanese quail, beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming. [...] Beak trimmed Muscovy ducks spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim. [...] It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak. [...] Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.|$|E

It wasn't in the least {{at the same time}} that encountered celebrities only thus provoked the shifting play of my small lamp, and this too even though they were easily celebrated, by my measure, and though from the very first I owed an individual here and there among them, as was highly proper, the benefit of impression at the highest pitch.

6000|$|But {{it is best}} {{perhaps to}} take in {{illustration}} some daily custom we have all heard despised as vulgar or trite. Take, {{for the sake of}} argument, the custom of talking about the weather. Stevenson calls it [...] "the very nadir and scoff of good conversationalists." [...] Now there are very deep reasons for talking about the weather, reasons that are delicate as well as deep; they lie <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> upon layer of stratified sagacity. First of all it is a gesture of primeval worship. The sky must be invoked; and to begin everything with the weather is a sort of pagan way of beginning everything with prayer. Jones and Brown talk about the weather: but so do Milton and Shelley. Then it is an expression of that elementary idea in politeness--equality. For the very word politeness is only the Greek for citizenship. The word politeness is akin to the word policeman: a charming thought. Properly understood, the citizen should be more polite than the gentleman; perhaps the policeman should be the most courtly and elegant of the three. But all good manners must obviously begin with the sharing of something in a simple style. Two men should share an umbrella; if they have not got an umbrella, they should at least share the rain, with all its rich potentialities of wit and philosophy. [...] "For He maketh His sun to shine...." [...] This is the second element in the weather; its recognition of human equality in that we all have our hats under the dark blue spangled umbrella of the universe. Arising out of this is the third wholesome strain in the custom; I mean that it begins with the body and with our inevitable bodily brotherhood. All true friendliness begins with fire and food and drink and the recognition of rain or frost. Those who will not begin at the bodily end of things are already prigs and may soon be Christian Scientists. Each human soul has in a sense to enact for itself the gigantic humility of the Incarnation. Every man must descend into the flesh to meet mankind.|$|E
