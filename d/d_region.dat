50|$|Ground wave {{radio signal}} {{propagation}} {{is ideal for}} relatively short distance propagation on these frequencies during the daytime.

50|$|When a {{solar flare}} occurs on the Sun {{a blast of}} intense {{ultraviolet}} and x-ray radiation hits the dayside of the Earth after a propagation time of about 8 minutes. This high energy radiation is absorbed by atmospheric particles, raising them to excited states and knocking electrons free {{in the process of}} photoionization. The low altitude ionospheric layers (<b>D</b> <b>region</b> and E region) immediately increase in density over the entire dayside. The ionospheric disturbance enhances VLF radio propagation. Scientists on the ground can use this enhancement to detect solar flares; by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate when solar flares have taken place.|$|E

The presence of phosphorus on each functionalized surface was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. High-resolution, soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {{was used to evaluate}} the As and Ga 3 <b>d</b> <b>regions</b> of such surfaces. On PEt 3 treated surfaces, the Ga 3 d spectra exhibited a bulk Ga peak as well as peaks that were shifted to 0. 35, 0. 92 and 1. 86 eV higher binding energy. These peaks were assigned to residual Cl-terminated Ga surface sites, surficial Ga 2 O and surficial Ga 2 O 3, respectively. For PCl 3 -treated surfaces, the Ga 3 d spectra displayed peaks ascribable to bulk Ga(As), Ga 2 O, and Ga 2 O 3, as well as a peak shifted 0. 30 eV to higher binding energy relative to the bulk signal. A peak corresponding to Ga(OH) 3, observed on the Cl-terminated surface, was absent from all of the phosphine-functionalized surfaces. After reaction of the Cl-terminated GaAs(111) A surface with PCl 3 or PEt 3, the As 3 <b>d</b> spectral <b>region</b> was free of As oxides and As 0. Although native oxide-terminated GaAs surfaces were free of As oxides after reaction with PCl 3, such surfaces contained detectable amounts of As 0.

5000|$|A {{riometer}} (commonly relative ionospheric opacity meter, although originally: Relative Ionospheric Opacity Meter for Extra-Terrestrial Emissions of Radio noise) is {{an instrument}} used {{to quantify the}} amount of electromagnetic-wave ionospheric absorption in the atmosphere. As the name implies, a riometer measures the [...] "opacity" [...] of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In {{the absence of any}} ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30-40 MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic synchrotron radiation and is absorbed in the Earth's <b>D</b> <b>region</b> of the ionosphere.|$|E

40|$|In situ {{experiment}} of synchrotron small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) {{was used}} to study the lamellar structure change of starch during gelatinization. Waxy corn starch {{was used as a}} model material to exclude the effect of amylose. The thicknesses of crystalline (<b>d),</b> amorphous (<b>d)</b> <b>regions</b> of the lamella and the long period distance (d) were obtained based on a 1 D linear correlation function. The SAXS and WAXS results reveal the multi-stage of gelatinization. Firstly, a preferable increase in the thickness of crystalline lamellae occurs because of the water penetration into the crystalline region. Then, the thickness of amorphous lamellae has a significant increase while that of crystalline lamellae decreases. Next, the thickness of amorphous lamellae starts to decrease probably due to the out-phasing of starch molecules from the lamellae. Finally, the thickness of amorphous lamellae decreases rapidly, with the formation of fractal gel on a larger scale (than that of the lamellae), which gradually decreases as the temperature further increases and is related to the concentration of starch molecular chains. This work system reveals the gelatinization mechanism of waxy corn starch and would be useful in starch amorphous materials processing...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} transplantation antigens (H- 2 antigens) of {{the mouse}} are determined by information in two genetic regions, K and D located {{at opposite ends of}} the H- 2 complex. Products of each K and <b>D</b> <b>region</b> are characterized serologically by private specificities which are restricted to the K or D product of a single H- 2 haplotype or haplotypes presumed to be of a common origin, and by public specificities which are shared among several H- 2 haplotypes. The two locus H- 2 model postulates that there is a single gene product for each K and <b>D</b> <b>region</b> and that the genes coding for these two molecules evolved by gene duplication (1). Limited data corroborating the existence of one K or one <b>D</b> <b>region</b> product each expressing both private and public specificities has been reported in chemical studies (2) and in surface redistribution studies (3, 4), although other recent studies have shown that in one combination the <b>D</b> <b>region</b> molecules reactive with antisera detecting private and public H- 2 specificities do not co-cap on the lymphocyte membrane (5). Since capping depends on accessibility of antigenic determinants to the reagents used, a variety of interpretations of these capping studies are possible.

40|$|In many cases, {{there is}} only limited space inside of the dust cartridge. To {{increase}} the filter surface area, the filter media are pleated to various extents to meet the filtration requirements. In many cases however, one can observe that a pleated medium exhibits a shorter lifetime than one would expect from the corresponding flat sheet media data. One {{of the reasons is}} that the changed flow resistivity of the folding region of the pleat has to be taken care of. The material in the inner part of the fold is compressed while the outer part is stretched. This change in the distribution of the material density directly influences the flow resistivity in the folding region. Eventually, the flow through the entire pleat and the distribution of deposited dirt will be affected, too: The fold <b>ing</b> <b>region</b> is less active than the straight part of the pleat. The aim of the study in this paper is to investigate these effects by analyzing the change of the flow resistance due to the folding of the medium.
