40|$|Based on {{very large}} {{experimental}} data, obtained by shaking table testing of five story, three bay steel frame {{model of a}} hypothetical building with and without GERB BCS, mathematical modeling has been done using CSI SAP 2000 computer program. A large number of analyses have been performed in order to model complex behavior of the BCS, considering different damping coefficients for viscous dampers, various types of spring elements with different properties, all in combination with different connection properties of the <b>foundation</b> <b>frame</b> structure. Verification of analytical model {{has been done by}} comparing analytical and experimental response time histories, FFT amplitude spectra, as well as comparing power in band ratios and analyzing cross correlation functions and coefficients. The effectiveness of the BCS was estimated by comparing experimentally obtained response time histories, for BCS and corresponding fixed base model. Furthermore, the BCS effectiveness is estimated based on analytical data by comparing response time histories and power in band ratios of various kinematic quantities and internal element forces, comparatively for BCS and corresponding fixed base model. The results showed that the BCS has capacity for reducing of inertia forces along the height of the structure by factor more than two, depending of the storey level, comparing with the fixed base case...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the internationalization of Finnish contemporary artists. The {{focus is on}} their exhibitions at contemporary art institutions in Sweden, covering the period 2004 – 2013. The aim is to investigate what makes these exhibitions to materialize. The main question is: How do different actors, networks, collaborations, and the field of artistic production look like when art is exported for exhibition purposes from Finland to Sweden? Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory and the Uppsala internationalization process model are used as the theoretical framework. Information is collected via interviews with three Finnish artists and three Swedish curators. The main {{result is that the}} artists do not actively impact the internationalization process themselves. Rather, the internationalization occurs through an international network of professionals, some acting on behalf of the artists, and some acting in their own interests. The main driving factor for internationalization is that the Finnish art market is small. Consequently, young contemporary artists are oriented internationally. For internationalization to occur, the artists must be available to foreign curators through the international networks. Finland is aware of this and promotes international art contacts through the <b>foundation</b> <b>Frame</b> Visual Art Finland. Important contact surfaces, where curators can learn about the artists, are art events, like European art biennials...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of nearly 7 years of postseismic {{deformation}} measurements using continuously recorded and survey mode GPS observations for the 1999 Izmit-Düzce earthquake sequence. Resolvable, time-dependent postseismic changes to the preearthquake interseismic velocity field extend {{at least as far}} as the continuous GPS station in Ankara, ∼ 200 km southeast of the Izmit rupture. Seven years after the earthquake sequence, the relative postseismic velocity across the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) reaches ∼ 10 – 12 mm/a, roughly 50 % of the steady state interseismic rate, with the highest postseismic velocities within 40 km of the coseismic ruptures. We use a sequence of logarithmic time functions to fit GPS site motions. Up to three logarithmic terms with decay constants of 1, 150, and 3500 days are necessary to fit all the transient motion observed at the continuous GPS stations. The first term is required for the component of site motion parallel to the NAF at near-field sites strongly implicating rapid, shallow afterslip. The intermediate and longer-term postseismic velocity components reflect more broadly distributed strain with a symmetric double-couple pattern suggestive of either localized, deep afterslip or viscoelastic relaxation of the upper mantle and/or lower crust. In two areas (including the Marmara Sea) this pattern is superimposed on north-south extension centered on the NAF. We speculate that this extension may result from aseismic dip slip along coseismically weakened faults, driven by the background tectonic stress.

50|$|The post-war {{worldwide}} {{shortage of}} building materials coupled with huge demands created {{the impetus for}} exploring and using new materials and techniques in Inala. Reinforced concrete {{was used in the}} construction of houses and this choice was made because of its strength, reliably and flexibility. Inala also had an advantage of good access to the local cement and concrete, made from washed river sand, and lime that came from coral dredged from Moreton Bay, shipped up the river by barge and crushed at Darra. Concrete was an ideal material for the fashionable Modernist style. Inala houses were situated on raised concrete <b>foundations,</b> <b>framed</b> with hardwood timber and floored with hard-wearing brushbox. Windows were framed with silky oak. The outer walls were constructed of poured concrete approximately 18 cm thick. Internal walls and ceilings were constructed with rendered wire lath. These robust construction techniques also served to minimise maintenance costs and achieve a long life span of the houses.|$|R

The surfaces of the supporting parts of the foundation are known to wear out and ruin under operating conditions. Substantial financing is required to restore them. The proposed «MM Stahl 1018 » due to its composition and consistency makes it possible to ensure high accuracy contact of the supporting surface and the <b>frames</b> of the <b>foundation,</b> protecting the <b>frames</b> against corrosion as well. The polymeric cylindrical samples mounted into the grooves of the frame have been studied. The aim of the research was to study the stress-strain state of the sample under the action of uniformly distributed pressure, taking into account static and vibratory loads. The results of solving the problem of Michell elasticity theory have been used; the values of normal, shearing and principal stresses in the sample have been obtained. With the help of the Microsoft Excel program, the numerical analysis of the problem for different values of the design parameters of the sample have been carried out and the depth of the samples getting into the grooves in the <b>foundation</b> <b>frames</b> have been calculated. The results of the analysis are tabulated in a table and the strain and stress diagrams have been constructed. The diagrams of stress and strain for the model made in the program Solid Works 3 D of the sample with the same parameters have been created.

50|$|In {{architecture}} and in structural engineering, a joist {{is one of}} a series of horizontal members supporting a ceiling or floor. Joists are supported by <b>foundations,</b> wall <b>framing,</b> or beams. Joists are often laid out in repetitive patterns, much like the ribs of a human body. The intent of the use of this type of framing is to span over an open space below the members. When incorporated into a floor framing system, the joists also serve to provide stiffness to the subfloor sheathing, allowing it to function as a horizontal diaphragm. Joists are often doubled or tripled, placed side by side, where conditions warrant, such as where wall partitions require support.|$|R
