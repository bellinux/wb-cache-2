40|$|Hydatidosis is an <b>endemic</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>disease</b> in {{countries}} where sheep are prolific. This is partic-ularly the case in Mediterranean countries includ-ing North Africa, Spain and Portugal [1]. The par-asite, Echinococcus granulosus, is a cestode that grows in the small intestine of its definitive host, usually a dog. Eggs are eliminated in the faeces and when ingested, liberate their larvae in the duode-num of an intermediate host (sheep or humans). The larvae cross the intestinal wall and via the por-tal system reach the liver where they form cysts. The liver is the organ most frequently infected by this disease (50 – 93 %) [2 – 4]. Without treatment, cysts grow and eventually form fistulas into adjacent organs or rupture int...|$|E

Colposcopy examination revealed dense acetowhite micropapillary epithelium covering the ectocervix, iodine-negative, an erosion area in endocervical canal, and atypical vessels. Histologic examination of the surgical specimens showed numerous calcified schistosome eggs (probably S. hematobium) and a high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The relation between S. hematobium infection and bladder cancer is well known; however, this relationship with cervical cancer remains controversial. The symptoms of schistosomiasis of the female genital tract are rather non-specific, and are often misdiagnosed with other pelvic diseases. The familiarity of health professionals with schistosomiasis of the female genital tract is less than expected, even in endemic regions. Therefore...|$|E

The persistence of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a similar prognosis to that of a non-diseased population. Benznidazole (BNZ) is the only drug with trypanocidal action available in Brazil. A group of 310 patients with chronic Chagas disease who had normal ECGs at the first medical visit performed before 2002 were included. There were 263 patients treated with BNZ and 47 untreated. The follow-up period was 19. 59 years. Univariate analyses showed that those treated were younger and predominantly male. As many as 79. 08 % of those treated and 46. 81 % of those untreated continued with normal electrocardiograms (p < 0. 0001). The occurrence of electrocardiographic abnormalities and relevant clinical events (heart failure, stroke, total mortality, and cardiovascular death) was less prevalent in treated patients (p < 0. 001, p: 0. 022, p: 0. 047 respectively). In multivariate analyses, the parasiticide treatment was an independent variable for persistence of a normal ECG pattern, which was an independent variable in the prevention of significant clinical events. The immunofluorescence titers decreased with the parasitological treatment. However, the small number of tests in untreated patients did not allow the correlation of the decrease of these titers with electrocardiographic alterations. These data suggest that treatment with benznidazole prevents the occurrence of electrocardiographic alterations.

40|$|Schistosomiasis {{remains one}} of the most common <b>endemic</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{affecting}} over 230 million people worlwide. Schistosoma mansoni is the main species causing intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis and the fresh water pulmonate snails of the genus Biomphalaria are best known for their role as intermediate hosts of the parasite. The development of new molecular monitoring assays for large-scale screening of snails from transmission sites to detect the presence of schistosomes is an important point to consider for snail control interventions related to schistosomiasis elimination. Our work was focussed on developing and evaluating a new LAMP assay combined with a simple DNA extraction method to detect S. mansoni in experimentally infected snails as a diagnostic tool for field conditions. A LAMP assay using a set of six primers targeting a sequence of S. mansoni ribosomal intergenic spacer 28 S- 18 S rRNA was designed. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 0. 1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63 °C for 50 minutes. LAMP was evaluated by examining S. mansoni DNA in B. glabrata snails experimentally exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure: early prepatent period (before cercarial shedding), light infections (snails exposed to a low number of miracidia) and detection of infected snails in pooled samples (within a group of uninfected snails). DNA for LAMP assays was obtained by using a commercial DNA extraction kit or a simple heat NaOH extraction method. We detected S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails by using no complicated requirement procedure for DNA obtaining. Our LAMP assay, named Biompha-LAMP, is specific, sensitive, rapid and potentially adaptable as a cost-effective method for screening of intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples.

This study aimed to evaluate whether abnormal blood coagulation and liver function tests in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (n = 55) correlate with the severity of their periportal fibrosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Blood samples were used for liver function tests, hemogram and prothrombin time (International Normalized Ratio, INR). The blood coagulation factors (II, VII, VIII, IX and X), protein C and antithrombin IIa (ATIIa), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) and D-dimer were measured by photometry or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Hyperfibrinolysis was defined {{on the basis of}} PAI- 1 levels and a D-dimer concentration greater than a standard cut-off of 483 ng/mL.

40|$|BackgroundInfectious {{livestock}} diseases {{remain a}} major threat to attaining food security and are a source of economic and livelihood losses for people dependent on livestock for their livelihood. Knowledge of the vital infectious diseases that account for the majority of deaths is crucial in determining disease control strategies and in the allocation of limited funds available for disease control. Here we have estimated the mortality rates in zebu cattle raised in a smallholder mixed farming system during their first year of life, identified the periods of increased risk of death and the risk factors for calf mortality, and through analysis of post-mortem data, determined the aetiologies of calf mortality in this population. A longitudinal cohort study of 548 zebu cattle was conducted between 2007 and 2010. Each calf was followed during its first year of life or until lost from the study. Calves were randomly selected from 20 sub-locations and recruited within a week of birth from different farms over a 45 km radius area centered on Busia in the Western part of Kenya. The data comprised of 481. 1 calf years of observation. Clinical examinations, sample collection and analysis were carried out at 5 week intervals, from birth until one year old. Cox proportional hazard models with frailty terms were used for the statistical analysis of risk factors. A standardized post-mortem examination was conducted on all animals that died during the study and appropriate samples collected. ResultsThe all-cause mortality rate was estimated at 16. 1 (13. 0 - 19. 2; 95 % CI) per 100 calf years at risk. The Cox models identified high infection intensity with Theileria spp., the most lethal of which causes East Coast Fever disease, infection with Trypanosome spp., and helminth infections as measured by Strongyle spp. eggs per gram of faeces as the three important infections statistically associated with infectious disease mortality in these calves.

Mean age of the patients was 3. 7 years. The majority of the cases (91. 5 %) were ≤ 5 years old. Bone-marrow aspiration detected Leishmania amastigotes only in 26. 6 % of cases. Fever (98. 1 %), abdominal protrusion (65. 1 %) and hepatosplenomegaly (63. 7 %) were the most common clinical presentations of the patients. Pancytopenia was noted in 43. 1, anemia in 87. 3 and thrombocytopenia in 64 % of cases. Increase {{in the level of}} AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), alkaline phosphatase, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CRP (C-Reactive Proteins) were seen in 84. 9, 53. 6, 44. 4, 72. 5 and 83. 1 % of cases, respectively. Mortality was noted in 5. 3 % of cases. Deranged haemato-biochemical parameters including total and direct bilirubin, PLT (platelet) and pancytopenia were significantly contributed to mortality from VL. Moreover, clinical features such as severe splenomegaly as well as bacterial infections were meaningfully contributed to death from VL. The majority of patients (74. 9 %) were treated with meglumine antimoniate. Amphotericin B was administrated in 59 of cases, 11 of them were initially treated with meglumine antimoniate with a shift to amphotericin B, because of treatment failure. Findings of the current study demonstrated that VL is present in southwest of Iran with a fairly continual rate during the last 16 years period. Deranged haemato-biochemical parameters along with severe splenomegaly contributed to mortality from VL...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is an <b>endemic</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>disease</b> in Iran. The {{residual}} unpleasant scar of {{this disease}} could be a potentially serious psychological threat to the patients. Based {{on the results of}} our previous study on the efficacy of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in the treatment of CL, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of topical 5 % TCA cream in the treatment of papulonodular leishmaniasis lesions. Methods: In this case series study, among the patients who were referred to skin disease and leishmaniasis research center(SDLRC), 16 patients with positive direct smear for leishmaniasis were randomly selected for treatment with 5 % TCA cream or, twice a day for 8 weeks or up to complete healing(epithelization) of the lesions. At the end of the treatment period, the response rate was assessed as complete cure, partial cure or treatment failure. The size of the scar was measured 6 months after complete epithelization of the lesions. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 12. Results: The mean area of the lesions was 38. 81 ± 81. 9 mm 2 before the treatment, and 3. 6 ± 9. 1 mm 2 at 6 month follow up period. Complete cure was achieved in 1 patient (6. 3 %) at week 2, in 13 patients (86. 7 %) at week 7, and in all patients at week 8. There was no serious reaction in none of the patients. Only one patient had mild erythema at week 2 and edema at the application site at week 5 which completely was resolved within 2 weeks. Conclusion: Our results showed complete cure in all cases at week 8 without any serious side effects. Considering the efficacy of TCA in decreasing the size of the residual scar and its low cost compared to other treatments, 5 % TCA cream could be considered as an alternative modality for intralesional glucantime in the treatment of CL. Further assessment as a double blind randomized clinical trial is warrante...|$|E
40|$|Chagas <b>disease,</b> a major <b>parasitic</b> <b>endemic</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} Trypanosoma cruzi, {{is a public}} health {{priority}} in Latin America, particularly among rural populations with low eco-nomic status. In spite {{of the effectiveness of}} vector control in the past two decades, 1 several countries, including Bolivia, are still highly endemic for this disease. However, the dramatic decrease in vectorial transmission shows the roles of blood transfusion and congenital transmission in the development of Chagas disease. The latter factor became a major concern in non-endemic countries where T. cruzi-infected women of childbearing age are living, both within Latin America and in countries with heavy immigration from the disease-endemic countries.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infectious {{livestock}} diseases {{remain a}} major threat to attaining food security and are a source of economic and livelihood losses for people dependent on livestock for their livelihood. Knowledge of the vital infectious diseases that account for the majority of deaths is crucial in determining disease control strategies and in the allocation of limited funds available for disease control. Here we have estimated the mortality rates in zebu cattle raised in a smallholder mixed farming system during their first year of life, identified the periods of increased risk of death and the risk factors for calf mortality, and through analysis of post-mortem data, determined the aetiologies of calf mortality in this population. A longitudinal cohort study of 548 zebu cattle was conducted between 2007 and 2010. Each calf was followed during its first year of life or until lost from the study. Calves were randomly selected from 20 sub-locations and recruited within a week of birth from different farms over a 45 km radius area centered on Busia in the Western part of Kenya. The data comprised of 481. 1 calf years of observation. Clinical examinations, sample collection and analysis were carried out at 5 week intervals, from birth until one year old. Cox proportional hazard models with frailty terms were used for the statistical analysis of risk factors. A standardized post-mortem examination was conducted on all animals that died during the study and appropriate samples collected. RESULTS: The all-cause mortality rate was estimated at 16. 1 (13. 0 - 19. 2; 95 % CI) per 100 calf years at risk. The Cox models identified high infection intensity with Theileria spp., the most lethal of which causes East Coast Fever disease, infection with Trypanosome spp., and helminth infections as measured by Strongyle spp. eggs per gram of faeces as the three important infections statistically associated with infectious disease mortality in these calves. Analysis of post-mortem data identified East Coast Fever as the main cause of death accounting for 40 % of all deaths, haemonchosis 12 % and heartwater disease 7 %. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate the impact of <b>endemic</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>diseases</b> in indigenous animals expected to be well adapted against disease pressures. Additionally, agreement between results of Cox models using data from simple diagnostic procedures and results from post-mortem analysis underline the potential use such diagnostic data to reduce calf mortality. The control strategies for the identified infectious diseases have been discussed. The Wellcome Trust (grant No. 079, 445) [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Hydatid {{disease is}} <b>endemic</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>disease</b> of the Mediterranean countries. It may develop in {{any part of}} the body. The {{location}} is mostly hepatic (75 %) and pulmonary (15 %), and only 10 % occur {{in the rest of the}} body, (1) with renal involvement occurring in only less than 5 % of confirmed cases (2 - 6). We report a sixty year old male with calcified left renal hydatid cyst, with history of hydatiduria, who had to be subjected to nephrectomy. A 60 year old male presented with history of episodic pain left lumbar area for last 2 years. The clinching point in this patient having hydatid kidney was history of passing grape like structures in urine that is hydatiduria for last 2 years. This patient was a nomad with history of being in contact with livestock and canines. Physical examination revealed a hard mass in left lumbar area about 9 cm x 4 cm in size which moved little with respiration and was ballotable. Plain KUB was done which revealed calcification in left renal area. Intravenous urogram revealed non-functioning left kidney. No evidence of hydatid disease was found in any other organ of body. This patient being a case of isolated calcified hydatid cyst left kidney, with total destruction of renal parenchyma, was subjected to total left nephrectomy. Hydatidosis is an endemic disease caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus. Renal involvement in seen in less than 5 % of confirmed cases. Isolated hydatid disease of the kidney is a rare condition that can be challenging to diagnose (7). It remains clinically silent for a long time, and only presents at the stage of complications. Hydatiduria, which is observed in 10 - 30 % of the cases, is the only pathognomic feature (8). The treatment is mainly based on surgery (9). The resection of the prominent dome remains the standard option as it allows preservation of the kidney, but total nephrectomy has to be proposed in cases of renal destruction (10) ...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (CL) is an <b>endemic</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>disease</b> {{of major}} health impact {{in many parts}} of the world and is caused by several species of the protozoan parasite Leishmania. Antimonial compounds (i. e glucantime and pentostam) are the first-line treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis with emerging drug resistance as a problem. The control of Leishmania is further complicated by the emergence of drug-resistant parasites. In the clinical settings, resistance to SbV containing drugs is now well established and it was found to occur in South America, Europe, the Middle East and most notably in India. Clinical resistance to organic pentavalent antimonials, in the form of sodium stibogluconate (pentostam) or N-methylglucamine antimoniate (glucantime), has long been recognized. However, it is unknown whether the clinical failure of chemotherapy is attributable to the development of drug resistance mechanisms in the parasite or to a variety of host factors that might also contribute to low drug response. Reported rate of drug-resistance to antimonial compounds in Iran varies from 9. 4 % to 94. 2 % and there is not any comprehensive study on this issue. Indeed, in the endemic region treatment with SbV fails in more cases; thus, in general patients infected with resistant parasites are unresponsive although exceptions have been reported. This article aims to review the mechanisms of drug resistance to these compounds. The main resistance factors include genetical, enzymatic, intracellular (such as apoptosis and cytoskeleton changes) and resistance proteins. Also, mechanisms related to drug transport and intracellular activation are discussed. Various methods of drug resistance detection such as culture and molecular methods (i. e polymerase chain reaction) are reviewed. Although the exact mechanism of action glucantime is not clear, it seems that protein and gene factors involved in cellular drug entry are the main causes of drug resistance. Cross-sectional studies on meglumine antimoniate resistance in endemic areas of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iran are highly recommended. Also, studies for evaluation of alternatives therapies for antimonial resistant cases are required.    ...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Leishmaniasis is an <b>endemic</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>disease</b> {{reported}} sporadically throughout Iran. Golestan province {{is one of}} the 17 zoonotic {{cutaneous leishmaniasis}} (ZCL) foci. In this study, ecoepidemiological characteristics of ZCL were investigated in Gonbad-e Kavus County, Golestan province of Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in three endemic villages and one ZCL-free village by exploiting a stratified random sampling methodology in 2013. To understand particular time-allocation and activity patterns, sandflies were entrapped twice per month using sticky traps from May to October 2013. Records of daily maximum and minimum temperatures (°C) obtained from the meteorological station were used to calculate accumulated degree days (ADD) for Phlebotomus papatasi sandflies using an online software, viz. degree-day calculator, available from the website of Integrated Pest Management, University of California. The computational ADD and expected stage appearance for P. papatasi sandflies were evaluated along with the phenological events. Human infection indices were investigated in the study areas as well. Results: In the entomological survey, a total of 13 different sandfly species were identified. Sergentomyia sintoni (66. 8 %) and P. papatasi (20 %) were observed to be the most dominant species. Monthly activity of the different species of sandflies started from early May to mid-October, with two peaks observed in early July and midSeptember, and the peak of hourly activity occurred at night (1900 - 2000 hrs). According to the phenological study, population dynamics of P. papatasi was completely in agreement with ADD required for the various stages of their growth. Epidemiologically, the highest incidence of ZCL was observed in the age group of 30 - 34 yr (29. 4 %). Interpretation & conclusion: Higher incidence of the disease was seen in the northern and the northeastern parts of the province bordered by Turkmenistan. The most effective alternative for controlling the disease in this hypoendemic focus is health education regarding personal protection from infected P. papatasi. The long-term studies are imperative for better understanding and estimation of the factors affecting ZCL transmission in the endemic areas. © 2016, Malaria Research Center.

5000|$|The {{majority}} of India {{lies in the}} tropical climate zone, which may {{have a negative impact}} on its agricultural and overall economic development. The climate thesis of economic development was first argued by Adam Smith and recently by David Landes in his The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Tropical areas generally average enough rainfall, but the timing is often irregular and unpredictable. The rain drops are large and the rate of fall often torrential. One answer to irregular moisture is storage and irrigation, but this is countered in these regions by incredibly high rates of evaporation. In the Agra region of India, for example, rainfall exceeds the needs of local agriculture for only two months in the year, and the excess held in the soil in those wet months dries up in only three weeks. [...] Tropical zones are also more prone to <b>endemic</b> water-borne and <b>parasitic</b> <b>diseases</b> such as cholera and malaria. As a result of climate change, the Gangotri Glacier, among others, is receding. Also, of the 3 million premature deaths in the world that occur each year due to outdoor and indoor air pollution, the highest number are assessed to occur in India.|$|R
