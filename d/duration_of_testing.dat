50|$|There are 3 main testing techniques; Natural Weathering, Accelerated Natural Weathering and Artificial Weathering.

The results show that the carburized layers can prevent surface plastic deformation and improve the wear resistance of the steel during the early stage of the wear process. However, subsurface plastic deformation occurs beneath the layer, leading to the catastrophic failure of the layer and a transition in the wear rate after a limited <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> The thickest layer tested produces the best wear performance under the present rolling-sliding test conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of consolidation characteristics forms {{an important aspect}} {{in the design of}} foundations and other earth-retaining structures. The conventional consolidation test as originally proposed by Teaaghi takes considerable time (more than 15 days in highly compressible soils with low coefficient of consolidation) and effort. Any effort to reduce the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> will be desirable from several considerations. In this paper, an attempt has been made to propose a rapid method of consolidation testing. In the proposed method, the next load increment is applied as soon as the necessary time required to identify the percent consolidation is reached and to evaluate the coefficient of consolidation by one of the popular curve-fitting procedures. The rectangular hyperbola method has been used to identify the percent consolidation reached after any load increment, and to determine the coefficient of consolidation, before making the next load increment. The time required to complete the test using the rapid consolidation method could be as low as 4 - 5 h compared with 1 or 2 weeks {{in the case of the}} conventional consolidation test...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} fiber-reinforcement on the {{behavior}} of a highly plastic clay during desiccation and infiltration of water were investigated in this study. Soil specimens were prepared with and without fiber-reinforcement and subjected to identical infiltration and desiccation stages over a period of nine months.

The presence of the fibers was not, however, found to influence the total volumetric strains of the soil specimens during the desiccation stages. The desiccation of the clay also increased the maximum (saturated) hydraulic conductivity of the soil by approximately two orders of magnitude. While the presence of fiber-reinforcement did not significantly affect the hydraulic conductivity of the clay at high suctions, a reduction in the initial rates of evaporation and infiltration of water into the fiber-reinforced soil column was measured...|$|E

In the United States, with its vast infrastructure {{of concrete and}} steel bridges, superhighways, and reinforced concrete buildings, billions of dollars have been spent on corrosion protection. Among the commercial technologies available today, migrating corrosion inhibitors (MCIs) show versatility in their use as admixtures, surface treatments, and in rehabilitation programs. The effectiveness of two commercial inhibitors applied to the reinforced concrete surface was evaluated. The corrosion behavior of the steel rebar was monitored using AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Corrosion potentials and polarization resistance values corroborated the inhibiting effects of the amine carboxylate and amino alcohol chemistry in an aggressive environment. The MCI products have successfully inhibited corrosion of the rebar in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution for <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> MCI protected samples showed an average corrosion rate of 0. 34 compared to untreated samples that were 1. 50 This will increase the life expectancy by more than 15 years.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{software}} firms now rely on public beta testing {{to improve the quality}} of their products before commercial release. While the benefits resulting from improved software reliability are well recognized, some important market-related benefits have not been studied. Through word-of-mouth, public beta testers can accelerate the diffusion of a software product after its release. Additionally, because of network effects, public beta testers can increase users’ valuation of a product. In this study, we consider both reliability-related and market-related benefits, and develop models to determine the optimal number of public beta testers and the optimal <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> Our analyses show that public beta testing can be profitable even if word-of-mouth and network effects are the only benefits. Furthermore, when both benefits are considered, there is significant “economies of scope”—the net profit increases at a faster rate when both word-of-mouth and network effects are significant than when only one benefit is present. Finally, our sensitivity analyses demonstrate that public beta testing remains highly valuable to software firms over a wide range of testing and market conditions. In particular, firms will realize greater profits when recruiting public beta testers who are interested in the software but unable to afford it...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of the number of {{averaged}} responses on the measurement of transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). Methods: The study was performed on the background of a universal newborn hearing screening program implemented in laso Maternity Hospital. Two groups of full-term newborns with normal otoacoustic emissions were studied. The first group included 58 newborns (115) ears, in which 260 low-noise samples, provided by the default setting of the equipment used (ILO 88), were presented. The second group included 58 newborns (113) ears, in which 20 - 50 averaged responses were presented, until the "pass" criteria would be met. Statistical comparison between the following parameters recorded during TEOAE measurement was performed: Overall response, signal-to-noise ratios, reproducibility (whole and partial), stimulus intensity, stimulus stability, input noise, noise rejection level and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> Results: Statistically significant differences were found in most of these parameters, except for overall response, stimulus intensity and noise rejection Level. Conclusions: Although a smaller number of clicks is usually sufficient to obtain a "pass" in newborn hearing screening programs, the quality of recording of TEOAEs is significantly improved by increasing the number of averaged tow-noise responses.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of packaging industry accelerated reliability testing for evaluation of lifetime of electronic components are increasingly utilized. In addition to common active thermal cycling procedures, accelerated mechanical fatigue testing provides a new possibility to assess the reliability of microelectronic components, mainly due to the significantly shorter <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> time. In this investigation we have used an ultrasonic fatigue testing system in combination with a special experimental set-up for qualification and lifetime determination of microelectronic interconnects. Using this technique, fatigue life of Al wire bonded interconnects were determined and S-N curves (shear stress {{as a function of}} loading cycles) up to N= 109 were plotted. Three dimensional elasto-plastic FEM simulations were performed to determine the distributions of shear stress and plastic strain generated during cyclic fatigue in the bond area. Furthermore, the FEM model was employed to predict the lifetime of wire-bonds. The results were correlated to the lifetime curves of similar bonds obtained by power cycling tests. Detailed microstructural investigations were performed by means of EBSD -SEM to study the evolution of microstructure of the interconnects subjected to thermal and mechanical fatigue loading. This study demonstrates the applicability of accelerated mechanical fatigue testing as an alternative to time consuming thermal cycling for qualification of microelectronic interconnects...|$|E
40|$|While {{evaluating}} various {{options for}} liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant management for lunar missions, Innovative Engineering Solutions (IES) conceived the flexible screen device {{as a potential}} simple alternative to conventional propellant management devices (PMD). An apparatus was designed and fabricated to test flexible screen devices in liquid nitrogen. After resolution {{of a number of}} issues (discussed in detail in the paper), a fine mesh screen (325 by 2300 wires per inch) spring return assembly was successfully tested. No significant degradation in the screen bubble point was observed either due to the screen stretching process or due to cyclic fatigue during testing. An estimated 30 to 50 deflection cycles, and approximately 3 to 5 thermal cycles, were performed on the final screen specimen, prior to and between formally recorded testing. These cycles included some "abusive" pressure cycling, where gas or liquid was driven through the screen at rates that produced differential pressures across the screen of several times the bubble point pressure. No obvious performance degradation or other changes were observed over the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> In summary, it is felt by the author that these simple tests validated the feasibility of the flexible screen PMD concept for use with cryogenic propellants...|$|E

30|$|For {{the static}} bending test, a {{universal}} testing machine of 200 -kN capacity (made by Tokyokoki Seizosho Ltd.) {{was used for the}} 100 -kN range. Third-point loading was applied with a total span of 360  cm. The total span deflection of green round timber was measured using the CDP- 100 displacement gauge with 10 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection. The targeted <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> was 5  min. The apparent Young’s modulus was obtained based on the total span deflection, and calculated at the middle circumference of the round timber. The bending strength was calculated at the circumference of a failure part from the ratio of the mid-length circumference to the circumference at the loading point. However, 9 of the 40 green round timbers did not show failure, even at the extension limit of the testing machine’s ram cylinder. For these specimens, load at the extension limit of the test machine’s ram cylinder was considered the maximum load. For the air-dried round timber, the total span deflection was measured using the rolled-in type DP- 500 E displacement gauge with 50 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection of air-dried round timber. All air-dried round timbers failed within the extension limit of the ram cylinder.|$|E

Pers. ] genotypes agronomically evaluated for 3 years (1974 through 1976) {{at each of}} four Oklahoma locations. Mean squares, estimated variance components, and regression analysis were used to draw conclusions. The first-order genotype × year (GY) interaction had a statistically nonsignificant (P>. 05) mean square and a relatively small variance component (σ ̂ 2 GY = 0. 11). The mean square and the variance component attributable to the genotype × location (GL) interaction effect were respectively, significant (P <. 05), and of intermediate magnitude (σ ̂ 2 GL = 0. 33). The genotype × replication in location GR(L) and the second-order genotype × location × year (GLY) interactions had highly significant (P <. 01) mean squares and large variance components (σ ̂ 2 GR(L) = 0. 73, σ ̂ 2 GLY = 0. 64). The results emphasized the considerable magnitude of GE interactions and the necessity for multiple environment testing through time and space to characterize relative genotypic differences. The nonsignificant mean square and the relatively small variance component attributable {{to the effect of}} years indicates that the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> is less important than the number of locations at which the testing is conducted.

We further assume that the mean lifetime is equal to where the covariates xi form an orthogonal Hadamard-type matrix which depends on testing conditions, and �i are the unknown parameters. n 0 devices are put on test. The period of testing, t 0, is divided into k stages of length ti, i= 1, [...] .,k, and {{on each of these}} stages all devices operate under a fixed testing regime. (The number of different testing regimes, k, equals to the number of parameters to be estimated). Each device which fails is immediately restored and continues to operate. A closed maximum likelihood solution is given for estimates of �i which exists if and only if at least one failure has been observed on each of the testing stages. Also the approximate optimal duration of the i-th testing stage, ti*, which would provide the minimum of is derived. It is shown that the near-optimal testing policy is obtained when ti* is proportional to the square root of the mean lifetime for the corresponding testing regime. Finally, the expression for the Fisher information matrix is derived and the optimality criterion (which is the trace of its inverse) is expressed as a function of model parameters �i, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> stages ti, and the number of devices operating on each of the testing stages...|$|E
