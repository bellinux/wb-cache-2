25|$|According to an {{independent}} survey, {{one out of every}} two Israeli families has been helped by Yad Sarah. The organization serves Jews, Christians, Muslims and Druze, as well as tourists with disabilities. Its menu of free or nominal-fee services include lending of medical and rehabilitative equipment, oxygen service, wheelchair transportation, national <b>emergency</b> <b>alarm</b> system, services for the homebound, legal aid for the elderly, geriatric dentistry, day rehabilitation centers, a play center for special needs children, and an education and recreation club for retirees. Yad Sarah receives no government funding, but relies on donations to meet its $23 million operating budget. It exports its expertise to developing countries and has established similar models in various countries. Yad Sarah is a recipient of the Israel Prize and has been awarded advisory status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} adoption of wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) in process control. Many real-world process control systems must handle various emer-gency alarms under stringent timing constraints {{in addition to}} regular control loops. However, despite considerable theo-retical results on wireless control, the problem of incorporat-ing <b>emergency</b> <b>alarms</b> in wireless control has received little attention. This paper presents, {{to the best of}} our knowl-edge, the first systematic approach to incorporate <b>emergency</b> <b>alarms</b> into wireless process control. The challenge in emer-gency communication lies in the fact that emergencies occur occasionally, but must be delivered within their deadlines when they occur. The contributions of this work are three-fold: (1) we propose efficient real-time emergency communi-cation protocols based on slot stealing and event-based com-munication; (2) we build an open-source WirelessHART pro-tocol stack in the Wireless Cyber-Physical Simulator (WCPS) for holistic simulations of wireless control systems; (3) we conduct systematic studies on a coupled water tank sys-tem controlled over a 6 -hop 21 -node WSAN. Our results demonstrate our real-time emergency communication ap-proach enables timely emergency handling, while allowing regular feedback control loops to effectively share resources in WSANs during normal operations...|$|R

Examples of home modifications include installing ramps and rails, altering kitchen and bathroom areas (relocating switches and lowering bench heights), installing <b>emergency</b> <b>alarms.</b>|$|R

5000|$|When {{the captain}} {{learned of the}} fire, he {{attempted}} to close the bulkhead fire doors on Deck 3. The fire doors were not configured for fully automatic closing and did not respond since <b>emergency</b> <b>alarms</b> near the doors had not been manually triggered by passengers or crew. A vehicle storage area ventilated by large fans to remove exhaust fumes was also located nearby, and the fans pulled air through an improperly secured fire door and caused rapid fire progress from Deck 3 through Deck 4 and Deck 5 via stairways located on either end.|$|R
50|$|On January 1, 2004, an {{explosion}} occurred at Santos's Moomba processing facility. The blast was {{traced to the}} Liquids Recovery Plant (LRP), where an inlet manifold and a related flange weld both failed after corrosion by mercury. Mercury was released along with a cloud of flammable gases including methane, ethane, propane and butane. Workers saw the cloud and raised the alarm, shutting down the plant and evacuating to designated safety points. Some workers allegedly did not hear the <b>emergency</b> <b>alarms.</b> The gas cloud ignited on contact with a heating unit 150 metres away, and {{an explosion}} followed. The plant was seriously damaged.|$|R
40|$|Determining {{whether the}} number of {{vehicles}} reporting an event is above a threshold is an important mechanism for VANETs, because many applications rely on a threshold number of notifications to reach agreement among vehicles, to determine the validity of an event, or to prevent the abuse of <b>emergency</b> <b>alarms.</b> We present the first efficient and secure threshold-based event validation protocol for VANETs. Quite counter-intuitively, we found that the z-smallest approach offers the best tradeoff between security and efficiency since other approaches perform better for probabilistic counting.

5000|$|The National <b>Emergency</b> <b>Alarm</b> Repeater (NEAR) was a {{civilian}} emergency warning device in the United States. It was a 2-3" [...] (5-7.5 cm) square box designed to plug into a standard power outlet {{to receive a}} special signal sent over the electric power transmission lines. Research and testing for the NEAR program was developed in 1956 during the Cold War to supplement the existing siren warning systems and radio broadcasts {{in the event of}} a nuclear attack. The advent of the radio Emergency Broadcast System rendered NEAR obsolete, although a severe disadvantage inherent in the Emergency Broadcast system was that it required a television or radio to be turned on for a household to receive the <b>emergency</b> <b>alarm,</b> whereas NEAR did not. Despite this advantage, upon the introduction of the Emergency Broadcast system, the stockpiled NEAR repeaters were destroyed by their respective manufacturers.|$|E
