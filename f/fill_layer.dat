A polymer/solvent [poly(ether-sulfone) / 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone] system filled with alumina powder is extruded into a nonsolvent bath to form the fibers which are then dried and sintered at high temp. to give alumina fibers. The fibers were characterized using a combined dry and wet gas permeation method and using SEM. Fibers were coated using simple dip coating techniques to study the effects on minimizing defects and max. pore size. More complex techniques have not been used, {{as there is no}} need to reduce median pore size given the intended application. Finally fibers were constructed into a module for parallel flow phase contacting. Mass transfer studies were carried out on removal of dissolved O from H 2 O, Ar was used as a stripping gas. Varied liq. flow, tube side pressure and gas flow were studied. The results were compared with predictions based on known mass transfer correlations for hollow fiber contactors. Mass transfer was strongly limited by diffusion through the liq. filled membrane. By increasing tube side pressure the liq. /gas interface could be driven back across the fiber wall resulting in effectively 2 mass transfer <b>layers,</b> one liq. <b>filled</b> <b>layer,</b> and one gas <b>filled</b> <b>layer.</b> Mass transfer is far faster in the gas <b>filled</b> <b>layer</b> so overall mass transfer is improved as the liq. <b>filled</b> <b>layer</b> is reduced.

40|$|Most design {{models for}} basal {{reinforced}} piled embankments design the geosynthetic reinforcement (GR) {{as a single}} biaxial layer. In practice, however, the required strength and stiffness is frequently divided into two ore more GR layers {{with or without a}} layer of granular material in between. This paper compares three geogrid-systems : (1) one GR layer consisting of one biaxial geogrid and a (2) one GR layer consisting of two uniaxial geogrids installed directly upon each other and (3) two geogrids with a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> in between. Five model tests have been carried out to study the differences between these three systems. This test series has been presented earlier by Van Eekelen et al. 2012 a. The present paper presents part of the results. It was shown that the behaviour of the first two systems is the same: the GR stiffness of the biaxial geogrid is apparently the same as the summed stiffness in each direction of the two uniaxial grids. It was also shown that the application of a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> between the two GR layers results in a slightly more linear dependency of the net load on the fill aan in the end of the tests, in slightly more arching. However, the differences are very small. The GR stiffness, for example, has much more influence than whether or not a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> has been applied between the two GR layers. It is therefore concluded that the stiffness and strength of two or more GR layers can be summed, thus 1 + 1 = 2 indeed...|$|E
40|$|Simple unpaved roads {{consist of}} a layer of coarse {{granular}} material placed directly {{onto the surface of}} weak or compressible ground. It is thought that the construction of such roads can be considerably improved by the incorporation of a geogrid {{at the base of the}} granular <b>fill</b> <b>layer.</b> Geogrids are a type of geotextile, distinguished by their relatively large aperture size. Laying out a geogrid on the surface of the ground before placing the <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> may in many cases allow a reduced thickness of fill material to be used, and may also substantially increase the load required to cause a complete failure of the system. No generally accepted design method exists for the construction of reinforced unpaved roads, due to the complex mechanisms which govern deformations in the system. The primary aim of this dissertation was to investigate the performance, in such a construction, of a particular geogrid, namely Tensar, manufactured by Netlon Ltd. A detailed model study into failure mechanisms was undertaken using laboratory apparatus constructed to conduct work at 1 / 4 full scale. Simple plane-strain, monotonic footing tests were carried out on systems consisting of a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> compacted onto a consolidated clay subgrade, both with and without the incorporation of a model grid at their interface. The testing technique included a comprehensive study of photographs taken of marker movements in the clay through the transparent sides of the test-box during tests. The relevant failure mechanisms associated with reinforced and unreinforced systems were established. In addition the significance of shear stresses acting at the subgrade surface was recognised and a concept whereby the appropriate subgrade bearing capacity factor is related to these shear stresses was developed. The modelling techniques adopted in this work obviated the need for a centrifuge...|$|E

Investigations included backhoe trench excavation, test unit excavation, shovel test unit excavation, and monitoring of internet cable installation. Three deposits of faunal remains were encountered during backhoe trench excavations and fully excavated during test unit excavations. Remains consisted primarily of green sea turtle (Cheloniidae). Additional shovel test units were excavated in the area where a proposed irrigation system will be installed.

30|$|Use of {{granular}} piles, GP, in weak soils (e.g., soft {{clay and}} loose sand) {{is now a}} well known ground improvement technique. In case of loose granular soil, the provision of granular pile enhances the bearing capacity of foundation and reduces its total and differential settlements. However, in case of soft cohesive soil, it has an additional advantage of providing a drainage path, which increases the rate of consolidation. Granular piles may be fully penetrated and resting on strong soil layer (i.e., end bearing granular piles, EBGP) or partially penetrated (i.e., floating granular piles, FGP). The floating granular piles are considered an economic alternative system to fully penetrated granular piles in case of deep weak soil layer or in case of lightly loaded structures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the heat, air, and moisture conditions of slab-on-ground of a heated building. Measurements show that the coarse-grained fill or drainage layers beneath heated slab-on-ground struc-tures are warm and moist throughout the year. Moisture migration: gravitational water, ground water table, capillary action and diffusion, keep these layer moist throughout the year. The water vapor content of the warm and moist <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> is usually higher than the content of the indoor air. Thus, the diffusion flow is directed into the indoor air, despite the existing heat flow into the opposite direction, and the ground is a moisture source for the structures above. Therefore, thermal and moisture conditions of the fill layers have the major effect on the overall moisture behavior of ground slabs: on the drying times of the fresh in situ cast concrete slab, and on the thermal and moisture behavior of the structure in normal long-term conditions. These conditions are also favorable for microbe growth, which is very common in fill layers. Fungal or bacterial growth was detected in 98 % of the test specimens taken beneath the ground slabs of heated buildings. These conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{shortage}} of available and suitable construction sites in city centres {{has led to}} the increased use of problematic areas, where the bearing capacity of the underlying deposits is very low. The reinforcement of these problematic soils with granular fill layers is one of the soil improvement techniques that are widely used. Problematic soil behaviour can be improved by totally or partially replacing the inadequate soils with layers of compacted granular fill. The study presented herein describes the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the multi-linear regression model (MLR) to predict the bearing capacity of circular shallow footings supported by layers of compacted granular fill over natural clay soil. The data used in running the network models have been obtained from an extensive series of field tests, including large-scale footing diameters. The field tests were performed using seven different footing diameters, up to 0. 90 m, and three different granular <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses. The results indicate that the use of granular fill layers over natural clay soil has a considerable effect on the bearing capacity characteristics and that the ANN model serves as a simple and reliable tool for predicting the bearing capacity of circular footings in stabilized natural clay soil...|$|E

The current study investigates the implications of different soil matrix types (anthropogenic <b>fill</b> <b>layer,</b> peat, clay, and sand) and bioavailability on bioremediation of an aged diesel contamination from a heterogeneous site. In addition to an uncontaminated sample for each soil type, samples representing two levels of contamination (high and low) were also used; initial TPH concentrations varied between 1. 6 and 26. 6 g TPH/kg and bioavailability between 36 and 100 %. While significant biodegradation occurred during 100 days of incubation under biostimulating conditions (64. 4 - 100 % remediation efficiency), low bioavailability restricted full biodegradation, yielding a residual TPH concentration. Respiration levels, {{as well as the}} abundance of alkB, encoding mono-oxygenases pivotal for hydrocarbon metabolism, were positively correlated with TPH degradation, demonstrating their usefulness as a proxy for hydrocarbon biodegradation. However, absolute respiration and alkB presence were dependent on soil matrix type, indicating the sensitivity of results to initial environmental conditions.

40|$|Welding of duplex {{stainless}} steel pipeline {{material for the}} oil and gas industry is now common practice. To date, research has been conducted primarily on the parent material and heat affected zones in terms of its susceptibility to various forms of corrosion. However, there has been little research conducted on the degree of sensitisation of the various successive weld layers, namely the root, fill and cap layers. The focus of this research study was to: (i) provide an in-depth microstructural analysis of the various weld passes, (ii) study the mechanical properties of the weld regions; (iii) determine degree of sensitisation of the various weld passes; and (iv) investigate the residual stress levels within the various regions/ phases of the welds. Four test conditions were prepared using manual Gas Tungsten Arc Welding with &# 039;V&# 039; and &# 039;U&# 039; bevel configuration. Structural analysis consisted of (i) optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and magnetic force microscopy; (ii) ferrite determination using Magna-Gauge, Fischer Ferrite-scope and Point Count method. Mechanical testing consisted of Vickers hardness measurements, Charpy impact studies and transverse tensile testing. The degree of sensitisation was determined by three test methods: a modified ASTM A 262, ASTM A 923 and a modified Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiodynamic Reactivation (DL-EPR) test. Residual stress levels were determined using two neutron diffraction techniques: a reactor source and a time of flight spallation source. Microstructure observed by optical microscopy and magnetic force microscopy shows the formation of both fine and coarse structures within the weld metal. There was no evidence of secondary austenite, being present in any of the weld metal conditions examined. In addition, no detrimental intermetallic phases or carbides were present. The DL-EPR test results revealed that the <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> regions for all four conditions and the base material showed the highest values for Ir/Ia and Qr/Qa. All four test conditions passed the ASTM A 262 and A 923 qualitative type tests, even under restricted and modified conditions. Residual stress measurements by neutron diffraction conducted at Lucas Heights Hi-Flux Reactor revealed that the ferrite phase stress was tensile in the heat affected zones and weld, and appeared to be balanced by a local compressive austenite phase stresses in the normal and transverse directions. Residual stress measurements by neutron diffraction conducted at Los Alamos Nuclear Science Centre revealed that in the hoop direction, ferrite (211) and austenite (311) exhibit tensile strains in the weld. In the axial and radial direction, the strains for both phases were more compressive. Correlations between the degree of sensitization and microstructural changes / ferrite content were observed. Higher degrees of sensitization (Ir/Ia and Qr/Qa) were associated with reduced ferrite (increased austenite) content. Correlations between the stresses generated, the evolved microstructures and degree of sensitization were evident. Stresses within the cap region were generally shown to be of a tensile nature in the transverse and longitudinal direction. In summary, the study has shown that correlations exist between the weld microstructure, susceptibility to sensitisation and levels / distribution of internal stresses within the weld regions...|$|E

They are made up equal spans, each of which has a length of 50. 70 m between the pile axes, with in all 22 on the north side and 30 on the south side. Each span consists of: 4 prefabricated girders which are joined at the ends by tie members; between the girders there is a 0. 50 cm thick <b>fill</b> <b>layer,</b> over which there is a reinforced concrete slab. The supporting piers, also of reinforced concrete, have a foundation of piles which generally speaking rest on the rocky substratum of the riverbed. The metal part rests upon two main piers, situated on either side, with same type of foundation as mentioned above. On these are located inverted V-shape pylons, with a short vertical element, to which the cables that support the centre bridge deck are anchored, formed by 96 m and 16 m long spans, welded together after having been lifted to their final level. This project —the greatest in France and the one that has the greatest clear span among the works of this kind— has required three years of work utilizing the most modern techniques and systems. More than 80, 000 m 2 of concrete and more than 17, 000 t of different kinds of steel have been used. Como consecuencia del desarrollo industrial y turístico de la región, fue preciso construir un puente sobre el Loira, contando con condicionantes tales como la naturaleza geológica del lecho del Loira, el paso de petroleros de hasta 200. 000 t, y otros factores que influyeron grandemente en el proyecto y posterior construcción. &# 13; La obra consta de dos viaductos de acceso y el puente metálico central. &# 13; Los primeros, cuyo trazado sigue curvas opuestas, se construyeron en hormigón pretensado. Están formados por tramos iguales, de 50, 70 m de luz entre ejes de pilas, con un total de 22 en la orilla norte y 30 en la sur. Cada tramo lleva: 4 vigas prefabricadas que se unen con tirantes en los extremos; un relleno de 0, 50 m de espesor entre ellas y una losa superior de hormigón armado. Las pilas de sustentación, también de hormigón armado, cuentan con una cimentación de pilotes apoyados generalmente sobre el substrato rocoso del fondo del río.
