We also find that Friday's close is the period of highest volatility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} three alternative rules on the long-run distributions of both <b>the</b> spot and <b>futures</b> prices ina single commodity market, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> key behavioral relationships are derived from the optimizing behavior of producers and speculators. The rules considered include: (i) leaning against <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spot market; (ii) utility maximizing speculative behavior by <b>the</b> stabilization authority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market; (iii) leaning against <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market. Since <b>the</b> underlying model is sufficiently complex to preclude analytical solutions, the analysis makes extensive use of simulation methods. As a general proposition we find that intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market is not as effective <b>in</b> stabilizing either <b>the</b> spot price of <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> price as is intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spot market. Indeed, Rule (iii), while stabilizing <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> price may actually destabilize the spot price. Furthermore, the analogous type of rule undertaken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spot market will always stabilize <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> price {{to a greater degree}} than it does the spot price. The welfare implications of these rules are also discussed. Our analysis shows how these can generate rather different distributions of welfare gains, including the overall benefits. ...|$|R
