2500|$|Overall, the {{majority}} of royal biographers have agreed that even if Charles and Camilla wanted to marry or did try for approval to get married, {{it would have been}} declined, because according to Charles's cousin and godmother Patricia Mountbatten, palace courtiers at that time found Camilla unsuitable as a wife for the future king. In 2005, she stated, [...] "With hindsight, you can say that Charles should have married Camilla when he first had the chance. They were ideally suited, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> But it wasn't possible." [...] "it wouldn't have been possible, not then." [...] When Charles heard of the engagement of Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973, he wrote to Lord [...] Mountbatten: [...] "I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually." [...] Nevertheless, they remained friends. In August 1979, Lord Mountbatten was assassinated by the IRA. Charles was grief-stricken and relied heavily on Camilla for solace. During this period, rumours began circulating among family, friends and neighbours that they had rekindled their intimate relationship. A source close to Camilla confirmed that by 1980 they had indeed rekindled as lovers. However, other sources assert it occurred earlier. Reportedly, Parker Bowles gave consent to the relationship during their marriage, while he also saw other women. In 1981, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sure--I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>now!</b> Oh, if only I had {{my hands}} on 'em. Say, they don't belong at Brill, do they?" [...] went on the farm hand eagerly.|$|E
60|$|For in a {{flash of}} intuition she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> She <b>knew</b> she was in love. She knew he loved her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} was a fool. She <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> I dare say. And perhaps she has repented. Do you mean to try it again with that girl at Harrington Hall?" ...|$|R
60|$|The scene changed. Barbara <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> {{she saw her}} Aunt Thompson's London house. In that drawing-room {{where she}} had parted from Mr. Russell, her son and his wife stood face to face.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I tell?" [...] he {{answered}} indifferently. [...] "I only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> {{he will be}} able to carry me home; if he dies afterwards, what will it matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite sure," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "If he were I wouldn't {{allow him}} to hurt you. You ought to <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Now</b> sit up so that every one {{can get a good}} look at you." ...|$|E
60|$|Mulroy {{observed}} the pirate's indecision, {{and although he}} knew not its cause to the full extent, he was sufficiently acquainted with human nature to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> was the moment to overcome the man, if {{he was to be}} overcome at all.|$|E
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} there came to our ears {{distinctly}} three smart raps on the outer door, and I leaned over Master Lord with my knife upraised, for I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> was come our time of greatest peril.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat back}} and screwed her eyes tight, as she had always done when puzzled. Something had {{happened}} to her, but how it had happened and when it had happened and why it had happened she could not understand. She only <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> {{for the first time}} she had been granted a moment of clear vision and was seeing things truly.|$|R
60|$|He felt, however, {{that he must}} obtain {{employment}} of some kind, and that quickly. The {{small amount of money}} he had in hand would not last him long, and though kind-hearted Mrs. Massanet might be willing to let him remain awhile without paying board, he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> with her son idle, the good woman could not afford so generous a course.|$|R
6000|$|... "His sperrit, dear life, his sperrit only, I mane. I 'udn't have no keeping {{company in}} my house, no, not for gowld untowld, I 'udn't; but the sperrit of mun--to see whether mun {{would be true}} or not, you'd like to <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>now,</b> 'udn't you, my darling?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. 'If {{there were any}} good,' he said, 'I could do on this earth, I would do it, Walter, for you. The sight of you from day to day, has been at once {{happiness}} and remorse to me. But the pleasure has outweighed the pain. I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>now,</b> by knowing what I lose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even if {{the boats}} {{have not been}} here," [...] Nat said to Lippincott, [...] "I don't think we shall have any trouble with them; they will have heard our guns, and, I dare say, the musketry firing, and will <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> we are awake and on our guard, we should {{probably}} sink them before they reached us." ...|$|E
60|$|Thanks {{to these}} attentions, she {{got through the}} afternoon, went early to bed, and next morning did her lessons with an energy which made Uncle Fritz wish that a new game could be invented every day. Quite a thrill pervaded the school-room when Daisy was {{dismissed}} at eleven o'clock, for everyone <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> {{she was going to}} have the new and mysterious play.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{simultaneous}} shout when, at four o'clock, they {{caught sight of}} him, and though, at Ethel's exclamation of wonder, Mary and Tom hung their heads at having forgotten themselves, the association of gladness in seeing Richard was refreshing; {{the sense of being}} desolate and forsaken was relieved, and they <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> they had one to rely on and to comfort them.|$|R
6000|$|Plunged in {{the deepest}} gloom, I write these few words to let you <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> just <b>now,</b> when the bell was {{striking}} ten, I drank to ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, dear Alicia,' he went on, 'I {{was more}} {{impressed}} by the affection of your apology to her than by anything else. And do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> the conditions have arisen which give me liberty to consider you my affianced?' I had been expecting this, but yet was not prepared. I stammered out {{that we would not}} discuss it then.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Fan, I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> but I didn't know it then. I {{married him}} {{three months before}} you was born, so that you'd be the child of honest parents. He had a hundred pounds with me, but it all went in a year; and it's always been up and down, {{up and down with}} us ever since, but now it's nothing but down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; he wasn't dead. But {{of course}} you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> He broke an arm and two ribs, and got rather a bad squeeze. He was just behind me, you know, and I {{had to wait for}} him. I lost the run, and had to see Harriet Tristram go away with the best lead any one has had to a fast thing this year. That's an {{uncommon}} nasty place at the back of Monkton Grange." ...|$|E
50|$|Arun {{changes his}} {{identity}} to nuclear scientist Wahid, {{working at a}} well-known Canadian nuclear research organization. Wahid pretends {{to be in love}} with Shaheen, as he wants {{to become a part of}} Zakaria's group. He even marries Shaheen to win their trust. Reshma meets Wahid at the time of his marriage to Shaheen. Arun is very happy on seeing Reshma alive but <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> they cannot be together, so she leaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, Hetty, {{the simple}} truth is this. You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I'm <b>now</b> a captyve to the Hurons, and captyves can't do, in all things, as they please--" ...|$|R
60|$|Of course, Reddy <b>knew</b> {{the instant}} <b>that</b> Bowser began to yelp and bark that {{something}} had happened. What it was he couldn't imagine. He sat down to wait and listen. Then he heard the voice of Farmer Brown's boy. Reddy <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> voice and he grinned, for he felt sure that Bowser would give up the hunt. He grinned because now {{he would have a}} chance to go back for that fat hen. At the same time that grin was not wholly a happy grin, because Reddy <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> Bowser would return to his home.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile the Indian {{had been}} {{watching}} with an intense fixed stare that noted every change of expression in the boy's face. A less close observer {{than he would have}} realized that the boy was tempted. He was cunning enough to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> was the time to play his trump card and catch the lad before he had fully regained possession of himself and spurned the temptation. With a single swift step forward he exclaimed, [...] "Fifty dollar!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{know what}} your father's {{helplessness}} and need of you meant [...] to you. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> life must seem to you a broken and [...] embittered thing and, knowing this, I venture to send this [...] greeting across the gulf of strangerhood between us, telling [...] you that my understanding sympathy is fully and freely yours, [...] and bidding you take heart for the future, which now, it may [...] be, looks so heartless and hopeless to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think {{not that}} I am conquered, for now {{my name is}} Victory! Think not that Ayesha's {{strength}} is spent or her tale is done, for of it thou readest but a single page. Think not even that I am today that thing of sin and pride, the Ayesha thou didst adore and fear, I who in my lord's love and sacrifice have again conceived my soul. For <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> once more as at the beginning, his soul and mine are one." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, all {{the little}} people of the Green Forest hurried {{to pay their respects}} to Mrs. Lightfoot and to tell Lightfoot how glad they felt for him. And they really did feel glad. You see, they all loved Lightfoot and they <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> he would be happier than ever, and {{that there would be no}} danger of his leaving the Green Forest because of loneliness. The Green Forest would not be the same at all without Lightfoot the Deer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> I <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> Well, <b>now</b> we {{understand}} each other, so I must be turning home. Thank {{you so much}} for having been quite candid with me. Good morning, Miss Layard; remember me to Stephen." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{they had}} been some half hour in bed, there stole a whisper across the {{darkness}} of the chamber from one couch to the other; [...] "Patty, are you asleep?" [...] Patience declared that she was wide awake. [...] "Then I'll come to you,"--and Clary's naked feet pattered across the room. [...] "I've just something to say, and I'll say it better here." [...] Patience made glad way for the intruder, and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> she would hear it all. [...] "Patty, it is better to wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, his {{self-restraint}} failing him, {{he slipped}} an arm {{about her and}} held her tightly to him. [...] "Carrie," [...] he said harshly, [...] "it is getting too hard for me. Do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> and then something almost drives me into taking you into my arms and crushing you into submission? I could do it now--the touch of you almost maddens me. This can't go on. I have felt lately that you were growing kinder and shrank from me less. After all, I am a man and nothing more. How long {{do you mean to}} keep me waiting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I sorrow for them, yet, Simbri, {{they were}} well spent," [...] Ayesha {{answered}} reflectively, [...] "who by their forewritten doom, as it was decreed, held thy knife from falling and thus won me my husband. Aye and I am happy--happier than such blind bats as thou can see or guess. For <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> with him I have re-wed my wandering soul divorced by sin from me, and that of our marriage kiss which burned his life away there shall still be born to us children of Forgiveness and eternal Grace and all things that are pure and fair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Richard," [...] replied he, with an ineffable sadness, [...] "I am naught but a {{wanderer}} {{upon the}} face of the earth. I have no ties, no kindred,--no real friends, save you and Dale, and some of these honest fellows whom I lead to slaughter. My ambition is seamed with a flaw. And all my life I must be striving, striving, until I am laid in the grave. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> and it is you yourself who have taught me. For I have violently broken forth from those bounds which God in His wisdom did set." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then call me {{what they}} will, I <b>know</b> [...] <b>That</b> <b>now</b> my soul is glad: [...] If this be madness, better so, [...] Far better to be mad, [...] Weeping or smiling as I go.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there must}} be--there will be compensations," [...] he assured her. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> just <b>now</b> you are {{suffering}} from the reaction--after all you have gone through. The memory of that will pass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, I <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> But <b>now</b> let us drop business. Tell me {{all about}} Tom. Just how has he been acting? I know you didn't want to let {{out in front of}} the girls." ...|$|R
