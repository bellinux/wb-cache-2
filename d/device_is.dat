5|$|When a USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> supported by the host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E

5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E
5|$|The host {{includes}} 15kΩ pull-down resistors on each data line. When no <b>device</b> <b>is</b> connected, this pulls both data lines low {{into the}} so-called single-ended zero state (SE0 in the USB documentation), and indicates a reset or disconnected connection.|$|E

The <b>device</b> <b>is</b> usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose.

5|$|In {{addition}} to limiting the total average power {{used by the}} device, the USB specification limits the inrush current (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> first connected.

Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.|$|E

In North America, connectivity options were Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi + 4G (LTE) on Verizon, AT, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, connectivity options are Wi-Fi only (on the Wi-Fi model) or Wi-Fi + 3G (on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as 4G (LTE) connectivity for the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> not available outside North America.
