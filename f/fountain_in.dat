5|$|Anthony Ashley-Cooper {{was born}} on 22 May 1938 in London, England. He was named after his father, as was {{tradition}} for firstborn sons in the Ashley-Cooper family. His father, Major Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Lord Ashley, was the firstborn son of the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury. Notable among his ancestors were his seventh great grandfather, the 1stEarl of Shaftesbury {{and leader of the}} Whig party in Parliament; and his second great grandfather, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury and 19th-century evangelical social reformer, who was honoured with the Shaftesbury Memorial <b>Fountain</b> <b>in</b> London's Piccadilly Circus.|$|E
5|$|Jahangir's Quadrangle {{occupies}} the northeastern {{corner of the}} fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began in 1617 or 1618 {{during the reign of}} Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> its centre.|$|E

5|$|Løvold was {{an active}} member of Foreningen Kristiansunderen, an {{organization}} which worked for the betterment of the town. After seeing The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Løvold started working to build a mermaid statue <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> Kristiansund. The mermaid statue was never built, although he eventually secured sufficient funding to build a fountain. Løvold traveled to the United States in 1951 to visit his siblings Oscar and Lise in Minnesota, which he had not seen in 42 years. He also visited New York City, where he drove through the Holland Tunnel. On his way home he came in contact with Prime Minister Oscar Torp.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{supplied}} with water by an aqueduct that ran from a {{spring in the}} hills behind the city. The aqueduct may have been constructed around 60–80AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply {{and a series of}} drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla.|$|E
5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid {{greater attention to}} the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> the Upper Ward, intending to replace it with a classical statue.|$|E

5|$|Images of {{the black}} swan played only a minor role in the {{development}} of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain. A <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.|$|E
5|$|In 1730, Vaccarini {{arrived in}} Catania as the {{appointed}} city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature {{rather than a}} general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported {{on the back of}} the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal façade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund {{announced}} Beacon Park, Minster Pool and Walk and the Garden of Remembrance {{had been}} awarded a grant £3.9 million under the 'Parks for People' programme.

Conservation work was carried out on the listed structures, including the statues, railings and <b>fountain.</b> <b>In</b> the Museum Gardens, the bowling green was relocated to the Recreation Grounds and in its previous location beds of flowers were planted to recreate the Victorian geometric landscaping to the gardens.|$|E

5|$|Nur ad-Din ruled as Zengid emir of Damascus from 1154 {{until his}} death in 1174. He took up {{residence}} in the citadel and rebuilt or refurbished its residential structures. After an earthquake hit Damascus in 1170, Nur ad-Din built a wooden house for sleeping and prayer next to the original stone residence of the citadel. In addition, he built a mosque and a <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> the citadel. Between 1165 and 1174, Nur ad-Din re-fortified Damascus with a concentric wall, and it is possible that he also strengthened the defences of the citadel. Nur ad-Din died of an illness in the citadel on 15 May 1174 and was buried there; his body was later transferred to the Nur ad-Din Madrasah in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Shemanski Fountain, {{also known}} as Rebecca at the Well, is an outdoor {{fountain}} with a bronze sculpture, located in the South Park Blocks of downtown Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The sandstone fountain was designed in 1925, completed in 1926, and named after Joseph Shemanski, a Polish immigrant and businessman who {{gave it to the}} city. Carl L. Linde designed the trefoil, which features a statue designed by Oliver Laurence Barrett. The sculpture, which was added to the <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> 1928, depicts the biblical personage Rebecca. Shemanski Fountain includes two drinking platforms with three basins each, with one platform intended for use by dogs.|$|E
5|$|The film's locations, {{with the}} {{exception}} of scenes filmed at a museum and at a farmhouse, were built on the Montreal sound stage. Production designer James Chinlund and his crew built sets for The <b>Fountain</b> <b>in</b> a large warehouse in Montreal. The sets included the 16th century jungle settings and the bubble-shaped spacecraft containing the tree of life and its garden. The spacecraft set was placed against greenscreen, and the crew hung colored reflective material, which included green, black, gold, and silver, on three circular tracks around the set. One material would be moved into place instead of the heavy equipment, and with the other materials partitioned off, a light source was used with the preferred material. Silver was used for scenes in which the spacecraft moved through the stars, and gold was used for when it entered the nebula.|$|E

5|$|Director Darren Aronofsky {{sought to}} produce The Fountain {{after the release}} of Requiem for a Dream in 2000. In April 2001, he entered {{negotiations}} with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow to direct the then-untitled film with actor Brad Pitt in the lead role. Requiem for a Dream was screened for Pitt, and the preliminary script for The Fountain persuaded the actor to join the project. Aronofsky prepared for production by traveling with a crew to Central America to consult with Mayan experts and to explore the Mexican ruins of Palenque. The group also visited Tikal, a jungle location featured in the 1977 film Star Wars. In addition to the trip, the films Aguirre, the Wrath of God and The Holy Mountain were screened for the crew to inspire it in designing a rainforest set for The <b>Fountain.</b> <b>In</b> June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join Aronofsky's project. Aronofsky, who wanted the film's actual title to be a secret, gave the project the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed to improve the script and to wait for Blanchett, pregnant when she joined, to give birth to her child in December 2001. The start date for production was tentatively set in summer 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings {{and some of its}} estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable {{for one of the most}} important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces.|$|E
5|$|In 1725, Mayfair {{became part}} of the new parish of St George Hanover Square, running as far east as Bond Street and to Regent Street north of Conduit Street. It ran as far north as Oxford Street and south near to Piccadilly. The parish {{continued}} into Hyde Park to the west and extended southwest to St George's Hospital. Most of the area belonged to (and continues to be owned by) the Grosvenor family, though the freehold of some parts of Mayfair belongs to the Crown Estate. A water supply to the area was built by the Chelsea Water Works, and a royal warrant was issued in 1725 for a reservoir in Hyde Park that could supply water into Mayfair, at what is now Grosvenor Gate. In 1835, the reservoir was decorated with an ornamental basin and a <b>fountain</b> <b>in</b> its centre. In 1963, following the widening of Park Lane, it was rebuilt as the Joy of Life Fountain.|$|E
