5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A <b>drought</b> in 2009 was the worst <b>drought</b> in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the <b>drought.</b> A <b>drought</b> in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California <b>drought,</b> all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the <b>drought,</b> but after that <b>drought</b> ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason {{it had not been}} reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US$500,000.|$|E
5|$|Since 1750, the Columbia has {{experienced}} six multi-year droughts. The longest, lasting 12years in the mid‑19th century, reduced the river's flow to 20percent below average. Scientists {{have expressed concern}} that a similar <b>drought</b> would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia. In 1992–1993, a lesser <b>drought</b> affected farmers, hydroelectric power producers, shippers, and wildlife managers.|$|E
30|$|Except for <b>droughts</b> {{in winter}} in Hebei Province, higher {{frequency}} of <b>droughts</b> {{can be detected}} mainly {{in the northern part}} of the study region rather than in the south. In Shandong Province, <b>droughts</b> occurred mainly in the eastern and the central areas. Generally, higher frequency of <b>droughts</b> can be identified across the entire Henan Province. Frequent <b>droughts</b> can be detected in southern Henan, the province’s region for winter wheat production, and frequent <b>droughts</b> pose serious challenges for stable production. Overall, <b>droughts</b> in Jiangsu Province are less severe than in the other provinces and occurred mainly in central Jiangsu. In spring and summer, the frequency of <b>droughts</b> in northern Anhui was higher and relatively low in southern Anhui.|$|R
30|$|The {{incipient}} <b>droughts</b> {{that occurred}} during the wintering period of the winter wheat growth helped to increase the winter wheat yield, while the mild <b>droughts</b> {{that occurred during}} the maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in a reduction of yield. The mild <b>droughts</b> {{that occurred during the}} filling and maturity period had a significant effect on the yield of winter wheat. The moderate <b>droughts</b> that occurred during the flowering, filling, and maturity periods of the winter wheat growth {{had a significant impact on}} yield. In addition, the water shortage due to <b>droughts</b> that occurred during the seeding period in autumn also affected the production of winter wheat, and that is particularly true for the severe and extreme <b>droughts</b> that occurred during the seeding period. With some exception of the occurrence of <b>droughts</b> of certain intensities during some specific growth stages of winter wheat, <b>droughts</b> of higher intensities had greater impacts on winter wheat yield during the critical growth stages.|$|R

5|$|The Bills {{were unable}} {{to make the playoffs}} in their first season with Ryan as coach, as they were {{eliminated}} in Week 15 with a 35–25 loss to the Washington Redskins on December 20, extending their <b>drought</b> to 16 seasons, the NFL's longest active <b>drought.</b> They finished the season with an 8–8 record.|$|E
5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball.

Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff <b>drought,</b> the longest such <b>drought</b> in team history.|$|E
5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month <b>drought,</b> President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the <b>drought</b> and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and <b>drought.</b> By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
30|$|Previous {{research}} {{mainly focused}} on accurate and real-time {{monitoring of the}} occurrence and development of <b>droughts</b> (Aghakouchak et al. 2015), but very few reports addressed the impacts of <b>droughts</b> on growing crops and related crop production. However, <b>droughts</b> with different intensities that occur during different growth stages of crops can have distinctly different impacts on crop yield (Çakir 2004). Therefore, {{it is critical to}} investigate the impacts of <b>droughts</b> on winter wheat yield by studying the occurrence timing of <b>droughts</b> relative to the growth stage of winter wheat.|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread <b>drought</b> conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary <b>drought</b> conditions.|$|E

40|$|Amazon forests {{experienced}} two severe <b>droughts</b> at {{the beginning}} of the 21 st century: one in 2005 and the other in 2010. How Amazon forests responded to these <b>droughts</b> is critical for the future of the Earth’s climate system. It is only possible to assess Amazon forests’ response to the <b>droughts</b> in large areal extent through satellite remote sensing. Here, we used the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) data to assess Amazon forests’ response to <b>droughts,</b> and compared the results with those from the standard (Collection 5 and Collection 6) MODIS VI data. Overall, the MAIAC data reveal more realistic Amazon forests inter-annual greenness dynamics than the standard MODIS data. Our results from the MAIAC data suggest that: (1) the <b>droughts</b> decreased the greenness (i. e., photosynthetic activity) of Amazon forests; (2) the Amazon wet season precipitation reduction induced by El Niño events could also lead to reduced photosynthetic activity of Amazon forests; and (3) in the subsequent year after the water stresses, the greenness of Amazon forests recovered from the preceding decreases. However, as previous research shows <b>droughts</b> cause Amazon forests to reduce investment in tissue maintenance and defense, it is not clear whether the photosynthesis of Amazon forests will continue to recover after future water stresses, because of the accumulated damages caused by the <b>droughts...</b>|$|R
