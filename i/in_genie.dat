25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs <b>in</b> <b>Genie.</b> No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E

5000|$|... "We are {{convinced}} that the great writers have told their own story in their works", wrote Chateaubriand <b>in</b> <b>Génie</b> du christianisme, [...] "one only truly describes one's own heart by attributing it to another, and the greater part of genius is composed of memories". This is certainly true of Chateaubriand himself. All his works have strong autobiographical elements, overt or disguised.|$|E

5000|$|Several books, TV shows, {{films and}} other {{projects}} had their genesis and inspiration on GEnie. One {{example is the}} Babylon 5 television show, created by J. Michael Straczynski, which was first announced publicly <b>in</b> <b>GEnie's</b> Science Fiction RoundTables. The SFRTs served as the show's first online [...] "home" [...] and were the source of many in-jokes and references throughout its run.|$|R
25|$|Kent, Howard Hansen, the Riglers, and Curtiss readily {{acknowledged}} {{that it had been}} extremely difficult to determine the course of the study, but maintained that all disputes during the meetings were impersonal and typical of scientific discourse. David Rigler said that, despite his disagreements with Shurley, Shurley's early recommendations were the only useful advice he received on handling Genie and he attempted to follow them as much as possible. The Riglers and Curtiss further stated that everyone involved <b>in</b> <b>Genie's</b> life, with the exception of Jean Butler Ruch, worked together as best they could to rehabilitate Genie and never fought with each other, and independently denied allegations of factionalism. Ruch never stated a motive for her actions, but members of the research team believed they were due to her anger over her foster custody rejection and her perception that Children's Hospital staff influenced the decision. The role of the scientists <b>in</b> <b>Genie's</b> case has become the source of debate within the scientific community.|$|R

5000|$|Alleron {{travels through}} six {{different}} worlds {{in which he}} must do battle with members of a specific race. Often, these areas end in boss battles, although not always. Along the way, there are many [...] "secret" [...] areas that are accessible only to particular forms, such as areas blocked off by bars or grates (which can only be accessed <b>in</b> <b>Genie</b> form after having cast the Gaseous Form spell). No matter the choices of forms, however, the main game is always completable.|$|E
5000|$|Filming {{began at}} the {{beginning}} of July. In an interview with Vogue Girl Korea, Minho confirmed that the drama would broadcast on 15 August, rather than the initially scheduled 8 August. MokWon University was used to film the scenes <b>in</b> <b>Genie</b> Athletic High School, and Anmyeondo was used to film the summer vacation scenes. The first scene Choi Min-ho filmed was a high jump scene. For the high jump scene, 105 high-speed cameras were used to film in bullet time.|$|E

5000|$|Like most {{systems of}} the era, the machine was built with a bank of core memory as the primary storage, {{allowing}} between 16 and 64 kilowords. Words were 24 bits plus a parity bit. [...] This was backed up {{by a variety of}} secondary storage devices, including a 1376 kWord drum <b>in</b> <b>Genie,</b> or hard disks in the SDS models {{in the form of a}} drum-like 2097 kWord ‘fixed head’ disk or a 16 384 kWord traditional ‘floating head’ model. The SDS machines also included a paper tape punch and reader, line printer, and a real-time clock. They bootstrapped from paper tape.|$|E
5000|$|Wren started acting {{when she}} was talent spotted by Walt Disney UK {{at the age of}} 16. She was then engaged for Walt Disney's Comedy Sketch show Life Bites, playing the lead role as Chloe.

50|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a mild allusion to the Agrabah boss battle in Kingdom Hearts. Sora must fight Jafar <b>in</b> <b>Genie</b> form, {{surrounded}} by a lava pit with raising and lowering levels, while Iago flies above with Jafar's lamp. Only striking the lamp has any effect on Jafar's health. This fight also {{takes place in the}} second game, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, and its PlayStation 2 remake. In both versions of Chain of Memories, the boss fight is due to the majority of the game being illusions created from Sora's memories. A second playable character, Riku, also fights the boss in his mode. The battle is once again visited in Kingdom Hearts Coded and Kingdom Hearts Re:coded.|$|E
50|$|In {{all of the}} {{algorithms}} {{the messages}} emanating from check nodes are the same; however, since the verification rules are different for different algorithms the messages produced by variable nodes will be different in each algorithm. The algorithm given above works {{for all of the}} VB-MPA's, and different algorithms use different rules in half round 2 of round 1 and 2. For instance, Genie algorithm uses D1CN rule in Half round 2 of round 1, and in fact the half round 2 of round 2 which uses ZCN rule is useless <b>in</b> <b>Genie</b> algorithm. LM algorithm uses D1CN in Half round 2 of round 1 and XH algorithm uses ECN rule in this stage instead of D1CN. SBB algorithm also uses both D1CN and ECN rule in the second half round of round 1. All of these rules can be efficiently implemented in update_rule function in the second half round of round 1.|$|E
