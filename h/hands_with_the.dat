5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake <b>Hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E

5|$|After {{the credits}} roll, Ocelot is heard {{talking to the}} KGB Chief Director over the telephone. After {{suggesting}} that the KGB use the knowledge of both the Virtuous Mission and Operation Snake Eater to blackmail the United States during future negotiations, he then calls another, unidentified man. Ocelot informs him that the microfilm stolen by EVA was a fake and {{that half of the}} Philosopher's Legacy is now in America's <b>hands,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other half held by the KGB. It transpires that Ocelot has been triple-crossing everyone from the very beginning.

5|$|On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat {{mission of}} the war, {{engaging}} in aerial combat for the 32nd time, Mölders was shot down near Compiègne at about 18:40 by Sous lieutenant René Pomier Layrargues, flying a French Air Force Dewoitine D.520. Mölders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France. While in French captivity, Mölders asked to shake <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues {{had been killed in}} action 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions to his face and his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, Capitaine Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating Mölders, Mölders approached Hermann Göring and requested clemency, which was granted.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda {{does not}} {{have a long history of}} written literature, but there is a strong oral {{tradition}} ranging from poetry to folk stories. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry. The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the Golden Globe-nominated Hotel Rwanda, Shake <b>Hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Devil, Sometimes in April, and Shooting Dogs, the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.|$|E

5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.|$|E
5|$|In April, Moore insulted the TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan, {{provoking}} a {{rivalry between}} the two. The following week Morgan cost Moore his {{shot at the}} TNA X Division Championship, and later attacked his tag team partner with Jesse Neal. Moore aided Neal, prompting the pair to form a tag team known as Ink Inc.. At Sacrifice Ink Inc. failed {{in their attempt to}} win the TNA World Tag Team Championship from The Band (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall), when Neal's trainer Brother Ray interfered in the match and attacked Neal. The following month, on the June 17 episode of Impact!, Ink Inc. defeated The Band (Kevin Nash and Eric Young) to advance to the finals of a tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. In the final, Ink Inc. was defeated by Beer Money, Inc. when Brother Ray attacked Neal backstage prior to the match. On the October 28 episode of Impact!, Ink Inc. received a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship against The Motor City Machine Guns in a three-way match, which also included Generation Me (Max and Jeremy Buck), but failed to win the championship. On December 5 at the Final Resolution pay-per-view, Ink Inc. lost to Beer Money, Inc. in a number one contender's match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Ink Inc. received a match for Beer Money's TNA World Tag Team Championship at Victory Road in March 2011, but were unsuccessful. After the match Moore turned heel by refusing to shake <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> champions and instead spat beer in Storm's face. On April 17 at Lockdown, Ink Inc. defeated The British Invasion (Douglas Williams and Magnus), Crimson and Scott Steiner and Eric Young and Orlando Jordan in a four team steel cage match to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The following month at Sacrifice, Ink Inc. was defeated by Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez). During the match, Neal suffered a neck injury, which sidelined him for the next four months.|$|E
