I just said: 'If you don't like it, <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves.

500|$|Though {{he was a}} villain, his amusing {{verbal skills}} led many fans to cheer The Rock, who then lost the title rematch at [...] and was thus betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him back into a fan {{favorite}} and beginning a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry that saw The Rock defeating Triple H at Over the Edge, but then losing to WWF Champion The Undertaker at King of the Ring.

500|$|Indeed, {{far from}} being a radical or {{threatening}} manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted {{the extent to which the}} character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: [...] "'Behold!' and she took his [...] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do I <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> lord'." [...] Ayesha declares this to be the [...] "first most holy hour of completed womanhood".|$|E

500|$|Magnapop was {{featured}} {{on a variety}} of various artist compilations. Their first commercial recording other than their independent single was their 1992 cover version of [...] "Pleasant Valley Sunday" [...] for Here No Evil– A Tribute to The Monkees.

Around this time, the band was so fraught from booking recording sessions, that they briefly considered breaking up.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Homer {{builds a}} scary clown-shaped bed for Bart. The scene was {{inspired}} by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown-shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss was scared of sleeping in it. As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing Cyndi Lauper's song [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun", which was released the same year. The idea for this sequence came from animation director Chuck Sheetz, who suggested it because {{the length of the}} final version of the episode was too short. The Fox censors wrote a note concerning Homer's line, [...] "Bart can <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> hairy, yellow butt!" [...] after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered [...] "coarse", due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback.|$|E

Styles, and Tomko), who were accompanied by Karen Angle. Hall had announced that morning {{that he would not}} show up. Prior to the match, Joe delivered an unscheduled, unscripted speech to the crowd explaining his anger and distaste for Hall's failure to show up for the event. He said that Hall [...] "punked out on me and on every single fan in this building tonight", and concluded: [...] "Scott Hall, chico, <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> ass, you punked out and you're a punk". He [...] followed this by announcing Hall's replacement in the match: Eric Young. The six men fought for a total of nine minutes and thirty-one seconds, before Joe slammed Tomko into the mat with his Muscle Buster maneuver to gain the pinfall.|$|E

500|$|In April, Speer's rivals {{for power}} succeeded in having him {{deprived}} {{of responsibility for}} construction. Speer sent Hitler a bitter letter, concluding with an offer of his resignation. Judging Speer indispensable to the war effort, Field Marshal Erhard Milch persuaded Hitler {{to try to get}} his minister to reconsider. Hitler sent Milch to Speer with a message not addressing the dispute but instead stating that he still regarded Speer as highly as ever. According to Milch, upon hearing the message, Speer burst out, [...] "The Führer can <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> ass!" [...] After a lengthy argument, Milch persuaded Speer to withdraw his offer of resignation, on the condition his powers were restored. On April23, 1944, Speer went to see Hitler who agreed that [...] "everything [...] stay as it was, [...] remain the head of all German construction". According to Speer, while he was successful in this debate, Hitler had also won, [...] "because he wanted and needed me back in his corner, and he got me".|$|E
500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} think that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E
500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] became R.E.M.'s {{biggest hit}} in the U.S., peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single stayed on the chart for 21 weeks. It charted at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 16 and No. 11 in Canada and Australia, respectively. Mills said years later, [...] "Without 'Losing My Religion', Out of Time would have sold two or three million , instead of the ten [...] or so it did. But the {{phenomenon}} that is a worldwide hit is an odd thing to behold. Basically that record was a hit in almost every civilised country in the world." [...] The success of [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] and Out of Time broadened R.E.M.'s audience beyond its original college radio-based fanbase. When asked at the time if he was worried that the song's success might alienate older fans, Buck told Rolling Stone, [...] "The people that changed their minds because of 'Losing My Religion' can just <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> ass." ...|$|E

500|$|After Melina's arrival on Raw, Mick Foley {{began to}} mention her in promos {{and on his}} WWE.com columns, playing on their real-life friendship, and they soon formed an {{on-screen}} friendship. At SummerSlam, Melina was involved in Foley's [...] "I Quit" [...] match against Ric Flair, when Flair threatened to hit her with a barbed wire baseball bat, causing Foley to quit the match to save her. The next night on Raw, the storyline had Vince McMahon order Foley to join the [...] After begging Foley not {{to go through with}} it, Foley [...] "joined the club" [...] to save Melina's job, only to have her suddenly turn on him by delivering a low blow and firing him at the behest of McMahon. The storyline was concocted by Foley to refresh the idea of the <b>Kiss</b> <b>My</b> Ass club. It was also around this time that Melina added another characteristic to her gimmick: screaming loudly at ringside while managing or in tag team action, which became known as the [...] "primal scream".|$|E
