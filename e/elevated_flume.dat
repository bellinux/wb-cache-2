50|$|The Winthrop Mill (also {{known as}} the Old Town Mill) is a {{historic}} mill building on Mill Street in New London, Connecticut. It is a grist mill located astride Briggs Brook between bridges carrying the eastbound and westbound lanes of Interstate 95. The first mill was supposedly established on this site in 1650 by Governor John Winthrop, Jr., and the property remained in Winthrop family hands until the late 18th century. Some elements of the mill infrastructure may be very nearly original to the period of first use, notably the <b>elevated</b> <b>flume,</b> wheel pit, and tail race. The present building may also include elements of the original, although {{it is known that}} the mill was set afire during Benedict Arnold's 1781 raid on New London and Groton. The property went through a succession of owners until 1892, when it was acquired by the city. It was leased for commercial operation until 1913, and underwent a major rehabilitation in 1960.|$|E

60|$|Six {{thousand}} {{spent the}} winter of 1897 in Dawson, work on the creeks went on apace, while beyond the passes {{it was reported that}} one hundred thousand more were waiting for the spring. Late one brief afternoon, Daylight, on the benches between French Hill and Skookum Hill, caught a wider vision of things. Beneath him lay the richest part of Eldorado Creek, while up and down Bonanza he could see for miles. It was a scene of a vast devastation. The hills, to their tops, had been shorn of trees, and their naked sides showed signs of goring and perforating that even the mantle of snow could not hide. Beneath him, in every direction were the cabins of men. But not many men were visible. A blanket of smoke filled the valleys and turned the gray day to melancholy twilight. Smoke arose from a thousand holes in the snow, where, deep down on bed-rock, in the frozen muck and gravel, men crept and scratched and dug, and ever built more fires to break the grip of the frost. Here and there, where new shafts were starting, these fires flamed redly. Figures of men crawled out of the holes, or disappeared into them, or, on raised platforms of hand-hewn timber, windlassed the thawed gravel to the surface, where it immediately froze. The wreckage of the spring washing appeared everywhere--piles of sluice-boxes, sections of <b>elevated</b> <b>flumes,</b> huge water-wheels,--all the debris of an army of gold-mad men.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1970s, Rivertown saw the {{addition}} of several attractions including Kenton's Cove Keelboat Canal in 1973, which was an <b>elevated</b> log <b>flume</b> ride that operated through the 2000 season, and The Beast roller coaster in 1979. Designed internally by Kings Island, The Beast opened as the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster in the world, {{and in addition to}} retaining its record length, it {{remains one of the most}} popular wooden roller coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards from Amusement Today. Other rides added over the years include a river rafting ride called White Water Canyon, which opened in 1985, and a heavily-themed, indoor flat ride called Tomb Raider: The Ride (later renamed The Crypt), which opened in place of Kenton's Cove Keelboat Canal in 2002. The Crypt closed permanently in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Water is {{delivered}} by an <b>elevated</b> intake <b>flume</b> {{from the back}} channel of the St. Johns River to cool the station's condensers, after which the water is returned to the back channel. This cooling water does not mix with other liquid process streams while {{in contact with the}} condensers. Because Unit 2 has been out of service since 1983, the actual demand for cooling water by Northside Generating Station at full load since that time has been approximately 620 million U.S. gallons per day (Mgd), or 430700 gal per minute, to operate Units 1 and 3. Operation of the entire 3-unit plant occurred only from about 1978 until 1980. During that time, the demand for cooling water was approximately 827 Mgd (574000 gal per minute): 24.5% for Unit 1, 24.5% for Unit 2, and 51% for Unit 3. This amount of surface water supplied to the station was approximately 10% of the average flow passing through the back channel of the St. Johns River.|$|R
