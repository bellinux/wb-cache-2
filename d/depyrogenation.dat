25|$|A pyrogen is a {{substance}} that induces fever. These can be either internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous) to the body. The bacterial substance lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, {{is an example of}} an exogenous pyrogen. Pyrogenicity can vary: In extreme examples, some bacterial pyrogens known as superantigens can cause rapid and dangerous fevers. <b>Depyrogenation</b> may be achieved through filtration, distillation, chromatography, or inactivation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Depyrogenation</b> {{refers to}} the removal of pyrogens from solution, most {{commonly}} from injectable pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|When purifying proteins, sodium {{hydroxide}} (NaOH) {{can be used}} safely and effectively. It is also widely used for <b>depyrogenation</b> of non-autoclavable equipment (e.g. plastics) and chromatography columns. In fact, when using an anion exchanger to remove pyrogens, {{it is necessary to}} clean the column with NaOH after each batch.|$|E
50|$|Because {{virtually}} all raw materials {{involved in a}} production process, including factory employees, can be potential sources of pyrogen contamination, raw material screening and <b>depyrogenation</b> can often {{go a long way}} to ensuring the final product is free of pyrogens and does not require costly removal or inactivation methods. Ultrafiltration of chemicals and buffer solutions, applying appropriate hygienic practices, and performing regular tests can all be helpful.|$|E

50|$|Heating {{methods are}} often used to ensure that glass and other lab {{equipment}} are free of pyrogenic material. Heat is applied by baking in a dry heat oven that is designed specifically for the <b>depyrogenation</b> process. Although endotoxins are relatively thermally stable, sufficient heating (250°C for 30 min) results in a 3-log reduction of endotoxin levels. Due to the high temperature levels, this method is also not suitable when purifying proteins.|$|E
50|$|Product {{polishing}} {{describes the}} final processing steps which end with packaging {{of the product}} {{in a form that}} is stable, easily transportable and convenient. Crystallization, desiccation, lyophilization and spray drying are typical unit operations. Depending on the product and its intended use, polishing may also include operations to sterilize the product and remove or deactivate trace contaminants which might compromise product safety. Such operations might include the removal of viruses or <b>depyrogenation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{pharmaceutical}} production, it {{is necessary}} to remove all traces of endotoxin from drug product containers, as even small amounts of endotoxin will cause illness in humans. A <b>depyrogenation</b> oven is used for this purpose. Temperatures in excess of 300 °C are required to break down this substance. A defined endotoxin reduction rate is a correlation between time and temperature. Based on primary packaging material as syringes or vials, a glass temperature of 250 °C and a holding time of 30 minutes is typical to achieve a reduction of endotoxin levels by a factor of 1000.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{feasibility}} {{to employ the}} in vitro pyrogen test (IPT) in the validation of <b>depyrogenation</b> process is presented. As {{one of the main}} advantages of IPT is its ability to determine pyrogen absorbed to the container surface, direct incubation of diluted whole blood with the endotoxin indicator was first attempted. It was not possible to quantify the endotoxin in control indicators due to the high content, which is discussed. However, it was possible to demonstrate that indicators subjected to the <b>depyrogenation</b> process were indeed pyrogen free, a quality that is difficult to assure when the LAL assay is employed in extract of indicators or medical devices. On the other hand, IPT performed as well as LAL when endotoxin was previously extracted from the indicator surface. Finally, some conditions for incubation of whole blood with the test surface and to dilute the supernatant obtained from the incubation are presented...|$|E
40|$|Aims: 11 C-L-methionine, an {{amino acid}} tracer used to {{delineate}} certain tumor tissues, {{has proven to}} be a prevailing nonfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical. We intended to prepare 11 C-L-methionine by following modified synthetic strategies at a rebuilt working area to meet the PET drug current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) regulations. Furthermore, we overcame the problem of pyrogen cross-contamination using a cleaner and more efficient program. Material and Methods: The task of upgrading air filtration equipment was integrated with the set of Web-Based Building Automation system (WebCTRL®). 11 C-L-methionine synthesis was carried out in accordance with redesigned methods to meet the requirements of PET drug cGMP. The product quality was tested by a series of quality control tests and was found to be satisfactory. <b>Depyrogenation</b> was carried out by three different methods with different flow rates and flushing durations. The results were examined through limulus amebocyte lysate clotting test. Results: The level of air cleanliness in each section meets the PIC/S GMP standards after the reconstructions. Moreover, after delicate modifications, the radiochemical yield of 11 C-L-methionine was 36. 20 % ± 3. 59 % (based on 11 C-CH 3 I, n = 7), which is about 10 % higher than the average former yield. Besides, the used <b>depyrogenation</b> methods could wipe the bioburden off within 8 h. Conclusions: The modifications done not only offer a good production environment but also protect the products from contamination. The modified approaches in both 11 C-L-methionine production and <b>depyrogenation</b> resulted in prominent progress in stability and efficiency as well...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial endotoxins, {{also known}} as lipopolysaccharides, are a fever-producing {{by-product}} of gram-negative bacteria commonly known as pyrogens. It is essential to remove endotoxins from parenteral preparations since they have multiple injurious biological activities. Because of their strong heat resistance (e. g., requiring dry-heat sterilization at 250 °C for 30 min) {{and the formation of}} various supramolecular aggregates, <b>depyrogenation</b> is more difficult than sterilization. We report here that soft hydrothermal processing, which has many advantages in safety and cost efficiency, is sufficient to assure complete <b>depyrogenation</b> by the inactivation of endotoxins. The endotoxin concentration in a sample was measured by using a chromogenic limulus method with an endotoxin-specific limulus reagent. The endotoxin concentration was calculated from a standard curve obtained using a serial dilution of a standard solution. We show that endotoxins were completely inactivated by soft hydrothermal processing at 130 °C for 60 min or at 140 °C for 30 min {{in the presence of a}} high steam saturation ratio or with a flow system. Moreover, it is easy to remove endotoxins from water by soft hydrothermal processing similarly at 130 °C for 60 min or at 140 °C for 30 min, without any requirement for ultrafiltration, nonselective adsorption with a hydrophobic adsorbent, or an anion exchanger. These findings indicate that soft hydrothermal processing, applied in the presence of a high steam saturation ratio or with a flow system, can inactivate endotoxins and may be useful for the <b>depyrogenation</b> of parenterals, including end products and medical devices that cannot be exposed to the high temperatures of dry heat treatments...|$|E

The effect of microwave discharges produced in different Ar/H 2 mixtures on Lipid A films has been studied by means of both biological tests and materials characterisation methods (FT-IR and ToF-SIMS spectroscopy) in order to identify the main mechanisms leading to the suppression of their pyrogenicity.

30|$|Column-wise {{adsorption}} {{was done}} at 20 °C. Adsorbents were suspended in water and fed into a glass column (8  mm i.d. × 100  mm length) using a LC- 6 A pump (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The length of the gel bed was between 930 and 980  mm. The resulting column was washed with 0.5  M NaOH, at 10  mL h- 1 for 3  h, and left overnight filled with 0.5  M NaOH to decompose LPS in the column (<b>depyrogenation).</b> After washing with water for 3  h, 0.1  M acetic acid was passed through for 1.5  h to convert amino groups of N-octadecylchitosan immobilized on the supports to their ammonium forms. After the buffer solution was passed through for 6.5  h, HSA solution was passed through at 5  mL h- 1 for 15 to 16  h. The eluted solution was collected immediately as ten fractions of 7.5  mL each. Fractions of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were analyzed for the concentrations of LPS and HSA.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{surface of}} flat-sheet nylon {{membranes}} was modified using bisoxirane as the spacer and polyvinyl alcohol as the coating polymer. The amino acid histidine was explored as a ligand for endotoxins, aiming at its application for endotoxin removal from aqueous solutions. Characterization of the membrane adsorber, {{analysis of the}} <b>depyrogenation</b> procedures and the evaluation of endotoxin removal efficiency in static mode are discussed. Ligand density of the membranes was around 7 mg/g dry membrane, allowing removal of up to 65 % of the endotoxins. The performance of the membrane adsorber prepared using nylon coated with polyvinyl alcohol and containing histidine as the ligand proved superior to other membrane adsorbers reported in the literature. The lack of endotoxin adsorption on nylon membranes without histidine confirmed that endotoxin removal {{was due to the}} presence of the ligand at the membrane surface. Modified membranes were highly stable, exhibiting a lifespan of approximately thirty months...|$|E
30|$|The elution {{property}} of separation medium {{is a key}} issue in liquid purification for the pharmaceutical industry. Elution from porous supports bearing lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan was evaluated by measuring the total organic carbon content in an eluent from a column packed with 20  mL of supports. The total organic carbon in the recovered water described in the experimental section was 400  μg L- 1 [10]. Even assuming {{that all of the}} organic carbons are due to eluted N-octadecylchitosan, the eluted N-octadecylchitosan (C, 65.7 %) is calculated as 3.0 [*]×[*] 10 - 5  g. This amount is 0.038 % of the N-octadecylchitosan immobilized on the 20 -mL supports. This stability for alkali is attributable to the stability of the amide linkage used for the immobilization of N-octadecylchitosan as well as the stability of the support material. Any substantial change was not observed in the IR spectra of the porous supports bearing lipid membranes after immersion in 0.5  M NaOH or 0.1  M HCl overnight at ambient temperature. This chemical stability, especially to 0.5  M NaOH immersion which is used as a standard <b>depyrogenation</b> procedure, is robust enough for a practical application in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E

The cytocompatibility and pro-inflammatory response to the biopolymer after the treatment and blending were evaluated by cellular responses in vitro. Cell attachment and spreading of murine NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts seeded on the films {{were found to be}} the highest on the hybrid P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) /Vit E/Col blend film. The P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) blends showed increased cell proliferation and negligible cytotoxicity. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL 6 and TNF expression in the murine macrophage cell line J 774 A- 1 monocyte/macrophage cells cultured on the biopolymer films were assessed by immunoblotting and RT-PCR analyses which revealed that the combined blending strategy was the most effective in reducing the pro-inflammatory activity. The depyrogenated P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) blends significantly extend the range of biomaterials suitable for tissue engineering.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the stability and purity of a phage cocktail to be delivered by nebulization. A cocktail of three phages active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients was developed for a potential nebulized formulation. The individual phages were examined for their retention of activity over time, while the phage cocktail was analysed for bacterial contaminant and endotoxin level according to regulatory requirements for nebulized products. The phage cocktail was nebulized using a Porta-neb nebulizer connected to an Anderson cascade impactor. The three phages retained activity over a period of 180 days storage at room temperature and at 4 °C. Nebulized phages were recovered in the lower stages of the cascade impactor indicative of potential delivery deep into the lungs. The phage cocktail met bacterial limits but the endotoxin levels measured with the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test remained considerably in excess of acceptable levels even following purification. These findings suggest that nebulization of phage is a viable delivery option; although, there is a need for appropriate <b>depyrogenation</b> strategies to remove bacterial endotoxins from phage-based preparations to meet regulatory requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Delamination, or the {{generation}} of glass flakes in vials used to contain parenteral drug products, {{continues to be a}} persistent problem in the pharmaceutical industry. To understand all of the factors that might contribute to delamination, a statistical design of experiments was implemented to describe this loss of chemical integrity for glass vials. Phase I of this study focused on the effects of thermal exposure (prior to product filling) on the surface chemistry of glass vials. Even though such temperatures are below the glass transition temperature for the glass, and parenteral compounds are injected directly into the body, data must be collected to show that the glass was not phase separating. Phase II of these studies examined the combined effects of thermal exposure, glass chemistry, and exposure to pharmaceutically relevant molecules on glass delamination. A variety of tools was used to examine the glass and the solution contained in the vial including: scanning electron microscopy and dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopy for the glass; and visual examination, pH measurements, laser particle counting, and inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry for the analysis of the solution. The combined results of phase I and II showed <b>depyrogenation</b> does not {{play a significant role in}} delamination. Terminal sterilization, glass chemistry, and solution chemistry are the key factors in {{the generation}} of glass flakes. Dissolution of silica may be an effective indicator that delamination will occur with a given liquid stored in glass. Finally, delamination should not be defined by the appearance of visible glass particulates.

40|$|A fully functional, microgravity-compatible {{microwave}} sterilization and <b>depyrogenation</b> system (MSDS) prototype {{was developed}} that {{is capable of}} producing medical-grade water (MGW) without expendable supplies, using NASA potable water that currently is available aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and will be available for Lunar and planetary missions in the future. The microwave- based, continuous MSDS efficiently couples microwaves to a single-phase, pressurized, flowing water stream that is rapidly heated above 150 C. Under these conditions, water is rapidly sterilized. Endotoxins, significant biological toxins that originate from the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and which represent another defining MGW requirement, are also deactivated (i. e., depyrogenated) albeit more slowly, with such deactivation representing a more difficult challenge than sterilization. Several innovations culminated in the successful MSDS prototype design. The most significant is the antenna-directed microwave heating of a water stream flowing through a microwave sterilization chamber (MSC). Novel antenna designs were developed to increase microwave transmission efficiency. These improvements resulted in greater than 95 -percent absorption of incident microwaves. In addition, incorporation of recuperative heat exchangers (RHxs) in the design reduced the microwave power required to heat a water stream flowing at 15 mL/min to 170 C to only 50 W. Further improvements in energy efficiency involved the employment of a second antenna to redirect reflected microwaves back into the MSC, eliminating the need for a water load and simplifying MSDS design. A quick connect (QC) is another innovation that can be sterilized and depyrogenated at temperature, and then cooled using a unique flow design, allowing collection of MGW at atmospheric pressure and 80 C. The final innovation was the use of in-line mixers incorporated in the flow path to disrupt laminar flow and increase contact time at a given flow rate. These technologies can be employed in small-scale systems for efficient production of MGW in the laboratory or in a range of larger systems that meet various industrial requirements. The microwave antennas can also be adapted to selectively sterilize vulnerable connections to ultra-pure water production facilities or biologically vulnerable systems where microorganisms may intrude...|$|E
