25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient <b>died</b> <b>last</b> night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E
500|$|The mystery writer J.A. Jance {{wrote in}} the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Yes, it's {{a bit of a}} shock to {{discover}} that some of the TV series' characters who <b>died</b> <b>last</b> season or the season before are back among the living between the covers of Lindsay's new book. Rita, Dexter's long-suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year's season finale, is alive and well and having a baby in Dexter Is Delicious. But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. Get over it. After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed. Patrick McCann and Colin Wrinn were very upset about her death in Season 4 of the hit TV show, Dexter, but Colin Whelan did not care for her." ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, {{everyone}} who drank Snake Juice is extremely hungover (except Ron (Nick Offerman)), and Leslie deeply regrets how she treated Ann. Ben visits Ann {{at her home}} and asks her to forgive Leslie. Ann, who also regrets the fight, is touched by Ben's gesture and reveals that Leslie likes him. Ann decides to attend the job interview, during which she and Leslie apologize to each other. After a second interview with Chris, Ann is given the job in a part-time basis, which also would allow her to continue {{her work as a}} nurse. Tom reluctantly decides to sell his Snakehole Lounge shares. Tom sells his shares the next morning to Jean-Ralphio, while Donna tries to comfort Tom, causing him to ask why Chris did not make her sell her shares, to which she replies that Chris does not know that she owns shares. She then tells Jean-Ralphio that [...] "nitches get stiches." [...] Ron attempts to convince Chris to let him keep the shares, and defends Tom's efforts to branch out by claiming the move was not unethical, but Chris is not persuaded. Instead, Ron comforts Tom by building him a special case to hold a bottle of Snake Juice. At the same time, April tries to reprise her role of Janet Snakehole and have Andy reprise Burt Macklin, but a hungover Andy says that [...] "...Burt Macklin <b>died</b> <b>last</b> night after the 10th shot of Snake Juice." [...] However, after seeing a sad April walk away, Andy creates himself a new role: Kip Hackman, Burt Macklin's brother and chases after Janet, although he vomits as this happens.|$|E

While Smith remained in the Bahamas with Dannielynn and Stern, Daniel's family in the United States, including his father, Billy Smith, gathered with friends on October 7, 2006, in Mexia, Texas, for a memorial service. Daniel was buried at Lake View Cemetery on New Providence, Bahamas, on October 19, 2006, almost six weeks after his death. According to Howard K. Stern, Smith's longtime boyfriend, she was devastated over her son's death. [...] "Anna and Daniel were inseparable. Daniel was without question {{the most important person in}} Anna's life," [...] Stern told Florida Circuit Judge Larry Seidlin during his testimony in Smith's body custody trial: [...] "At Daniel's funeral, she had them open the coffin and tried to climb inside. She said that 'if Daniel has to be buried, I want to be buried with him,'" [...] Stern testified. [...] "She was ready to go down with him." [...] Howard K.

I would say that physically, she <b>died</b> <b>last</b> week, but in a lot of ways, emotionally she died when Daniel died," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|The Swedish-language {{national}} Finnish newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet {{reported on}} the front page of its 23 December 1988 issue — two days after the bombing — that a State Department spokesperson in Washington, Phyllis Oakley, confirmed the details of the bomb threat to the Helsinki Embassy. The newspaper writes that, [...] "according the spokesperson, the anonymous telephone voice also stated that the bomb would be transported from Helsinki to Frankfurt and onwards to New York on Pan-Am's flight to the US. The person transporting the bomb would not themselves be aware of it, with the explosives hidden in that person's luggage." [...] The same news article reports that the US Embassy in Moscow also received the same threat on 5 December, adding that Finland's foreign ministry has found no evidence in its investigations of any link to the Lockerbie crash. [...] "The foreign ministry assumes that an Arab living in Finland is behind the phone threat to the US Embassy in Helsinki. According to the foreign ministry's sources, the Arab has phoned throughout the year with threatening calls to the Israeli and US embassies ," [...] wrote the paper. [...] "The man who rang the embassies claimed to belong to Abu Nidal's radical Palestinian faction that has been responsible for many terrorist actions. The man said that a bomb would be placed on board a Pan-Am plane by a woman." [...] The article continues, [...] "This has led to speculation that a Finnish woman placed the bomb aboard the downed aircraft.

2500|$|<b>Died</b> <b>last</b> Saturday, after a {{lingering}} sickness, age 48 years, SAMUEL ELBERT, Esq. Major General of the Militia of this state, Vice {{president of the}} Society of [...] the Cincinnati, and Sheriff [...] of the County of Chatham. [...] His death was announced by the discharge of minute guns and the colours of Fort Wayne, and vessels in the harbour being displayed at half mast high. [...] An early and warm attachment {{to the cause of}} his country stimulated him to exert those natural talents he possessed for a military life, throughout [...] the late glorious and successful contest, with ability and general approbation, for which he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in the Army of the United States. [...] In the year 1785, his country chose him, by their general suffrage, Governor and Commander in chief of the State, which office he executed with fidelity and discharged its various duties with becoming attention and dignity. [...] The appointments of Major General of the Militia and Sheriff of this county, were further marks of the confidence of his country, whose interests he had always at heart, and whose appointments he received and executed, with a grateful remembrance that his conduct through life had met the approbation of fellow citizens. [...] In private life, he {{was among the first to}} promote useful and benevolent societies. [...] As a Christian, he bore his painful illness with patience and firmness, and looked forward to his great change with an awful and fixed hope of future happiness. [...] As a most affectionate husband and parent his widow and six children have great cause to lament his end, and the society in general to regret the loss of [...] a valuable member. [...] His remains were attended to on Sunday to Christ Church by the ancient society of the Masons, (of which he was the Passed (sic) Grand Master in this state) with the members of the Cincinnati as mourners, accompanied by a great number of his other fellow citizens, whom the Rev. Mr. Lindsay addressed in a short but well adapted discourse on the solemn occasion. [...] Minute guns were fired during the funeral, and every other honor was paid his memory, by a respectable military procession, composed of the Artillery and other Militia Companies. [...] The body was afterwards deposited at the family burial place on the Mount at Rae’s Hall.|$|E
