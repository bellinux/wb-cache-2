40|$|For new interventions, {{the results}} of {{sequential}} randomized or non-randomized trials and meta-analysis can differ significantly.

40|$|One {{prominent}} {{argument for}} pragmatic encroachment (PE) is that PE is entailed {{by a combination}} of a principle that states that knowledge warrants proper practical reasoning, and judgments that it is more difficult to reason well when the stakes go up. I argue here that this argument is unsuccessful. One problem is that empirical tests concerning knowledge judgments in high-stakes situations only sometimes exhibit the result predicted by PE. I argue here that those judgments that appear to support PE are better <b>interpreted</b> not as <b>judgments</b> that the epistemic demands for knowing increase as one’s practical situation becomes more demanding, but instead as judgments reflecting a different kind of normative epistemic evaluation, namely whether one is acting in an epistemically responsible way. The general idea is that when someone treats a proposition as a reason for acting we can evaluate them epistemically both in terms of whether they know that proposition, as well as in terms of whether they are acting on their knowledge in the right kind of way. My charge against the PE proponent, then, is that she is <b>interpreting</b> <b>judgments</b> that are indicative of whether we are adhering to certain normative epistemic requirements generally as being indicative of whether we have knowledge specifically. There are, however, normative epistemic requirements that make demands of us that are indicative of something other than our possession of knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Teaching {{competition}} {{is a common}} and standardized practice in mainland China, but until then it is rather new to teachers in Hong Kong. Teaching competition can have dual roles: being an activity for teacher development and {{as a kind of}} standard enforcement of teachers’ performances. The primary purpose of this dissertation was to examine the perceptions of teachers in Hong Kong towards teaching competition as a means for staff development. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this research study. A questionnaire containing both multiple choices and open-ended questions was used to collect data anonymously from secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. This study also attempted to explore other areas relating to teaching competition, including teacher collaboration, teaching performance assessment, teacher identity, and teacher standards. The results of this study showed that in general Hong Kong teachers did not reject the idea of using teaching competition as a platform for sharing and developing teaching skills. However, some teachers considered that teaching competition might, to a certain extent, induce tensions among teachers and jeopardize teacher collaboration. Judging teachers’ performances in teaching competition can be considered as a process of assessment. As such, applying theories of assessment could gain better understanding of the judgment itself, maintain fairness of judgment and clear up the misunderstanding of ostentation in teaching competition and non-determinacy of teaching performance. Moreover, the results of judgments in teaching competitions must be correctly <b>interpreted.</b> <b>Judgments</b> accompanied with feedback instead of simply feedouts could serve better for teacher development purpose. Finally, teaching competition could enforce performance standards to teachers. Findings from this research study revealed that recent education reform in Hong Kong would affect teachers’ views on teaching competition. It was argued that teaching competition might be an appropriate means to help teachers establish and re-establishing their discredited professional identity under the cultural change of marketization. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R

Next, a sequence of tests was applied, based on successive approaches of inter- and intra-evaluators’ behavior. Data were treated by statistical analysis (Cochran and Selenor tests). Results: with respect to the analysis of the evaluators' performance, it was possible to define those that presented the best results, in terms of reliability and proximity of analyses, as compared to the most experienced evaluator, excluding one. The results of the cluster analysis also allowed designing a voice quality profile of the group of speakers studied.

40|$|Natural {{resource}} management requires the simultaneous consideration {{of many different}} and often conflicting goals. For resource decisions to accurately reflect public values and desires, a systematic method is needed for assessing the importance which public groups attach to different management goals. Direct judgments {{of the importance of}} goals are often used as weights in additive utility models for evaluating alternative resource decisions. The overall value of each alternative is assessed by assigning it a value with respect to each relevant goal, multiplying each value by the corresponding goal's importance weight, and summing the weighted values. The validity of this procedure depends on the assumption that each goal's importance is judged independently of all other goals and is not affected by perceived conflicts between goals. Otherwise, the importance of some goals will be overestimated (double-counted). This study tested the validity of this assumption for direct judgments of the importance of forest management goals. Subjects read a description of a hypothetical national forest and rated the importance of six forest management goals on a ten-point scale. They also rated the amount of conflict between each possible pair of goals. The management scenarios were varied to represent two levels of conflict between a wilderness preservation goal and a timber production goal, and two levels of scarcity of existing wilderness areas in the region of the national forest. The conflict and scarcity manipulations were crossed, creating four conflict/scarcity conditions in a two-by-two ANOVA design. Analysis showed that both conflict and scarcity produced effects on ratings of the management goals' importance. The effects differed depending {{on the nature of the}} individual goal. In particular, goals which conflicted with wilderness preservation were rated lower in importance when the conflict was higher and when wilderness scarcity was high. This suggests that people discount the importance of goals which are perceived as conflicting with a highly valued goal, such as wilderness preservation. Importance ratings would therefore underestimate the importance of goals such as timber production if they were used as weights in an additive utility model. Further analysis revealed the presence of a single strong dimension underlying the ratings of conflict between goals. This dimension also seemed to be related to judgments of goal importance. It is possible that both conflict and importance judgments are made with respect to general cognitive attributes of the goals (for example preservation/utilization orientation). The results of this study show that direct judgments of goal importance may not satisfy the requirements of additive utility models, and that public perception of conflict between goals must be taken into account when <b>interpreting</b> <b>judgments</b> of the importance of management goals. A resource planner must be aware of what preconceptions the public holds about conflicts between goals and how these preconceptions affect the expressed importance of the goals...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The authors {{explored}} {{the relations between}} predictions of the likelihood of recalling studied items (called judgments of learning, or JOLs) and second-order judg-ments (SOJs), in which one rates confidence in the accuracy of each JOL. Each partici-pant studied paired–associate items and made JOLs. A given JOL was either immediate or delayed and was followed immediately by an SOJ. After all items were studied and judged, paired–associate recall occurred. The incorporation of SOJs into this standard method yielded numerous outcomes relevant to theory of metacognitive judgments. SOJs were greater for extreme JOLs (0, 100) than for intermediate JOLs (40, 50). Also, JOL accuracy was greater for delayed than for immediate JOLs, and, reflecting this delayed-JOL effect, SOJs were greater for delayed than for immediate JOLs. These and other out-comes support 2 -process hypotheses of how people make JOLs and uncover some pitfalls in <b>interpreting</b> poor <b>judgment</b> accuracy. Key words: judgments of learning, metacognition, metamemory, second-order judgments IN THIS ARTICLE, we offer an advance for metacognitive research by intro-ducing second-order judgments (SOJs), which provide a new perspective for exploring the processes and accuracy of metacognitive judgments in general and judgments of learning in particular.

These judgments have {{become one of the}} most intensely inves-tigated of the metacognitive judgments (Koriat, 1997; Schwartz, 1994), partly because making them accurately can support the effective regulation of self-paced study (Thiede, 1999).

The author argues that Scheler's concept of symbols can get round the obstacles of transcendental and eidetic reductions. Scheler <b>interprets</b> modifications of <b>judgments</b> only as modifications of individual pronouncements, but not as general pronouncements. It is a kind of treatment which has an influence upon whole phenomenological procedures, as well as upon the practice of phenomenological reductions.

40|$|A vast body of {{research}} points {{to the importance of}} justice to people. Justice exists between individuals and groups of individuals and is thus a social phenomenon. Communication constitutes {{an important part of the}} social construction of what is considered fair or unfair. It is for this reason that an examination of how and when people talk about justice, and what the consequences of such communications are, is so important. I suggest that justice can be employed by people (e. g., by adopting it in communications) to influence others or to attract others’ attention. I also suggest that self-interest plays a pivotal role in the use of justice in communications because justice can be seen as an objective, higher-order norm that conflicts with self-interest. The studies in Chapter 2 show that people use justice assertions to persuade others, but only when all conditions are present that warrant successful employment of justice assertions (i. e., no apparent self-interest, and able to adjust behavior to a situation). Chapter 3 presents experimental research data that shows that adopting justice assertions in communications renders a message more persuasive when the communication source is not pursuing self-interested goals. Chapter 4 shows that because of the aversive and threatening characteristics, and the social meaningfulness of injustice, unjust information draws and holds attention stronger than just, positive and neutral information and information that is equally negative but less socially meaningful. Finally, Chapter 5 investigates fluctuations in the justice sensitivity personality trait. I show that both fair and unfair experiences, directed toward the self and others, elevate justice sensitivity. These effects may be temporary or evolve into desensitization over repeated exposures, or, potentially, may shed light on the process of how people acquire sensitivity to justice. These chapters thus show that justice assertions and information are functional and are used as such. The current studies aim to contribute to a better understanding of the justice judgment process. Investigating the functionality of justice judgments helps to obtain a complete representation of the manners in which people use and <b>interpret</b> justice <b>judgments</b> and justice-related experiences, and contribute to our understanding of the justice judgment process...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Quantitative {{estimates}} of the magnitude, direction, and rate of change of health inequalities {{play a crucial role}} in creating and assessing policies aimed at eliminating the disproportionate burden of disease in disadvantaged populations. It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral process, providing objective data that are then <b>interpreted</b> using normative <b>judgments</b> about whether a particular distribution of health is just, fair, or socially acceptable. METHODS: We discuss five examples in which normative judgments play a role in the measurement process itself, through either the selection of one measurement strategy to the exclusion of others or the selection of the type, significance, or weight assigned to the variables being measured. FINDINGS: Overall, we find that many commonly used measures of inequality are value laden and that the normative judgments implicit in these measures have important consequences for interpreting and responding to health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Because values implicit in the generation of health inequality measures may lead to radically different interpretations of the same underlying data, we urge researchers to explicitly consider and transparently discuss the normative judgments underlying their measures. We also urge policymakers and other consumers of health inequalities data to pay close attention to the measures on which they base their assessments of current and future health policies.

In our cases, the mission and purpose dictate every other aspect in the organisational life. Our findings from Reaktor and Buurtzorg are in line with the general assumption that in the future organisations will seek to use technology for everything that it can be used for. However, context specific decision-making that requires <b>judgment,</b> <b>interpreting</b> subtle cues, creative problem solving, ethical consideration and above all human-to-human communication, will become key elements in work, as they already are in our cases. There is currently nothing that suggests these needs to disappear with the emergence of sophisticated automation. Thus, organisations are likely to evolve to make the most out of those human abilities. For people, this shift in focus, at least in the cases we observed, increases job satisfaction, and makes work an integral element in life. At the root of the self-organised model in our cases seems to be a change in the mind-set which allows empowered individuals within the organisations the authority to pursue work that they see as meaningful and important. Designing and implementing IT-solutions that really {{meet the needs of the}} people they will be serving, and providing quality care that supports the autonomy of the clients to lead a good life, are only two examples of needs in our current societies that today predominantly are not met.
