Similarly Indonesian Professor George Aditjondro, formerly of Salatiga University in Java, concluded from his study of Indonesian Army data that in fact 300,000 Timorese <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> {{the early years of the}} occupation.|$|E

5|$|The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, {{including}} {{a platoon of}} 70 Rhodesians, was transferred from France to the Salonika Front in 1915. On this comparatively quiet front, they were slowly whittled down {{over the course of}} the war: 26 of them remained in January 1917, and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon no longer existed. Most of the men <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> action, while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) never {{recovered}} from {{the crash of the}} Amana. Since the beginning of 1945, 77 people <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> accidents in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the blaze.|$|E

Adeka's older brother <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E

McGuire, Jr, the second-highest scoring US fighter pilot, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> action.|$|E

Cunningham knew the family well and contacted his father, whose other son John <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> a collision while flying a Mosquito in 1943. With the agreement of de Havilland senior, Cunningham took the dead pilot's post which earned him £2,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, nine of {{the fallen}} militants were buried in Erec. Some 400 ethnic Albanians {{attended}} their funerals. The dead {{ranged in age from}} seventeen to forty-five years old. Villagers claimed that some of the dead had been arrested days before their deaths and thus could not have been ambushed, as the Yugoslav authorities claimed. Such claims could not be independently verified by Western reporters. In a 1998 report, Amnesty International affirmed that the 19 men <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> an ambush while trying to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.|$|E
