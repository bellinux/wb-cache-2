2500|$|In finance, a {{convertible}} bond or [...] convertible note or convertible debt (or {{a convertible}} debenture {{if it has}} a maturity of greater than 10 years) is a type of bond that the holder can convert into a specified number of shares of common stock in the issuing company or cash of equal value. [...] It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It originated in the mid-19th century, and was used by early speculators such as Jacob Little and Daniel Drew to counter market cornering. [...] Convertible bonds are most often issued by companies with a low credit rating and high growth potential. [...] Convertible bonds are also considered debt security because the companies agree to give fixed or <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> as they do in common bonds for the funds of investor.|$|E

40|$|This article {{shows that}} European firms do their {{shareholders}} a disservice {{if they use}} bank financing, especially if that financing comes with restrictive covenants and <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The restrictive covenants discourage expansion and the <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> make the firm's cash flows less stable. The better way to finance the firm is with fixed-rate bonds. With bond financing, the covenants are less restrictive and the firm's interest expense is more stable. The simulation approach which the authors have developed gives estimates of how much each attribute of the financing affects the company's share price. The effects that they found are large [...] for example, choosing fixed-rate bond financing over floating-rate bank financing adds 17. 4 per cent to the stock price. Interest expense {{is an important component}} of cost in the author's simulation, and making it fixed instead of floating brings enough stability to the firm's cash flow to deliver a large increase in the stock price. Also, postponing a new factory, as managers might do to avoid violating the restrictive covenants of bank loans, lowers the stock price 19. 7 per cent. In the simulation, the firm has adequate capacity at the beginning, but in many scenarios becomes capacity-constrained after one or two years. Stock market investors gain if the company buys the factory sooner, because they place a high value on growth and market share.

40|$|The authors {{document}} {{and try to}} explain the sizable cross-country differences in <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on external debt paid {{by a group of}} highly indebted developing countries in 1973 - 89. They find that Indonesia and Turkey, which are often praised for not rescheduling in the 1980 s, paid <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> substantially below LIBOR - and avoided the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> shock of the early 1980 s. Differences in the default-risk premium explain some of the variation among countries, but different degrees of access to official loans carrying highly subsidized <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> played the major role. In the sample they studied, they found no evidence that debt at <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> was more expensive than debt at fixed rates. For the period 1981 - 89, it is possible to control for differences in the currency composition of debt, and the results are essentially unchanged. These results suggest that studies of economic performance among the highly indebted countries during the debt crisis should control for cross-country differences in the burden of interest payments.

50|$|The most {{innovative}} product was the “swap” first {{done by the}} World Bank in a transaction facilitated by Salomon Brothers with IBM in 1981. The swap in its original form permitted a borrower of one currency to shift its obligation into another currency or to permit a borrowing at <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to shift to a fixed-rate obligation or vice versa. The swap thereby permitted the liquefying of balance sheets so issuers were able to shift their original obligations through exchanging cash flows with a counter-party. Later, the swap was used {{in a wide variety}} of financial products. It is used today as both a risk-reducing and risk-taking product. The swap market has developed into the largest securities market in the world, accounting for over $500 trillion in transactions. It revolutionized financial management for governments and the private sector in the management of their resources.|$|R
50|$|An {{interest}} rate swap's (IRS's) effective description is a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies {{the nature of}} an exchange of payments benchmarked against an {{interest rate}} index. The most common IRS is a fixed for floating swap, whereby one party will make payments to the other based on an initially agreed fixed rate of interest, to receive back payments based on a <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> index. Each of these series of payments is termed a 'leg', so a typical IRS has both a fixed and a floating leg. The floating index is commonly an interbank offered rate (IBOR) of specific tenor in the appropriate currency of the IRS, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK.To completely determine any IRS a number of parameters must be specified for each leg; the notional principal amount (or varying notional schedule), the start and end dates and date scheduling, the fixed rate, the chosen <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> index tenor, and day count conventions for interest calculations.|$|E

Any instance of an interest rate being reset—either due to maturities or <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> resets—is called a repricing. The date on which it occurs is called the repricing date.|$|E
40|$|This paper derives a {{pricing model}} for a quanto foreign equity/domestic {{floating}} rate swap in which one party pays domestic <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and receives foreign stock returns determined in the foreign currency, but is paid in the domestic currency. We use the risk-neutral valuation technique developed by Amin and Bodurtha to generate an arbitrage-free pricing model. A closed-form solution is obtained under further restrictions on the drift rates of the asset price processes. Pricing formulae show {{that the value of}} a quanto equity swap at the start date does not depend on the foreign stock price level, but rather on the term structures of both countries and other parameters. However, the foreign stock price levels do affect the swap value times between two payment dates. The numerical implementations indicate that the domestic and foreign term structures, the correlation between the foreign <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and the exchange rate, and the correlation between the exchange rate and the foreign stock are more important factors in pricing a quanto equity swap than other correlations.

40|$|Tribunals in {{international}} arbitration are regularly asked by claimants to award prejudgment interest. Unless foreclosed by {{an agreement between}} the parties, there is widespread agreement prejudgment interest should put the claimant {{in the same position}} as it would have been had it not been injured by the respondent. However, there is little consensus how to calculate prejudgment interest in order to accomplish that purpose. In this Essay, we describe the proper method of calculating prejudgment interest based on sound financial principles. Using the paradigm that the respondent has forced the claimant to make an involuntary loan to the respondent, we argue that prejudgment interest should be computed using the respondent 2 ̆ 7 s borrowing rate. Furthermore, we argue that tribunals should use a series of short-term, <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> rather than a single long-term rate at the commencement of the dispute in order to provide the parties with the proper incentive to settle their dispute. We also discuss how the calculations are different when the parties are individuals and closely held corporations as opposed to corporations and governments, and we address complications that arise when a tribunal calculates damages in one currency and makes a final award in another currency...|$|R

The question is already relevant for mortgage choices in several countries and will probably become relevant for more mortgage markets due to the ongoing liberalization of such markets. Our economic agent has an exogenously determined initial amount of debt.

First, the static case is considered, where no rebalancing of debt is al-lowed after the initial point in time. The optimal fraction of floating rate debt is shown to be proportional to the wealth-to-debt ratio. No closed form solution for the optimal fraction of floating rate debt is available, but some analytical approximations are discussed and compared with numer-ical solutions. Next, the dynamic case is treated where the debt portfolio can be rebalanced continuously at no cost. In this case closed form solu-tions for the optimal fraction of floating rate debt are available We find...|$|R
40|$|The {{main issue}} that this {{research}} deals {{with is the}} evaluation of the structural adjustment policies adopted in 1980. Their impact on the Turkish economy is assessed, and comparisons are made with the 1970 s. Econometric methods are used to assist the evaluation and two models, based on the Klein model I, are developed and compared. This study also includes an analysis of the changes that occurred at the sectoral level (agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism) {{as a result of the}} 1980 structural adjustment programme. In addition, the thesis contains a review of the literature on structural adjustment. An overview of the Turkish economy is provided including the economic policies implemented by different Turkish governments in 1978 and 1979. The research findings show the need to stabilise the exchange rate. Inflation has been exacerbated by continuing depreciation. Domestic supply, in particular industrial production, is the key determinant of exports, not the exchange <b>rate.</b> In addition, <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which rose substantially in the 1980 s, appear to have a moderate positive impact on savings and credits. Also, the evidence suggests that structural adjustment has improved income distribution in Turkey.

50|$|With {{inflation}} at double-digit rates {{per month}} {{as a result}} of printing, macroeconomic stabilization was enacted to curb this trend. Stabilization, also called structural adjustment, is a harsh austerity regime (tight monetary policy and fiscal policy) for the economy in which the government seeks to control inflation. Under the stabilization program, the government let most prices <b>float,</b> raised <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to record highs, raised heavy new taxes, sharply cut back on government subsidies to industry and construction, and made massive cuts in state welfare spending. These policies caused widespread hardship as many state enterprises found themselves without orders or financing.

5000|$|The term {{notional}} principal contract (NPC) {{is a term}} of art used by U.S. {{federal income}} tax professionals for contracts based on an underlying notional amount (other financial services professionals refer to such NPCs under the more general heading [...] "swaps," [...] although not all swaps are NPCs). The reason the underlying amount is [...] "notional" [...] is because neither party to the NPC is required to actually hold the property comprising the underlying amount. NPCs involve two parties who agree contractually to pay each other amounts at specified times, based on the underlying notional amount. The simplest example of an NPC is a so-called <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swap, in which one party (Party A) pays the other party (Party B) an amount each quarter determined by multiplying a <b>floating,</b> market-determined <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (e.g., LIBOR) by the notional amount; and Party B pays Party A on the same date an amount determined by multiplying a fixed <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> by the notional amount.|$|R
40|$|The {{market prices}} of {{developing}} countries'debts are imperfect {{indicators of the}} countries'payment capacity for three reasons: the concave shape of the debt's payoff structure, the presence of third-party guarantees, and {{the differences in the}} terms of various debt claims. Claessens and Pennacchi derive an improved indicator of payment capacityby developing a pricing model - using option valuation techniques - that takes these three factors into account. Applying the model to bonds issued recently by Mexico and Venezuela, they find that the estimated indicator of payment capacity often behaves differently from the raw bond prices themselves, confirming the importance of cleaning the raw prices for these three factors. In order of importance, the benefits of cleaning raw prices come first from correcting for the effects of different terms (such as fixed versus <b>floating</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates),</b> followed by the value of third-party enhancements and then by the concavity of the payoff structure. They find some evidence that the new indicator of repayment capacity conforms better than the raw prices themselves to generally held beliefs about which variables drive a country's repayment capacity. In particular, they find that variables that are often assumed to be related to payment capacity - such as oil prices and the countries'stock market prices - are more closely (and with the right sign) associated with the new estimated measure of payment capacity than are the secondary market prices of the bonds.
