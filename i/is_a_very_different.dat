25|$|While the {{diagnosis}} of brain death has become accepted {{as a basis for}} the certification of death for legal purposes, it should be clearly understood that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> state from biological death - the state universally recognized and understood as death. The continuing function of vital organs in the bodies of those diagnosed brain dead, if mechanical ventilation and other life-support measures are continued, provides optimal opportunities for their transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} to higher education for women is the physical and cultural distance of the universities from Negev Bedouin towns. Even the nearest universities require significant travel time to and from campus. In many instances, Bedouin women are only permitted {{to make the trip}} if accompanied by a male relative. Moreover, the university <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> cultural space than Negev Bedouin towns. Jewish-Israeli culture is largely modern and secular, as opposed to the traditional, religious culture in Negev Bedouin society. This pronounced cultural difference is both an obstacle to enrolling at universities and a challenge women must overcome once they arrive. Additionally, societal pressure to marry young can conflict with attaining a university education. While there have been cases where women could attain a university education after marrying, the familial responsibilities (childcare and housework, for instance) provide additional challenges to completing their studies. Further, studying after marriage is entirely dependent upon the approval of the women's husbands. In other words, women are always dependent upon male consent for their studies, either from their fathers (or other male guardians) or their husbands. Finally, the lack of female employment opportunities means that studying at a university {{does not seem to be}} a reasonable investment, especially in instances where family resources are limited.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|Flann {{was served}} by Máel Mura Othna (died 887), [...] "chief poet of Ireland". In 885 Máel Mura {{composed}} the praise poem Flann for Érinn (Flann over Ireland). This linked Flann with the deeds {{of the legendary}} Uí Néill ancestor Túathal Techtmar. As Máire Herbert notes, Máel Mura depicts Tuathal as a 9th-century ruler, taking hostages from lesser kings, compelling their obedience and founding his kingship over Ireland on force. The high king in Flann for Érinn has authority over the fir Érenn (the men of Ireland) and leads them in war. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{from the way the}} kingship of Flann's 6th century ancestor Diarmait mac Cerbaill is portrayed in early sources.|$|E

McIlarth notes that [...] "Torches" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{when compared to}} most of the band's material, due to its heavy metal intro and breakdown. The penultimate track, [...] "Amber Changing", is more muted in its sound, and has McIlrath sing about not wanting a great moment in a relationship to end. The album ends with a hidden track, a cover of [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] by Journey. The band covered the song to bring a sense of familiarity to listeners while on tour.|$|E
500|$|The two symphonies are {{strongly}} contrasted with one another. The First is {{on a large}} scale, reminiscent at times of Sibelius. Grove says {{of the work that}} its [...] "orgiastic power, coruscating malice, sensuous desolation and extroverted swagger" [...] make the symphony a tribute to Walton's tenacity and inventive facility. Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up {{to the rest of the}} work. In comparison with the First, the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight, and, as with many of Walton's works of the 1950s, it was regarded as old fashioned. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> kind of work from the First Symphony. David Cox describes it as [...] "more a divertimento than a symphony ... highly personal, unmistakably Walton throughout", and Kennedy calls it [...] "somewhat enigmatic in mood, and a superb example of Walton's more mature, concise, and mellow post-1945 style." ...|$|E

An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle's argument but recognised his belief that [...] "because {{of the effect of}} the effluxion of time, he was entitled to take a different view", and concluded that the Chief Justice's argument was [...] "sufficiently plausible to make it difficult to say that that position is manifestly improper or that, in adopting it, Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct." [...] Beadle explained in a 1972 interview: [...] "We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when the thing was in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in, we wouldn't budge. But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the principle of law, which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it. Yet because we accepted the inevitable we're blamed {{by a lot of people}} for being responsible for the revolution, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the episode, the Doctor behaves erratically, as he {{gradually}} gets used to his {{new body}} and tastes while developing a new personality. Willis stated that he [...] "finally clicks into place" [...] after picking out his new outfit." [...] The rooftop scene {{was not in the}} original script; the Doctor simply ran away from the ward and returned to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he did not really have a formal introduction, and that more could be made of the costume, as many previous Doctors had picked theirs out quietly. The main story arc is the Doctor meeting the grown-up Amy. Moffat felt that over time the relationships between the Doctor and his companions had become too adult. He wanted to create a childlike relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed {{this was the kind of}} relationship viewers had with the Doctor, regardless of their age. When the Doctor returns for Amy, she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> person from the seven-year-old he had met before. Moffat explains that she developed a tough element and had become distrustful and cynical due to him not returning as promised, forcing her to accept that he was an imaginary friend. Rory was completely in love with Amy, but Amy wanted adventures before admitting she loved him, too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary Doctor.|$|E
500|$|The telepathic mutant {{leader and}} founder of the X-Men. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in {{humanity}} create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out who they are and you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E
500|$|In an NPR {{interview}} via affiliate WBUR-FM, Mumbai Mirror columnist Aseem Chhabra called Chak De! India [...] "an {{example of}} a film that's been made {{within the framework of}} Bollywood and yet it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> film. It does take up some realistic issues, and what I really liked about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, each one of them got a chance. Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film. Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India. People loved it". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars stating that it was a film of [...] "great performances by a bunch of unknowns." [...] India Today called Chak De! India [...] "the most feisty girl power movie to have come out of Bollywood ever." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote, [...] "At another level, Chak De is about women's liberation. It {{is one of the best}} feminist films of our times." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Chak De's ... a winner all the way." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film [...] "the most authentic, meticulously researched sports movie India has made". [...] In Kolkata's Telegraph, Bharathi S. Pradhan wrote that the film combines [...] "an extremely well-knit screenplay with unrelentingly deft direction, 16 unknown, and not even glamorous, girls simply carried you with them, with one single known actor compelling you to watch Chak De India without blinking". Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave Chak De! India four out of five stars stating that [...] "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket." [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Derek Elley of Variety called Chak De! India [...] "a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals." [...] In The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that the [...] "technical credits are first rate with excellent cinematography, quicksilver editing, musical montages of practice and a fine use of locations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Burleson, Clarkson {{was encouraged by}} her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series [...] in May 2002. Despite receiving a [...] "golden ticket," [...] a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as [...] "ghetto", explaining: [...] "On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK but America <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress."

[...] He later elaborated that [...] "The feel of Thor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> than Iron Man. Yet they live in the same universe. For me, it’s like somehow Indiana Jones showed up on the Enterprise, or something." [...] Tyler described The Dark World as [...] "science fiction meeting classic medieval war", and saw it as a cross between Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings—"there’s spaceships and lasers ... but within it they wear capes and fight with swords and ride horses ... those were not elements really present as much in the first one. So it required something different. I think my score for Thor: The Dark World would have been out of place in the first film and vice versa." [...] Azam Ali, who collaborated with Tyler on Children of Dune, and Tori Letzler are featured vocalists for the score; Tyler felt that their contributions provided [...] "something emotional" [...] to the score.|$|E

2500|$|Freud's {{analysis}} {{of the dynamics of}} Life and Death was mistaken, according to Brown, since Freud's discovery of the ultimate identity of the two instincts implied that there is no necessary antagonism between Eros and Thanatos: they exist in harmony at a deeper level of psychic life and aggression was therefore not inevitable. Brown believed that the death instinct need not be externalized in the form of aggression if [...] "men could recapture the original undifferentiated harmony of Life and Death." [...] Brown therefore {{called for an end to}} the [...] "repression of death" [...] that perpetuated aggression. People had to learn [...] "how to die" [...] or, more concretely, to learn [...] "how to grow old." [...] Robinson calls Brown's argument [...] "daring", and stresses that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> solution to the problem of aggression than that proposed by Marcuse, since it was a psychological solution that involved adopting a new attitude toward death and did not involve political or economic revolution. Robinson compares Brown and Marcuse's treatment of Reich: both criticize him for [...] "misrepresenting the problem of repression as one of genital sexuality" [...] and advocated polymorphous perversity instead, but Brown again provided an exclusively psychological argument.|$|E

Whereas Slade had been a huge influence on Kiss, the favor was now returned, as Whatever {{has a bit of}} the Hotter Than Hell, early-Kiss sound, which the band has acknowledged. It's still pure Slade, though. The songs and playing here are pretty much out of sight, with monster riffs and a different production style. For the Slade fan, this is a great record, and one you probably never heard. Rectify that." [...] Joe Geesin of Get Ready to Rock! said of the 2007 Salvo remaster: [...] "legendarily titled after a genuine piece of graffiti, the album is a return to the band's skinhead roots. It was also their first album since leaving Polydor. Some rough Slade style rock'n'roll, but gone was the glam (largely) and the kitsch. Still very much Slade, but if you're only familiar with the early 70s hits this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> beast. There's some great rough guitar." [...] In 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "superior: reputation cementing" [...] and wrote: [...] "Viewed with hindsight as the band's 'lost' album, Whatever Happened to Slade was buried by punk, yet praised by many punk musicians. But however marginalised, a world-beating band doesn't become shit overnight, and Whatever Happened to Slade tempers their established qualities with righteous indignation." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Returning from their lengthy attempt to crack America, Whatever Happened to Slade showed muscle, but the prime influence was US stadium boogie, paired with Noddy's least charming lyrics." ...|$|E
