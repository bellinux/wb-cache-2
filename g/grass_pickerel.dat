50|$|The American pickerels are two {{subspecies}} of Esox americanus, {{a species}} of freshwater fish in the pike family (family Esocidae) of order Esociformes: the redfin pickerel, E. americanus americanus Gmelin, 1789, and the <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel,</b> E. americanus vermiculatus Lesueur, 1846.|$|E
50|$|The redfin and <b>grass</b> <b>pickerels</b> occur {{primarily}} in sluggish, vegetated waters of pools, lakes, and swamps, and are carnivorous, feeding on smaller fish. Larger fishes, {{such as the}} striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bowfin (Amia calva), and gray weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), in turn, prey on the pickerels when they venture into larger rivers or estuaries.|$|R
50|$|Both {{subspecies}} {{are native}} to North America. They {{are not to}} be confused with their aggressive counterpart the Northern pike. The redfin pickerel's range extends from the Saint Lawrence drainage in Quebec down to the Gulf Coast, from Mississippi to Florida, while the <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel's</b> range is further west, extending from the Great Lakes Basin, from Ontario to Michigan, down to the western Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas to Mississippi.|$|R
50|$|Kensico Reservoir sustains {{an active}} {{population}} of gamefish, supplemented by stocking, including brown trout, lake trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, perch, and <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel.</b> The size {{and depth of}} the reservoir allow Lake Trout in particular to thrive. Shore fishing is practiced in many areas, and boating is restricted to DEC licensed and inspected aluminum rowboats. No motor-boat of any kind are permitted on the reservoir, nor are recreational watercraft such as kayaks, rafts, or canoes.|$|E
50|$|The redfin {{pickerel}} (Esox americanus americanus) is a subspecies {{of freshwater}} fish belonging to the pike family (Esocidae) of the order Esociformes. Not {{to be confused with}} its close relatives, the <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> and the chain pickerel, this fish is unique in {{the fact that it has}} brightly colored red fins. Like all pikes, the redfin pickerel is an ambush predator, lying amongst thick vegetation in wait for smaller, more agile prey to enter within its range of attack.|$|E

5000|$|Stomach {{contents}} of 46 individual banded pygmy sunfish (26 {{of which were}} spawning adults) collected at Mound, Louisiana, were examined for food identification. The main food identified included insect larvae (mostly from the family Chironomidae), small crustaceans, and snail eggs. The crustaceans and snail eggs combined constituted {{the majority of the}} content. Next in quantity were insect larvae. Minute amounts of algal spores were ingested by these fish. These algae were most likely taken in accidentally with other prey in the presence of algal blooms. Lastly, no other fish species or banded pygmy sunfish larvae were found in the stomach contents. [...] The banded pygmy sunfish lives in rather eutrophic conditions such as swamps and ponds. They are able to live in sedimentation levels that make oxygen availability less than 0.5 mg/L of water. Very few fish species can survive in this hypoxic condition. The only other notable fish that affect E. zonatum are live-bearers (Poeciliidae), the <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> (Esox americanus), and bowfins (Amia calva). [...] The bowfins are known to be occasional predators on the pygmy sunfish family. Occasionally, the <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> and live-bearers are competitors for food with the pygmy sunfish. Other than fish, water snakes and fish-eating birds are known to be enemies. Water beetles and Ondonta nymphs are known to be competitors for insect larvae. [...] Wetland habitat is important for spawning habitat, but it is also an important habitat for food and protection. It provides dense plant matter (especially Ceratophyllum) for cover against predators and as a laying area of snail eggs. This habitat is also excellent as a source for insect eggs and larvae. Thus, the human development of wetland habitat not only affects Elassomatidae, but several other species of fish and insects, as well.|$|E
50|$|This fish {{seems to}} prefer water with low {{dissolved}} oxygen levels, warmer temperatures, and low flow. It {{is able to}} live in hypoxic conditions because {{of its ability to}} breathe air. This species is also known to feed in the winter in temperatures as low as 1.1 Â°C. According to Jenkins and Miller, some animals that feed on the mudminnow are the <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel,</b> sunfishes, northern pike, and catfishes; it is also preyed upon by birds, foxes, and snakes when caught out of water. This mudminnow is known to bury itself in the mud or sand to avoid capture in some situations. Also, Jenkins and Miller found that the mudminnow is a shoaling fish; they prefer to be with other mudminnows rather than by themselves. This shoaling mechanism seems reduce their predation risk.|$|E
5000|$|Thousands {{of plant}} and animal species grow {{throughout}} the conservation area. The list of plant species totals 471 and includes plants such as wild sarsaparilla, green and white trilliums, wild ginger, wild geranium, Virginia bluebells, Canada yew, arrowhead, wild leek, asparagus, wild yam, red mulberry, wild columbine, Canada anemone, chokecherry, Virginia creeper and St. John's wort. Ball's Falls is made up of hardwoods mixed with coniferous trees, lying within the deciduous forest zone. Tree species include Eastern cottonwood, butternut, black walnut, shagbark hickory, white oak, tulip tree and slippery elm. Rare species include sycamore, sassafras and pignut hickory. The species of fish living in Twenty Mile Creek include the largemouth bass, yellow perch, <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel,</b> rock bass, green sunfish, creek chub and pumpkinseed. [...] Among the species of birds found at Ball's Falls are the eastern bluebird, indigo bunting, house sparrows, northern cardinals, mallards, killdeer.|$|E
5000|$|The central mudminnow {{lives in}} slow-moving water around ponds, lakes, and streams in central North America, and ranges in length from 51-102 mm. It burrows tail-first in mud and can {{tolerate}} low oxygen levels, {{allowing it to}} live in waterways unavailable to other fishes. Its coloration matches this habitat, being brownish above with mottled sides and a pale belly. It is eaten by many species of fish such as <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel,</b> sunfishes, northern pike, and catfishes; it is also preyed upon by birds, foxes, and snakes when caught out of water. According to Paszkowski and Tonn, mudminnows perform better in environments with other fish species than in environments with just mudminnows, because the [...] "interspecific interactions override a similar contribution for the mudminnow, which {{is regarded as a}} fugitive species". Central mudminnows are known to eat a large variety of zooplankton and benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates. Adults are also known to feed energetically in the winter months on littoral fish. One experiment conducted by Colgan and Silburt resulted in mudminnows typically feeding more on benthic than plaktonic resources, with zooplankton making up only 0.7 of 511 items found in the stomach. This mudminnow uses a modified gas bladder to breathe air pockets trapped between the ice and water during the winter to feed and stay active.|$|E
5000|$|The Red Cedar River is a {{familiar}} campus landmark at Michigan State University. The name of the river is featured in {{the first line of}} MSU's fight song, and MSU students can be found studying in the parkland along its banks. A number of student activities centered around the Red Cedar over the course of MSU's history, including freshman vs. sophomore [...] "tug-o-war" [...] spanning the river and a Water Carnival featuring student made floats drifting in procession. People on campus frequently feed the large community of mallard ducks that congregate near the river. Wildlife in the river includes 33 species of fish and various other aquatic animals, and study of the river and its ecosystem is incorporated into relevant areas of the university's curricula. Fishing was banned on the campus in the 1960s; the ban was rescinded for a section of the river in 2013. The river is popular in the summer for canoeing and kayaking. (The campus canoe dock is self-mockingly named Red Cedar Yacht Club.) During floods, the river forms a standing wave at the campus dam that can be surfed. In the winter, the river often freezes over and students walk or play on the ice despite the inherent danger. During its inaugural season in 1922, the MSU hockey team played games on the frozen river. Alongside the river on MSU's campus is the W.J. Beal Botanical Garden, the oldest continuous botanical garden in the United States. The garden was started in 1873. A variety of species of fish {{can be found in the}} Red Cedar River. From December 1979 to 1981, Dr. Patrick M. Muzzall from MSU's zoology department collected the following species: white sucker, northern hog sucker, spotted sucker, golden redhorse, silver redhorse, rock bass, green sunfish, pumpkin seed, warmouth, bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, stoneroller, carp, hornyhead chub, common shiner, rosyface shiner, sand shiner, bluntnose minnow, blacknose dace, creek chub, <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel,</b> brook stickleback, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rainbow darter, johnny darter, yellow perch, blackside darter, and central mudminnow.|$|E
40|$|<b>Grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> were {{collected}} in rivers and streams throughout Indiana for diet analysis. Frequency of occurrence, mean percent volume, and relative importance index were calculated for diet from all <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> stomachs containing food. <b>Grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> were divided into three size classes (57 - 95 mm, 96 - 150 mm, > 150 mm) and stomach contents were divided into four groups (insects, fish, crayfish, and other). <b>Grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> in the small size class consumed mostly fish and crayfish while in the largest size class mostly crayfish were ingested.

40|$|Fishes {{were trapped}} moving between the river channel and two {{distinct}} floodplain habitats: an ephemeral ditch and a permanent pool. Twenty-five fish species were sampled by one-way traps and seine; dominant species were <b>grass</b> <b>pickerel</b> (Esox americanus), green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus) and orange spotted sunfish (L. humilis). Numbers of fish trapped per day were {{positively correlated with}} river discharge yielding a significant exponential relationship. Recaptures of marked fish were rare indicating seasonal use of the floodplain. Juveniles made up 54. 7 % of the fish collected, revealing the value of floodplains as nursery areas. No significant migration trends of size or taxon occurred by date or discharge. Samples of fish leaving the ephemeral ditch and samples of those entering the permanent pool showed the highest similarity index value. These data suggest that flood exploitative fishes, those species adapted to flooding, continue to see favourable backwater habitat when forced off the floodplain...|$|E
