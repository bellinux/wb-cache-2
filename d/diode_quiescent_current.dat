40|$|A DC-DC {{converter}} is {{an important}} power management module as it converts one DC voltage level to another suitable for powering a desired electronic system. It also stabilizes the output voltage when fluctuations appear in the power supplies. For those wireless sensor networks (WSNs) powered by energy harvesting, the DC-DC converter is usually a linear regulator and it resides at the last stage of the whole energy harvesting system just before the empowering sensor node. Due to the low power densities of energy sources, one may have to limit the <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> of the linear regulator in the sub-uA regime. This severe restriction on <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> could greatly compromise other performance aspects, especially the transient response. This dissertation reports a voltage regulator system topology which utilizes the sensor node state information to achieve ultra-low power consumption. The regulator system is composed of two regulators with different current driving abilities and <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> consumptions. The key idea is to switch between the two regulators depending on the sensor state. Since the "right" regulator is used at the "right" time, the average <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> of the regulator system is minimized, and the trade-off between low <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> and fast transient response has been eliminated. In order to minimize the average <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> of the system, nano-ampere reference current design is studied, and the proposed reference current circuit is shown (theoretically and experimentally) to reduce the supply voltage dependence by 5 X. The regulator system has been fabricated and tested using an ON Semiconductor 0. 5 &# 956;m process. It has been verified through experiments that the proposed system reduces the <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> by 3 X over the state-of-the-art in the literature; and, more importantly, it achieves low <b>quiescent</b> <b>current,</b> low dropout voltage, and fast transient response with small output voltage variation {{all at the same}} time.

40|$|Abstract — The {{demand for}} low-voltage, low {{drop-out}} (LDO) regulators is increasing {{because of the}} growing demand for portable electronics, i. e., cellular phones, pagers, laptops, etc. LDO’s are used coherently with dc-dc converters as well as standalone parts. In power supply systems, they are typically cascaded onto switching regulators to suppress noise and provide a low noise output. The need for low voltage is innate to portable low power devices and corroborated by lower breakdown voltages resulting from reductions in feature size. Low <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> in a battery-operated system is an intrinsic performance parameter because it partially determines battery life. This paper discusses some techniques that enable the practical realizations of low <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> LDO’s at low voltages and in existing technologies. The proposed circuit exploits the frequency response dependence on load-current to minimize <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> flow. Moreover, the output current capabilities of MOS power transistors are enhanced and drop-out voltages are decreased for a given device size. Other applications, like dc-dc converters, can also {{reap the benefits of}} these enhanced MOS devices. An LDO prototype incorporating the aforementioned techniques was fabricated. The circuit was operable down to input voltages of 1 V with a zeroload <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> flow of 23 &quot;A.
