25|$|The Australian <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service</b> (formerly {{known as}} the Royal Australian Navy <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service)</b> is the Australian Commonwealth Government agency {{responsible}} for providing hydrographic services that meet Australia's obligations under the SOLAS convention and the national interest; enabling safe navigation, maritime trade and supporting protection of the marine environment. The agency, headquartered at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales, {{is an element of}} the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and serves both military and civilian functions. The names Australian <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service</b> and the Australian Hydrographic Office are commonly abbreviated as AHS or AHO respectively.|$|E

25|$|After the war, the Admiralty {{decided that}} with higher {{priorities}} in Europe, {{it would provide}} at most a single vessel for survey operations around Australia, and the Australian government was forced to create its own hydrographic surveying service. After deliberation on whether the new <b>hydrographic</b> <b>service</b> would be military or civilian operated, the government decided that surveying would be a naval responsibility, with the RAN <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service</b> established on 1 October 1920. A single sloop, , was commissioned into RAN service to supplement the Royal Navy survey vessel, and was later fitted with a Fairey IIID seaplane to assist with surveys of the Great Barrier Reef. Geranium was replaced by , but the new survey ship was placed in reserve once the Great Barrier Reef survey was completed in 1929. By this point, no other survey operations (military or civilian) were being performed in Australian waters.|$|E

25|$|In 1827 a {{navigation}} corps was founded, {{which also}} {{was in charge}} of the <b>hydrographic</b> <b>service.</b> In common with other non-executive corps in the Russian navy, members of the navigation corps were given military ranks. This corps contained one major general, and a number of colonels, lieutenant colonels, captains, staff captains, lieutenants, second lieutenants and ensigns, as well as conductors (warrant officers). In 1885 the navigation corps was abolished, and its responsibilities were transferred to the executive corps.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the inherent value of <b>hydrographic</b> <b>services</b> and bathymetric surveys beyond the obvious benefit of improved nautical charts. These {{direct and indirect}} benefits are not traditionally recognized for their economic value to coastal States as they are difficult to quantify. Also, their actual value is somewhat dependent on the specific economic, recreational, and defense activities of each coastal State. Convincing governments to invest in hydrography and bathymetry can be difficult. However even without quantitative analysis, there is strong logical and qualitative argument that recognizes the critical value of <b>hydrographic</b> <b>services</b> as {{an essential element of}} national infrastructure and a critical enabler of other maritime activities. Thus, providing government with information detailing the second and third order benefits of bathymetric surveys and <b>hydrographic</b> <b>services</b> may influence further investment in these essential enablers of economic growth...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of HHCode {{can be traced}} to efforts by scientists working for the Canadian <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service's</b> Atlantic regional offices at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. CHS was facing a problem with storing very large spatial datasets acquired during hydrographic surveys (thus having a temporal element) and was seeking a method to store the datasets in a relational database structure.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{extremely}} complex tidal {{regime in the}} Northumberland Strait consisting of diurnal and semi-diurnal cycles, any attempt to close Abegweit Passage would be next to impossible since the tidal cycles {{on each side of}} a causeway would be placed at opposites to each other. It is estimated by tidal experts at the Canadian <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service,</b> that tidal currents through a gap in such a causeway would be in excess of , powerful enough to counter most commercial ships and to sweep away boulders the size of houses.|$|E
25|$|The Australian <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service</b> is {{an element}} of the RAN, and serves both {{military}} and civilian functions. The headquarters of the agency is at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales. Hydrographic services provided by the AHS include the mapping and surveying of undersea terrain and irregularities on and under the water's surface (known collectively as hydrography), the provision of nautical charts and other publications, such as tide tables and Notices to Mariners. Over 400 paper charts are produced by the AHS, with conversion of these to electronic navigational chart format due to be completed in 2011.|$|E
500|$|After {{reviewing}} {{testimony that}} Fitzgerald had passed near shoals north of Caribou Island, the USCG Marine Board examined the relevant navigational charts. They {{found that the}} Canadian 1973navigational chart for the Six Fathom Shoal area was based on Canadian surveys from 1916 and 1919 and that the 1973U.S. Lake Survey Chart No.9 included the notation, [...] "Canadian Areas. For data concerning Canadian areas, Canadian authorities have been consulted." [...] Thereafter, {{at the request of}} the Marine Board and the Commander of the USCG Ninth District, the Canadian <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service</b> conducted a survey of the area surrounding Michipicoten Island and Caribou Island in 1976. The survey revealed that the shoal ran about [...] further east than shown on Canadian charts. The NTSB investigation concluded that, at the time of the Fitzgerald foundering, Lake Survey Chart No.9 was not detailed enough to indicate Six Fathom Shoal as a hazard to navigation.|$|E

While most of the mountain lies within the City and Borough of Yakutat, the summit is also in Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, British Columbia (Canada), making it the highest point in that province. It is also designated as Boundary Peak 164 or as US/Canada Boundary Point #164. The mountain was named on May 3, 1778 by Captain James Cook, [...] apparently for the unusually good weather encountered at the time. The name has been variously translated. It was called [...] "Mt.

2500|$|In 1946, the Australian Cabinet {{decided that}} the RAN would remain in control of all hydrographic {{operations}} in both Australian waters and areas of Australian interest. RAN warships were used to survey waters around Australia {{as part of a}} national hydrographic survey. In 1947, the Antarctic exploration ship [...] was commissioned, but only one voyage was completed, and RAN hydrographic operations in the Antarctic were stopped in 1948. In 1963, a resource and export boom required the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service</b> to change its focus from a comprehensive national survey to the charting of new ports and shipping routes suitable for deep-draught merchant ships. A purpose-built survey ship, [...] entered service in 1964. Survey of ports and shipping routes was completed by 1974. From 1979 onwards, the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service</b> began to provide hydrographic assistance and training to Pacific island nations. During 1989 and 1990, four Paluma class survey ships entered service with the RAN, followed by two larger Leeuwin class ships in 1999. In 1993, the RAN began to use Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS) technology to asistin surveying: this was first fitted to a Fokker F27 aircraft, then in 2010 was installed in a De Havilland Dash 8, operated by the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight.|$|E

2500|$|Surveying {{operations}} did not resume in {{the region}} until World War II, when it became evident that Age of Sail-era charts of the South West Pacific desperately needed updating. Requesitioned auxiliary ships, later supplemented by several Bathurst class corvettes modified into survey vessels, were used to chart the waters around the East Indies and New Guinea, with the RAN designated as the charting authority responsible for supporting Allied operations in the South West Pacific Area. As well as updating navigational charts, RAN survey ships were also used to inspect and clear sites for amphibious landings. By {{the end of the}} war, sixteen vessels were attached to the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Service,</b> including the frigate [...] and five Bathurst class corvettes.|$|E

The flood discharges for ungauged catchments were estimated by the Top-kriging approach with manual adjustment to the local flood characteristics. The adopted combination approach proved to be very efficient both in terms of the project time required {{and in terms of the}} accuracy and acceptability of the estimated flood discharges of given return periods...|$|R
