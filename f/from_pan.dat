The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made <b>from</b> <b>PAN</b> have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Roddenberry began flying for Pan American World Airways, {{including}} routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time. Listed as {{a resident}} of River Edge, New Jersey, he experienced his third crash while on the Clipper Eclipse on June 18, 1947. The plane landed in the Syrian desert, and Roddenberry dragged injured passengers out of the burning plane and led the group to get help. Fourteen {{people died in the}} crash; 11 passengers needed hospital treatment, and eight were unharmed. He resigned <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> Am on May 15, 1948, and decided to pursue his dream of writing, particularly for the new medium of television.|$|E
5|$|The Avianca Flight 52 {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK-2016). The {{aircraft was}} manufactured in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> Am in 1977. By {{the time of the}} crash, the aircraft was 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours. The 707 was equipped with four JT3D-3B engines modified with a hush kit to reduce noise pollution. Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a five-percent fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the hush kit along with an additional five-percent overburn due to the age of the aircraft. Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft's autopilot, including the altitude hold function.|$|E

25|$|The {{appointment}} of Air Marshal Nur Khan as the Managing Director of PIA in 1959 heralded {{an era of}} success for PIA. In March 1960, PIA wet-leased a Boeing 707 <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> American airlines, thereby becoming the first Asian airline followed by Air India to induct a jet aircraft in its fleet. With the newly acquired aircraft, the airline introduced its first trans-Atlantic route Karachi-New York via London in 1961. In 1962, it expanded its fleet by placing orders for Boeing 720s, Fokker F27 Friendships, and Sikorsky helicopters. On 2 January 1962, a PIA Boeing 720B flown by Captain Abdullah Baig from London to Karachi established a world record for speed over a commercial airline route for powered landplanes of 938.78km/h (582.98mph), a record which still holds to this day.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of the Second World War, in July 1941, a Portuguese mission under the command of {{engineer}} Colonel Hermínio José de Sousa Serrano, and which included Colonel Frederico Lopes da Silva and Major Fernando Tártaro, visited Santa Maria to study a possible location for an airfield, opting for the plateau known as Pico de Maria Dias. Three years later, technicians <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> American World Airways arrived on the island, arriving on board the NT Lima in December 1943, and confirmed that the location was optimal for establishing a military airfield to complement the field at Lajes. The airfield would, therefore, assist in the protection of the maritime convoys that crossed the Atlantic to support the port of Murmansk in the Soviet Union, which were being sunk by German U-boats.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II in 1945, the City of Miami {{established}} a Port Authority and raised bond revenue to purchase Pan American Field, {{which had been}} since renamed 36th Street Airport, <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> Am. It merged with the former Miami Army Airfield, which was purchased from the United States Army Air Force south of the railroad in 1949 and expanded further in 1951 when the railroad line itself was moved south to make more room. The old terminal on 36th Street was closed in 1959 when the center modern passenger terminal (since greatly expanded) opened. United States Air Force Reserve troop carrier and rescue squadrons also operated from the airport from 1949 through 1959, when the last unit relocated to nearby Homestead Air Force Base, (now Homestead Air Reserve Base).|$|E
25|$|The only lack of {{permission}} {{was from}} the Scandinavian authorities, from which the delegation had not had time to receive permission before it left. However, on 5 March, Aerotransport, DDL and DNL made an agreement with Pan Am to operate a route using a Boeing 314 Clipper flying boat from New York via Botwood and Reykjavík to Bergen. It was the American authorities who wanted a landing in Iceland, and Bergen was chosen instead of Stavanger because the latter lay within the area defined by American authorities {{as part of the}} war zone. The route would commence during the summer and operate eight times, with twelve services the following year. The aircraft was chartered <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> Am for USD15,000 per trip. All formalities with external parties were completed on 12 March, and the operations approved by the board of the three Scandinavian airlines on 6 April. Representatives from the Scandinavian delegation visited Douglas, Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney, and planned to use Douglas DC-4 land planes from 1942, with up to two weekly round trips.|$|E

25|$|In 1967 {{the airline}} ordered two Sud Aviation Caravelles for {{delivery}} in October 1967 {{and the summer}} of 1968, and on 12 May 1967 a BAC One Eleven, on a one-year lease from Laker Airways entered service on the airlines' routes. The airline operated a service from Kinshasa to Brussels in a pool arrangement with Sabena until June 1967. On 25 November 1967 a Douglas DC-8 joined the airlines' fleet, and it flew on routes from Lubumbashi-Kinshasa-Brussels-Paris or Rome, with the last sector being flown on alternate weeks. The Caravelles were introduced on regional flights from Kinshasa-Lagos and Kinshasa-Bangui-Fort-Lamy. The airline also operated twice weekly flights on the route Kinshasa-Entebbe-Nairobi-Dar es Salaam-Lubumbashi-Lusaka-Lubumbashi-Kinshasa. The DC-6s operated on regional routes linking Kinshasa-Goma-Bujumbura-Entebbe-Nairobi. The airline operated the DC-3s, DC-4s and DC-6s to 26 domestic destinations, and the smaller Beech aircraft were operated to 27 other domestic destinations. At the end of 1967, an agreement was signed with Fokker {{for the purchase of}} ten Fokker F 27-600s. A Douglas DC-3 operated by the airline crashed on 15 February 1970, under unknown circumstances. In October, Pan American World Airways began managing the airline, under a three-year management contract. The American airline provided 14 specialists to the airline in order to assist with technical and operational issues. There was special emphasis placed on the training of Congolese nationals to run the airline, and in 1970 two Douglas DC-8s were bought <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> Am.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{is taken}} by Greg and Tamara through the jungle. Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the walkie-talkie they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie dust <b>from</b> <b>Pan,</b> hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg had no idea that they were working for Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet in a clearing, with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that nothing has changed, and scoffs at the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series which were developed by Japanese companies, Digimon Racings development was handled by the Kirkland, Washington, United States-based Griptonite Games. However, Digimon series veteran Bandai (now Namco Bandai Games) returned to publish the game. It was the first original Digimon game for the Game Boy Advance, since Digimon Battle Spirit and Digimon Battle Spirit 2 were ports of WonderSwan Color games. The game uses the Mode 7 engine to create three-dimensional gameplay on the handheld console otherwise incapable of such a feat. It occasionally uses voice acting during races, uncommon in Game Boy Advance games. The game was initially announced at E3 2003. It was later exhibited at E3 2004, with the North American release announced for August 2004.
