To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the <b>front</b> <b>diving</b> planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.

They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke.

50|$|The rear {{suspension}} {{was linked to}} {{the lower end of the}} tubular frame and featured flexible rubber and metal elements that did not require servicing.

50|$|Opening {{the event}} was the Last Chance Four Way match between Mason Andrews, Rubix, Dakota Darsow and Lars Only {{to qualify for the}} Ultimate X match contesting the TNA X Division Championship later in the night. Plenty of face pace, back-and-forth high impact {{offensive}} maneuvers were seen between all four participants. During one point, Rubix and Only fought alone in the ring until Only finished with Rubix and went at it was Darsow. Further on, Rubix cleared the ring and executed a leaping <b>front</b> flip <b>dive</b> to take out his competitors on the outside. Later, the match produced two big points where there was a three-way Tower of Doom out of the ring corner and a corner-to-corner missile dropkick by Rubix {{from one side of the}} ring to the next. After multiple moves that allowed all involved to showcase themselves, Andrews went on to hit his fireman's carry into a cutter finisher on Only to win the match by pinfall.|$|R

50|$|Lowell {{advanced}} {{a runner}} to third {{base in the}} bottom of the 11th, but a diving play by Scelfo in center field ended the inning. In the bottom of the 12th, the Spinners loaded the bases with one out thanks to a single and two walks. Scelfo made another diving catch for the second out, but he could not come up with a third sensational grab to keep the game alive.

50|$|At 25:20, Zaripov {{was given}} a 2-minute {{interference}} penalty, and at 26:51, Olli Palola scored on a rebound in the slot to put the Finns up 2-1. The Russians answered back just 43 seconds later with Vadim Shipachyov setting up Alexander Ovechkin for an easy backhander in <b>front</b> of a <b>diving</b> Pekka Rinne. That goal seemed to unleash the Russians' momentum with Finland picking up two consecutive 2-minute penalties, giving the Russian team a two-man advantage for over a minute. That time was enough for Evgeni Malkin to find {{the back of the}} net at the 35:36 mark and retake the lead for Russia with a hard slapshot.

50|$|BMW {{did things}} {{differently}} from other manufacturers. This {{is evident in}} the R27. Its enclosed shaft final drive is rare for a single cylinder motorcycle. But it also had a triangulated Earles front fork (named after English designer Ernest Earles); so the motorcycle had a front swingarm as well as a rear swingarm. When you squeezed the front brake lever hard not only did the <b>front</b> end not <b>dive,</b> it actually rose slightly. Thus, braking was a very steady activity, though the brakes were weak by today's standards. The engine's crankshaft was laid out fore-and-aft rather than side-to-side; also a rare feature. This way, the crank and the final shaft were in line, and drive forces {{did not have to be}} run through a set of 90-degree gears. Also, the kick starter swung out sideways instead of parallel to the frame.|$|R
50|$|The Haters faced Mad Man Pondo and Necro Butcher in {{the next}} match. Utilizing a steel chair, The Haters suplexed Pondo then drove his face into the it.

After he kicked out, Vito lifted Pondo onto his shoulders and slammed him onto the mat before Pauly performed a <b>diving</b> <b>front</b> flip splash for another two count. As Pauly climbed to the ropes again, Necro Butcher hit him with a chair then wrapped his legs around Pauly’s head before flipping him to the mat back first. Pondo hit Pauly {{in the head with}} a stop sign while Necro climbed to the top rope, lifted Vito up over his shoulder and fell forward, slamming him back first through a table for the victory.|$|R

50|$|With Hershiser rolling, it {{appeared}} the Dodgers would knock off the Mets {{and take the}} lead in the series. But in the ninth, Mets rookie Gregg Jefferies led off with a single. He advanced to second on a ground out, and the Mets broke through against Hershiser when Darryl Strawberry lined a double into the gap in right-center field to score Jefferies. Hershiser was then lifted in favor of ace closer Jay Howell. Kevin McReynolds drew a walk, and following a Howard Johnson strikeout, Gary Carter hit a two-strike pitch in <b>front</b> of a <b>diving</b> John Shelby. Strawberry scored as the ball bounced in front of Shelby, and McReynolds followed close behind. Shelby's throw to the plate was a little off target, and McReynolds scored the winning run by bowling over catcher Mike Scioscia as the ball sailed past him.|$|R
50|$|The Swimming Stadium is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} venue for citizens. It is open {{from the beginning of}} May to the end of September. It {{is a popular}} place and in summertime it is visited by about 5000 swimmers every day - 290,000 altogether in the summer 2013. The stadium has three pools: a 50 metre exercise swimming pool, a diving pool and a children's pool, and a small, shallow, round wading pool for small children a little further away. The diving pool has two 1 metre and two 3 metre high springboards, and a 1 metre plateau in <b>front</b> of the <b>diving</b> tower.

However, for example when swimming teams or clubs come to practice at the Stadium, the 3 metre springboard may be reserved for their use.|$|R
50|$|The natural design {{progression}} from the Lotec was the Pullman combination motorcycle. The heavy but economic Mini engine lent itself {{to having a}} sidecar attached for long distance touring. The first Austel Pullman prototype appeared in 1987 with a Mini 850cc engine, shaft drive, solenoid operated handlebar mounted gear change, drum brakes, Austel 8 spoke steel wheels and leading link anti <b>dive</b> <b>front</b> forks. The production models were revised to have 1300cc engines, full duplex frame with box section swing arm, twin front disc brakes with single rear disc and a front-mounted radiator. With the sidecar attached it was then {{possible to have a}} manual gearbox with hand gear stick although this meant the gear selection was rotated 90 degrees due the engine being positioned longitudinally in the frame. The sidecar choice was down to the customer and could be fitted with a fuel tank in the boot for greater capacity and a dummy tank on the bike that could be removed easily for engine maintenance. No two Austel motorcycles were ever the same due to design developments and customer requirements.|$|R
