A bacteria {{would be considered}} as probiotic if it possess several characteristics as {{generally regarded as safe}} (GRAS) proposed by USFDA Regulations. Similar terms like Prebiotics and Synbiotics are often used in association with probiotics but they are often different. Several species of bacteria like lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, streptococcus, enterococcus etc are widely used as probiotics for human and animal applications. Each Probiotic strain is unique in its origin and mechanism of action, hence only a few probiotics which has good market potential are manufactured commercially. Depending upon the strain selected for manufacturing, a unique media, a separate process for fermentation and downstream would be applied to ensure the cell viability, stability and potency for a longer duration.
