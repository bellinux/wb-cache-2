40|$|The aims of this {{research}} are to know: (1) Which one more effective, learning using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> realistic mathematics approach, Quantum Learning (QL) or a conventional learning. (2) Which one gives better mathematics learning achievement, student with personality types Sanguine, Melancholy, Choleric or Phlegmatis. (3) Which one more effective for each personality type of students, learning using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> PMR, QL or a conventional learning. This research used quasi experimental method with its population included all of students of state junior high school in East Lampung Regency. Sampling was done by stratified cluster random sampling. The size of the samples was 303 students. The data collection technique were the document {{that was the last}} of examination the seven grade for initial capability data before the experiment, achievement tests for mathematics student achievement data, and questioner of personality types. The data was analyzed using analysis of variance. The conclusions of the research were as follows: (1) learning mathematics using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> PMR is as effective as learning mathematics using the method of <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> QL. However, learning of mathematics using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> PMR approach is more effective than learning mathematics using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> conventional approach. Likewise, learning mathematics using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> QL approach is more effective than learning mathematics using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> conventional approach. (2) Students with personality types of Sanguine, Melancholy, Choleric, nor Phlegmatis have the same mathematics achievement. (3) For each personality type of students, learning using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> PMR approach is as effective as using <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> QL.
