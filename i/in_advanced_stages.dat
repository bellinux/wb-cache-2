40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} trends in survival and therapy <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in the Netherlands and to determine if changes in therapy affected survival. METHODS: All EOC patients diagnosed in the Netherlands during 1989 - 2009 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Differences in treatment over time were tested by the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Multivariable relative survival analyses were performed to test whether changes in treatment are associated with survival. RESULTS: 23, 399 EOC patients were diagnosed, of whom 15, 892 (67. 9 %) <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> (stage >/= 2 b). <b>In</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> patients, the proportion receiving (neo-) adjuvant chemotherapy and optimal debulking (residuals /= 75 years) a stable proportion (approximately 28 %) did not receive any treatment. Five-year relative survival <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> patients increased from 18 % in 1989 - 1993 to 28 % in 2004 - 2009. In the multivariable model survival improved over time (relative excess risk (RER) of 2004 - 2009 was 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 67 - 0. 75 compared to 1989 - 1993). This RER attenuated to 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 80 - 0. 90) and 0. 91 (95 % CI 0. 83 - 0. 99) with inclusion of treatment variables in the model (surgery with chemotherapy or optimal surgery with chemotherapy, respectively). This suggests that the improvement was mainly, although not entirely, caused by changes in treatment. CONCLUSION: Treatment <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> EOC patients <b>in</b> the Netherlands improved over the last two decades; more patients received (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and underwent optimal debulking surgery. Changes in treatment led to partial improvement of survival in EOC patients...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the mean sojourn time (MST) of {{prostate}} cancer, to estimate the probability of overdiagnosis, and to predict the potential reduction <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> disease due to screening with PSA. The MST of prostate cancer was derived from detection rates at PSA prevalence testing in 43 [*] 842 men, aged 50 – 69 years, {{as part of the}} ProtecT study, from the incidence of non-screen-detected cases obtained from the English population-based cancer registry database, and from PSA sensitivity obtained from the medical literature. The relative reduction <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> disease was derived from the expected and observed incidences of <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> prostate cancer. The age-specific MST for men aged 50 – 59 and 60 – 69 years were 11. 3 and 12. 6 years, respectively. Overdiagnosis estimates increased with age; 10 – 31 % of the PSA-detected cases were estimated to be overdiagnosed. An interscreening interval of 2 years was predicted to result in 37 and 63 % reduction <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> disease <b>in</b> men 65 – 69 and 50 – 54 years, respectively. If the overdiagnosed cases were excluded, the estimated reductions were 9 and 54 %, respectively.

For instance, if a knife cuts into an infected tuber, the next 20 tubers that the knife cuts {{have a high}} risk of becoming infected. The bacteria enters the host through wounds and invades the xylem where it multiplies via binary fission. If colonization is successful, the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels. <b>In</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stages</b> of infection, the bacteria will move out of the vessels and break down the surrounding parenchyma tissue before moving into new vessels.

A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-fiber foods and plenty of water. Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, competing between them for access. When taken together, the consequences of such competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive proteins are discouraged, while <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stages,</b> additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa is recommended to be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch and are usually taken at dinner. As the disease advances, dysphagia may appear. In such cases, specific measures include the use of thickening agents for liquid intake, special postures when eating, and gastrostomy in the worst cases.|$|E

500|$|Cochrane goes on, {{in chapter}} six, to {{consider}} Marxism. Unlike the other political theories explored in An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, Marxism is purportedly not a normative account but a scientific theory which predicts and explains {{the end of}} the state and the beginning of communism. This is understood as the inevitable conclusion of the history of the changing forms of economic relationships. Cochrane outlines the discontinuities between humans and animals that exist for Karl Marx and considers the extent to which animal-rights thinking is an example of bourgeois morality. These analyses serve to illustrate how Marxist thinking can be used to exclude animals, but counterarguments are offered. Cochrane then draws upon the work of Catherine Perlow and Barbara Noske, who have argued that animals may represent an exploited group in a Marxist sense, but he is critical of the argument that this exploitation is caused by capitalism and that overthrowing capitalism would be a necessary step for achieving justice. He next considers the work of David Sztybel and Ted Benton, who have drawn upon the adage of [...] "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need" [...] in relation to animals; Cochrane is wary about the use of the phrase for three reasons. First, it is unclear how central the idea is to Marxist thought; second, it is a principle only for societies <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stages</b> of communism; and third, even if we assume we can know the needs of animals, the principle would entail the extension of justice beyond sentient animals, which is an idea that Cochrane rejects. Finally, Cochrane considers Benton's proposal that liberal rights-based approaches to animal justice cannot achieve their goal, and that Marxism can be used as a resource for political achievement. This is, for Cochrane, Marxism's most important contribution in the area.|$|E

40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} the clinical predictors and prognosis {{of the patients}} with <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC) after hepatectomy. Methods 　A total of 110 patients with SHCC admitted to the General Hospital of PLA and undergone hepatectomy from Jan. 1995 to Dec. 2009 were included in present retrospective study. Survival analysis was performed by Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier. The association of SHCC and nine routine clinical parameters was analyzed by the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results 　Of the 110 patients with SHCC, 31 (28. 2 %) were SHCC <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage,</b> and the 1, 3, 5 year survival rates were 78. 6 %, 61. 6 % and 38. 5 %, respectively, with a median survival time of 48. 8 months (95 % CI 29. 2 - 68. 4 months). Seventy-nine of the 110 patients (71. 8 %) were suffering form early stage SHCC, and the 1, 3, 5 year survival rates were 98. 7 %, 83. 8 % and 74. 8 %, respectively, with a median survival time of 98. 0 months (95 %CI 73. 8 - 122. 2 months). The survival rate was obviously higher in the patients with early stage SHCC than <b>in</b> those with <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> SHCC (χ 2 = 13. 29, P= 0. 0003).
