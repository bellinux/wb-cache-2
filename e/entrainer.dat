25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{separation}} involve introducing an additional agent, called an <b>entrainer,</b> {{that will affect}} the volatility {{of one of the}} azeotrope constituents more than another. When an <b>entrainer</b> is added to a binary azeotrope to form a ternary azeotrope, and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called azeotropic distillation. The best known example is adding benzene or cyclohexane to the water/ethanol azeotrope. With cyclohexane as the <b>entrainer,</b> the ternary azeotrope is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% cyclohexane, and boils at 62.1°C. Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water/ethanol azeotrope to engage all of the water into the ternary azeotrope. When the mixture is then boiled, the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.|$|E
25|$|When condensed, {{this becomes}} a {{two-phase}} liquid mixture. The heavier phase, {{poor in the}} <b>entrainer</b> (benzene or cyclohexane), is stripped of the <b>entrainer</b> and recycled to the feed—while the lighter phase, with condensate from the stripping, is recycled to the second column. Another early method, called extractive distillation, consists of adding a ternary component that increases ethanol's relative volatility. When the ternary mixture is distilled, it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>entrainer</b> is {{one that}} has a strong {{chemical}} affinity for one of the constituents. Using again the example of the water/ethanol azeotrope, the liquid can be shaken with calcium oxide, which reacts strongly with water to form the nonvolatile compound, calcium hydroxide. Nearly all of the calcium hydroxide can be separated by filtration and the filtrate redistilled to obtain 100% pure ethanol.|$|E

40|$|A summary {{about our}} {{experiences}} in the introduction of heterogeneous <b>entrainers</b> in azeotropic and extractive batch distillation is presented in this work. Essential advantages of the application of heterogeneous <b>entrainers</b> are showed by rigorous simulation and experimental verification in a bench batch distillation column for separating several azeotropic mixtures such as acetonitrile – water, n hexane – ethyl acetate and chloroform – methanol, commonly found in pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
25|$|Extractive {{distillation}} {{is similar}} to azeotropic distillation, except {{in this case the}} <b>entrainer</b> is less volatile than any of the azeotrope's constituents. For example, the azeotrope of 20% acetone with 80% chloroform can be broken by adding water and distilling the result. The water forms a separate layer in which the acetone preferentially dissolves. The result is that the distillate is richer in chloroform than the original azeotrope.|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} 5% water with 95% {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{is an example}} of an azeotrope that can be economically separated using a pressure swing – a swing in this case between 1 atm and 8 atm. By contrast the composition of the water to ethanol azeotrope discussed earlier is not affected enough by pressure to be easily separated using pressure swings and instead, an <b>entrainer</b> may be added that either modifies the azeotropic composition and exhibits immiscibility with one of the components, or extractive distillation may be used.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes azeotropes {{are useful}} in {{separating}} zeotropic mixtures. An example is acetic acid and water, which do not form an azeotrope. Despite this {{it is very difficult}} to separate pure acetic acid (boiling point: 118.1°C) from a solution of acetic acid and water by distillation alone. As progressive distillations produce solutions with less and less water, each further distillation becomes less effective at removing the remaining water. Distilling the solution to dry acetic acid is therefore economically impractical. But ethyl acetate forms an azeotrope with water that boils at 70.4°C. By adding ethyl acetate as an <b>entrainer,</b> it is possible to distill away the azeotrope and leave nearly pure acetic acid as the residue.|$|E

There are various techniques exist to separate azeotropic compositions. In this work we studied the basic features of azeotropic distillation using Aspen plus simulation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{separation}} of the nonaqueous azeotropic systems methyl acetate−methanol and ethyl acetate−ethanol was investigated with 13 cations and 27 anions as <b>entrainers</b> to identify suitable ionic liquids using the COSMO-RS model. It is observed that the cations best suited are imidazolium> pyridinium> methyl pyrrolidinium> octyl quinolinium. The lengthening of the alkyl chain of cations was also studied as well as whether the shorter the alkyl chain, the better is the separation. It was also noticed that {{the efficacy of the}} anions is in the order [OAc]> [Cl]> [DHP]. It was seen that the influence of anions is more significant on the behavior of ionic liquid solvation in alcohols. The effects of polarity, excess free energy, and excess enthalpy are addressed on nonaqueous systems containing ionic liquids. It is suggested that [EMIM][OAc], [EMIM][Cl], and [EMIM][DHP] can be used as promising <b>entrainers</b> for practical applications of ester−alcohol separation. 1...|$|R

50|$|In chemistry, {{azeotropic}} distillation is {{any of a}} range of techniques used to break an azeotrope in distillation. In chemical engineering, {{azeotropic distillation}} usually refers to the specific technique of adding another component to generate a new, lower-boiling azeotrope that is heterogeneous (e.g. producing two, immiscible liquid phases), such as the example below with the addition of benzene to water and ethanol. This practice of adding an <b>entrainer</b> which forms a separate phase is a specific sub-set of (industrial) azeotropic distillation methods, or combination thereof. In some senses, adding an <b>entrainer</b> is similar to extractive distillation.|$|E
50|$|A common {{historical}} {{example of}} azeotropic distillation is {{its use in}} dehydrating ethanol and water mixtures. For this, a near azeotropic mixture {{is sent to the}} final column where azeotropic distillation takes place. Several <b>entrainers</b> can be used for this specific process: benzene, pentane, cyclohexane, hexane, heptane, isooctane, acetone, and diethyl ether are all options as the mixture. Of these benzene and cyclohexane have been used the most extensively. However, because benzene has been discovered to be a carcinogenic compound, its use has declined. While this method was the standard for dehydrating ethanol in the past, it has lost favor due to the high capital and energy costs associated with it.Another favorable method and less toxic than using benzene to break the azeotrope of the ethanol-water system is to use toluene instead.|$|R

50|$|The {{addition}} of a Material Separation Agent, such as benzene to an ethanol/water mixture, changes the molecular interactions and eliminates the azeotrope. Added in the liquid phase, the new component can alter the activity coefficient of various compounds in different ways thus altering a mixture's relative volatility. Greater deviations from Raoult's law {{make it easier to}} achieve significant changes in relative volatility with the {{addition of}} another component. In azeotropic distillation the volatility of the added component {{is the same as the}} mixture, and a new azeotrope is formed with one or more of the components based on differences in polarity. If the material separation agent is selected to form azeotropes with more than one component in the feed then it is referred to as an <b>entrainer.</b> The added <b>entrainer</b> should be recovered by distillation, decantation, or another separation method and returned near the top of the original column.|$|E
