Chronic EBV-associated hepatitis is suspected in immunocompetent adults with compatible serology, suggestive histology and detection of the viral genome in the liver and/or increase of specific circulating cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. EBV is the main cause of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders which occur in up to 30 % of cases.

It {{replicates}} in hepatocytes but is non-cytopathic; liver damage {{is thought to}} be immune mediated. Here, we investigated the role of innate immune responses in mediating liver damage in patients with chronic HBV infection. Longitudinal analysis revealed a temporal correlation between flares of liver inflammation and fluctuations in interleukin (IL) - 8, interferon (IFN) -alpha, and natural killer (NK) cell expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) directly ex vivo. A cross-sectional study confirmed these findings in patients with HBV-related liver inflammation compared with healthy carriers. Activated, TRAIL-expressing NK cells were further enriched in the liver of patients with chronic HBV infection, while their hepatocytes expressed increased levels of a TRAIL death-inducing receptor. IFN-alpha concentrations found in patients were capable of activating NK cells to induce TRAIL-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro. The pathogenic potential of this pathway could be further enhanced by the ability of the IFN-alpha/IL- 8 combination to dysregulate the balance of death-inducing and regulatory TRAIL receptors expressed on hepatocytes. We conclude that NK cells may contribute to liver inflammation by TRAIL-mediated death of hepatocytes and demonstrate that this non-antigen-specific mechanism can be switched on by cytokines produced during active HBV infection...|$|E

Sequence analysis of the viral capsid protein genes revealed the presence of seven missense mutations, three of which were also present in a second PVpi, suggesting {{that they could be}} important determinants of the persistent phenotype. When the three mutations were introduced into the lytic Leon strain separately, in pairs or all together, {{all but one of the}} viruses was capable of establishing a persistent infection.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes an asymp-tomatic latent <b>infection</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 90 % of the human population, but it has also been linked to lymphomagenesis. A coop-erative relationship of EBV and the germi-nal center reaction during the establish-ment of viral persistence has been postulated, but the contribution of EBV latent genes to the respective genetic events remains to be investigated in de-tail. In the present study, we show that activation of the EBV growth program has a clear inhibitory effect on AID expres-sion, due to a negative effect of the mas-ter transcription factor of this program, EBNA 2. This mechanism may counterbal-ance AID induction by the LMP 1 protein, in order to prevent deleterious genetic changes during EBV-induced B-cell growth. EBNA 2 -mediated AID inhibition also provides a molecular explanation for the previously observed differences in somatic hypermutation activity in EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases, thus pointing to a crucial mechanism of EBV-mediated regulation of genomic in-tegrity.

This high frequency of persistent infection indicates that HCV has evolved efficient strategies to interfere with the adaptive and innate immune response and to occupy and use host cell infrastructure. The present study provides evidence that c-Src, a member of the Src family kinases that participates in many signal transduction pathways, represents an essential host factor exploited for viral replication. c-Src directly interacts with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS 5 B) via its SH 3 domain and with the nonstructural phosphoprotein NS 5 A via its SH 2 domain. Both interactions are required to maintain the protein-protein interaction of NS 5 A and NS 5 B, which has been previously demonstrated to be essential for viral replication. Accordingly, HCV genome replication and production of the viral proteins was strongly reduced upon small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of c-Src or {{in the presence of the}} tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A.

Clinical, biological, imagery features and outcomes were characterized. Results: Twenty-five (3. 45 %) patients were identified as having PML. The mean time between HIV and PML diagnosis was 20. 4 months. PML was the presentation of HIV infection in 40 % of the patients, and 92 % had CD 4 T cell count lower than 200 /mm 3. Paresis {{was the most common}} clinical presentation. No specific characteristics were found in cerebrospinal fluid and JCV DNA was positive in 3 of 7 patients. MRI revealed characteristic findings. Combined antiretroviral therapy was started or changed in 96 % of the patients. Neurological condition got worse in 12 patients. From the 14 deaths, 5 were directly attributed to PML progression. Follow-up was lost in 8 patients. Conclusions: PML was the presentation of HIV <b>infection</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1 / 3 of patients, frequently associated with advanced immunocompromise. MRI sensitivity to PML is high, and JCV DNA determination in CSF was not revealed to be sensible. PML diagnosis should be taken into account in HIV patients presenting any neurological symptoms, and HIV infection should be suspected when radiological findings suggest PML lesions even in previously healthy individuals.

40|$|Abstract Background Living with {{a chronic}} disease, such as primary {{antibody}} deficiency, will often have consequences for quality of life. Previous quality-of-life studies in primary antibody deficiency patients {{have been limited}} to different treatment methods. We wanted to study how adults with primary antibody deficiencies manage their conditions and to identify factors that are conducive to coping, good {{quality of life and}} hope. Methods Questionnaires were sent to all patients ≥ 20 years of age with primary antibody deficiencies who were served by Rikshospitalet University Hospital. The questionnaires consisted of several standardized scales: Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index (QLI), Short Form- 36 (SF- 36), Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS), Nowotny Hope Scale (NHS), and one scale we devised with questions about resources and pressures in the past. Of a total of 91, 55 patients (aged 23 – 76 years) answered the questionnaires. The questionnaire study were supplemented with selected interviews of ten extreme cases, five with low and five with high quality of life scores. Results Among the 55 patients, low quality of life scores were related to unemployment, <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> four organs, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two additional diseases, or <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two specific occurrences of stress in the last 2 – 3 months. Persons with selective IgA deficiency had significantly higher QLI scores than those with other antibody deficiencies. An optimistic coping style was most frequent used, and hope values were moderately high. Based on the interviews, the patients could be divided into three groups: 1) low QLI scores, low hope values, and reduced coping, 2) low QLI scores, moderate hope values, and good coping, and 3) high QLI scores, moderate to strong hope values, and good coping. Coping was related to the patients' sense of closeness and competence. Conclusion Low quality of life scores in adults with primary antibody deficiencies were linked to unemployment and disease-related strains. Closeness and competence were preconditions for coping, quality of life and hope. The results are valuable in planning care for this patient group. </p...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{the burden}} of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) disease is needed to inform policy decisions on primary and secondary prevention. Specimen based laboratory data (1989 – 2004) were converted to person-based data and combined with notification data (2004 – 2009) to describe {{the burden of}} HCV <b>infection</b> <b>in</b> Ireland. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> 10 000 people were confirmed as HCV infected in 1989 – 2004, with the numbers peaking in 2000. The predominant genotypes were 1 (55 %) and 3 (39 %). Drug use was the most likely risk factor in 80 %, with receipt of blood or blood products in 16 %. It is estimated that 20 000 50 000 people in Ireland are chronically infected with HCV, a population prevalence of 0. 5 – 1. 2 %, {{which is similar to}} other countries in Northern Europe. This is the first published estimate of the number of chronic HCV <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> Ireland. These data will be of value in health service planning and will contribute to the understanding of HCV <b>infection</b> <b>in</b> Europe...|$|R
40|$|Electrophoretic {{karyotype}} and {{restriction endonuclease}} analysis of genomic DNA {{were used for}} the typing of nine isolates of Candida albicans from the oral cavities of two patients with AIDS-a husband and wife-whose infections became resistant to treatment with fluconazole (400 mg/d). The in vitro susceptibilities of sequential isolates to fluconazole and two other triazoles, itraconazole and the investigational drug D 0870, were also evaluated. DNA analysis showed that the isolates responsible for fluconazole-resistant episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis in the two patients were genetically related. In vitro susceptibility to fluconazole correlated well with clinical outcome. Al-though the minimal inhibitory concentrations of itraconazole and D 0870 for fluconazole-resistant isolates were higher than those for fluconazole-susceptible isolates, both of the former triazoles exhibited good in vitro activity against the isolates tested. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is the most common my-cosis associated with HIV <b>infection,</b> occurring <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 80 % of cases [1, 2]. Recurrences of OPC caused by isolates of Candida albicans that have become progressively less sus-ceptible to fluconazole in vitro as well as in vivo have recentl...|$|R
