The objective of this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to investigate whether ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist could attenuate rotavirus- and norovirus-induced vomiting and diarrhoea, which would facilitate oral rehydration and possibly accelerate recovery and reduce need for hospitalization. Children with acute gastroenteritis, aged 6 months to 16 years where enrolled (n = 104) and randomized to one single oral dose (0. 15 mg/kg) of ondansetron (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52). The number of diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following treatment was reported as well as the number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in faeces were diagnosed by real-time PCR. Outcome parameters were analyzed for rotavirus- and norovirus-positive children. One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus clinical symptoms (p = 0. 014), with a median of two days. Furthermore, ondansetron reduced diarrhea episodes, most pronounced in children that had been sick for more than 3 days before treatment (p = 0. 028). Ondansetron may be a beneficial treatment for children with rotavirus gastroenteritis. <b>European</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>Trial</b> <b>Database</b> EudraCT 2011 - 005700 - 15...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To provide {{pharmacodynamic}} data of crushed and chewed ticagrelor tablets, {{in comparison with}} standard integral tablets. METHODS: Ninety nine patients with stable angina were randomly assigned, in a 3 : 1 : 1 fashion, {{to one of the}} following 180 mg ticagrelor loading dose (LD) formulations: A) Integral B) Crushed or C) Chewed tablets. Platelet reactivity (PR) was assessed with VerifyNow before, 20 and 60 min after LD. High residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) was defined as > 208 P 2 Y 12 reaction units (PRU). RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference in}} PRU values at baseline. PRU 20 min after LD were 237 (182 - 295), 112 (53 - 238) and 84 (29 - 129) and 60 min after LD, 56 (15 - 150), 51 (18 - 85) and 9 (7 - 34) in integral, crushed and chewed ticagrelor LD, respectively (p< 0. 01 for both). Chewed ticagrelor tablets resulted in significantly lower PRU values compared to crushed or integral tablets at 20 and 60 min. Crushed ticagrelor LD resulted in significantly lower PRU values compared to integral tablets at 20 min whereas no difference was observed at 60 min. At 20 min, no patients had HRPR with chewed ticagrelor compared to 68 % with integral and 30 % with crushed ticagrelor LD (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: With crushed or chewed ticagrelor tablets a more rapid platelet inhibition may be achieved, compared to standard integral tablets. We also show that administration of chewed tablets is feasible and provides faster inhibition than either crushed or integral tablets. <b>CLINICAL</b> <b>TRIAL</b> REGISTRATION: <b>European</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>Trial</b> <b>Database</b> (EudraCT number 2014 - 002227 - 96).

Appropriate hypergastrinemia results from gastric acid inhibition. A gender difference in fasting gastrin with higher levels among women than among men on long-term PPI therapy has been demonstrated. Patients with endoscopically verified erosive esophagitis on long-term PPI therapy were randomized double blindly to step down their dose by half or continue with the same dose for 8 weeks. Fasting gastrin levels were measured before and after treatment. The primary endpoint was successful step-down throughout the study period. Overall, 100 patients were randomized, 49 (24 females) to continue with the same dose as before and 51 (25 females) to step down. Female patients had higher gastrin levels compared with male patients: 78 pg/mL (IQR, 50 to 99) versus 50 pg/mL (IQR, 36 to 74) (P= 0. 007). Among those randomized to the step-down intervention only 3 / 25 (12 %) women failed to complete the 2 months of lower-dose therapy versus 9 / 25 (36 %) men (P= 0. 09). Female gender (P= 0. 048) was the strongest predictor for successful step-down (odds ratio= 1. 27; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 60). The chance of failing to maintain symptom control was twice as high in the reduction group (24 %) as compared with the control group (13 %) (P= 0. 2). Female patients on long-term PPI therapy were 3 times more likely to tolerate half of their prior dose. Female gender had higher probability for successful step-down. These results indicate that women with gastroesophageal reflux disease might manage with lower doses of PPIs as compared with men. <b>European</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>Trial</b> <b>Database</b> ([URL] number 2013 - 002067 - 26...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Fibroblast {{growth factor}} 23 (FGF 23) is a phosphaturic hormone that is {{secreted}} from bone and serum level increases as renal function declines. Higher levels of FGF 23 {{are associated with}} increased mortality in hemodialysis-patients and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2 - 4. The use of active vitamin D and phosphate binders as recommended in international guidelines, may affect the level of FGF 23 and thereby clinical outcome. We investigated {{the effects of a}} phosphate binder and active vitamin D on the serum levels of intact FGF 23 (iFGF 23) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in patients with CKD stage 3 b (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30 – 44 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). Methods Seven women and 14 men were included, mean age 65. 6 [*]±[*] 12. 2 [*]years. They were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive one of two treatment sequences. Group- 1 (the alphacalcidol-sevelamer carbonate group) : alphacalcidol 0. 25 [*]μg once daily for two weeks followed by sevelamer carbonate 800 [*]mg TID with meals for two weeks after a two-week washout period. Group- 2 (the sevelamer carbonate-alphacalcidol group) : vice versa. Nineteen patients completed the study. The 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level at baseline was 97. 6 [*]±[*] 25. 0 [*]nmol/l. Results There were no treatment effects on the iFGF 23 and iPTH levels overall. In group- 1 the iFGF 23 level was higher after treatment with alphacalcidol compared with sevelamer carbonate (mean 105. 8 [*]±[*] 41. 6 vs. 79. 1 [*]±[*] 36. 5 [*]pg/ml, p[*]=[*] 0. 047 (CI: 0. 4 - 52. 9), and the iPTH level was lower (median: 26. 5, range: 14. 6 - 55. 2 vs. median 36. 1, range 13. 4 - 106. 9 [*]pg/ml, p[*]=[*] 0. 011). In group- 2 the iFGF 23 level increased non-significantly after treatment with sevelamer carbonate and throughout the washout period. Conclusions In this crossover trial with alphacalcidol and sevelamer carbonate in patients with CKD stage 3 b, the levels of iFGF 23 were not significantly different after the two treatments. However, in the group of patients initiating therapy with sevelamer carbonate the iFGF 23 levels seemed to increase while this response was mitigated in the group of patients given alphacalcidol followed by sevelamer carbonate. This may have therapeutic implications on choice of first line therapy. The number of patients is small and this conclusion is in part based on subgroup analysis. It is therefore important that these results are confirmed in larger studies.

This prospective cohort study recruited NTG patients taking antiglaucoma medication. Subjects were excluded if they had previous glaucoma surgery/laser or corneal pathologies. All subjects underwent a 1 -month washout. A single session of SLT was performed to 360 ° of the trabecular meshwork. Medication was resumed at 1 month to achieve a targeted 30 % intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction from the post-washout/pre-SLT IOP. IOP was measured every 3 months and medication use was recorded at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Subjects with a secondary SLT or cataract extraction were excluded from IOP and medication analyses. At 24 months, 34 of the initial 45 right eyes were eligible for analyses. There were significant IOP reductions at all time intervals (except at 1 week) following SLT {{when compared to the}} prestudy (without medication) or pre-SLT (post-washout) IOP (P  20 % from pre-SLT, without medication) was achieved in 11. 1 % (5 / 45).

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIt is {{documented}} that omalizumab treatment reduces the cell surface expression of immunoglobulin E high-affinity receptor (FcɛRI) on several cell types. This {{has not been}} investigated in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent allergic asthma. MethodsIn a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, patients with severe allergic asthma uncontrolled by high dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β 2 -agonist received either omalizumab (n =  20) or placebo (n =  11) over 16 weeks at appropriate doses and frequencies. Baseline and end of study (week 16) FcɛRI expression on basophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells was determined by flow cytometry for the primary endpoint. Secondary efficacy endpoints included asthma control and lung function {{as part of an}} initial investigation into the use of FcɛRI expression as a marker of response. ResultsIn the omalizumab group, and with respect to placebo, FcɛRI expression was significantly reduced at end of study on basophils (− 82. 6 %, p <  0. 01) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (− 44. 2 %, p =  0. 029). FcɛRI expression reduction was not found to be correlated with clinical response. ConclusionsLong-term omalizumab treatment induced reduction of FcɛRI expression on circulating basophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. These changes were not associated with those of clinical features related to severe asthma, which does not support further investigation into its use as a predictive marker of response.

40|$|Abstract Background The Matchpoint trial aims to {{identify}} the optimal dose of ponatinib to give with conventional chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin to chronic myeloid leukaemia patients in blastic transformation phase. The dose should be both tolerable and efficacious. This paper describes our experience implementing EffTox in the Matchpoint trial. Methods EffTox is a Bayesian adaptive dose-finding trial design that jointly scrutinises binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes. We describe a nomenclature for succinctly describing outcomes in phase I/II dose-finding trials. We use dose-transition pathways, where doses are calculated for each feasible set of outcomes in future cohorts. We introduce the phenomenon of dose ambivalence, where EffTox can recommend different doses after observing the same outcomes. We also describe our experiences with outcome ambiguity, where the categorical evaluation of some primary outcomes is temporarily delayed. Results We arrived at an EffTox parameterisation that is simulated to perform well over a range of scenarios. In scenarios where dose ambivalence manifested, we were guided by the dose-transition pathways. This technique facilitates planning, and also helped us overcome short-term outcome ambiguity. Conclusions EffTox is an efficient and powerful design, but not without its challenges. Joint phase I/II clinical trial designs will likely become increasingly important in coming years as we further investigate non-cytotoxic treatments and streamline the drug approval process. We hope this account {{of the problems we}} faced and the solutions we used will help others implement this dose-finding clinical trial design.

40|$|BACKGROUND: For many years, {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma has been doxorubicin. This study compared gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. METHODS: The GeDDiS trial was a randomised controlled phase 3 trial done in 24 UK hospitals and one Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) hospital. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma of Trojani grade 2 or 3, disease progression before enrolment, and no previous chemotherapy for sarcoma or previous doxorubicin for any cancer. Patients {{were randomly assigned}} 1 : 1 to receive six cycles of intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks, or intravenous gemcitabine 675 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 8 every 3 weeks. Treatment was assigned using a minimisation algorithm incorporating a random element. Randomisation was stratified by age (≤ 18 years vs > 18 years) and histological subtype. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 weeks in the intention-to-treat population. Adherence to treatment and toxicity were analysed in the safety population, consisting of all patients who received at least one dose of their randomised treatment. The trial was registered with the <b>European</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>Trials</b> (EudraCT) <b>database</b> (no 2009 - 014907 - 29) and with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry (ISRCTN 07742377), and is now closed to patient entry. FINDINGS: Between Dec 3, 2010, and Jan 20, 2014, 257 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (129 to doxorubicin and 128 to gemcitabine and docetaxel). Median follow-up was 22 months (IQR 15 · 7 - 29 · 3). The proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 weeks did not differ between those who received doxorubicin versus those who received gemcitabine and docetaxel (46 · 3 % [95 % CI 37 · 5 - 54 · 6] vs 46 · 4 % [37 · 5 - 54 · 8]); median progression-free survival (23 · 3 weeks [95 % CI 19 · 6 - 30 · 4] vs 23 · 7 weeks [18 · 1 - 20 · 0]; hazard ratio [HR] for progression-free survival 1 · 28, 95 % CI 0 · 99 - 1 · 65, p= 0 · 06). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (32 [25 %] of 128 patients who received doxorubicin and 25 [20 %] of 126 patients who received gemcitabine and docetaxel), febrile neutropenia (26 [20 %] and 15 [12 %]), fatigue (eight [6 %] and 17 [14 %]), oral mucositis (18 [14 %] and two [2 %]), and pain (ten [8 %] and 13 [10 %]). The three most common serious adverse events, representing 111 (39 %) of all 285 serious adverse events recorded, were febrile neutropenia (27 [17 %] of 155 serious adverse events in patients who received doxorubicin and 15 [12 %] of 130 serious adverse events in patients who received gemcitabine and docetaxel, fever (18 [12 %] and 19 [15 %]), and neutropenia (22 [14 %] and ten [8 %]). 154 (60 %) of 257 patients died in the intention-to-treat population: 74 (57 %) of 129 patients in the doxorubicin group and 80 (63 %) of 128 in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group. No deaths {{were related to the}} treatment, but two deaths were due to a combination of disease progression and treatment. INTERPRETATION: Doxorubicin should remain the standard first-line treatment for most patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. These results provide evidence for clinicians to consider with their patients when selecting first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.

We aimed to assess the outcome of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in patients from the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology (AIEOP) centres treated with AIEOP-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (AIEOP-BFM) protocols. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we included all children aged from 1 to less than 18 years with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia immunophenotype diagnosed between Jan 1, 2008, and Oct 31, 2014, from AIEOP centres. Early T-cell precursors were defined as being CD 1 a and CD 8 negative, CD 5 weak positive or negative, and positive {{for at least one}} of the following antigens: CD 34, CD 117, HLADR, CD 13, CD 33, CD 11 b, or CD 65.

40|$|Abstract Background Efflux {{transporters}} like MDR 1 and MRP 2 may modulate the pharmacokinetics {{of about}} 50  % of all drugs. It is currently unknown {{how much of}} the variation in the activities of important drug membrane transporters like MDR 1 or MRP 2 is determined by genetic or by environmental factors. In this study we assessed the heritability of the pharmacokinetics of talinolol as a putative probe drug for MDR 1 and possibly other membrane transporters. Methods Talinolol pharmacokinetics were investigated in a repeated dose study in 42 monozygotic and 13 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs. The oral clearance of talinolol was predefined as the primary parameter. Heritability was analyzed by structural equation modeling and by within- and between-subject variance and talinolol clearance was correlated with polymorphisms in MDR 1, MRP 2, BCRP, MDR 5, OATP 1 B 1, and OCT 1. Results Talinolol clearance varied approximately ninefold in the studied sample of healthy volunteers. The correlation of clearances between siblings was not significantly different for the monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. All data analyses consistently showed that variation of talinolol pharmacokinetics was mainly determined by environmental effects. Structural equation modeling attributed 53. 5  % of the variation of oral clearance to common environmental effects influencing both siblings to the same extent and 46. 5  % to unique environmental effects randomly affecting individual subjects. Talinolol pharmacokinetics were significantly dependent on sex, body mass index, total protein consumption, and vegetable consumption. Conclusions The twin study revealed that environmental factors explained much more of the variation in pharmacokinetics of talinolol than genetic factors.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies have}} {{questioned}} our previous understanding {{on the effect}} of nitrous oxide on muscle relaxants, since nitrous oxide has been shown to potentiate the action of bolus doses of mivacurium, rocuronium and vecuronium. This study was aimed to investigate the possible effect of nitrous oxide on the infusion requirements of cisatracurium. Methods 70 ASA physical status I-III patients aged 18 - 75 years were enrolled in this randomized trial. The patients were undergoing elective surgery requiring general anesthesia with a duration of at least 90 minutes. Patients were randomized to receive propofol and remifentanil by target controlled infusion in combination with either a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (Nitrous oxide/TIVA group) or oxygen in air (Air/TIVA group). A 0. 1 mg/kg initial bolus of cisatracurium was administered before tracheal intubation, followed by a closed-loop computer controlled infusion of cisatracurium to produce and maintain a 90 % neuromuscular block. Cumulative dose requirements of cisatracurium during the 90 -min study period after bolus administration were measured and the asymptotic steady state rate of infusion to produce a constant 90 % block was determined by applying nonlinear curve fitting to the data on the cumulative dose requirement during the study period. Results Controller performance, i. e. the ability of the controller to maintain neuromuscular block constant at the setpoint and patient characteristics were similar in both groups. The administration of nitrous oxide did not affect cisatracurium infusion requirements. The mean steady-state rates of infusion were 0. 072 +/- 0. 018 and 0. 066 +/- 0. 017 mg * kg- 1 * h- 1 in Air/TIVA and Nitrous oxide/TIVA groups, respectively. Conclusions Nitrous oxide does not affect the infusion requirements of cisatracurium.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundElectrochemical skin {{conductance}} measurement is {{an active}} electrophysiologic method in which incremental low direct voltage is applied on the skin. It generates a current due to reverse iontophoresis which previous studies suggested to be mostly related to chloride anion movements. As sweat chloride movements upon electric stimulation {{were likely to be}} impaired in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, we designed a proof-of-concept study to measure electrochemical skin conductance in CF patients and control subjects and to test the ability of this method to discriminate CF from controls. MethodsElectrochemical skin conductance was measured in 41 adult patients with classical CF and 20 healthy control subjects. Patients placed their hands and feet on nickel electrodes and an incremental low direct voltage was applied on the anode during 2 min. The resulting voltage on the cathode and the current generated between anode and cathode were measured and from them, two electrochemical skin conductance variables were calculated: ESC, obtained when a low voltage of 1. 6 V was applied, and dESC which took into account electrochemical skin conductances obtained when low and high voltages were applied. ResultsESC measurements on hands and feet were significantly different in CF patients (on feet: 75 ± 10 μSi), as compared with control subjects (62 ± 13 μSi, p< 0. 0001); dESC was also significantly different and more discriminative in CF patients (on feet: 34 ± 24 μSi), as compared with control subjects (93 ± 24 μSi, p< 0. 0001). dESC measurement provided a diagnostic specificity of 1 and a sensitivity of 0. 93. ConclusionsThese results show that electrochemical skin conductance which is easily and rapidly measured is abnormal in CF patients.

40|$|Background & Aims: The second-generation Pillcam Colon Capsule Endoscope (PCCE- 2; Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) is an {{ingestible}} capsule for {{visualization of}} the colon. We performed a multicenter pilot study to assess its safety and feasibility {{in evaluating the}} severity of Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: In a prospective study, 40 patients with active colonic CD underwent PCCE- 2 and optical colonoscopy procedures. Using both techniques, we generated values for the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS), the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD, and global evaluation of lesion severity. In {{the first stage of}} the study, we calculated the correlation between PCCE- 2 and optical colonoscopy scores. In the second stage, we performed interobserver agreement analysis for a random subset of 20 PCCE- 2 recordings, graded in duplicate by 2 independent readers. Results: There was substantial agreement between PCCE- 2 and optical colonoscopy in the measurement of the CDEIS (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0. 65; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 43 - 0. 80). There was substantial interobserver agreement between 2 independent PCCE- 2 readers for the CDEIS (ICC, 0. 67; 95 % CI, 0. 35 - 0. 86) and the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (ICC, 0. 66; 95 % CI, 0. 32 - 0. 85). However, the PCCE- 2 scoring systematically underestimated the severity of disease compared with optical colonoscopy; based on our results, PCCE- 2 detected colonic ulcerations with 86 % sensitivity and 40 % specificity. No adverse events were observed and PCCE- 2 was better tolerated than colonoscopy. Conclusions: PCCE- 2 is feasible, safe, and well tolerated for the assessment of mucosal CD activity in selected populations. Larger studies are needed to assess its operating characteristics further. <b>European</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> <b>database</b> number: 2014 - 003854 - 15.

40|$|The study aims {{to define}} a legal {{framework}} of clinical trials data, by testing international the European rules of data secrecy against the expanding demands for disclosure. We argue that information embedded in clinical trial protocols {{turn out to be}} a precious source for the evaluation of drug’s safety and efficacy, the awareness of which is thus to be considered essential for protecting patients’ and consumers’ health. However clinical trials data do not only have an important public informational value, but also an intrinsic regulatory- and therefore commercial- value, being key to the granting of drugs’ marketing license. We compare the general disclosure provision provided by art. 84 of the recent European Clinical Trials Regulation, establishing a publicly accessible <b>European</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> <b>database,</b> with specific intellectual property measures, providing guarantees of exclusivity to clinical testing data used to obtain marketing approval. Research-based companies aiming to protect their “sweat of the brow” from competitors’ free-riding, have invoked art. 39. 3 TRIPS and the European data exclusivity regimes, as a legal basis for regulatory agencies’ non-disclosure obligation. Also privacy concerns have been called upon as a legal barrier to disclosure, due to the vast amount of personal data embedded in the results of test data. We illustrate how drug’s safety information disclosure is not prevented by both clinical trials protection rules and the privacy normative framework. To the contrary we demonstrate a systemic justification for disclosure. In our analysis we read public interest of transparency and accountability in clinical trials information through the subsequent lenses of the human right to health as defined by International Human Rights Treatises and the Human rights case law, of the public goods dimension of research and knowledge production, and finally of the legal framework protecting consumer rights as defined by the correspondent European Directives...|$|E
