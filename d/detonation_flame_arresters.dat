5000|$|Flame arresters are {{passive devices}} with no moving parts. They prevent the {{propagation}} of flame from the exposed side of the unit to the protected side {{by the use of}} metal matrix creating a torturous path called a flame cell or element. All <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> operate on the same principle: removing heat from the flame as it attempts to travel through narrow passages with walls of metal or other heat-conductive material, but unlike flame arresters, <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> must be built to withstand extreme pressures that travel at supersonic velocities, [...] at 2500 m/s is not uncommon with a group D Gas.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{patented}} <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> {{was developed}} by Nicholas Roussakis et al., [...] and was issued on March 20, 1990. Its need was initially driven by new environmental legislation, namely the Clean Air Act of the USA. Regular <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> had been around for years, but they had very limited applications.|$|R
50|$|Detonation Flame Arrester {{products}} {{were created in}} response to environmental regulations (such as The Clean Air Act) which required liquid product storage terminals and hydrocarbon processing plants to control evaporative hydrocarbon emissions from loading and storage operations. This process is called vapor control. Two types of recognized vapor control technologies are commonly used; carbon adsorption vapor recovery and vapor destruction or combustion. Vapor destruction systems include elevated flare systems, enclosed flare systems, burner and catalytic incineration systems, and waste gas boilers. Both systems require flame or <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> to maximize safety.Detonation flame arresters are used in many industries, including refining, pharmaceutical, chemical, and petrochemical, pulp and paper, oil exploration and production, sewage treatment, landfills, mining, power generation, and bulk liquids transportation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> (also spelled arrestor) is {{a device}} fitted {{to the opening}} of an {{enclosure}} or to the connecting pipe work of a system of enclosures and whose intended function is to allow flow but prevent the transmission of flame propagating at supersonic velocity.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> {{applications}} are in systems which collect gases emitted by liquids and solids. These systems, {{commonly used in}} many industries, may be called vapor control systems. The gases which are vented to atmosphere or controlled via vapor control systems are typically flammable. If the conditions are such that ignition occurs, a flame inside or outside of the system could result, {{with the potential to}} do catastrophic damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>arresters</b> {{should be}} {{periodically}} inspected {{to make sure}} they are free of dirt, insects using it as a nest, or corrosion. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board concluded that an uninspected and badly corroded <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> failed to prevent a 2006 explosion at a wastewater treatment plant in Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|R

50|$|As {{with all}} high-alcohol beverages, Bacardi 151 is flammable. Bacardi 151 has {{multiple}} warnings {{on the label}} of the bottle stating {{that it should not}} be ignited or exposed to an open flame. Bottles are also equipped with a stainless steel <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> crimped onto the neck of the bottle to prevent the rum inside the bottle from igniting, in case a consumer ignores the warnings and applies the rum to a source of ignition (e.g. a flaming pan or dish, a flambé). Despite the warnings against ignition and the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> consumers have claimed to have been burned by people who ignored repeated warnings, removed the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> and exposed the bottle to an open flame.|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the capability to}} predict {{the effectiveness of a}} <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> in the cooling of hot combustion gases expelled through a <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> the U. S. Bureau of Mines developed an equilibrium. model and one-and three-dimensional transient thermal models of a <b>flame</b> <b>arrester,</b> which were used to predict the temperature evolution within the arrester and the maximum temperature at the external surface of the arrester. The models account for convective and conductive heat transport within the arrester and radiative losses at the exit surface. The gas flow through the arrester is established from an empirically derived relationship between the gas velocity and the pressure gradient across the arrester. Lateral heat loss from the arrester to the enclosure wall is accounted for in the three-dimensional model. The model calculations for maximum outside surface temperature of the arrester showed an approximate agreement with measured values for vent-area-to-enclosure-volume ratios between 12 and 28 in 222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ft- 3...|$|R

40|$|Detonation is the {{supersonic}} mode of {{combustion process}} which {{is essential for}} energy release from combustion process. Detonation is the more energetic process compare to deflagration mode of combustion process. The turbulence combustion flame cannot transit itself into detonation combustion process. So objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of obstacles configuration landed in detonation tube channel to propagate the detonation wave and diffraction encounters in an obstacles site. Four different cases of obstacles blockage ratio (BR) 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 7 were studied for <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> acceleration in <b>detonation</b> tube. A three dimensional computational simulation was done using unsteady green-gauss cell based solver for adopting the combustion simulation. As a result <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> propagation, <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> velocity and <b>detonation</b> <b>flame</b> pressure were increase in reducing blockage ratio from 0. 7 to 0. 4 and eddy viscosity of combustible mixture was increase with increasing the blockage ratio.

50|$|On a fuel storage vent, <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> {{also serve}} a {{secondary}} purpose of allowing air pressure to equalize inside the tank when fuel is added or removed, while also preventing insects from flying or crawling into the vent piping and fouling the fuel in the tanks and pipes.|$|R
50|$|Under normal {{operating}} conditions the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> permits a relatively {{free flow of}} gas or vapor through the piping system. If the mixture is ignited and the flame begins to travel back through the piping, the arrester will prohibit the flame from moving back to the gas source.|$|R

50|$|For <b>flame</b> <b>arresters</b> used as {{a safety}} device, the mesh must be {{protected}} from damage due to being dropped or struck by another object, and the mesh must be capable of rigidly retaining its shape during the propagation of a flame front.

50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>arresters</b> {{should be}} used only in the gas group and {{conditions}} they have been designed and tested for. Since the depth on an arrester is specified for certain conditions, changes in the temperature, pressure, or composition of the gases entering the arrester can cause the flame spatial velocity to increase, making {{the design of the}} arrester insufficient to stop the flame front ("propagation"). The deflagration may continue downstream of the arrester.|$|R

50|$|A <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> (also {{called a}} {{deflagration}} arrester) functions by absorbing {{the heat from}} a flame front traveling at sub-sonic velocities, thus dropping the burning gas/air mixture below its auto-ignition temperature: consequently, the flame cannot survive. The heat is absorbed through channels (passages) designed into an element. These channels are chosen and measured as the mesg (Maximum Experimental Safe Gap) of the gas for a particular installation.These passages can be regular, like crimped metal ribbon or wire mesh or a sheet metal plate with punched holes, or irregular, {{such as those in}} random packing.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{results obtained}} from an experimental programme {{to determine the}} explosion development characteristics of mixtures of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and carbon monoxide in oxygen plus nitrogen atmospheres. The main complex experimental pipe configuration and mixtures studied reproduced, as accurately as possible, a process configuration identical to that used in a real operational process plant. A commercial <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> device (nominal channel size 0. 475 mm) was also tested on occasions. The test pipe configurations used 300 mm nominal bore steel pipe. The main test series were conducted in a configuration that included three standard 1. 5 D bends, as part of on overall pipe length of ca. 20 m. In certain tests the <b>flame</b> <b>arrester</b> was placed after the third bend, furthest from the spark ignition source. Some initial commissioning tests were made using a single straight section, 4 m long. This allowed some overpressure development measurements of VCM mixtures to be compared with those for ethylene mixtures. In addition the flame acceleration characteristics of VCM/CO/O 2 /N 2 mixture in the full 20 m geometry have been quantified and compared to the behaviour observed with propane/O 2 /N 2 mixtures. For both fuels a distinct change in flame acceleration characteristics with reduced nitrogen content was observed.

A nascent protostrange star should be bare because of strong mass ejection and high temperature after the supernova <b>detonation</b> <b>flame,</b> and a crust can also hardly form {{except for a}} super-Eddington accretion. The magnetosphere of a bare strange star is composed mainly of electron-positron pair plasma, where both inner and outer vacuum gaps work for radio as well as high energy nonthermal emission.

S. Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA's) Approval and Certification Center, Triadelphia, WV. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a permissible pressure vent for use on lightweight, vented, explosion- proof enclosures. In laboratory tests, four grades of RETIMET, a stainless steel foam material, were evaluated: (1) 45 NC- 7, (2) 45 NC- 13, (3) 80 NC- 7, and (4) 80 NC- 13. Explosive gas mixtures were prepared by a dynamic flow system. Ignition was by a low-voltage arc. Each grade of RETIMET metal foam successfully arrested the flame front in all methane-air tests. To evaluate RETIMET metal foam on large, commercial size enclosures, a multicompartmented enclosure was designed and tested in MSHA's explosion gallery in Triadelphia, WV. Extensive explosion testing revealed that a minimum vent-area-to-enclosure-volume ratio of 11. 33 in 2 /ft 3 is required to keep internal pressure rises below 3 psig.
