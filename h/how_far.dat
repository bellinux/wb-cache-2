5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about <b>how</b> <b>far</b> natural selection affected animals, and <b>how</b> <b>far</b> other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore discursive {{strategies}} applied in Fars News {{to represent the}} event of Egyptian revolution as a positive/legitimized action and Hosni Mubarak’s regime as the negative/delegitimized other. Van Leeuwen's (2008) model of legitimation is used to show <b>how</b> <b>Fars</b> News applies the legitimation discursive construction, including four main categories of ''authorization'', ''evaluation'', ''rationalization'', and ''mythopoesis'' to legitimize Egyptian revolution.   This article also tries {{to see how this}} news agency tries to delegitimize Mubarak’s regime by using such discursive strategies. The researchers aim to reveal <b>how</b> <b>Fars</b> News network is using language in order to legitimize or delegitimize a single event. Also, the research will argue how using certain discursive strategies of language can affect people’s mind in a way that might be in line with the policies and guidelines of a specific news agency. The study shows that Fars News put more focus on legitimizing Egyptian revolution than delegitimizing Hosni Mubarak's regime, and for the purpose of persuading its audiences to take the revolution as a good event and Mubarak as the evil since it has mostly utilized ''authorization" as the most influential legitimating category. And among the subcategories of legitimation, Fars News has made use of "personal authority" more frequently.  </p...|$|R

5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: <b>how</b> <b>far</b> to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|Ireland {{remained}} {{ruled by}} native kings into the 12th century, largely {{without the use}} of castles. There was a history of Irish fortifications called ráths, a type of ringfort, some of which were very heavily defended but which are not usually considered to be castles in the usual sense of the word. The kings of Connacht constructed fortifications from 1124 which they called caistel or caislen, from the Latin and French for castle, and there has been considerable academic debate over <b>how</b> <b>far</b> these resembled European castles.|$|E

5|$|Until this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} a {{consensus}} regarding <b>how</b> <b>far</b> away GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported {{the idea that}} GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint {{because they are not}} highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{artillery}} guns were deployed, including heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and smaller pieces such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older guns, for example slings and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons {{such as the}} culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain <b>how</b> <b>far</b> the guns of the period would have reached; analysis {{carried out in the}} 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between 1,600 and 2,743 metres (5,200ft and 8,999ft) away.|$|E

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and <b>how</b> <b>far</b> from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or <b>how</b> <b>far</b> above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine <b>how</b> <b>far</b> away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
