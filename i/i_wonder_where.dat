2500|$|Discussing the {{influence}} aesthetic for Shadows of the Sun and {{the influence}} of chamber music, Rygg commented, “There's no specific aesthetic other than a sense of the beautiful itself, I suppose. There's a connection to classical composition, that's pretty obvious. Some Wagner transpositions. Some Schumann warped beyond recognition etc. in there. [...] "Funebre" [...] is largely based on one single bar off Wagner and we have that little Chopin signature thrown in there as well. So yeah, even though we use fewer notes, the classical stamp is all over the record. Beach Boys? It's probably the vocal thing, that I am fond of clean-sung, layered, well-produced vocals and harmonies. That's another rarity these days. <b>I</b> <b>wonder,</b> <b>where</b> did all the sunshine pop go?” ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{measures}} {{have been taken to}} try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President Ronald Reagan introduced the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987. This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, [...] "During her education, she [...] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act. I know my daughter's performance is hers, but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> she would have been without the assistance she received under the McKinney-Vento Act. Many students at BHS owe their graduation and success to the assistance under this law." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was making}} {{my way through}} the crowd, {{watching}} the various people, giving a word here and there or a nod, and I thought that life was really a very amusing thing.

6000|$|I {{sat still}} {{and let the}} cold sweat run down.

6000|$|I {{stared at}} the distant houses. For {{the first time since}} our {{starvation}} in the crater I thought of earthly food. [...] "Bacon," [...] I whispered, [...] "eggs.

60|$|I {{heard the}} {{landlord}} yelling, {{and there was}} a long and systematic thumping somewhere, thump, thump, thump, and banging. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>where</b> it was. <b>I</b> could not locate it at all, because my room lay beyond another large room: I had to go through a large room, by the foot of two beds, to get to my door; so I could not quite tell where anything was.|$|R

60|$|I set {{my little}} tent, {{which was about}} {{as big as a}} dog kennel, and crawled into it early, in order to be {{shielded}} from the winds, which grew keen as sword blades as the sun sank behind the western mountains.

60|$|Neither of us {{spoke again}} for a time, and I {{remember}} reflecting that whoever won Lucille Haldane would have a helpmate {{to be proud of}} in this world and perhaps, by virtue of what she could teach him, follow into the next.

6000|$|He was up {{long before}} the late dawn, {{and it was still}} early when we waded {{scarcely}} knee-deep among the boulders of a curiously shrunken stream. Smooth-ground rocks cumbered its bed, and the muddy water that gurgled among them was stained red instead of the usual glacial green, while, as <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>where</b> the rest had gone, the prospector remarked, [...] "These blamed rivers are low in winter, but I never saw one quite so ashamed of itself as this.

60|$|I {{climbed to}} the highest rock of that ridge and looked about. It was a wild spot, some three miles from town. Presently I {{recognized}} landmarks {{given to me by}} Steele and knew I was near his place. I whistled, then halloed, but got no reply. Then by working {{back and forth across the}} ridge I found what appeared to be a faint trail. This I followed, lost and found again, and eventually, still higher up on another ridge, with a commanding outlook, I found Steele's hiding place. He had not been there for perhaps forty-eight hours. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>where</b> he had slept.|$|R
60|$|Afterwards I {{drove in}} a cab down a canon of rushing street between high warehouses, and peeped up {{astonished}} at the blackened greys of Saint Paul's. The traffic of Cheapside--it was mostly in horse omnibuses in those days--seemed stupendous, its roar was stupendous; <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>where</b> the money came from to employ so many cabs, what industry could support the endless jostling stream of silk-hatted, frock-coated, hurrying men. Down a turning I found the Temperance Hotel Mr. Mantell had recommended to me. The porter in a green uniform who took over my portmanteau, seemed, I thought, to despise me a good deal.|$|R
