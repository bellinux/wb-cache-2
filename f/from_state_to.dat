5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun because {{it would be easy to}} maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a gun from his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> state to choose their victims. They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU solicits {{donations}} to its charitable foundation. The ACLU is accredited by the Better Business Bureau, and the Charity Navigator has ranked the ACLU with a four-star rating. The local affiliates solicit their own funding; however, some also receive {{funds from the}} national ACLU, with the distribution and amount of such assistance varying <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> state. At its discretion, the national organization provides subsidies to smaller affiliates that lack sufficient resources to be self-sustaining; for example, the Wyoming ACLU chapter received such subsidies until April 2015, when, {{as part of a}} round of layoffs at the national ACLU, the Wyoming office was closed.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range was {{produced}} by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. Active volcanism has taken place for approximately 36million years; the nearby Challis Range features complexes as old as 55 mya. Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades has been relatively intermittent, producing up to 3,000 volcanic calderas at a time. Frequent volcanism within the last 10,000years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California's Lassen Peak complex. Remarkably different <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> state, the volcanism ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones. TheCascadevolcanoes are divided into two large sectors, called the High Cascades and the Western Cascades; Thielsen {{is part of the}} High Cascades, which are east of the Western Cascades.|$|E
5|$|What is now MD222 was {{originally}} designated MD268. MD 268 {{was replaced by}} a southern extension of US 222 from US 1 at Conowingo to US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville in 1938. The Susquehanna River Road section of US 222 was transferred <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> county maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. However, that section was returned to state control through an August 23, 1961, agreement after Cecil County requested it be returned to the state. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved rolling back {{the southern end of the}} US 222 designation from US 40 to US 1 at their April 1995 spring meeting. The Maryland State Highway Administration proposed and AASHTO approved the redesignation of US 222 to MD 222 from US 40 to US 1 in February 1996; however, the new designation had already been enacted officially and marked publicly in 1995. The redesignation did not apply to Aiken Avenue; indeed, Aiken Avenue's designation was changed from US 222 to MD 222 in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E
