5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles.

Mycobacteria, especially M. avium complex and M. tuberculosis infections, are closely associated with <b>HIV</b> disease. <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very small <b>retrovirus</b> and its high mutation rate leads to extremely variable viral populations, both within and between individuals. It is coated with glycoprotein 120 (gp 120), which it uses to bind to and infect a range of CD 4 + leukocytes, depending on the co-receptor specificity. T cell-tropic HIV strains tend to use the CXCR- 4 chemokine receptor, while macrophage-tropic strains tend to use the CCR- 5 chemokine receptor.

After acute infection, virus continues to replicate resulting in sero-conversion and its detection in blood 4 - 6 weeks after exposure. 2, 3 in untreated HIV infection, viral load progressively increases with subsequent depletion of CD 4 + T lymphocytes. As a result, immune system becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections. Symptomatic and life threatening condition known as AIDS (Acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome) can develop when CD 4 + counts falls below 200 cells/µl.

The infection results {{in a wide range of}} clinical manifestations related to defective cell-mediated immunity (Beers and Berkow, 1999). At the end of the twentieth century, over 21 million individuals worldwide had died from AIDS, over 34 million were living with the HIV infection, and over 95 % of HIV-infected persons resided in developing nations (Klatt, 2005). At present, 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV/AIDS of which more than 26 million reside in Africa (Treatment Access, 2005). Sutherlandia frutescens, a medicinal plant from South Africa has documented anti-cancer and antiviral activity. One of the active compounds of this plant <b>is</b> L-canavanine, <b>a</b> cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). In minute doses, the iNOS inhibitor may stimulate nitric oxide (NO) release to counteract retrovirus replication. This study aimed to ascertain the effect of Sutherlandia frutescens 200 CH on CD 4 cell counts and symptomatology in persons infected with HIV. Study parameters involved recording of vital signs, symptomatology and CD 4 analysis at three separate consultations over a ten-week period. All information was collected and collated for statistical or descriptive analysis. The research study was carried out on a random sample size of twenty-six participants, between the age of seventeen and fifty years over a period of ten weeks. Participants included both genders and had been previously diagnosed HIV-positive. Persons using antiretroviral treatment or falling into Category C as specified in the Centres for Disease Control Classification (Appendix B), were excluded from the sample group. Participants acted as own controls for the study with the use of a CD 4 analysis baseline reading at the first consultation. Participants were then assessed at mid-term (week 5) and final consultations (week 10) during the study. Sutherlandia frutescens 200 CH, in granule form, was taken sublingually once a day for two weeks, with participants then taking no medication for three weeks until the mid-term consultation. The treatment regimen was repeated in the second half of the study. Physical examinations to assess vital signs and opportunistic infections, completion of a health status questionnaire and report-back sessions were conducted at all consultations to determine a general symptomatic picture of research participants. Blood samples taken at all consultations were analysed for CD 45 + white cell count, CD 4 percentage of lymphocytes and absolute CD 4 cell count. The McNemar test and a One Factor Repeated Measure (ANOVA) test were used to give statistical results and to form a profile analysis. Analysed results show that treatment with Sutherlandia frutescens 200 CH significantly improves several common signs and symptoms experienced by HIV positive people, including oral candidiasis, fever and skin rashes; a number of other pathologies showed improvement, but not to a statistically significant level. The analysis of CD 4 cell counts demonstrated a significant decrease of absolute CD 4 cell counts during the course of the study, even in the presence of a stable CD 4 percentage. Statistical analysis also indicated a lack of consistency in change of CD 4 percentage and absolute CD 4 between participants, as well as a lack of correlation between change of CD 4 percentage and absolute CD 4 changes. <b>As</b> NO <b>was</b> not tested directly no assumption can be made as to how these results might have been influenced.

40|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrovirus</b> on the Lentivirus subfamily. The virus binds to the CD 4 {{receptor}} on the T helper lymphocytes. Fusion of the viral {{and cell}} membranes allows entry of the viral core into the cell. The reverse transcriptase enzyme, a protein {{carried by the}} virus that allows transcription of ribonucleic acid (RNA) into deoxyribonucleic acid, then mediates transcription of the viral RNA genome into viral DNA. Viral integrase then facilitates incorporation of the viral DNA into the host genome. The viral DNA is then transcribed into multiple RNA copies by the host cell. This newly created RNA is translated into viral proteins. Translation of the viral RNA sequences results in protein precursors that undergo proteolytic processing by a viral protease that liberates the functional viral proteins [1, 2]. As the virus infects and damages helper T cells, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are impaired. Defective chemotaxis and phagocytosis causes increased vulnerability to infections such as candidiasis and toxoplasmosis. A lack of T-cell stimulation of B cells results in decreased immunoglobulin production and a vulnerability to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria. These problems are compounded by impaired neutrophil function [2]. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) results from infection {{with the human}} immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV).</b> HIV- 1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrovirus,</b> belonging to the lentivirus family, and is characterized by its sexual or blood route of transmission and long clinical latency. The genetic structure of HIV- 1 has been well characterized, and is composed of the gag, pol, and env genes common to all retroviruses, two essential regulatory genes, tat and rev, and several auxiliary genes, vpr, vpu, nef, and vif. The Vpr, Vpu and met, non-structural proteins {{have been found to}} be associated with the viral particle to a varying extent. The pol gene encodes the reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), and integrase (IN) enzymes, all of which play major roles in the life cycle of the virus. The protease enzyme <b>is</b> <b>an</b> essential component in the process of virus maturation and infectivity. Protease mediates the assembly of the viral core components, which are initially produced as polyprotein precursors, by catalyzing specific cleavages releasing the individual proteins. ^ Current treatment for infected individuals involves the administration of several drugs, all of which either target the viral reverse transcriptase or protease activities of the virus. Targeting these proteins will inhibit or halt the replication of the virus, the contributing factor to the disease process. The prolonged treatment of virus-infected individuals with these drugs has led to the selection of viruses which exhibit partial to full resistance to treatment due to specific changes in the target enzymes resulting from the low fidelity of the reverse transcription process. In the absence of a successful vaccine to prevent HIV- 1 infection, various alternative approaches for inactivating the virus at different stages of the life cycle have been proposed and are being actively investigated. Here we propose antiviral agents “from within” the viral particle, targeted to interfere with the function of the virally encoded protease, preventing the production of infectious virus. We manipulated the virion associated protein Vpr to serve as a pseudosubstrate for protease processing, with hopes that natural substrates will be left unprocessed and virus will remain non-infectious. Likewise, we targeted the dimerization process of protease with other chimeric Vpr proteins, so as to prevent the production of an enzymatically active molecule. To provide proof of the principle, we have shown that viruses generated within the context of chimeric Vpr molecules showed varying levels of inhibition with a chimeric Vpr based on the capsid/p 2 cleavage site, 24 / 2, being 100 % effective in preventing the production of infectious virus in single and multiple round replication assays. The chimeric Vpr molecules containing cleavage sites were efficiently processed by protease, and along with the chimeric Vpr proteins generated to interfere with protease dimerization, still allowed for processing of the Gag polyproteins to occur. Furthermore, chimeric Vpr molecules were efficiently incorporated into wild-type virus in the presence of wild-type Vpr when expressed in stably expressing cell-lines. Here we demonstrate that in addition to conventional therapies used to combat HIV- 1 in infected individuals, the modifiedVpr protein may serve as an alternative therapeutic molecule in the treatment of HIV- 1. ...|$|R

During this decade, effective therapies aimed at continued suppression of HIV replication and targeted at resting HIV reservoirs such as brain, lymphatic systems will be critical to prolong survival and renewing hopes for a cure. Currently available antiHIV drugs can be classified into three categories: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Most of these drugs bear some significant drawbacks such as relatively short half-life, low bioavailability, poor permeability and undesirable side effects. Efforts have been made to design drug delivery systems for antiHIV agents to: a) reduce the dosing frequency, b) increase the bioavailability and decrease the degradation/metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract, c) improve the CNS penetration and inhibit the CNS efflux, and d) deliver them to the target cells selectively with minimal side effects. This article is an attempt to compile all major research work towards drug delivery for AIDS therapy and channel future attempts in the area of more effective controlled delivery of antiHIV agents...|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrovirus</b> that causes an infection within {{the immune system and}} can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) if not properly addressed. While this disease specifically attacks the immune system, it also affects other systems, such as the brain. One major relationship we will be investigating is between HIV status and the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) index, which includes race, sex and other biomarkers such as CD 4 count, viral load, hepatitis C infection, and hemoglobin. We hypothesize {{that there will be a}} strong correlation between the VACS index and frailty in those with HIV; we also predict there will be changes in cognition and brain volumes. Ninety-seven individuals between the ages of 50 and 77 completed neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. The mean age for males is 57. 2 (54 % AA) and females is 56. 11 (78 % AA). The mean years of education for men is 13. 8, and 12. 4 for women. Individuals were divided into 3 groups based on their severity of frailty (Non-Frail, Pre-Frail, and Frail (N= 19). In the present study, we propose to examine potential differences in neuropsychological scores and structural neuroimaging between these groups. Additionally, we will examine whether the VACS index is predictive of more severe frailty and worse cognitive outcomes and structural neuroimaging. Previous studies have shown that the VACS index is more predictive of mortality risks and frailty in older adults than HIV biomarkers alone. We plan to investigate if these indices are correlated to neuropsychological measures and neuroimaging...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrovirus</b> that infects cells of the immune system, destroying or impairing their function. As the infection progresses, the immune system becomes weaker, and the person becomes more susceptible to infections. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of  intervention training on knowledge and attitude of teachers about HIV/AIDS. Materials and Methods This quasi-experimental study, 11 cities were selected randomly cluster among 27 cities of Khorasan Razavi province- Iran. The study teachers were selected multi stage cluster sampling method; so, in the selected cities, randomly selected a number of 4 high schools of each cluster, and all the teachers of these schools {{were invited to participate}} in this research. At pre-test basic knowledge and attitude of teachers about HIV/AIDS were evaluated. Then their educational needs and curriculum were designed. Then 2 weeks after conducting the education, teacher's knowledge and attitude were evaluated (post-test). Results 1, 838 teachers with the mean age of 39. 81 + 6. 104 participated in this study. The mean score of their knowledge about HIV/AIDS rose from 11. 84 + 2. 116 to 12. 2 + 1. 450 after intervention. The mean score of their attitude about HIV/AIDS rose from 18. 07 + 4. 740 to 20. 64 + 4. 905 after intervention. The results showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between teachers’ knowledge and attitude before and after the training program (P= 0. 000). Conclusion According to the study it can be concluded teachers training to increase knowledge about HIV/AIDS and improve their attitude towards the disease AIDS...|$|E
