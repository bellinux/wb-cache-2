5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
25|$|A {{very fast}} bowler {{with the ability}} to cause {{problems}} even on docile pitches, Ted McDonald was the unexpected bowling sensation of the 1921 Australian tour to England. He and Jack Gregory caused something approaching panic among the England batsmen: John Evans' <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> allegedly knocking together when he went out to bat, and Andy Ducat was bowled when part of his bat, broken by McDonald's pace, hit the wicket. Where Gregory was able to swing the ball both ways, McDonald imparted vicious movement off the wicket. Like later fast bowling pairs, they were devastating in combination, taking 46 wickets in the series.|$|E
25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and {{the only}} sound heard from his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was terrified and fell to the ground.|$|E

25|$|During this stage, he is a {{said to have}} practised some {{technique}} of meditation that would seemingly help him control elements (called tattva) like fire and {{water out of the}} total 36 such elements enumerated in Kashmir Shaivism. He started the practice of blowing air at live charcoals in his fire pot (called kanger in local language) sometimes for hours together. He was found talking to and directing invisible people at times. Various parts of his body like his shoulders and <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> seen shuddering at times. He spiritually initiated a Sikh disciple who had come to see him from some other state and lived at his home for 3 months. He also initiated Pandit Maheshwar Nath Zutshi of Mallapore locality of Srinagar by offering him his pipe. He also started the practice of transfixing his gaze on water filled in a tumbler kept inside a brass basin filled with water. This brass basin was placed over an earthenware pot which too was filled with water. It was also during this time that majority of his miracles were recorded and people started flocking him, seeking solutions to their worldly problems. It was sometime during the period between 1946–56 that he came to be called as Bhagwan by his devotees. He regularly visited the shrines of the deities of Mata Sharika Bhagwati and Mata Ragnya Bhawani during this period. Sometime after 1957, on every Sunday afternoon, musical concerts were held at his place by known local musicians who would play local and Indian classical music for him. Some of the other shrines visited by him during the initial and final stages of his spiritual practice were Jwala Ji at Khrew, Bhadrakali at Handwara, Jyestha Bhagwati at Srinagar, Gupt Ganga near Nishat Bagh, Tushkaraja Bhairav at Srinagar and Amarnath.|$|E

500|$|Following their {{disastrous}} 1976 season, the Jets hired longtime assistant Walt Michaels {{as their}} new head coach. In the offseason, the team made the difficult decision to part ways with Joe Namath, {{who had become}} ineffective on the field. Although Namath's throwing abilities were unimpaired, his <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> so bad as to render him almost immobile; Paul Zimmerman of the New York Post dubbed him the [...] "million dollar statue". The team attempted to trade him but was unsuccessful. On May 12, 1977, Namath was cut from the roster. He signed with the Los Angeles Rams, but retired at season's end.|$|E

50|$|Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> injury {{term used}} in volleyball circles that {{describes}} the mechanism of the injury known as patella tendinopathy, patella tendinosis or patella tendonitis. Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> defined as a syndrome of tendon pain, localized tenderness and that is detrimental to an athletes performance. in the initial phase of the Jumper's knee injury the tendons with the <b>knee</b> <b>are</b> usually inflamed. If Jumper's knee becomes a chronic injury ,which usually occurs as age increases, the tendons show an increasing degree of degeneration and little to no inflation present. As the etiology and pathology of Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> not known the treatment varies and is largely based on a trial and error basis. Jumpers <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> said to occur after frequent actions involving quick accelerations and declarations, eccentric activities and quick cutting actions. As spiking involves jumping, in which a quick acceleration occurs when jumping and quick deceleration when landing, this action is a possible cause of Jumper's <b>knee.</b> Also blocking <b>is</b> a possible cause of Jumper's knee because it to involves jumping and landing quickly. However, Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> less common among athletes who compete in beach volleyball rather than those who play indoor volleyball. This is because beach volleyball is played on sand which reduces the impact of landing on the knee.|$|R
500|$|Namath did {{not start}} the January 1965 Orange Bowl, as he was nursing an injured knee. He came off the bench {{in the second quarter}} with Alabama down by two touchdowns, and led his team to within a foot of victory, falling short in a run on the game's final play. Despite the loss, he was voted the game's Most Valuable Player. The {{following}} day, Namath officially signed with New York for an unprecedented contract worth $427,000 over three years. The total included bonuses yet to be earned as well as a convertible given to Namath as a signing bonus. The Jets had been aware that Namath had knee problems, but when team doctor Nicholas examined Namath in the restroom at a party held to celebrate his signing, he told the quarterback that had he known Namath's <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> that bad, he would have advised Werblin not to sign him. The Jets scheduled Namath for surgery amid considerable public interest; the media asked to photograph the operation, but were refused permission. The Jets hedged their bets by signing three other quarterbacks for a total of $400,000, including Notre Dame quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte. There was an intense media spotlight on Namath, who became known for a playboy lifestyle; he was dubbed [...] "Broadway Joe".|$|E
2500|$|After the war Evans again {{played only}} occasionally, making two {{appearances}} for amateur Gentlemen sides in 1919 and playing in one match for Hampshire in 1920. In 1921 he scored 69 not out for MCC against the touring Australians {{and made a}} century in his first innings for Kent in May and was, {{on the strength of}} these performances, picked for the England team for the second Ashes Test at Lord's in June. Aged 32, this was Evans' only Test match. He scored 4 and 14 runs in his two innings and Wisden reported that the Test was [...] "perhaps rather too big for him." [...] Other reports suggested that he was [...] "so nervous that his <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> knocking together … his nerve had gone and the first straight ball did for him".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1991, {{researchers}} Dana M. Wegner and Colan Ratliff {{from the}} David Taylor Research Center and Kevin Lynaugh, from the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, published an exhaustive {{report on the}} question. Their research noted several key pieces of historical evidence that the two ships were not the same vessel. This included {{the fact that the}} timbers from the dismantled 1797 Constellation were auctioned off after the ship-breaking process ended in September 1853, the fact that the keel-laying for the 1854 ship had been done in June 1853, before the 1797 ship had been dismantled completely, and building records that meticulously accounted for each piece of timber that was used to build the new ship; in fact, only 204 oak <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> re-used, but these came from existing stocks, not the original vessel and they stated that, [...] "There was no evidence that any material was transferred directly from the old ship to the new." [...] In March 1989, they had come upon the builder's half-hull model of Constellation in the U.S. Naval Academy Museum. This was important because half-hull models are only built for new designs, not rebuilds, and the use of half-hull models was not introduced until after 1797. The authors conclude that this is definitive evidence that the vessel launched in 1854 was new, as it was [...] "impossible to accurately scale down the form of an existing ship to model format," [...] and that [...] "a new half model would not have been employed by Lenthall unless he was forging a fully new design." ...|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{shortly after}} World War II, a {{controversy}} arose {{over whether the}} 1854 sloop was a new ship or a rebuilt version of the 1797 frigate. Naval architect Howard I. Chapelle {{was one of the}} first people to raise the issue. In his book The History of the American Sailing Navy, published in 1949, he pointed out the differences in the hull dimensions of the 1797 Constellation and the 1854 Constellation as evidence that they were two different ships. He also stated that, [...] "Unfortunately, some of the semi-official lists of American naval ships have listed [...] as though she had, in fact, been preserved and altered. This has led to many believing the sloop-of-war, which is still in existence, to be the oldest ship in the Navy and to have had a continuous identity since 1797...the only reason her register was maintained, by means of an administrative fiction, was to enable the work to be done without the need of applying to Congress for authority and funds to build an entirely new ship." [...] Stephen Bockmiller and Lawrence Bopp agree with Chapelle, writing in USS Constellation: An Illustrated History, that [...] "working under the subterfuge of 'repairs,' the Navy actually began building a new ship about 900 yards from where the original Constellation was being dismantled. Thus, unwittingly, the Navy itself would originate the arguments about the authenticity of the Constellation. To further compound the argument, some salvageable timbers from the original ship, particularly the ship’s <b>knees,</b> <b>were</b> used in constructing the new vessel." ...|$|E

30|$|We further {{demonstrated}} {{that the rate of}} TT–TG change was significantly negatively correlated with length, weight, and BMI. In other words, the effect of <b>knee</b> angle <b>was</b> greater in smaller subjects. This finding is particularly relevant since patellar instability is common among adolescents. Our present data indicate a need to standardize the TT–TG measurement protocol to avoid overlooking pathology, especially in adolescents. We suggest that the <b>knee</b> should <b>be</b> fully extended for imaging. Moreover, quadriceps should be at rest as the muscle contraction may impact TT-TG measures. If the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> not fully extended this should be taken in account. Data in adults indicate that as the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> flexed the TG deviates laterally in relation to the starting point when the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> in extension (Iranpour et al. 2010). Rotation of the <b>knee</b> should <b>be</b> taken in account also. In the present study there was no problem to find out the groove because study subjects were healthy children, not patients with dysplasia.|$|R
