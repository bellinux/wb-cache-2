30|$|In {{the wake}} of this incident, the {{remainder}} of the second panel was abandoned. A new tailgate was driven for the third panel, leaving {{the remainder of the}} second panel as an <b>interpanel</b> barrier pillar protecting the third panel tailgate from abutment loads arising from the first panel. Subsequent panels were also developed with the <b>interpanel</b> barrier design, leaving solid pillars up to 180  m wide between adjoining panels. Two independent sets of two-entry yield pillar gates were driven for each new panel.|$|E
30|$|The {{experience}} at Mine A demonstrated both {{the advantages and}} limitations of the two Utah longwall pillar design techniques. While the yield pillar system used {{on the first two}} panels typically performs well at depths up 600  m or so, it concentrates the load on the tailgate corner of the longwall face, and this can make it unworkable at greater depths. After the <b>interpanel</b> barrier method was introduced at Mine A, it was adopted at several other Utah longwalls (Gilbride and Hardy 2004). In some cases, rather than leave a full barrier, these mines elected to make mid-panel moves around the area of deepest cover, thus providing a local <b>interpanel</b> barrier for the next panel (Maleki 2006).|$|E
30|$|The <b>interpanel</b> barrier {{effectively}} {{protects the}} tailgate {{corner from the}} influence of previous panels, but at greater depths the single-panel stresses on the longwall face reach the same levels as were present with abutment loads and yield pillars. This limitation led one major Utah operator to announce in 2008 that it would write off reserves at depths exceeding 900  m as unmineable (Foy 2008).|$|E
30|$|With {{respect to}} our second goal, {{we are not}} aware of any {{existing}} method for <b>interpanel</b> synchronization mismatch perception evaluation. ITU-R Recommendation BT. 500 - 11 [12] describes methods for the subjective assessment of the quality of television pictures. Also, ITU-R Recommendation BT. 710 - 4 [13] describes methods for subjective assessment for image quality in high-definition television. The above methods [12, 13] describe subjective evaluation which is conducted on a single display screen. The main distinctions of our proposed subjective evaluation method are the following. We describe a method for creation of a synchronization mismatch measurement test video set for particular tile configuration and for various <b>interpanel</b> synchronization mismatch values. This synchronization mismatch test video set allows performing synchronization mismatch perception evaluation for a target tiled system using a typical single-screen display (e.g., a 46 ′′ LCD display). That is, the tiled display is simulated on a single display panel. The method supports perceptual evaluation to correspond to a tiled display with or without tile bezels. The method creates a higher frame rate video from an original video for playback using a typical video player. The method uses a display which can provide higher frame rate playback, such as 120 [*]Hz display, since 60 [*]Hz (16.66 [*]ms) is too close to the human visual system threshold.|$|E
30|$|A new gateroad was {{developed}} in order to leave an additional 75  m <b>interpanel</b> barrier to isolate the D- 4 panel from the D- 3 panel. Mining had advanced approximately 400  m in the D- 4 panel, and the face was beneath almost 800  m of cover, when the largest burst yet, with M =  3.4, destroyed 4  ha of headgate pillars in by the face. Ventilation was again severely affected. Several weeks later, before the face could be recovered, a heating event developed in the gob. Ultimately the face was abandoned and the mine was sealed.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Examine the {{reproducibility}} of the RAND {{method for}} developing {{criteria for the}} appropriateness of medical procedures. Design: Comparison of two sets of explicit criteria for appropriateness of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy, developed by separate expert panels from two countries. Setting: United States, Switzerland. Study participants: National experts from different medical specialties involved in the referral or application of UGI endoscopy. Interventions: Each panel was presented with about 500 clinical scenarios (indications) that were rated on a nine-point scale as to the appropriateness of performing UGI endoscopy for a patient with that clinical presentation. Main outcome measurer: (1) distribution of appropriateness ratings and intrapanel agreement categories between the two panels, (2) between-panel agreement of assigning appropriateness for comparable indications and, (3) percentage of indications with major between-panel differences. Results: Ratings for 2 / 3 of indications could be compared. The Swiss panel showed higher intrapanel agreement (54. 6 % versus 46. 2 % p= 0. 002). Seventy-eight percent of comparable Indications were assigned to indentical categories of appropriateness by both panels (kappa= 0. 76,P < 0. 001). For 93 % of the 376 comparable indications, there were no major <b>interpanel</b> differences. Conclusion: Separate expert panels in different countries, using a standardized methodology, produce criteria for appropriatenesof medical procedures that are similar. Given the resources being invested throught the world in devilping criteria and guidelines, international collaboration in seeking optimal use of limited health care resources should be intensifled. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Glue {{laminated}} wood deck systems {{are commonly used}} for bridge decks on girder bridge systems. These decks are usually covered with a hot-mix asphalt wearing surface {{in conjunction with a}} bituminized fabric sheet waterproofing membrane. Often cracks occur in the asphalt at the intersection of two adjacent deck panels which limits the useful life of the wear surface, provides a poor riding surface and potentially allows moisture to flow to wooden bridge components. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the structural behavior of asphalt/wood/membrane deck systems. This was accomplished experimentally by determining the deflection of bridge deck panels with respect to each other under simulated truck loading. A classical linear analysis model and a finite element analysis model were developed for the deck panel deflections. These analytical results were compared to the experimental results and a value of approximately 0. 05 in for the <b>interpanel</b> differential deflection was determined to be a reasonable, conservative value for the typical configuration considered. This deflection was then used to load various asphalt/membrane/wood configurations to investigate the effectiveness of the arrangement with regards to resisting hot-mix asphalt cracking. It was found that when subjected to repeated deflections of 0. 05 in, the following experimental composite bridge deck performed best in terms of reduced cracking: 1) hot-mix asphalt base layer applied directly onto the glulam deck panel; 2) waterproofing membrane placed on the base layer of asphalt; 3) hot-mix asphalt surface layer placed on the waterproofing membrane. ii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|E
40|$|Protection against {{noise is}} one of the six {{essential}} requirements of the European Construction Product directive. In buildings, airborne sound insulation is used to define the acoustical quality between rooms. In order to develop wall structures with optimal sound insulation, an understanding of the physical origins of sound transmission is necessary. The purpose of this thesis was, firstly, to study and compare the validity of existing physical models to predict the sound insulation of wall structures, and, secondly, to study the benefits of the sound intensity measurement method for determining the sound insulation. To develop the kind of knowledge that is applicable to the improvement of real wall and door structures was the motive behind this study. Five main results are summarized in the following. 1. It was possible to measure wall structures with a considerably, up to 22 dB, higher sound reduction index with the intensity method than with the pressure method. Thus, the intensity method enables the determination of sound insulation in the presence of strong flanking where the pressure method gives only an underestimate. 2. The sound transmission through doors was modelled by two separate paths: a structural path through the door leaf and a leaking path through the door slits. The structural path was predicted using Sharp's model. The agreement with measurements was reasonably good except at high frequencies where overestimations were obtained. The leaking path was predicted using the model of Gomperts and Kihlman. The agreement with measurements was good for free apertures. 3. Thirteen existing prediction models of double panels were compared. The variations in predicted sound reduction indices were high, 20   [...] .   40  dB. Further work is needed to rank different models according to their reliability for practical structures. In addition, there is an obvious need to develop a hybrid model where all the important parameters are considered. 4. A new flanking mechanism could be observed in situ for a floating floor covering over a concrete slab. Identical floor structures in adjacent dwellings led to strong flanking transmission at the double panel resonance frequency of the floors. Strong flanking could be avoided by modifying the double structure in one dwelling. 5. In general, the most typical design fault of sound insulating double structures was strong mechanical connections, either in the form of rigid <b>interpanel</b> connections (studs) or in the form of bonded cavity absorbent (sandwich structures). In the case of door structures, efforts are usually wasted {{on the development of the}} structure, while the leak transmission may be the main transmission path. The results of this study are useful when the intensity method is used in the presence of strong flanking sound, the sound insulation of wall and door structures are predicted or improved and when prediction models are developed. reviewe...|$|E
