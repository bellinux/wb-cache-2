In addition, we compared both techniques for anal sphincter thickness and length measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with fecal incontinence underwent three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging. Images of both endoluminal techniques were evaluated for atrophy and defects of the external anal sphincter. External anal sphincter atrophy scoring with three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> depended on the distinction of the external anal sphincter and its reflectivity. External anal sphincter atrophy scoring with magnetic resonance imaging depended on the amount of muscle and the presence of fat replacement. Atrophy score was defined as none, moderate, and severe. A defect was defined at anal <b>endosonography</b> by a hypoechogenic zone and at magnetic resonance imaging as a discontinuity of the sphincteric ring and/or scar tissue. Differences between three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of external anal sphincter atrophy and defects were calculated. In addition, we compared external anal sphincter thickness and length measurements in three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included (median age, 58 years; range, 27 - 80; 15 women). Three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging did not significantly differ for the detection of external anal sphincter atrophy (P = 0. 25) and defects (P = 0. 38). Three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> demonstrated atrophy in 16 patients, magnetic resonance imaging detected atrophy in 13 patients. Three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> agreed with magnetic resonance imaging in 15 of 18 patients for the detection of external anal sphincter atrophy. Using the grading system, 8 of the 18 patients scored the same grade. Three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> detected seven external anal sphincter defects and magnetic resonance imaging detected ten. Three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging agreed on the detection of external anal sphincter defects in 13 of 18 patients. Comparison between three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging for sphincter thickness and length measurements showed no statistically significant concordance and had no correlation with external anal sphincter atrophy. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that shows that three-dimensional anal <b>endosonography</b> can be used for detecting external anal sphincter atrophy. Both endoanal techniques are comparable in detecting atrophy and defects of the external anal sphincter, although there is a substantial difference in grading of external anal sphincter atrophy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{clinical}} N 1 (cN 1) lung cancer based on imaging {{are at risk}} for malignant mediastinal nodal involvement (N 2 disease). <b>Endosonography</b> with a needle technique is suggested over surgical staging as a best fi rst test for preoperative invasive mediastinal staging. Th e addition of a confi rmatory mediastinoscopy seems questionable in patients with a normal mediastinum on imaging. Th is prospective multicenter trial investigated the sensitivity of preoperative linear <b>endosonography</b> and mediastinoscopy for mediastinal nodal staging of cN 1 lung cancer. METHODS: Consecutive patients with operable and resectable cN 1 non-small cell lung cancer underwent a lobe-specifi c mediastinal nodal staging by <b>endosonography.</b> Th e primary study outcome was sensitivity to detect N 2 disease. Th e secondary end points were the prevalence of N 2 disease, the negative predictive value (NPV) of both <b>endosonography</b> and <b>endosonography</b> with confi rmatory mediastinoscopy, and the number of patients needed to detect one additional N 2 disease with mediastinoscopy. RESULTS: Of the 100 patients with cN 1 on imaging, 24 patients were diagnosed with N 2 disease. Invasive mediastinal nodal staging with <b>endosonography</b> alone has a sensitivity of 38 %, which can be increased to 73 % by adding a mediastinoscopy. NPV was 81 % and 91 %, respectively.

Objective- To compare the endoscopic and <b>endosonography</b> findings in the differential diagnosis of the gastrointestinal bulging (subepithelial tumor or extrinsic compression). Method- Patients referred by <b>endosonography</b> with bulging of upper gastrointestinal tract were studied retrospectively. The size, location, consistency and presumptive diagnosis were recorded at time of endoscopy and <b>endosonography.</b> Endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration was proposed in case of uncertain diagnose to increase diagnostic sensitivity. Results- One hundred seventy-six patients (93 women) and mean age 62. 5 years (10 - 87). One hundred fifty-three had subepithelial tumor and 23 had extrinsic compression as a final diagnosis. <b>Endosonography</b> had sensitivity, specificity and accuracy higher than those found by endoscopy for both diagnosis subepithelial tumor and extrinsic compression. Endoscopy and <b>endosonography</b> showed poor concordance (K = 0. 13) for subepithelial tumor diagnosis and unsuitable agreement for diagnosis in extrinsic compression (K = 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{patients}} with lung cancer, <b>endosonography</b> {{has emerged as}} a minimally invasive method to obtain cytological proof of mediastinal lymph nodes, suspicious for metastases on imaging. In case of a negative result, it is currently recommended that a cervical mediastinoscopy be performed additionally. However, in daily practice, a second procedure is often regarded superfluous. The goal of our study was to assess the additional value of a cervical mediastinoscopy, after a negative result of <b>endosonography,</b> in routine clinical practice. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the records of 147 consecutive {{patients with}} an indication for mediastinal lymph node staging and a negative result of <b>endosonography</b> were analysed. As a subsequent procedure, 124 patients underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy and 23 patients were scheduled for an intended curative resection directly. The negative predictive value (NPV) for both diagnostic procedures was determined, as well as the number of patients who needed to undergo a mediastinoscopy to find one false-negative result of <b>endosonography</b> (number needed to treat (NNT)). Clinical data of patients with a false-negative <b>endosonography</b> were analysed. RESULTS: When using cervical mediastinoscopy as the gold standard, the NPV for <b>endosonography</b> was 88. 7 %, resulting in a NNT of 8. 8 patients. For patients with fluoro- 2 -deoxyglucose positron emission tomography positive mediastinal lymph nodes, the NNT was 6. 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the value of three-dimensional (3 D) <b>endosonography</b> for staging of rectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Transrectal ultrasound is the most sensitive technique for peroperative staging and follow-up of rectal cancer. Major limitations of this technique include the complexity of image interpretation and the inability to examine stenotic tumors or to identify recurrent rectal cancer. METHODS: Three-dimensional <b>endosonography</b> was performed in 100 patients with rectal tumors. Transrectal volume scans were obtained using a 3 D multiplane transducer (7. 5 / 10. 0 MHz). Stenotic tumors were examined with a 3 D frontfire transducer (5. 0 / 7. 5 MHz). The volume scans were processed and analyzed on a Combison 530 workstation (Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria). RESULTS: The 3 D <b>endosonography</b> and conventional <b>endosonography</b> were performed in 49 patients with nonstenotic rectal cancer. Display of volume data in three perpendicular planes or as 3 D view facilitated the interpretation of ultrasound images and enhanced the diagnostic information of the data. The accuracy of 3 D <b>endosonography</b> in the assessment of infiltration depth was 88 % compared to 82 % with the conventional technique. In the determination of lymph node involvement, 3 D and two-dimensional <b>endosonography</b> provided accuracy rates of 79 % and 74 %, respectively. The 3 D scanning allowed the visualization of obstructing tumors using reconstructed planes in front of the transducer. Correct assessment of the infiltration depth was possible in 15 of 21 patients with obstructing tumors (accuracy, 76 %). Three-dimensional <b>endosonography</b> displayed suspicious pararectal lesions in 30 patients. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was extremely precise (accuracy, 98 %) and showed malignancy in 10 of 30 patients. Histologic analysis changed the endosonographic diagnosis in 8 (27 %) of the patients.

Bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsies, the current diagnostic standard, has moderate sensitivity in assessing granulomas. <b>Endosonography</b> with intrathoracic nodal aspiration {{appears to be a}} promising diagnostic technique. To evaluate the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy vs <b>endosonography</b> in the diagnosis of stage I/II sarcoidosis. Randomized clinical multicenter trial (14 centers in 6 countries) between March 2009 and November 2011 of 304 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis (stage I/II) in whom tissue confirmation of noncaseating granulomas was indicated. Either bronchoscopy with transbronchial and endobronchial lung biopsies or <b>endosonography</b> (esophageal or endobronchial ultrasonography) with aspiration of intrathoracic lymph nodes. All patients also underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield for detecting noncaseating granulomas in patients with a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The diagnosis was based on final clinical judgment by the treating physician, according to all available information (including findings from initial bronchoscopy or <b>endosonography).</b> Secondary outcomes were the complication rate in both groups and sensitivity and specificity of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. A total of 149 patients were randomized to bronchoscopy and 155 to <b>endosonography.</b> Significantly more granulomas were detected at <b>endosonography</b> vs bronchoscopy (114 vs 72 patients; 74 % vs 48 %; P <. 001). Diagnostic yield to detect granulomas for <b>endosonography</b> was 80 % (95 % CI, 73 %- 86 %); for bronchoscopy, 53 % (95 % CI, 45 %- 61 %) (P <. 001).

A prospective, international, open-label, randomised controlled study, with a trial-based economic analysis. Four centres: Ghent University Hospital, Belgium; Leuven University Hospitals, Belgium; Leiden University Medical Centre, the Netherlands; and Papworth Hospital, UK. Inclusion criteria: known/suspected NSCLC, with suspected mediastinal lymph node involvement; otherwise eligible for surgery with curative intent; clinically fit for <b>endosonography</b> and surgery; and no evidence of metastatic disease. Exclusion criteria: previous lung cancer treatment; concurrent malignancy; uncorrected coagulopathy; and not suitable for surgical staging. Study patients were randomised to either surgical staging alone (n = 118) or <b>endosonography</b> followed by surgical staging if <b>endosonography</b> was negative (n = 123). <b>Endosonography</b> diagnostic strategy used endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration combined with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, followed by surgical staging if these tests were negative. Patients with no evidence of mediastinal metastases or tumour invasion were referred for surgery with curative intent. If evidence of malignancy was found, patients were referred for chemoradiotherapy. The main clinical outcomes were sensitivity (positive diagnostic test/nodal involvement during any diagnostic test or thoracotomy) and negative predictive value (NPV) of each diagnostic strategy for the detection of N 2 /N 3 metastases, unnecessary thoracotomy and complication rates. The primary economic outcome was cost-utility of the <b>endosonography</b> strategy compared with surgical staging alone, up to 6 months after randomisation, from a UK NHS perspective. Clinical and resource-use data were available for all 241 patients, and complete utilities were available for 144. Sensitivity for detecting N 2 /N 3 metastases was 79 % [41 / 52; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 66 % to 88 %] for the surgical arm compared with 94 % (62 / 66; 95 % CI 85 % to 98 %) for the <b>endosonography</b> strategy (p = 0. 02). Corresponding NPVs were 86 % (66 / 77; 95 % CI 76 % to 92 %) and 93 % (57 / 61; 95 % CI 84 % to 97 %; p = 0. 26). There were 21 / 118 (18 %) unnecessary thoracotomies in the surgical arm compared with 9 / 123 (7 %) in the <b>endosonography</b> arm (p = 0. 02). Complications occurred in 7 / 118 (6 %) in the surgical arm and 6 / 123 (5 %) in the <b>endosonography</b> arm (p = 0. 78) : one pneumothorax related to <b>endosonography</b> and 12 complications related to surgical staging. Patients in the <b>endosonography</b> arm had greater EQ- 5 D (European Quality of Life- 5 Dimensions) utility at the end of staging (0. 117; 95 % CI 0. 042 to 0. 192; p = 0. 003). There were no other significant differences in utility. The main difference in resource use was the number of thoracotomies: 66 % patients in the surgical arm compared with 53 % in the <b>endosonography</b> arm. Resource use was similar between the groups in all other items. The 6 -month cost of the <b>endosonography</b> strategy was £ 9713 (95 % CI £ 7209 to £ 13, 307) per patient versus £ 10, 459 (£ 7732 to £ 13, 890) for the surgical arm, mean difference £ 746 (95 % CI -£ 756 to £ 2494). The mean difference in quality-adjusted life-year was 0. 015 (95 % CI - 0. 023 to 0. 052) in favour of <b>endosonography,</b> so this strategy was cheaper and more effective. <b>Endosonography</b> (followed by surgical staging if negative) had higher sensitivity and NPVs, resulted in fewer unnecessary thoracotomies and better quality of life during staging, and was slightly more effective and less expensive than surgical staging alone. Future work could investigate the need for confirmatory mediastinoscopy following negative endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA or EBUS-TBNA separately and the delivery of both EUS-FNA or EBUS-TBNA by suitably trained chest physicians.

40|$|Brachytherapy and {{external}} irradiation combined are {{an alternative to}} surgery {{in the treatment of}} advanced esophageal cancer. <b>Endosonography</b> has proved to be an accurate method of staging the depth of tumor invasion of esophageal cancer. Sixty-three patients with inoperable esophageal cancer underwent <b>endosonography</b> followed by combined brachytherapy {{and external}} irradiation. Staging was incomplete in 31 of 63 patients because of tight stenosis or difficulty in imaging celiac lymph nodes. During follow-up of 23 patients, reduction of tumor thickness and lymph node abnormalities was observed in 16. The median survival was 10. 4 months. Survival time was correlated with initial number of metastatic lymph nodes found by <b>endosonography.</b> Paradoxically, the survival of patients with more extensive intra-luminal tumor growth was significantly better than survival of those with less tumor growth. In summary, the response to combined brachytherapy and external irradiation could accurately be assessed with <b>endosonography.</b> Lymph node abnormalities and tumor thickness were closely related to survival rat...|$|E
40|$|Esophageal {{tuberculosis}} is rare, and {{may result}} from the direct extension of tuberculosis infection from adjacent mediastinal lymph nodes. <b>Endosonography</b> {{can be used to}} evaluate heterogeneous or homogeneous hypoechoic masses in the esophageal wall, interruption of the esophageal adventitia, and mediastinal lymphadenitis. We admitted a 19 -year-old woman to our hospital because of weight loss and chest pain. Endoscopic observation revealed an esophageal submucosal mass and central ulceration with exudates. <b>Endosonography</b> showed a homogeneous hypoechoic mass with a destroyed esophageal wall layer, spot-like hyperechoic foci, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum.

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{identification}} of a bulging covered by normal epithelium is a common finding during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. OBJECTIVE: To compare the endoscopic and <b>endosonography</b> findings in the differential diagnosis of the gastrointestinal bulging (subepithelial tumor or extrinsic compression). METHOD: Patients referred by <b>endosonography</b> with bulging of upper gastrointestinal tract were studied retrospectively. The size, location, consistency and presumptive diagnosis were recorded at time of endoscopy and <b>endosonography.</b> Endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration was proposed in case of uncertain diagnose to increase diagnostic sensitivity. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six patients (93 women) and mean age 62. 5 years (10 - 87). One hundred fifty-three had subepithelial tumor and 23 had extrinsic compression as a final diagnosis. <b>Endosonography</b> had sensitivity, specificity and accuracy higher than those found by endoscopy for both diagnosis subepithelial tumor and extrinsic compression. Endoscopy and <b>endosonography</b> showed poor concordance (K = 0. 13) for subepithelial tumor diagnosis and unsuitable agreement for diagnosis in extrinsic compression (K = 0. 01). The endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 75 %, 72. 4 %, 80. 5 %, 65. 6 % and 74 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Endoscopy has high sensitivity and low specificity for subepithelial tumor and both are low for the extrinsic compression.

40|$|IMPORTANCE: Tissue {{verification}} of noncaseating granulomas {{is recommended for}} the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsies, the current diagnostic standard, has moderate sensitivity in assessing granulomas. <b>Endosonography</b> with intrathoracic nodal aspiration {{appears to be a}} promising diagnostic technique. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy vs <b>endosonography</b> in the diagnosis of stage I/II sarcoidosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized clinical multicenter trial (14 centers in 6 countries) between March 2009 and November 2011 of 304 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis (stage I/II) in whom tissue confirmation of noncaseating granulomas was indicated. INTERVENTIONS: Either bronchoscopy with transbronchial and endobronchial lung biopsies or <b>endosonography</b> (esophageal or endobronchial ultrasonography) with aspiration of intrathoracic lymph nodes. All patients also underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield for detecting noncaseating granulomas in patients with a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The diagnosis was based on final clinical judgment by the treating physician, according to all available information (including findings from initial bronchoscopy or <b>endosonography).</b> Secondary outcomes were the complication rate in both groups and sensitivity and specificity of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were randomized to bronchoscopy and 155 to <b>endosonography.</b> Significantly more granulomas were detected at <b>endosonography</b> vs bronchoscopy (114 vs 72 patients; 74 % vs 48 %; P <. 001). Diagnostic yield to detect granulomas for <b>endosonography</b> was 80 % (95 % CI, 73 %- 86 %); for bronchoscopy, 53 % (95 % CI, 45 %- 61 %) (P <. 001). Two serious adverse events occurred in the bronchoscopy group and 1 in the <b>endosonography</b> group; all patients recovered completely. Sensitivity of the bronchoalveolar lavage for sarcoidosis based on CD 4 /CD 8 ratio was 54 % (95 % CI, 46 %- 62 %) for flow cytometry and 24 % (95 % CI, 16 %- 34 %) for cytospin analysis. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with suspected stage I/II pulmonary sarcoidosis undergoing tissue confirmation, the use of endosonographic nodal aspiration compared with bronchoscopic biopsy resulted in greater diagnostic yield.

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{evaluate}} the relative accuracy of digital examination, anal <b>endosonography,</b> and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for preoperative assessment of fistula in ano by comparison to an outcome-derived reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethical committee approval and informed consent were obtained. A total of 104 {{patients who were}} suspected of having fistula in ano underwent preoperative digital examination, 10 -MHz anal <b>endosonography,</b> and body-coil MR imaging. Fistula classification was determined with each modality, with reviewers blinded to findings of other assessments. For fistula classification, an outcome-derived reference standard {{was based on a}} combination of subsequent surgical and MR imaging findings and clinical outcome after surgery. The proportion of patients correctly classified and agreement between the preoperative assessment and reference standard were determined with trend tests and kappa statistics, respectively. RESULTS: There was a significant linear trend (P <. 001) in the proportion of fistula tracks (n = 108) correctly classified with each modality, as follows: clinical examination, 66 (61 %) patients; <b>endosonography,</b> 87 (81 %) patients; MR imaging, 97 (90 %) patients. Similar trends were found for the correct anatomic classification of abscesses (P <. 001), horseshoe extensions (P =. 003), and internal openings (n = 99, P <. 001); <b>endosonography</b> was used to correctly identify the internal opening in 90 (91 %) patients versus 96 (97 %) patients with MR imaging. Agreement between the outcome-derived reference standard and digital examination, <b>endosonography,</b> and MR imaging for classification of the primary track was fair (kappa = 0. 38), good (kappa = 0. 68), and very good (kappa = 0. 84), respectively, and fair (kappa = 0. 29), good (kappa = 0. 64), and very good (kappa = 0. 88), respectively, for classification of abscesses and horseshoe extensions combined.

40|$|<b>Endosonography</b> was {{performed}} preoperatively in 33 patients with {{common bile duct}} carcinoma and in 43 patients with carcinoma of the common hepatic duct and its bifurcation. The results were correlated with the histology of resected specimens {{according to the new}} (1987) TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification. <b>Endosonography</b> was accurate in the evaluation of the depth of tumor infiltration. Overall accuracy for common bile duct carcinoma and common hepatic duct carcinoma was 82. 8 % and 85 %, respectively. <b>Endosonography</b> was helpful in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases but not accurate in diagnosing nonmetastatic lymph nodes. With common bile duct carcinoma, the incidence of lymph node metastasis increased with progressive depth of tumor infiltration. No such correlation was found in common hepatic duct carcinomas.
