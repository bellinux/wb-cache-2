Now, I may have been wrong on this front, but it wasn't what I imagined, or really what I think was described in the script. The line of description called for Logan to [...] "devour" [...] Veronica. I wanted it to be—I don't know if sexual <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> but—hungry, or a release, or mixed with some self-loathing and confusion. Instead, it came off as singularly romantic." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> then?" [...] {{asked the}} captain with {{affected}} sternness, for, although by nature disinclined {{to admit that}} he could be wrong, he had no objection to be put right by Minnie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said firmly, [...] "I trust you," [...] and {{the words}} that had been so {{difficult}} to say <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words.</b> He had no more doubt of it.|$|R
50|$|No {{trace of}} author {{identity}} remains. Author {{may not even}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> for stories that likely grew gradually—woven around racial, tribal, or even family history, {{and in some cases}} around incidents of early Celtic mythology. This process formed stories that were told and retold, burnished and added to by professional poets and saga-tellers.|$|R
5000|$|Farnham {{toured the}} album nationally in October and November 2011 in {{intimate}} venues and smaller audiences [...] Patrick McDonald of Adelaide Now {{said of the}} tour, [...] "Magic <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> For all <b>the</b> flack he cops about endless comebacks, it would truly be a crime if [...] "The Voice" [...] was ever silenced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{have given}} a very good account of you,’ said she, ‘which I hope you may justify. I told them there was nothing against you beyond {{the fact that you}} were put to the haw (if that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word)</b> for debt.’ ...|$|E
60|$|STEVE. 'Oh, very well.' First {{he thinks}} there is {{something}} innocent about her request, and then he wonders if 'innocent' <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> 'Well, your business, please?' he demands, like {{the man of the}} world he hopes some day to be.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have given}} a very good account of you," [...] said she, [...] "which I hope you may justify. I told them there was nothing against you beyond {{the fact that you}} were put to the horn (if that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word)</b> for debt." ...|$|E
5000|$|Aaron Sorkin {{explained}} that the Latin monologue in <b>the</b> National Cathedral <b>was</b> written in <b>the</b> language {{in order to avoid}} censorship by network NBC. NBC initially refused to allow a line where Mrs. Landingham describes the President's father as a [...] "prick". Sorkin explained its use: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> and <b>the</b> slightly startling nature of it was really what you needed.".|$|R
50|$|Sense and {{response}} would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words</b> to describe <b>the</b> principle behind the digital particle accelerator. Instead of radio-frequency cavities, a digital accelerator ring {{is equipped with}} devices called induction accelerating cells. Particles travel around the ring in a form of a bunch. When a charged particle bunch passes a beam sensor, the system picks up the signals and calculates the timing to generate the pulse voltage required to accelerate the bunch, and then produces the pulse voltage energizing a transformer.|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” {{said the}} girl. “I {{know what you}} mean, but morbid <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> Your uncle <b>is</b> now and then pedantic but one could only feel respect for him to‐day.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mad <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word!</b> I {{look back}} at my own infatuation--and I can't account for it; I can't {{understand}} myself. What was there in you," [...] she asked, with an outbreak of contemptuous surprise, [...] "to attract such a woman as I am?" ...|$|E
60|$|Even as I thought thus a {{voice in}} my heart seemed to echo that poor girl's words--because it is your duty--and to add others to them--woe betide him who neglects his duty. I was {{appointed}} to try to hook a few fish out of the vast kettle of human woe, and therefore I must go on hooking. Meanwhile this particular problem seemed beyond me. Perhaps Fate would help, I reflected. As a matter of fact, in the end Fate did, if Fate <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> to use in this connection.|$|E
6000|$|She {{proceeded}} to develop her theme, speaking in ringing, enthusiastic tones, {{as if she}} loved the topic. Jeeves could tell you the word I want. I think it's [...] "ecstatic", unless that's the sort of rash you get on your face and have to use ointment for. But if that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> then that's what her manner was as she ventilated the subject of poor old Tuppy. If you {{had been able to}} go simply by the sound of her voice, she might have been a court poet cutting loose about an Oriental monarch, or Gussie Fink-Nottle describing his last consignment of newts.|$|E
5000|$|The most astounding {{thing is}} how Wolfgang Herrndorf {{is able to}} get onto a level with his heroes, how he speaks their language, even if it’s that of two {{pubescent}} teenagers …, without it being invasive or embarrassing. The dialogue works because Maik <b>is</b> <b>the</b> compelling young narrator who the author, despite being more knowledgeable and having more life experience, never interferes with. ‘Authentic’ would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> if it didn’t disguise the fact that Herrndorf is a great stylist and a genius with words. Die Zeit ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{offensive}} {{to me to}} say that Sir James could think I was fond of him. Besides, it <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> for <b>the</b> feeling I must have towards the man I would accept as a husband." ...|$|R
5000|$|Addressing {{the use of}} nigger {{by black}} people, philosopher and public {{intellectual}} Cornel West said in 2007, [...] "There's a certain rhythmic seduction to the word. If you speak in a sentence, {{and you have to}} say cat, companion, or friend, as opposed to nigger, then <b>the</b> rhythmic presentation <b>is</b> off. That rhythmic language is a form of historical memory for black people... When Richard Pryor came back from Africa, and decided to stop using the word onstage, he would sometimes start to slip up, because he was so used to speaking that way. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> at <b>the</b> moment to keep the rhythm together in his sentence making." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The truth, which I am sure {{it would}} be wrong to hide from you, Arbuthnot," [...] said the former to me one day, [...] "is that during your long illness I fell in love, I suppose that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> with the Glittering Lady. After {{thinking}} the matter over also, I conceived that it would be proper to tell her so if only to clear the air and prevent future misunderstandings. As I remarked to her on that occasion, I had hesitated long, as I was not certain how she would fill the place of the wife of the incumbent of an English parish." ...|$|E
60|$|Every one {{has read}} the monograph, I believe that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> of my dear friend, Professor Higgs--Ptolemy Higgs {{to give him}} his full name--descriptive of the {{tableland}} of Mur in North Central Africa, of the ancient underground city in the mountains which surrounded it, and of the strange tribe of Abyssinian Jews, or rather their mixed descendants, by whom it is, or was, inhabited. I say every one advisedly, for although the public which studies such works is usually select, that which will {{take an interest in}} them, if the character of a learned and pugnacious personage is concerned, is very wide indeed. Not to mince matters, I may as well explain what I mean at once.|$|E
60|$|So then, {{the little}} English King, by his representative, {{formally}} delivered Joan {{into the hands}} of the court, but with this reservation: if the court failed to condemn her, he was to have her back again! Ah, dear, what chance was there for that forsaken and friendless child? Friendless, indeed--it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> For she was in a black dungeon, with half a dozen brutal common soldiers keeping guard night and day in the room where her cage was--for she was in a cage; an iron cage, and chained to her bed by neck and hands and feet. Never a person near her whom she had ever seen before; never a woman at all. Yes, this was, indeed, friendlessness.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} Northampton Repertory Theatre, in 1951, Hamilton put on a {{production}} of The Romantic Young Lady at the Kettering Savoy, starring Jean Charlesworth, Peter Bell and Ronald Radd. Glyn Idris Jones said that he <b>was</b> [...] "not <b>the</b> most brilliant of directors but a delightfully pleasant man and, competent, I suppose, would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> Even if they lacked imagination, his productions were clean, professional, and at least he didn't always abide by French's acting editions." [...] Upon the resignation of John Ellin as {{general manager of the}} Northampton Repertory Theatre in May 1954, Hamilton assumed his position, having already become acting director of productions of the theatre company at the time.|$|R
50|$|In {{some social}} {{situations}} Greeks can react negatively or <b>be</b> offended if <b>the</b> word Γραικός (Greek) {{is used in}} a situation where in the modern Greek language the word Έλληνας (Hellene) <b>is</b> considered <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> to use.http://pheidias.antibaro.gr/Hellas_names/Diamantopoulos.html Both words have a positive meaning in the Greek language if they <b>are</b> used in <b>the</b> preferred context.|$|R
5000|$|MacLeod {{published}} {{only one}} novel {{and fewer than}} 20 short stories during his lifetime. Writing in longhand, he worked slowly refining his sentences until he found what he felt <b>were</b> just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>words.</b> [...] "I write a single sentence at a time," [...] he once told an interviewer, [...] "and then I read it aloud." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are as well able {{to judge}} as I am," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{think that it}} would perhaps {{be the best way to}} write down the twenty names and put them in a hat, and draw them one by one. The first five should be number one squad. I don't know whether that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> but anyhow it will do for them. The next five number two, and so on. Then each five can vote whether they would prefer {{alternate}} commands, or to choose one of their number as permanent non-commissioned officer. If they prefer this, they must then ballot as to which among them shall be leader. If you can think of any way that you would like better, by all means say so." ...|$|E
60|$|Lastly, the fortifications in the {{mountain}} pass required unceasing labour and attention. This was the task of Ragnall, who fortunately in his youth, before he succeeded unexpectedly to the title, was for some years {{an officer in the}} Royal Engineers and therefore thoroughly understood that business. Indeed he understood it rather too well, since the result of his somewhat complicated and scientific scheme of defence was a little confusing to the simple native mind. However, with the assistance of all the priests and of all the women and children who were not engaged in provisioning the Mount, he built wall after wall and redoubt after redoubt, if that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> {{to say nothing of the}} shelter trenches he dug and many pitfalls, furnished at the bottom with sharp stakes, which he hollowed out wherever the soil could be easily moved, to discomfit a charging enemy.|$|E
6000|$|The real Colonel Sellers, as I {{knew him}} in James Lampton, was a pathetic and {{beautiful}} spirit, a manly man, a straight and honorable man, {{a man with}} a big, foolish, unselfish heart in his bosom, a man born to be loved; and he was loved by all his friends, and by his family worshipped. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> To them he was but little less than a god. The real Colonel Sellers was never on the stage. Only half of him was there. Raymond could not play the other half of him; it was above his level. That half was made up of qualities of which Raymond was wholly destitute. For Raymond was not a manly man, he was not an honorable man nor an honest one, he was empty and selfish and vulgar and ignorant and silly, and there was a vacancy in him where his heart should have been. There was only one man who could have played the whole of Colonel Sellers, and that was Frank Mayo.[3] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Content <b>is</b> {{scarcely}} <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> for it," [...] {{he assured}} her, [...] "If it weren't so still and serene up here, I'd be riotously happy. There are {{reasons for this}} {{quite apart from the}} scenery; for one, it's remarkably pleasant to feel that I need do nothing but what I like during the next few months." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Seppi Wohlmeyer. He {{had felt}} his blood leap and his spirits {{rise in a}} way that could mean only one thing, and he knew Satan was near, {{although}} it was too dark to see him. He came to us, and we walked along together, and Seppi poured out his gladness like water. It {{was as if he were}} a lover and had found his sweetheart who had been lost. Seppi was a smart and animated boy, and had enthusiasm and expression, and was a contrast to Nikolaus and me. He <b>was</b> full of <b>the</b> last new mystery, now--the disappearance of Hans Oppert, the village loafer. People were beginning to be curious about it, he said. He did not say anxious--curious <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> and strong enough. No one had seen Hans for a couple of days.|$|R
6000|$|... 2. ...it cannot {{arise from}} reasoning, etc. (Note on 7 135.) The editio princeps (1813) has {{conviction}} for reasoning here--an obvious error of the press, overlooked by Mrs. Shelley in 1839, and perpetuated in his several {{editions of the}} poems by Mr. H. Buxton Forman. Reasoning, Mr. W.M. Rossetti's conjectural emendation, <b>is</b> manifestly <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> here, and has been adopted by Dowden and Woodberry.|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR SIR,--I {{found your}} letter {{an hour ago}} among some others which had lain {{forgotten}} a couple of weeks, and I at once stole time enough to read Ariadne. Stole <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> for the summer [...] "Vacation" [...] is the only chance I get for work; so, no minute subtracted from work is borrowed, it is stolen. But this time I do not repent. As a rule, people don't send me books which I can thank them for, and so I say nothing--which looks uncourteous. But I thank you. Ariadne is a beautiful and satisfying story; and true, too--which is {{the best part of}} a story; or indeed of any other thing. Even liars have to admit that, if they are intelligent liars; I mean in their private [the word conscientious written but erased] intervals. (I struck that word out because a man's private thought can never be a lie; what he thinks, is to him the truth, always; what he speaks--but these be platitudes.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "James Walker" [...] {{drew a deep}} sigh--evidently a sigh of relief--and said nothing; but {{his eyes}} lost {{something}} of their wildness, his countenance cleared visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. [...] "Old" [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> and a pity, too; old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime {{in the matter of}} years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to disconnect the idea of ships' anchors {{from the idea of}} the ship's chief mate--the man who sees them go down clear and come up sometimes foul; because not even the most unremitting care can always prevent a ship, swinging to winds and tide, from taking an awkward turn of the cable round stock or fluke. Then the business of [...] "getting the anchor" [...] and securing it afterwards is unduly prolonged, and made a weariness to the chief mate. He is the man who watches the growth of the cable--a sailor's phrase which has all the force, precision, and imagery of technical language that, created by simple men with keen eyes for the real aspect of the things they see in their trade, achieves the just expression seizing upon the essential, which is the ambition of the artist in words. Therefore the sailor will never say, [...] "cast anchor," [...] and the ship-master aft will hail his chief mate on the forecastle in impressionistic phrase: [...] "How does the cable grow?" [...] Because [...] "grow" [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> for the long drift of a cable emerging aslant under the strain, taut as a bow-string above the water. And it is the voice of the keeper of the ship's anchors that will answer: [...] "Grows right ahead, sir," [...] or [...] "Broad on the bow," [...] or whatever concise and deferential shout will fit the case.|$|E
5000|$|Guitarist/vocalist Mark Jansen explains: [...] "I {{have been}} {{listening}} to our new album and I can't get enough of it! It sounds more modern, but with all typical Epica elements inside. Refreshing might <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> This album has also <b>been</b> <b>the</b> result of a real group effort. It was great to see everyone being so motivated to create our best album! Even though <b>the</b> sound <b>is</b> more heavy (<b>the</b> guitars, bass and drums sound so brutal!!!), it's still a very catchy album as well. Some old influences from our earliest work, some references to Design Your Universe and some new elements." [...] The band further commented: [...] "Where Retrospect reflected on {{the first decade of}} our career, we’d like to think The Quantum Enigma marks {{the beginning of a new}} era, where Epica sounds heavy, modern and without compromises! Every detail finds its way into a perfectly balanced mix, and makes Epica sound raw and overwhelming." ...|$|R
6000|$|It will be {{seen from}} his tone that Mr. Gladstone, in all the embarrassments arising from this source, showed {{complete}} freedom from personal irritation. Like the lofty-minded man he was, he imputed no low motives to a colleague because the colleague gave him trouble. He recognised by now that in his cabinet <b>the</b> battle <b>was</b> being fought between old time and new. He did not allow his dislike {{of some of the}} new methods of forming public opinion, to prevent him from doing full justice to the energetic and sincere public spirit behind them. He had, moreover, quite enough to do with (M68) the demands of the present, apart from signs that <b>were</b> ominous for <b>the</b> future. A year before, in a letter to Lord Granville (March 24, 1884), he had attempted a definition that will, perhaps, be of general interest to politicians of either party complexion. It is, at any rate, characteristic of his subtlety, if that <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> in drawing distinctions:— ...|$|R
6000|$|Our mouths came open to answer, but stood {{so for a}} moment, {{because we}} couldn't say [...] "Nobody," [...] for it wouldn't <b>be</b> true, and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> didn't seem to come; then I thought of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> one, and said it: ...|$|R
