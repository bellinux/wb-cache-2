5|$|Prime Minister Petr Nečas defended Drobil, {{and called}} Michálek untrustworthy despite his public {{reputation}} as a whistleblower. Since the Civic Democrats vowed to fight corruption, losing its first minister to corruption charges was {{a blow to the}} party's standing. The Drobil incident was the first of several high-profile resignations. On December 21, 2010, Czech Police Chief Oldrich Martinu resigned after Interior Minister Radek John's month-long call for his ouster in part due to the Drobil case's mishandling. Michálek returned to the State <b>Environmental</b> <b>Fund</b> as a financial analyst in 2011. The Drobil case is on indefinite hiatus for a lack of evidence as of September 2012. As of February 2013, the case against Knetig is on a similar hiatus for insufficient evidence.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{specific}} environmental projects with international support, {{the most important}} was the National Environmental Plan (Plano Nacional do Meio Ambiente—PNMA), which received a US$117 million loan from the World Bank. The National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Fund</b> (Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente—FNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteção das Florestas Tropicais do Brasil—PPG-7) {{was supported by the}} world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondônia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the overall}} water use in Morocco, {{reclaimed}} water can only provide {{a fraction of the}} country's increasing water needs. Furthermore, there is no regulatory framework for water reuse and no established system to recover the costs for reclaimed water from users. The country's largest reuse project is currently under construction in Marrakech, where reclaimed water from a 90,000 m3/day plant will be reused primarily to irrigate golf courses. The tertiary treatment and the network to distribute the reclaimed water will be financed by private investors. Redal, the utility serving Rabat, was carrying out a study in 2009 to assess the feasibility of wastewater reuse to irrigate green spaces in the city. Besides this {{there have been a few}} scattered small-scale pilot reuse projects since the 1980s, some of which have been abandoned. Among the sustainable projects is a project to irrigate golf courses in Ben Slimane that has been operating since 1997 with a capacity of 5,600 cubic meter/day. In 2009 a large reuse project was planned in Agadir to irrigate a golf course and municipal gardens with 50,000 cubic meters/day. In 2009 there were also two projects for direct, planned reuse in agriculture in Oujda and Beni Mellal. These projects are financed by the National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Fund</b> and would add a tertia2bb03c3e1; centralauth_Session=1reatment plants.

Based on a secretly audiotaped conversation, Michálek also alleged that Martin Knetig, an advisor to environmental minister Pavel Drobil, asked him to manipulate the tender to fund his party (the Civic Democrats) and Drobil's political career. Michálek recorded his subsequent conversation with Drobil, who allegedly offered his deputy position for the destruction of the tapes. Upon the story's publication, Drobil fired Michálek and Knetig, denied any wrongdoing, and resigned a day later.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{investment}} {{is supported by}} individuals, organizations and countries. Each of these three levels of support contributes to <b>environmental</b> investment <b>funding</b> in various ways. Individuals pay taxes and make donations to environmental projects. Organizations develop strategic plans which minimize {{the damage to the}} environment and/or attempt to restore the environment to its previous state. Foreign countries attempt to negotiate with organizations and governments which are environmentally conscious. The concern, however, is over how these funds are invested and which groups are the most effective at utilizing <b>environmental</b> <b>funding.</b> It is suggested that there is a positive correlation between the status of a country and the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>funding.</b> The status of a country is defined as less developed (LDC), newly industrialized (NIC) and highly developed (HDC). Use of <b>environmental</b> <b>funding</b> refers to the means by which the funding is allocated and the percentage of funding that is applied to its intended recipient. The problem with allocation and usage arises when there is a failure to control the allocation of funds, misuse of funds, corrupt government officials and fraud. Fraud and funding abuse can be minimized by a number of applications. Criminal investigations and tighter control over environmental spending is one method to ensure the protection and restoration of the environment. The solution to <b>environmental</b> <b>funding</b> fraud lies, in part, in the appropriate use of financial support from the World Bank, the International Monetary <b>Fund,</b> and other <b>environmental</b> lending agencies that advocate the principals of environmental protection, clean water supplies and sanitation. The question arises concerning environmental investment or third world fraud. It is hypothesized that misappropriation of <b>environmental</b> <b>funding</b> increases with the decrease in the status of a country. That is, misappropriation of funds is greater in LDCs than HDCs. Conversely, it is hypothesized that a better appropriation of <b>environmental</b> <b>funding</b> increases with the increase in the status of a country. That is, misappropriation of funds is less in HDCs than LDCs...|$|R

The facility, which is open six days a week, has a public lending library and cafe with free Wi-Fi access, IT suites and conference facilities. The office space is used by Cullompton Adult Community Learning which was previously based at the local secondary school. Cullompton Adult Community Learning is run by Devon County Council and offers a range of courses for adult learners ranging from Indian Head Massage to French for Beginners. Courses are run in the Hayridge's learning suites on the first floor. [...] The second major project completed in 2011 was the Cullompton Community centre, which opened in December.

2500|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, environmental regulation is largely unchanged in Turkmenistan. The new government created the Ministry of Natural Resources Use and Environmental Protection in July 1992, with departments responsible for environmental protection, protection of flora and fauna, forestry, hydrometeorology, and administrative planning. Like other CIS republics, Turkmenistan has established an <b>Environmental</b> <b>Fund</b> based on revenues collected from environmental fines, but the fines generally are too low to accumulate significant revenue. Thanks to the former Soviet system of game preserves and the efforts of the Society for Nature Conservation and the Academy of Sciences, flora and fauna receive some protection in the republic; however, [...] "hard-currency hunts" [...] by wealthy Western and Arab businesspeople already are depleting animals on preserves.|$|E
40|$|In many {{countries}} with economies undergoing {{transition to a}} market economy, environmental expenditures seem {{to be less than}} optimal. The standard explanation by environmental economists and environmental policy analysts is that of government failures to provide environmental public goods or to correct market imperfections related to environmental externalities. These arguments often appear to hold, however,. part of the problem may also be that public institutions managing environmental expenditure may attract less resources if they do not corroborate with the acknowledged standards of sound public finance. The focus of the paper is on public, domestic institutions managing environmental investment expenditures in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the New Independent States (NIS). Special attention is paid to autonomous, public <b>environmental</b> <b>funds</b> due to their distinctive role played in the management of public environmental expenditures in these countries.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{comparative analysis}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>funds</b> in Belarus and the Republic of Moldova {{based on the}} results of the Environmental Performance Reviews of the two countries. <b>Environmental</b> <b>Funds</b> in the two countries have a very different structure of their revenues. In Belarus, majority of revenues come from the pollution charges. In the Republic of Moldova, pollution charges constitute only a small part of the total revenues of the Fund, while tax on imported fuel and the tax on environmentally harmful products are the main sources. Expenditures from the funds in the two countries suffer from similar problems. Among those are lack of clear priorities, insufficient transparency of the process of project selection, frequent absence of assessment of the environmental and other benefits of accomplished projects and their cost-effectiveness. Insufficient capacity of the management staff of the funds, particularly at the local level, is one of the main reasons for these problems. However, <b>environmental</b> <b>funds</b> play important role in solving environmental problems. The paper outlines recommendations for their improvement in both countries using both international and domestic experience. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>funds</b> {{have become}} popular in {{developing}} and transition economies {{as a way of}} channeling money into environmental programs when access to financing for such activities is limited.

Despite their appeal, environ-mental funds do not solve underlying problems; they are most useful as transitional measures that provide resources for some environmental improvement while stronger environmental policies and regulatory struc-tures are being put in place.
