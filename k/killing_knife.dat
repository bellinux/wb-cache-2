For example describing what major forces exist and how they have developed over the last twenty years, how the farm raised and feral venison industries has evolved in that time and to give particular attention to what factors have contributed to venison returns from 2000 to today...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} a {{slaughterhouse}} in Khartoum State to assess the meat hygiene practices. Ten critical control points were selected in a cattle slaughter line.

A total of 908 isolates were detected, and the main Gram positive bacteria isolates were Staphylococcus caseolyticus (38. 4 %) Staph. capare (4. 2 %), Staph. epidermidis (4. 9 %), Staph. cohnii(0. 22 %), Staph. schleiferi (0. 11 %), Streptococcus pyogenus (3. 99 %), Micrococcus kristinae (11. 09 %), Micrococcus varians(8. 65 %), Bacillus cereus (4. 99 %), Bacillus firmus (0. 22 %), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (0. 89 %), Aerococcus (22. 51 %), Anaerobic cocci (0. 44 %), Kurthia gibsonii (0. 11 %).

The highest level of contamination was in the air of cattle slaughter hall (251 isolates) and meat before wash (168 isolates) and beef splitting saw (110 isolates). The lowest level of contamination occurred in <b>killing</b> <b>knives</b> (19 isolates) and refrigerated meat (22 isolates). The most predominant organism isolated was the Staphylococcus sp.
