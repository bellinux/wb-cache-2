25|$|At current state, the Internet {{provides}} a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction {{has resulted in}} English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs, minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways. For example, users attempting to learn the minority language may opt to read and understand {{about it in a}} majority language and stop there, resulting in a loss instead of gain in the potential speakers of the minority language. Also, speakers of minority languages may be encouraged to learn the more common languages that are being used on the Web in order to gain access to more resources, and in turn leading to a decline in their usage of their own language. The future of endangered minority languages in view of the spread of Internet remains to be observed.|$|E

Washington and Others" [...] in The Souls of Black Folk. Later in life, Du Bois regretted having been critical of Washington in those essays. One of the contrasts between the two leaders was their approach to education: Washington felt that African-American schools should focus primarily on industrial education topics such as agricultural and mechanical skills, to prepare southern blacks for the opportunities {{in the rural areas}} where most lived. Du Bois felt that black schools should focus more on liberal arts and academic curriculum (including the classics, arts, and humanities), because liberal arts were required to develop a leadership elite. However, as sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and economists Gunnar Myrdal and Thomas Sowell have argued, such disagreement over education was a minor point of difference between Washington and Du Bois; both men acknowledged the importance of the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> that the other emphasized. Sowell has also argued that, despite genuine disagreements between the two leaders, the supposed animosity between Washington and Du Bois actually formed among their followers, not between Washington and Du Bois themselves. Du Bois himself also made this observation in an interview published in The Atlantic Monthly in November 1965.|$|E

500|$|A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{unveiled}} the government's plans in his Queen's Speech. The plans included the duty {{for parents to}} assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation in some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> or training until the school {{year in which the}} child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the many}} poems that explore this idea—among them Keats's and the works by his contemporaries—Keats begins by {{questioning}} suffering, breaks {{it down to}} its most basic elements of cause and effect, and draws conclusions about the world. His own process is filled with doubt, but his poems end with a hopeful message that the narrator (himself) is finally free of desires for Love, Ambition, and Poesy. The hope contained within [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] is found within the vision he expresses in the last stanza: [...] "I yet have visions for the night/And for the day faint visions there is store." [...] Consequently, in her analysis of The Odes of John Keats, Helen Vendler suggests that [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] is a seminal poem constructed with themes and images that appeared more influential in his other, sometimes later, poems. The ode is an early and entirely original work that establishes the basis of Keats's notion of soul making, a method by which the individual builds his or her soul through a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> consisting of suffering and personal experience. This is a fundamental preoccupation of the Romantics, who believed the way to reconcile man and nature was through this soul development, education—the combination of experience and contemplation—and that only this process, not the rationality of the previous century, would bring about true Enlightenment.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} of trends in the current US system <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> as informed by historical movements for autonomous education {{in the period of}} Reconstruction and in the 1960 s and 70 s. The driving questions of the dissertation are 1. How to understand the system <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in the US as having a historical and current role in the preservation of an existing structure of power, 2. How did historical movements that focused on the creation <b>of</b> autonomous <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> challenge the given order of society?, and 3. What would a renewal of movement for autonomous education look like in the current moment? I examine historical, theoretical and literary texts in my analysis of the role <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in US society. My theoretical framework for the dissertation comes from the collective work of El Kilombo Intergaláctico, an organization in Durham, North Carolina, and the work of Alvaro Reyes on the crisis of capitalist society and Blackness as a political alternative. In my historical and literary research, I focus particularly on educational policy documents that demonstrate the ways in which movements for autonomous education shaped state education, and literary texts that share a vision <b>of</b> collective autonomous <b>education</b> in the US in a way that both recalls past movements and gestures toward new possibilities for movement. Ultimately, I argue that the tradition of the creation <b>of</b> autonomous <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in the US, and existing <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> autonomous <b>education</b> in social movements in Latin America, have the potential to once again provide insight toward the creation <b>of</b> alternative <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in the US now that would be different from earlier and current <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> US <b>education</b> for domination and control.
