40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of the types and addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and the age of cement on expansion value and expansion performance of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent was systematically studied. The expansion characteristics of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent or calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent were compared. The expansion of such material increases with the addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and cement mortar age. During the test period, the expansion of cement based material increases continuously. The light-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent modified by CaO <b>expanding</b> agent is able to increase the 28 d expansion of such material effectively. The temperature of calcination for the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent is higher than that of light-burned one, thus the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent has a rather dense structure with slow hydration rate and gives a small expansion of the cement based material at early age, showing an obvious expansion delay. The calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent gives most expansion of the material in the early 28 d and there is small expansion at middle and later age of the material...|$|R

Leaf sheaths contained significantly more nonstructural carbohydrate than did the <b>expanded</b> blade. Sheaths also contained a greater percentage of fructan with more than six sugar residues (long chain fructan), than either the <b>expanded</b> blade or <b>expanding</b> leaf. <b>Expanding</b> leaves contained a greater {{concentration of}} fructose and oligosaccharides than did sheath or blade tissues. <b>Expanding</b> leaves also had the greatest fructosyl-transferase activity measured either as radiolabel incorporated into fructans in tissue pieces or protein extracts.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A mixture of powdered or liquid metal and powdered or liquid metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is treated with a liquid or gaseous non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material. The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is added to the metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material to form the <b>expanding</b> agent. Preferred Features: The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is a hydrating agent and the <b>expanding</b> agent is a metal hydride. The hydrating agent is hydrogen gas or a gas mixture containing hydrogen. The reaction of the non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material with the metal -containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is carried out at 300 - 700, preferably 400 - 600 deg.
