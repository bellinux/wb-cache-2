5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim <b>faith</b> in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express <b>faith</b> in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only to those who have <b>faith</b> in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of <b>faith</b> which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E

5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of <b>faith.</b> Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; <b>faith</b> is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through <b>faith</b> once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their <b>faith</b> in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their <b>faith.</b> God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Faith</b> {{reached the}} northernmost {{latitude}} {{and had the}} longest track of any Atlantic tropical cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, <b>Faith</b> developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and {{the west coast of}} Africa on August21.

Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August23. About 42hours later, <b>Faith</b> reached an initial peak with winds of 105mph (165km/h), before weakening slightly on August26.

5|$|In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, {{challenging}} the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the <b>faith</b> {{of the prince}} {{was to be the}} <b>faith</b> of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed <b>faith</b> was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War {{until the end of the}} Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed <b>faith</b> as their official religion after 1648.|$|E

In a separate room, the remains of `Abdu'l-Bahá were buried in November 1921.|$|E
