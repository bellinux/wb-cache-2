25|$|Human activities, mainly {{cultivation}} of the steppes, {{resulted in the}} disappearance of animals formerly common in the basin, such as tarpan, steppe antelope, saiga antelope, marmots and others. Back in the 1960s–1970s, especially near Oskol River, {{it was not unusual}} to meet bobak marmot, Eurasian deer, wild boar and Russian desman. Current mammals of the basin include <b>European</b> <b>beaver,</b> Dipodidae, suslik, mice, European otter, European mink, weasel and bats.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{theory is}} that the waitoreke is {{actually}} a beaver. This is because several of the sightings report that the waitoreke lives in dams like those of a beaver. The fur color of a beaver is also close to that of the description of a waitoreke. However, the body shape and the tail structure of a waitoreke are different than that of a beaver. If the waitoreke was a beaver it would most likely be introduced by European settlers and would then be related to the <b>European</b> <b>beaver.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are more}} than 20 lakes in the park, {{some of them are}} pristine, of crystal-clear waters (e.g., Gacno Wielkie and Male, Nierybno, Gluche). Around 25 species of fish can be found here as well as <b>European</b> <b>beavers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Seventeen {{species are}} listed mainly {{because they are}} {{endangered}} on a global scale, such as the <b>European</b> <b>beaver,</b> even if the population in Norway is not seen as endangered. The number of threatened and near-threatened species equals to 3,682; it includes 418 fungi species, {{many of which are}} closely associated with the small remaining areas of old-growth forests, 36 bird species, and 16 species of mammals. In 2010, 2,398 species were listed as endangered or vulnerable; of these were 1250 listed as vulnerable (VU), 871 as endangered (EN), and 276 species as critically endangered (CR), among which were the grey wolf, the Arctic fox (healthy population on Svalbard) and the pool frog.|$|E
25|$|The Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs {{from the}} 1st {{millennium}} BCE depict lion and bull hunts in fertile landscapes. Sixteenth to nineteenth century European travellers in the Syrian Euphrates basin reported on {{an abundance of}} animals living in the area, {{many of which have}} become rare or even extinct. Species like gazelle, onager and the now-extinct Arabian ostrich lived in the steppe bordering the Euphrates valley, while the valley itself was home to the wild boar. Carnivorous species include the gray wolf, the golden jackal, the red fox, the leopard and the lion. The Syrian brown bear {{can be found in the}} mountains of Southeast Turkey. The presence of <b>European</b> <b>beaver</b> has been attested in the bone assemblage of the prehistoric site of Abu Hureyra in Syria, but the beaver has never been sighted in historical times.|$|E
25|$|Rodents make up 40% of the mammal species. These include squirrels, mice, voles, {{rats and}} the {{recently}} reintroduced <b>European</b> <b>beaver.</b> There {{is also an}} abundance of rabbits, hares, hedgehogs, shrews, moles and several species of bat. Carnivorous mammals include the fox, badger, otter, weasel, stoat and elusive wildcat. Various species of seal, whale and dolphin are found on or around British shores and coastlines. The largest land-based wild animals today are deer. The red deer is the largest species, with roe deer and fallow deer also prominent; the latter was introduced by the Normans. Sika deer and two more species of smaller deer, muntjac and Chinese water deer, have been introduced, muntjac becoming widespread in England and parts of Wales while Chinese water deer are restricted mainly to East Anglia. Habitat loss has affected many species. Extinct large mammals include the brown bear, grey wolf and wild boar; the latter has had a limited reintroduction in recent times.|$|E
50|$|Among mammals {{living in}} the park are red deer, roe deer, boar, red fox, grey wolf, and eurasian badger. In 1979 <b>European</b> <b>beavers</b> were reintroduced and now colonies of the mammal thrive in the Wieprz valley. In 1982 Polish ponies were brought here.|$|R

25|$|Although North American beavers are superficially {{similar to}} the <b>European</b> <b>beaver</b> (Castor fiber), several {{important}} differences exist between the two species. North American beavers tend to be slightly smaller, with smaller, more rounded heads; shorter, wider muzzles; thicker, longer, and darker underfur; wider, more oval-shaped tails; and longer shin bones, allowing them a greater range of bipedal locomotion than the European species. North American beavers have shorter nasal bones than their European relatives, with the widest point being at {{the middle of the}} snout for the former, and in the tip for the latter. The nasal opening for the North American species is square, unlike that of the European race, which is triangular. The foramen magnum is triangular in the North American beaver, and rounded in the European. The anal glands of the North American beaver are smaller and thick-walled with a small internal volume compared to that of the European species. Finally, the guard hairs of the North American beaver have a shorter hollow medulla at their tips. Fur color is also different. Overall, 50% of North American beavers have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish, while in European beavers, 66% have pale brown or beige fur, 20% are reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats.|$|E
500|$|Beverley Brook rises at Cuddington Recreation Park in Worcester Park {{and enters}} the park (where it is {{followed}} by the Tamsin Trail and Beverley Walk) at Robin Hood Gate, creating a water feature used by deer, smaller animals and water grasses and some water lilies. [...] Its name is derived from the former presence in the river of the <b>European</b> <b>beaver</b> (Castor fiber), a species extinct in Britain since the sixteenth century.|$|E

25|$|North American beavers {{were also}} {{released}} in Finland in 1937, {{before it was}} realized that they formed a separate species. (Eurasian beavers had been extirpated from the region, so the release {{was intended as a}} reintroduction project.) By 1999, it was estimated that 90% of beavers in Finland were the American species. The species is not considered invasive, as in Europe it has a similar keystone effect to <b>European</b> <b>beavers,</b> which have not recolonized the area. The beaver population has been controlled by issuing hunting licenses. A report in 2010 concluded that while the current population was not problematic, as the species has larger litters than <b>European</b> <b>beavers</b> and builds somewhat larger dams, it could become a problem if its range continues expanding into Russia, but this {{does not seem to be}} taking place.|$|R
5000|$|Bamff {{has been}} the home of several <b>European</b> <b>beavers</b> since 2002.

25|$|The {{two species}} are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 chromosomes, while <b>European</b> <b>beavers</b> have 48. Also, more than 27 {{attempts}} were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in one stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely {{in areas where the}} two species' ranges overlap.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{principle}} of zapovednost stipulates no economic use, in practice zapovedniks have often been required {{to contribute to the}} national economy.

Several zapovedniks have also been regarded as a breeding ground for other commercially valuable fur-bearing animals, such as sable and desman, allowing them to spread into neighboring unprotected areas to support commercial trapping.|$|R

25|$|<b>European</b> <b>beavers</b> (Castor fiber) were {{eventually}} hunted nearly to extinction {{in part for}} the production of castoreum, which was used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Castoreum was described in the 1911 British Pharmaceutical Codex for use in dysmenorrhea and hysterical conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising blood pressure and increasing cardiac output. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of salicin from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to salicylic acid and has an action very similar to aspirin. Castoreum continues to be used in perfume production.|$|R
50|$|The {{collection}} reflects species currently native, {{introduced and}} those previously native to Britain, {{back to the}} last ice age (~10,000 years ago). Wildwood Trust currently maintains the most varied native collection in the UK, comprising 30 mammals, 18 birds, 6 reptiles and 4 amphibians. Highlights for visitors include two brown bears rescued from a bear breeding facility in Kormissosh (Bulgaria), the large pack of European wolves roaming a wooded enclosure, and a group of badgers in their underground set. Other species rarely kept in UK collections are water shrews, pine martens, stoats, roe deer, <b>European</b> <b>beavers,</b> coypu (the only exhibit of this species in the UK), ravens, Eurasian cranes and Northern adders.|$|R
50|$|Other monogamous species include wolves, otters, a few hooved animals, some bats, certain {{species of}} fox, and the Eurasian beaver. This beaver is {{particularly}} interesting {{as it is}} practicing monogamy in its reintroduction to certain parts of Europe; however, its American counterpart is not monogamous at all and often partakes in promiscuous behavior. The two species are quite similar in ecology but American beavers {{tend to be less}} aggressive than <b>European</b> <b>beavers.</b> In this instance, the scarcity of the European beavers' population could drive its monogamous behavior; moreover, it lowers the risk of parasite transmission which is correlated with biological fitness. Monogamy is proving to be very efficient for this beaver, as their population is climbing.|$|R
