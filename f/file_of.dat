5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a <b>file</b> <b>of</b> unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{continued}} as divisional commander {{for most of}} the campaign at Gallipoli. Of tall stature, he made constant tours of the front line amidst jokes that the communication trenches needed to be dug deeply to allow for his height. On one visit to Quinn's Post on 7 May, he personally directed troop deployments to counter a potential Turkish counterattack. Despite his inspections, his reputation amongst the rank and <b>file</b> <b>of</b> the division did not improve. Nor was his co-ordination of offensive operations sound; during the August offensive, his lack of oversight allowed one of his brigade commanders, Brigadier General Francis Johnston, a British Army officer on secondment to the NZEF, to vacillate over deployment of reinforcements. On the morning of 8 August, the Wellington Infantry Battalion was in tenuous possession of Chunuk Bair but required support to consolidate its position. Johnstone did not order his reinforcements forward until later that day. Crucial momentum was lost and Chunuk Bair was later recaptured by the Turks.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a <b>file</b> <b>of</b> unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} colorized twice, {{the first time}} in 1987. This version was poorly received. The film was colorized again by Legend Films, who {{released}} their color version as well as a restored black-and-white version of the film on DVD in 2006. Legend Films' colorized version was well received, and was also given a theatrical premiere at the Coney Island Museum on May 27, 2006. The DVD included an audio commentary track by comedian Michael J. Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame. A DivX <b>file</b> <b>of</b> Legend's colorized version with the commentary embedded is also available as part of Nelson's RiffTrax On Demand service. On January 28, 2009, a newly recorded commentary by Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett was released by RiffTrax in MP3 and DivX formats. Legend's colorized version is also available from Amazon Video on Demand, without Nelson's commentary.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Vietnamese support the CPP, and those who carry Cambodian citizenship would vote for the party. Vietnamese support for the CPP has mostly driven by strong anti-Vietnamese sentiments from other political parties. Although many members within the rank and <b>file</b> <b>of</b> the CPP share anti-Vietnamese sentiments with other political parties, the CPP maintained an openly neutral stance towards the Vietnamese community. According to Ehrentraut, the CPP's neutral stance was a balance between not providing open support for the Vietnamese community, which would have the potential effect of losing electoral votes to other political parties, {{while at the same time}} maintaining close ties with the Vietnamese government which the CPP had historical ties dating back to 1979. Vietnamese who hold Cambodian citizenship have also expressed fear over physical insecurity during election periods, which is most apparent during the 1993 and 2013 elections when Vietnamese civilians faced physical intimidation from the Khmer Rouge and CNRP supporters respectively and have abstained from participating in elections.|$|E

This {{is one of three}} substantial studies of English culture conducted by Geoffrey Gorer between 1955 and 1971, all held by the Mass-Observation Archive.

The material for this study, Death, Grief and Mourning in Contemporary Britain, consists <b>of</b> 31 <b>files</b> <b>of</b> papers. The fieldwork was carried out by Research Services Ltd in April and May 1963 and the longer interviews by Geoffrey Gorer and David Tomlinson later the same year. The study consists <b>of</b> 3 <b>files</b> <b>of</b> in-depth interviews; 10 <b>files</b> <b>of</b> completed questionnaires; and 17 <b>files</b> <b>of</b> assorted background material. Main Topics : Main topics include death, bereavement, sorrow and funerals in Great Britain...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a loan secured by {{personal}} property collateral, the <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> a financing statement gives notice of a lien against the property so that other lenders or buyers of the personal property will know of the security interest. In the case <b>of</b> a <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> a financing statement by a lessor <b>of</b> fixtures, the <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> the financing statement gives notice of the lessor's interests to others who acquire an interest in the real property and related fixtures. The financing statement does not create a lien nor does it create any additional rights against a lessee in favor of a lessor, the <b>filing</b> <b>of</b> a financing statement just gives notice of whatever rights the creditor or lessor have under their loan documents or lease, respectively.|$|R
