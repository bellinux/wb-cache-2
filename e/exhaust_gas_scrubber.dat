40|$|The {{international}} maritime {{community has}} been experiencing tremendous pressures from environmental organizations to reduce the emissions footprint of their vessels. In the last decade, air emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter, have become the focus. In an effort to regulate and gain control of vessel air pollution, in 1997, the International Maritime Organization created Annex VI, Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships, to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL Annex VI). Recently, in 2008, MARPOL Annex VI was amended to impose more stringent air emission regulations that will be enforced based on a tiered system that grows tighter with time. New technologies are under development to ensure new vessels can meet the stricter standards while maintaining propulsion plant performance. With {{the bulk of the}} international commercial fleet approaching its mid-service life, this thesis completes an analysis of retrofitting these new technologies to the existing power plants of vessels built in the 1990 s, focusing on performance impacts in the way of specific fuel consumption, transit times and brake engine power output. Three types of commercial vessels are explored: bulk carriers, containerships and tank vessels. Maxsurf, an integrated naval architecture & ship construction software program, is utilized to parametrically develop 30 computer based hull models. The Hullspeed module of Maxsurf is then used to estimate speed-power curves for the hull models based on the Fung and Holtrop hull resistance and power estimations. The models' dimensions and power plants are taken from existing vessels constructed in the 1990 s and obtained from the American Bureau of Shipping database (ABS Eagle). This thesis focuses on reducing NOx and SOx emissions from these vessels. Six air emission reducing technologies are explored including two after-treatment systems, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> and four pre-combustion systems, direct water injection (DWI), fuel-water emulsification, <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recycle (EGR) and scavenge air moistening (SAM). The published performance impacts are applied to the vessels traveling on a hypothetical route comparing new transit times and increased fuel consumption. by Ronald J. Caputo. Thesis (S.

40|$|Rising {{environmental}} awareness and stricter environmental regulations {{have increased the}} interest in new fuels and energy efficiency measures in the shipping industry. Different fuels have different {{physical and chemical properties}} that affect the performance of internal combustion engines, e. g. the efficiency, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> emissions, and the potential for energy recovery. This has an impact on the potential propulsion efficiency {{as well as on the}} life cycle environmental performance. The aim of this study is therefore twofold. First, to assess the potential for optimising the energy use of the propulsion system dependent on fuel choice and second, to assess the overall life cycle global warming potential of the optimised systems. Three fuels are compared, heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil (MGO), and liquefied natural gas (LNG), in combination with two <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> cleaning technologies, <b>scrubbers</b> and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units. Data from one year of actual operation with a product tanker are used as a base for the optimization. The results show that the solution with the lowest fuel consumption and carbon footprint is a two-stroke engine with waste heat recovery (WHR) powered by LNG. The synthesis of an optimization procedure for the propulsion system and an LCA approach leads to very interesting results. The different carbon content of different fuels, together with methane slip, leads to a better estimation to the carbon footprint of different propulsion systems. On the other hand, a better insight of the differences between different propulsion arrangements allows performing a more accurate comparison between different fuels. The potential for WHR has a particularly relevant influence on the final result...|$|R
