5|$|A <b>high-density</b> {{residential}} district {{built on a}} coastal knoll, Lam Tin hosts residential housing estates, transport infrastructure, mass-transit facilities, shopping centres, recreational areas and many other buildings and structures. It is home to 130,000 residents, making up a fifth of Kwun Tong District's population.|$|E

5|$|With {{the release}} of dual-layer Wii Optical Discs, Nintendo of America stated that some Wii systems may have {{difficulty}} reading the <b>high-density</b> software (due to a contaminated laser lens). Nintendo offers retail lens-cleaning kits and free console repairs for owners who experience this issue.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found {{throughout}} almost all countries of South America except Chile. They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, {{as well as}} flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in <b>high-density</b> populations.|$|E
5|$|Carlton Hill's {{pattern of}} {{development}} {{was defined by}} the long-established structure of land ownership around Brighton, whereby land was divided into long, narrow strips with many different owners. This encouraged the development of terraced housing—the predominant housing pattern until the council undertook large-scale demolition and <b>high-density</b> rebuilding in the mid-20th century. This work introduced more open space and varied land uses: Brighton Art College was able to expand into the area, and American Express opened a large, visually dominant headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the University of Dayton {{released}} a Master Plan {{which called for}} the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the alleys behind the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to raze the Ghetto {{and replace it with}} more <b>high-density</b> housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.|$|E
5|$|Other uses of organobromine {{compounds}} include <b>high-density</b> drilling fluids, dyes (such as Tyrian {{purple and}} the indicator bromothymol blue), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. silver bromide for photography). Zinc–bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale to industrial scale.|$|E
5|$|Tracing {{its history}} {{back to the}} 1870s, the Ghetto now {{includes}} more than 200 university-owned houses as well as landlord-owned houses, <b>high-density</b> housing and gathering spaces. With the inclusion of Holy Angels and The Darkside, two smaller neighborhoods the university owns property in, {{there are more than}} 400 houses currently used as student residential space. Because of the area's age, the university has been engaged in a program to renovate and update the Ghetto, and several additional changes to the neighborhood are expected in the coming years as part of the university's Master Plan.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, <b>high-density</b> markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of <b>high-density</b> urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of <b>high-density</b> lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, JAL {{was hit by}} {{the effects}} of Japan's recession, {{increased}} foreign competition and the strengthening of the Japanese Yen, JAZ was given a new role to help reduce costs. The airline obtained the license to operate scheduled services on July 30, 1999 and would operate as a scheduled carrier on a wet-lease basis for JAL. It would operate on <b>high-density</b> low yield tourist routes in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly the Japan–Hawaii services; with a fleet of four McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and five Boeing 747s. On October 1, the airline {{changed its name to}} JALways Co., Ltd. and operated its first scheduled passenger service from Tokyo to Kona and Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the <b>high-density</b> diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third-largest conurbation. There {{is a mixture of}} <b>high-density</b> urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around , is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester, through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester spans , which roughly {{covers the}} {{territory}} of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the second most populous urban area in the UK. It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of <b>high-density</b> urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs.|$|E
5|$|In late 1939, the Southern Railway, {{until then}} {{primarily}} a <b>high-density</b> commuter railway serving London and South-East England, {{much of it}} electrified with third-rail pick-up, found itself on the British front line of the Second World War, with a severe lack of modern freight-handling capability. The newest freight design was the Q Class 0-6-0 of 1938, the last locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell. Built to essentially Victorian era principles, these had been designed as replacements {{for many of the}} older 0-6-0s inherited by the Southern Railway in 1923, and entered service in January 1938. Maunsell, having retired at the end of October 1937, was replaced by Oliver Bulleid.|$|E
5|$|Land uses in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Brook include forested land, agricultural land, and developed land such as <b>high-density</b> residential land and downtown commercial land. Abandoned mine land also occurs in {{the watershed}} and wetlands occur in some areas. Major roads in the stream's drainage basin include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. Mills and forges were built along the stream in the late 1700s and early 1800s. During the 19th century, there was a substantial coal and iron industry in the watershed. Several railroads were also built in the stream's vicinity. Numerous bridges, including the Harrison Avenue Bridge (which is on the National Register of Historic Places) have been built across the stream as well. Additionally, sites such as the Scranton Iron Furnaces are in its watershed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form <b>high-density</b> metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook is {{the largest}} {{tributary}} of the Lackawanna River. It is a third-order stream. Its headwaters are situated immediately {{to the west of}} the watershed of the Lehigh River. Forested land comprises 70 percent of the watershed's upper reaches. 20 percent is agricultural land and 10 percent is developed. Some abandoned mine land occurs in the watershed as well. Other land uses include <b>high-density</b> residential land and downtown commercial land. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. South Washington Avenue is located near the stream's mouth. The University of Scranton is located near the stream.|$|E
5|$|Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide {{crystals}} {{have been}} used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of <b>high-density</b> glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|E
5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A <b>high-density</b> polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
5|$|The Ghetto also {{contains}} several <b>high-density</b> living areas, including the Garden Apartments, the Lawnview Apartments and the Campus South, a high-rise living complex for sophomores. In 2004, the ArtStreet complex opened, {{intended as a}} combined living-learning space. It includes housing for 56 students, {{as well as a}} cafe, an amphitheater, rehearsal rooms, several activity rooms and gallery spaces, and a new studio for the campus radio station, WUDR. The Ghetto is also home to the McGinnis school house, which was acquired in 1982 and renamed the McGinnis Center; it is used as a central point of contact for Ghetto residents. The McGinnis Center houses several meeting rooms, administrative offices and laundry facilities for houses that are not equipped with washers and dryers.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids. When used for this purpose, they are {{harvested}} young in <b>high-density</b> plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E
5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium {{in the military}} sector is in <b>high-density</b> penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|E
5|$|The site, a {{steeply sloping}} {{hillside}} between a main railway line {{and one of}} Brighton's main roads, had been {{the home of a}} railway locomotive works and goods yard for more than a century. <b>High-density</b> housing was built {{at the same time and}} surrounded the railway buildings. From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works and goods yard were closed and demolished, and most of the housing was cleared. This left large areas of derelict land which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council. Site clearance work followed, and construction began in 2004.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a mixture}} of <b>high-density</b> urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural {{locations}} in Oldham. There is some permanent grassland but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The territory of Oldham is contiguous with other towns on all sides except for a small section along its eastern and southern boundaries, and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics, forms the fourth largest settlement of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation. The M60 motorway passes through the southwest of Oldham, through Hollinwood, and a heavy rail line enters Oldham from the same direction, travelling northeast to the town centre before heading northwards through Derker towards Shaw and Crompton.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and <b>high-density</b> water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E
25|$|Spotted low-density arrays {{typically}} feature picolitre {{drops of}} a range of purified cDNAs arrayed on the surface of a glass slide. The probes are longer than those of <b>high-density</b> arrays and typically lack the transcript resolution of <b>high-density</b> arrays. Spotted arrays use different fluorophores for test and control samples, and the ratio of fluorescence is used to calculate a relative measure of abundance. <b>High-density</b> arrays use single channel detection, and each sample is hybridised and detected individually. <b>High-density</b> arrays were popularised by the Affymetrix GeneChip array, where each transcript is quantified by several short 25-mer probes that together assay one gene.|$|E
