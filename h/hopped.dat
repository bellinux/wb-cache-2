5|$|After boiling, the <b>hopped</b> wort is now cooled, {{ready for}} the yeast. In some breweries, the <b>hopped</b> wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the <b>hopped</b> wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E

North American beers often use Cascade <b>hops,</b> Columbus <b>hops,</b> Centennial <b>hops,</b> Willamette, Amarillo <b>hops</b> and about forty more varieties as the U.S.A. have lately been the more significant breeders of new <b>hop</b> varieties, including dwarf <b>hop</b> varieties.|$|R

5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily <b>hopped</b> than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E
5|$|Robben was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Netherlands at Euro 2012. He started in the first group stage match, a 1–0 loss to Denmark, in which he hit the post with a curled effort. In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he <b>hopped</b> over the advertising boards and walked the long way round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt because he thought he could have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.|$|E
30|$|In addition, we {{investigate}} whether promotion <b>hops</b> {{vary with the}} duration of stay (at some job) before <b>hopping.</b> Figure  12 shows the promotion <b>hop</b> fractions (i.e., p(promotion|external <b>hop)</b> and p(promotion|internal <b>hop))</b> as well as promotion <b>hop</b> counts {{as a function of}} duration of stay prior to <b>hopping.</b> For these plots, we also set the minimum support threshold to filter out unreliable statistics. The right chart of Fig.  12 suggests that promotion <b>hops</b> most commonly happen after a person works for 1 – 2 years. However, the left chart of Fig.  12 indicates no obvious relationship between the duration of stay and promotion <b>hop</b> fraction. Regardless, it is again evident that the probability of promotion is higher for internal <b>hops</b> than for external <b>hops.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} <b>hop</b> houses or <b>hop</b> kilns, <b>hop</b> barns were {{very common in}} areas of the United States where <b>hops</b> were grown. <b>Hop</b> barns were so common it was said that [...] "every other farm" [...] had one.

Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{display is}} poorly recorded. Ornithologist J.

Groups {{of two or more}} males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden sparrow have been reported.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz <b>hopped</b> down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E

Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers and police officers rushed into the ring and managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight.

5|$|Technological {{advances}} proceeded in a {{range of}} areas. Watermills to grind grain had existed during most of the Anglo-Saxon period, using horizontal mill designs; from the 12th century on many more were built, eliminating the use of hand mills, with the older horizontal mills gradually supplanted by a new vertical mill design. Windmills began to be built in the late 12th century and slowly became more common. Water-powered fulling mills and powered hammers first appeared in the 12th century; water power was harnessed to assist in smelting by the 14th century, with the first blast furnace opening in 1496. New mining methods were developed and horse-powered pumps were installed in English mines {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages. The introduction of <b>hopped</b> beer transformed the brewing industry in the 14th century, and new techniques were invented to better preserve fish. Glazed pottery became widespread in the 12th and 13th centuries, with stoneware pots largely replacing wooden plates and bowls by the 15th century. William Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde began using the printing press during the late 15th century. Transport links were also improved; many road bridges were either erected or rebuilt in stone during the long economic boom of the 12th and 13th centuries. England's maritime trade benefited from the introduction of cog ships, and many docks were improved and fitted with cranes for the first time.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} this study show that the most usual damages of <b>hop</b> glandular trichomes are {{obtained}} on tunica of peltate glandular trichomes as well as cracking of bulbous glandular trichomes.

The decrease in volume of <b>hop</b> glandular trichomes in dried <b>hop</b> cones is the result of dehydration of <b>hop</b> cones and consequently <b>hops</b> glandular trichomes during the drying process which cause shrinkage of peltate glandular trichomes.
