40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of several phthalate esters in water samples using solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography was developed. A polytetrafluoroethylene turnings packed column {{was used as a}} SPE adsorbent material. The analytes were sorbed on polytetrafluoroethylene turnings, from which they were eluted by a small amount of acetonitrile, followed by a RP-HPLC-UV analysis. Detection limits (3 sigma) of 4. 7, 3. 1, 3. 6, 4. 3, and 5. 8 ng mL(- 1) for di-n-butyl-phthalate, di-cyclohexyl-phthalate, <b>di-n-octyl-phthalate,</b> di-n-nonyl-phthalate and di-iso-decyl-phthalate. respectively, were achieved. Acceptable recovery results (92. 1 - 127. 5 %) were obtained on five phthalate esters spiked samples...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{accurate}} and reliable method was presented and validated for the simultaneous monitoring of six phthalates at trace level con-centrations in seven different brands of commercial bottled mineral water from Jordan. Liquid–liquid extraction {{with a mixture}} of methy-lene chloride–petroleum ether (20 : 80, v/v) was used for isolation and enrichment of the phthalates and sample cleanup. This was followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) for identifica-tion and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultravio-let detection for quantification. The linear range of the GC–MS calibration curve was 0. 3 – 1. 2 mg/L with a mean correlation coeffi-cient (R 2) of 0. 9920 + 0. 0063, the detection limit was 90 %. For HPLC, the linear range was 0. 5 – 10 mg/L with R 25 0. 9985 + 0. 0012 and an average detection limit of 0. 20 + 0. 15 mg/L. The results indicated that the Jordanian bottled water was contaminated with dibutyl-, di- 2 -ethylhexyl- and <b>di-n-octyl-phthalate,</b> with total phthalate concentrations between 8. 1 and 19. 8 mg/L. Increasing the storage temperature of the bottled water increased the content of leached phthalates in the water (total concentration of 23 – 29. 2 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} titanate nanotube (Fe 3 O 4 -TN composite) {{was prepared}} and functionalized with C- 18 groups and then coated by a hydrophilic alginate polymer cage. This material (ALG@C- 18 -Fe 3 O 4 -TN) exhibited {{the properties of}} large surface area, superparamagnetism, high adsorption ability, and good dispersibility in water. ALG@C- 18 -Fe 3 O 4 -TNs possessed high extraction efficiency to phthalate esters di-n-propyl-phthalate (DPP), di-n-butyl-phthalate (DBP), dicyclohexyl-phthalate (DCP), and <b>di-n-octyl-phthalate</b> (DOP). The dispersed adsorbents in solution could be collected with an external magnetic field within 10 min. The extraction could be conducted under some extreme conditions such as high salinity, acid or alkali solution or humic acid-rich samples without the decrease in extraction efficiency. In the presence of 100 mg L- 1 humic acid (11 As), the recoveries of analytes were not affected at pH > 6, and decreased recoveries of DPP and DCP were observed only in acid solution. Potential analysis and comparison study with the biphthalate acid or n-decanoic acid-rich matrix indicated that the anti-interference ability of adsorbents to HAs mainly resulted from the repulsion interaction and size exclusion provided by alginate cage to HAS. Under the optimized conditions, ALG@C- 18 -Fe 3 O 4 -TNs were used to analyze several environmental water samples, a concentration factor of 1000 and detection limits of phthalate esters ranging in 11 - 46 ng L- 1 were achieved, and the recoveries of analytes were {{in the range of}} 84 - 109 % for all samples...|$|E
