5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here {{the lens of the}} eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a <b>hereditary</b> <b>disease,</b> it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} the cause of this {{condition}} was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the <b>Hereditary</b> <b>Disease</b> Foundation (HDF) was created by Milton Wexler, a psychoanalyst based in Los Angeles, California, whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington's disease. The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project who over a 10-year period worked to locate the responsible gene.|$|E

5|$|The first likely {{description}} of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington, after whom it is named. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the <b>Hereditary</b> <b>Disease</b> Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy {{with the goal of}} repairing damage caused by the disease.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a <b>hereditary</b> <b>disease</b> caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially <b>hereditary</b> <b>disease</b> of the hip joint.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{models are}} {{requisite}} for genetic dissection of, and improved treatment regimens for, human <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases.</b> While several animals {{have been used}} in academic and industrial research, the primary model for dissection of <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases</b> has been the many strains of the laboratory mouse. However, given its greater (than the mouse) genetic similarity to the human, high number of naturally occurring <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases,</b> unique population structure, and the availability of the complete genome sequence, the purebred dog has emerged as a powerful model for study of diseases. The major advantage the dog provides is that it is afflicted with approximately 450 <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases,</b> about half of which have remarkable clinical similarities to corresponding diseases of the human. In addition, humankind has a strong desire to cure diseases of the dog so these two facts make the dog an ideal clinical and genetic model.

25|$|Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a <b>hereditary</b> <b>disease</b> {{in which}} the bone marrow {{produces}} neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS {{has been found in}} Border Collies in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.|$|E
25|$|For {{an adult}} patient with {{isolated}} hematuria, tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and cystoscopy are usually done first {{to pinpoint the}} source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of hematuria. In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection can raise the suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic hematuria (i.e. without associated proteinuria and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A urinalysis will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. Proteinuria, usually less than 2grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated hematuria include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a <b>hereditary</b> <b>disease</b> associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.|$|E

25|$|Beta {{thalassemia}} is a <b>hereditary</b> <b>disease</b> {{allowing for}} a preventative treatment by carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis. It can be prevented if one parent has normal genes, giving rise to screenings that empower carriers to select partners with normal hemoglobin. A study aimed at detecting the genes that could give rise to offspring with sickle cell disease. Patients diagnosed with beta thalassemia have MCH ‚â§ 26 pg and an RDW < 19. Of 10,148 patients, 1,739 patients had a hemoglobin phenotype and RDW consistent with beta thalassemia. After the narrowing of patients, the HbA2 levels were tested presenting 77 patients with beta thalassemia. This screening procedure proved insensitive in populations of West African ancestry because of the indicators has high prevalence of alpha thalassemia. Countries have programs distributing information about the reproductive risks associated with carriers of haemoglobinopathies. Thalassemia carrier screening programs have educational programs in schools, armed forces, and through mass media {{as well as providing}} counseling to carriers and carrier couples. Screening has showed reduced incidence; by 1995 the prevalence in Italy reduced from 1:250 to 1:4000, and a 95% decrease in that region. The decrease in incidence has benefitted those affected with thalassemia, as the demand for blood has decreased, therefore improving the supply of treatment.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} who {{immediately}} succeeded Arsaces I.

Yet Curtis and Brosius state that Arsaces II was the immediate successor of Arsaces I, with Curtis claiming the succession took place in 211BC, and Brosius in 217BC. Bivar insists that 138BC, the last regnal year of Mithridates I, is [...] "the first precisely established regnal date of Parthian history." [...] Due to these and other discrepancies, Bivar outlines two distinct royal chronologies accepted by historians. Later on, some of the Parthian Kings would claim Achaemenid descent. The claim has recently received support from numismatic and other written evidence suggesting that both Achaemenid and Parthian kings suffered from the <b>hereditary</b> <b>disease</b> neurofibromatosis.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{scope of}} the present work was to provide an {{scientific}} overview of the actually state of canine genetics of <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases.</b> Causative mutations, inheritance modes, breed disposition and incidence of the single genetic defects in the affected dog populations have been outlined. Additionally a special focus aims on the gathering of actually available genetic tests for respective <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases</b> within different dog breeds. The present state of science covers 76 genetically characterized <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases</b> of the dog (status: January, 2009). Their inheritance mode, genetic basis, pathophysiology, breed dispositions and genetic control are shown here in detail. Up to date, 61 DNA tests are available for canine <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases.</b> A compendium of the actually available genetic tests for the affected breeds with different suppliers {{is included in the}} appendix of this work. In the sector of genome analysis and screening tests for dogs, high research activity can be observed. This contributes to the specific suitability of the species dog as an animal model for the investigation of human <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases.</b> The partial considerable inbreeding of some dog breeds leads to the appearance of numerous monogenetic <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases</b> which are mostly of recessive nature. In addition, research results of the last few years demonstrate that these diseases are phenotypical or even genotypical homologues to human <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases.</b> The number of the dog¬¥s identified genetic mutations, which are connected to <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases,</b> has increased in the past years and will increase continuously in the next years. An application of the enlarged genetic research results is as well of interest to the human medicine, as to the stockbreeding. The application of molecular-genetic screening methods offers dog breeders the possibility to determine the genetic status of their breeding dogs, to select healthy animals and to minimize future hereditary defects. The incidence of <b>hereditary</b> <b>diseases</b> can be reduced using genetic screening tests on the breeding dogs before breeding, introducing DNA of breeding dogs from other populations and avoiding the inbreeding within different pedigrees of dogs. Since a couple of years numerous screening and breeding programmes and the generation of genotype data banks are an obligation within many associations of dog breeders. This might accelerate an offbreeding of hereditary defects. The rising quantity of genetic screening tests and further investigation of undecoded mutations, will allow researches to amplify the understanding in the wide field of the polygene diseases. Relieving the succeeding generations of pedigree dogs from monogene and polygene hereditary sufferings is the future aim...|$|R
