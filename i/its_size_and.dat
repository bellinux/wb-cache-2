5|$|Benson in 2010 {{concluded}} from <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> common distribution that Megalosaurus was {{the apex}} predator of its habitat. He saw {{the absence of}} Cetiosaurus on the French Armorican Massif as an indication that Megalosaurus too did not live on that island and {{was limited to the}} London-Brabant Massif.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the numbers}} {{continued}} to mount against Napoleon, and the French army was pinned {{down by a}} force twice <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> lost at the Battle of Leipzig.

5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> {{geologic}} {{features such}} as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10% of Texas' land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|Following its debut, the 747 rapidly {{achieved}} iconic status, {{appearing in}} numerous film productions such as Airport 1975 and Airport '77 disaster films, Air Force One, Die Hard 2, and Executive Decision. Appearing in over 300 film productions the 747 {{is one of}} the most widely depicted civilian aircraft and is considered by many as one of the most iconic in film history. The aircraft entered the cultural lexicon as the original Jumbo Jet, a term coined by the aviation media to describe <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> <b>and</b> was also nicknamed Queen of the Skies.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. The wall was frequently mentioned in Nazi propaganda, where <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> strength were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.|$|E

It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E

5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> poor soil, this {{diversity}} is notable.

Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of habitats, and thus remarkable species.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{original}} Middlesex County Council office building that stood on site was incorporated into the new Civic Centre. The centre's clock tower is the only visible section from the old building. The Uxbridge Cricket Club Ground and Uxbridge fire station were relocated {{as part of the}} new development, which became controversial owing to <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> cost. Areas of the building, particularly the council chambers, continue to suffer from poor acoustics.|$|E

Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If {{the entrance to}} the hole is too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> <b>and</b> often coats the inside of the cavity too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid was {{excavated}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century by two different teams who reported conflicting estimates regarding <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> number of subterranean chambers. No artefacts were found over the course of the excavations, and no trace of a burial could be found. For this reason, it is unclear whether the pyramid was used to bury a pharaoh or was abandoned following the premature death of the king.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray is not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride the ray. The round ribbontail ray is popular with ecotourist divers because of <b>its</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> spectacular appearance. Although displayed in public aquariums, it is not hardy and 81 days is the longest one has been kept in captivity.|$|E
