2500|$|After the war, {{inflation}} {{began to}} devalue the Krone, {{which was still}} Austria's currency. In autumn 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the League of Nations. The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition. The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925, the Schilling [...] was introduced, replacing the Krone {{at a rate of}} 10,000:1. Later, it was nicknamed the [...] "Alpine dollar" [...] <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>stability.</b> From 1925 to 1929, the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Tuesday.|$|E

50|$|The F1 grenade {{was first}} {{produced}} in limited quantities by France in May 1915.
