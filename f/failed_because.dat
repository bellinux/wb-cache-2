5|$|The enemy {{made many}} {{attempts}} to encircle the regiment, {{but each time}} they <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of the many casualties inflicted by the 65th. Because the 65th held their positions, that enabled the U.S. Marines {{to withdraw from the}} Chosin Reservoir on December 1950.|$|E
5|$|Commandos {{on board}} would then {{disembark}} and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations, searchlights and gun emplacements. The destroyer {{would then be}} blown up. At {{the same time the}} RAF would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area. Most of them <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of heavy clouds and fog and very few bombers.|$|E

5|$|During the Phoney War the Netherlands officially {{adhered to}} {{a policy of}} strict neutrality. In secret, the Dutch {{military}} command, partly acting on its own accord, negotiated with both Belgium and France via the Dutch military attaché in Paris, Lieutenant-Colonel David van Voorst Evekink to coordinate a common defence to a German invasion. This <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of insurmountable differences of opinion {{about the question of}} which strategy to follow.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, a {{group of}} Puerto Ricans met with the {{appointed}} Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rican National Guard.

5|$|In that year, he {{took the}} civil service exam, likely in Chang'an. He failed, to his {{surprise}} and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he probably <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> his prose style {{at the time was}} too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E

5|$|The first rollout to Launch Pad 39A {{occurred}} on 4 September 2008. On 27 September, the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling (SIC) Unit on the Hubble Space Telescope <b>failed.</b> <b>Because</b> of its {{importance to the}} telescope, NASA postponed the launch of STS-125 on 29 September until 2009 so the failed unit could be replaced as well. Atlantis was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 20 October.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Newburgh {{writing in}} the 1190s, the plan <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of Geoffrey’s early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the {{paternal}} and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou. Henry’s brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{allied with}} Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three {{countries}} that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate {{in the conflict}} between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group from South America. Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E

5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This {{may have been}} one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E
5|$|Dein in the {{meantime}} pursued an offer from a television consortium, funded by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). They intended to create a football-only channel, available on the Astra satellite transponder. The Observer believed {{that in addition to}} broadcasting league matches, SBC would offer a selection of top clubs fees for airing matches against their European counterparts. Dein was impressed by the proposal – financier Chris Akers forecasted profits of up to £50 million – so he forwarded it to Parry. Although he too was impressed, SBC's offer eventually <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of sponsorship doubts.|$|E

5|$|Early {{mediation}} {{attempts in}} March 1499 had <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of mutual distrust between the parties. But {{after the battle}} of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are helium nuclei {{by allowing the}} particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Richard {{attempted}} a comeback with the Astros, but this <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> the stroke had slowed down his reaction time and weakened his depth perception. He {{spent the next}} few seasons {{in the minor leagues}} before being released by the Astros in 1984. After his professional baseball career ended, Richard became involved in unsuccessful business deals and went through two divorces, which led to him being homeless and destitute in 1994. Richard found succor in a local church and later became a Christian minister.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Pratt & Whitney studied {{retrofitting}} B-52s {{with four}} Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (F117) engines, {{but this was}} not done, since all B-52s were to be replaced by B-1s and B-2s by the late 1990s. In 1996 Rolls-Royce and Boeing jointly proposed to fit B-52s with four leased Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines, but this plan <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> of Air Force resistance to leasing combat assets and a negative Air Force economic analysis which was later disputed as flawed.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{an attempt}} was made to {{relocate}} the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt <b>failed</b> <b>because</b> the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, making it impossible to differentiate the two. A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil-bearing rock strata was severely eroded, and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus, indicating {{that a majority of the}} skeleton was gone by the time the vertebra and femur were recovered.|$|E
