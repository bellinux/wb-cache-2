40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the results of {{immunological}} tests (tests with recombinant allergen TB in standard dilution (RAT) and the Mantoux tuberculin test) in children at risk of developing tuberculosis in Tomsk Region. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 1204 outpatient medical records of children and adolescents at the age from 1 to 16 was performed. Results. When two tests are carried out at the same time (skin test with RAT (Diaskin-test) and Mantoux tuberculin test), the proportion of positive reactions to tuberculin was 92, 4 %, including 6, 6 % of <b>hyperergic</b> reactions, while there were 6, 0 % of positive reactions to RAT, including 3, 2 % of <b>hyperergic</b> reactions. The biggest number of positive reactions to RAT was recorded among children with severe and <b>hyperergic</b> tuberculin sensitivity (28, 7 %) and children from tuberculosis prevalence areas (17, 5 %). The lowest number of positive reactions to RAT was recorded among children with conversion of tubercular tests and children with latent TB infection (LTBI) – 2, 8 % and 1, 5 % respectively. Conclusions. The results of skin tests with RAT as compared to the tests with tuberculin are different. When there is a conversion of tubercular test the positive reaction to Diaskintest was detected only in a few cases (2, 8 % of cases) as compared to prevailing (in 96, 4 % of cases) positive reaction to tuberculin; in children with severe and <b>hyperergic</b> results the tuberculin reaction to RAT was the same in every third child (28, 7 %); in children with increasing sensitivity to tuberculin the immunological response during Diaskintest was detected in 4, 7 % of cases. More often local forms of tuberculosis were detected among children with <b>hyperergic</b> reactions to skin tests with RAT (12 of 38 children, 31, 6 %), χ 2 = 306, 3; p < 0, 001, and when there is an overlap of <b>hyperergic</b> results of two immunological tests (6 of 15 children, 40, 0 %) χ 2 = 303, 5; p < 0, 001 </p...|$|E
40|$|After {{the acute}} <b>hyperergic</b> phase of schistosomal infection, the chronic {{phase of the}} disease {{corresponds}} to the estabilishment of a relative equilibrium between the host and the parasite. This involves: (1) A shift from the predominance of the TH 2 response observed in the acute phase, to the predominance of the TH 1 response in the chronic phase of the disease, with modification of lymphokine and immunoglobulin secretions patterns. (2) Redistribution of hosts responses to parasite, with predominance of systemic controls in the acute phase, and a shift towards local tissue responses in the chronic phase. This redistribution relieves the <b>hyperergic</b> responses involving the whole body of the host, and delimits cellular and molecular reactions to parasites to only those tissues that are directly involved by the adult parasites and their eggs. Mobilization of eosinophil granulocytes in schistosomal periovular granulomas is one of examples of this redistribution...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigations}} of the pathogenesis of croupous pneumonia (c. p.) were predominantly carried out in two directions {{in the last few}} years. Some authors see in c. p. an infectious disease sui generis. Accordingly the therapy is bactericidal-antitoxic. Another investigative direction—Lauche summarized the relevant observations at the time —interprets c. p. (see this number, p. 165) as an expression of a <b>hyperergic</b> reaction of the diseased lung tissue. The most substantial support of this view appears to us to be the observation made by numerous authors that it is only possible to produce c. p. with some degree of regularity in the specifically most sensitive animal. The most essential anatomical criterion is considered not the size of the disease focus, but rather the abundance of the fibrin in the exudate. The question as to the pathogenic significance of a fibrinous exudate was answered by Roessle to the effect that the fibrinous inflammation was the histological expression of an intensified irritation defense. Our interest was directed at the metabolic processes which introduce the sudden precipitation of large quantities of fibrin, and we also hope to change the <b>hyperergic</b> development by influencing the metabolic pathway. Therefore, we turned our attention to the blood proteins and were inclined to see a pathogenically important symptom in the increase o...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that chronic low-grade infection, or numerous localized foci of inflammation induced in the rabbit by repeated minute inoculations with relatively avirulent (green or indifferent) streptococci, evoke a state of hypersensitivity to the bacteria (1, 2). This hypersensitivity may be demonstrated by hyperreaction to minute doses injected intracutaneously, by an ophthalmic reaction following application of the bacteria to the scarified cornea, and by death in from 24 to 48 hours after intravenous doses tolerated by normal animals (2). Suitable preliminary intravenous inoculations result in another type of response; the characteristic <b>hyperergic</b> reactions are not induced; skin lesions are smaller than in normal animals and quickly assume a hard nodular character without much macroscopic evidence of edema; ophthalmic tests are negative; the responses are those of immune animals (3).

A rabbit may react to intracutaneous inoculation with non-hemolytic streptococci in one of four ways, depending on whether it is normal, hypersensitive, immune or cachectic. Most normal animals show a secondary reaction about 10 days after inoculation with suitable strains of non-hemolytic streptococci; hypersensitive, allergic, or <b>hyperergic</b> animals show much larger lesions than do normals with the corresponding doses of the same streptococci, and practically never show secondary reactions; immune animals show smaller and harder early lesions and usually do not have secondary reactions if they are fairly well immunized.

40|$|The {{results of}} gross and {{microscopic}} observations and survival tests after subcutaneous infection of mice with Type I pneumococci {{can be summarized}} as follows: Normal mice possessed no adequate means of protection against this organism. The bacteria disseminated freely through the tissue spaces {{in the presence of}} widespread inflammation, and were not ingested by significant numbers of host cells. Macrophages mobilized in the subcutis by intraperitoneal vaccinations with homologous killed organisms promptly ingested the living bacteria subsequently introduced. The cocci were sharply localized and destroyed in the presence of minimal amounts of exudation, edema and necrosis. Bacterial localization accompanied a similar hypoergic reaction after passive immunization. When a <b>hyperergic</b> response was induced by repeated local, in addition to intraperitoneal, vaccinations, prompt phagocytosis by macrophages, as after intraperitoneal vaccination alone, was again the outstanding means of disposal of the organisms. The heightened exudation, edema and local necrosis resembled a harmful rather than an important localizing reaction. Immunity was not dependent upon a <b>hyperergic</b> reaction. Prompt in vivo agglutination of living bacteria after passive immunization was an important early localizing phenomenon. After either active or passive immunization, phagocytosis was the only means observed by which the organisms were destroyed. Thus localization and destruction of the bacteria in immunized mice were dependent both on bacterial changes caused by specific antibody and on phagocytic activities of host cells. A viscous gum acacia medium caused a transient delay in bacterial dissemination, but the organisms ultimately became widely scattered in the tissues of the abdominal wall. The animals died earlier, with more extensive and destructive lesions than when the bacteria were introduced in a saline medium. In distinct contrast, the pneumococci were as a rule sharply localized and destroyed when injected in an acacia medium containing a small amount of immune serum. After local active immunization, sufficient to protect about half the animals subsequently infected by pneumococci in a saline medium, extensive and destructive lesions and death of the mice followed introduction of the organisms in acacia. It was suggested that the more viscous medium may have hindered diffusion of immune bodies from the tissues into the inoculum...|$|E

Development of systemic inflammation (SI) was evaluated by appropriate integral criteria. An association was established between SI development and critical complications in the both groups of patients. Meanwhile, <b>hyperergic</b> variants of SI development associated with high cytokine levels, proved to prevail in acute sepsis. On the contrary, hypoergic variants were more common in cases of tertiary peritonitis, being characterized by relatively low levels of cytokines, along with higher probability of other SI syndromes and risks of lethal outcomes. In summary, systemic inflammatory events in acute versus prolonged sepsis may proceed by different pathogenetic pathways. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of chronic}} chagasic cardiopathy {{is still a}} debated matter. In this review, the main theories raised about it since the first description of the disease in 1909 by Carlos Chagas, are considered. The scarcity of T. cruzi parasites into the myocardium and the apparent lack of correlation between their presence and the occurrence of myocardial inflammatory infiltrate, have originated many theories indicating that chronic Chagas' cardiopathy is an autoimmune disease. Recently however, papers using immunohistochemical technique or PCR have demonstrated a strong association between moderate or severe myocarditis and presence of T. cruzi Ags, indicating a direct participation of the parasite in the genesis of chronic chagasic myocarditis. Different patterns of cytokine production seem to have {{important role in the}} outcome of the disease. Participation of the microcirculatory alterations and fibrosis as well as the relationship with the parasite are also emphasized. Finally, the author suggests that the indeterminate form of the disease occurs when the host immunological response against the parasite is more efficient while the chronic cardiopathy occurs in patients with <b>hyperergic</b> and inefficient immune respons...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{sensitization}} of rabbits {{to horse}} serum {{have shown that}} there is a close parallel between the serum precipitins and the occurrence and severity of local anaphylactic sensitivity and indicate that the Arthus phenomenon depends upon the union within the tissues of circulating precipitin and its specific antigen (Opie (1), Culbertson (2), Cannon and Marshall (3)). No such correlation has been demonstrated in animals sensitized to various microorganisms. There is, however, evidence to suggest that bacterial hypersensitivity may depend upon the presence of specific antibodies (Rich (4)). The general trend of cutaneous sensitivity may be parallel to that of antibody formation, but in individual instances or at a given time such a correlation is not demonstrable (Julianelle (5), Schultz and Swift (6), Angevine (7)). The lack of parallel between the cutaneous sensitiveness to bacteria and the circulating antibodies might be explained by a difference between the antibody content of the tissues in which <b>hyperergic</b> reactions take place and the titre of circulating antibodies (Opie (8)).

The importance of this vitamin for body balance has been understood in more detail since the amount of ascorbic acid in the organs and fluids of the body and its urinary excretion have been amenable to determination. It has been found that a pronounced vitamin C deficiency exists not only in the ailments named after Skorbut and Möller-Barlow, the terminal states of a vitamin C deficiency, but also in many other disease states, such as hemorrhagic diathesis, bone diseases, dyspepsia, adrenal insufficiency, allergic conditions, intoxications, pregnancy and particularly infectious diseases. A. Hochwald, Prague, has demonstrated — especially for the so-called <b>hyperergic</b> diseases whose histological expression is fibrinous inflammation according to Rössle — that extra consumption and a resulting deficiency of reducing substances arises during the antigen/antibody reaction that takes place in the body, whereby leading to cell damage and the formation of histamine-like substances that are capable of triggering toxic phenomena as severe as anaphylactic shock. As a result of adequately administering such reducing substances, there has been success in preventing this effect and, hence, in favorably modifying the course of the disease.

It {{is used as a}} specific test during mass population screening on tuberculosis (mass tuberculin diagnostics) and for individual examinations (individual tuberculin diagnostics). The aims of the mass diagnostics are: revealing of the patients contaminated with MBT for the first time; revealing of the patients with <b>hyperergic</b> and increasing reactions to tuberculin; selection of the population for vaccination against tuberculosis with weakened BCG vaccine in infants older than 2 months of life who had not been vaccinated after birth, as well for re-vaccination with BCG vaccine; early diagnostics of tuberculosis in children and adolescents; determination of epidemiological characteristics of tuberculosis (population contamination with MBT, yearly risk of contamination with MBT). On mass tuberculin diagnostics it is used only the united intradermal tuberculin Mantoux test with 2 tuberculin units (TU) of purified tuberculin in standard solution (prepared form). In the article the author discusses questions of tuberculosis diagnostics in children and adolescents, lists indications to mass tuberculin diagnostics with Mantoux test with 2 TU PPD and test with recombinant tuberculosis allergen. Advantages of both methods, which should be used in order to increase efficacy of tuberculosis diagnostics among children population, are described. It was concluded that switch to the mass screening of tuberculosis with the means of recombinant tuberculosis allergen is not rational under current conditions.

40|$|Studies {{were made}} on the antigen-antibody {{reactions}} in Ectromelia virus hepatitis and the following results were obtained: 1) Elementary body in the parenchymal cells of the liver was always observed {{on the third day}} after the intraperitoneal inoculation of Ectromelia virus, regardless of the amount inoculated. Inclusion body was found in some instances to which a rather larger amount of the virus was inoculated. The changes in chick hemoagglutinin in the blood appeared to be almost {{similar to those of the}} elemetary and inclusion bodies. 2) Regardless of the amount of virus inoculated, antivirus complement fixation antibody, which was directly produced by viral infection, and hemoagglutinin inhibitor were noted in an early stage of the infection with their highest titres at 6 th to 10 th days. However, somewhat lower titres of those antibodies in the blood were observed when a larger amount of virus was inoculated. 3) Auto-liver antibody was continuously noted, even rather low titer, during the later stage of the infection (after 21 st day), when a small amount of virus inoculated, and there were marked generalized pathological reactions of the mesenchymal tissue and <b>hyperergic</b> processes such as proliferative demarcation to fibrosis of necrotic parenchymal liver cells. Simultaneously, the auto-liver antibody presented positive cross-reactions with some of soluble infected liver tissue component and liver-phosphatid-antigen (mouse and rabbit). 4) When a small amonnt of virus inoculated the organ-antibodies to soluble infected liver tissue component, which was so-called accompanied substance with infection, were produced in the early stage of infection and had been maintained for a considerable period of time. Changes in the organ-antibodies were almost similar to those of anti-virus antibodies in the early stage and then to those of auto-liver antibodies in the later stage. Heterophile antibody (Paul-Bunnell reaction) was noted in the early stage, while anti-liver phosphatid antibody was noted in the later stage. 5) Changes in γ-globulin were considered to be closely related to the production of antibodies despite the fact that serum protein was affected by infection because of decreased production of albumin in the early stage of infection and also of participation of globulin from unspecific necrosis of parenchymal liver cells. 6) When a small amount of virus inoculated the positive direct-Coomb's antibody, which was an incomplete antibody, appeared in the early stage of the infection. In view from the changes in the positive direct Coomb's antibody, not only such incomplete antibody in specific γ-globulin type but also those factors as adhesion of virus to erythrocytes and influence of affected serum albumin by infection upon surface potential of erythrocytes appeared to play significant roles in the direct Coomb's test. 7) In view from the alternations of the antigen antibody system and histological findings in the viral infection, different mechanisms of antibody production between anti-virus and auto-liver antibodies were postulated. 8) When a large amount of virus inoculated, histological feature of the liver and spleen of the infected mouse was a rapidly progressing unspecific exudative inflammation like Arthus's phenomenon. When a small amount of virus inoculated, a relatively mild <b>hyperergic</b> productive inflammation in which colliquative necrotic foci of parenchymal cells were demarcated by mesenchymal cells and then became nodular was noted. 9) At any rate, an allergic process was observed in the Ectromelia virus infection regardless of the amount of the virus inoculated since that was a feature of the virus as a obligatory parasite...|$|E

A mean disease incidence of 6. 0 per 100, 000 person-years and an average prevalence of 1 % {{has been reported in}} Europe. HS has the highest impact on patients' quality of life among all assessed dermatological diseases.

40|$|The {{etiology}} {{of the human}} disease, glomerulonephritis, remains unknown. Certain observations in this condition suggest that it may depend, in part at least, on a <b>hyperergic</b> state of the tissues. While various authors have attempted by different methods to produce experimental nephritis simulating the human affliction, only those investigations dealing with cytotoxins will be discussed. This communication presents a study of certain of the factors in the anti-organ sera responsible for the induction of renal abnormalities. LITERATURE Lindemann (I), in 1900, influenced by the production of hemolysins (2) and spermatolysins (3), injected guinea pigs with rabbit kidney, and obtained from these animals a serum which induced in rabbits marked albuminuria, cast formation, and tubular degeneration. Pearce (4) subsequently investigated this subject and confirmed the claims of Lindemann and others (5 - 7) regarding {{the existence of a}} heteronephrotoxin, but was unable to produce an autonephrotoxin (5, 7 - 9). He showed, moreover, (4, 10) that many of the so called specific anti-organ sera then in use depended for their effect on the hemagglutinins and hemolysins which they contained, and consequently introduced the technique of perfusing the organs used for antigens. Anti&idney serum made with such an antigen induced albuminuria and cylindruria, whereas antiserum prepared by immunizing with unwashed kidney induced an additional feature, hematuria. The high hemolysin and hemagglutinin titer of the latter serum, he felt, was responsible for the hematuria. Even the antiserum against perfused kidney tissue was only relatively organ specific [...] "special " is the term he applied [...] since certain immune sera prepared against perfused liver induced similar kidney changes.

Methods: Previously untreated patients (pts) with SCLC and measurable or evaluable disease were randomized to receive either cisplatin 50 mg/m 2 on days 1 - 2 or carboplatin 300 mg/m 2 on day 1, both combined with etoposide 300 mg/ m 2 on days 1 - 3 every 21 days for 6 treatment cycles. The vast majority of responding limited disease (LD) pts and complete responders (CR) with extensive disease (ED), also received thoracic irradiation (TI) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) concurrently with the third cycle. Results: Of the 147 patients registered, 143 were eligible; median performance status (PS, WHO) was 1, and tumour stage was LD in 41 pts of each treatment group. The mean delay between cycles was 8 days in the EP group and 9 in the EC group increasing in both arms {{with the number of}} treat-ment courses. The drug dose administered per unit time as a proportion of the protocol dose was 74 % and 80 % for the two groups respectively.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the age-related {{features}} of an adrenergic response of {{the central nervous system}} to acute somatic pain (ASP). Subjects and methods: The spinal cord (SC) levels of adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA), and dopamine (DA) were studied in albino male rats of five age groups: 1) neonatal (2 — 4 -day) rats; 2) 17 — 18 -day rats that began to see; 3) monthly rats; 4) sexually mature (3 — 4 month) ones; and 5) old ones aged over 2 years. ASP was reproduced by electrodermal stimulation of the rat tail; the levels of catecholamines (CA) were measured by spectrofluorimetric microassay. Results. During postnatal ontogenesis, the rats were found to have a phase pattern of physiological changes in the spinal concentrations of CA: a decrease in their high neonatal levels (due to DA) by the time the animals began to see; their progressive increase by prepuberty (due to NA) and in sexually maturity (due to A and DA), and a reduction in all CA fractions in old rats. ASP was attended by a rise in the SC concentration of CA in the neonatal animals and by clearly-cut reactive shifts in all fractions in the old ones. With A and DA increases, the SC concentrations of NA halved in the rats that began to see and had ASP; the amount of CA remained unchanged as compared with the controls. In prepubertal and sexually mature male rats, there was a reduction in the spinal CA pool, but due to different components: to A and NA in 35 -day rats and to A and DA in 3 -month ones. Conclusion. Age-related changes in the pattern of a spinal CA response in rats with ASP show a ontogenetic trend in the development of adrenal responsiveness from the immature generalized forms of an early postnatal period to the definitive differentiated economic reactions of the hypo-to-normergic type and then to the <b>hyperergic</b> destructive reactions of old age.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Prevalence of {{allergic}} diseases {{increases with}} every decade, which {{is determined by}} climatic changes, global warming, lengthening of season of pollination, anthropogenic loading on atmospheric air. Objective of the research — to study hypersensitivity to the main allergens in children with allergic diseases {{based on the results}} of skin allergy testing, as well as to analyze the structure of diseases. Materials and methods. We have examined 228 children using skin prick testing, the estimation of results was conducted 25 – 40 minutes after performing the test. Associations between the results of skin prick test with various allergens were studied using cross-correlation analysis in the package of applied statistics Statistics 6. 0. Results. 85. 5  % of children were sensitized to the pollen allergens, domestic — 54  %, food — 21  %, fungal allergens — 35  %. Among pollen plants, there prevails sensitization to ambrosia — 47. 8  %, sunflower — 49. 5  %, cyclachaena — 38. 5  %; among domestic allergens — to the tick species D. рteronyssinus and D. farinae — 24  %, cat hair — 19. 7  %, among fungal — to Alternaria (23  %). Most often <b>hyperergic</b> reaction (papule diameter ≥  8 mm) was observed to cyclachaena (44  %), sunflower (46  %), ambrosia (50  %), cat hair (42  %), D. farinae (39  %). We have established significant (р < 0. 05) correlations of mainly middle strength between positive prick-tests in pairs: ambrosia — cyclachaena (r = + 0. 43), ambrosia — sunflower (r = + 0. 43), acarus D. рteronyssinus — D. farinae (r = + 0. 66), mixture «birch, alder, oak, hazel» — ryegrass (r = + 0. 53), beef meat — egg yolk (r = + 0. 42), pork meat — chicken meat (r = + 0. 35), milk (r = + 0. 36), wool of sheep — pork (r = + 0. 36). Conclusion. Predominance of sensitization to pollen allergens represents the epidemiological situation in the South region of Ukraine. The presence of correlations between the different types of allergens indicates the cross reactions between them. In case of multiple positive results of skin allergen tests, the study using molecular allergy diagnostic method is recommended to establish genuine or cross allergy...|$|E
40|$|Os Autores descrevem um caso grave de esquistossomose mansoni (forma hepática com hipertensão portal associada a forma pulmonar com hipertensão pulmonar e cor pulmonalej sobre o qual evoluiu uma sindrome toxi-infectuosa grave e de longa duração. Sucessivos exames radiológicos do tórax revelaram acometimento predominantemente arteriolar, ao lado de uma micronodulação pulmonar grosseira e difusa em ambos os hemitóraces e configuração de coração pulmonar. A histopatologia de {{material}} de biópsia pulmonar identificou basicamente uma arterite pulmonar característica, inflamação granulomatosa atípica provocada principalmente por vermes e raros ovos de S. mansoni envolvidos por escassa reação inflamatória. Para explicar a origem de constelação clínica toxi-infectuosa, foram afastadas as hipóteses de associação da esquistossomose a concausas infectuosas ou não, mas de curso febril, e a superposição de uma forma toxêmica sobre outra crônica pré-existente. Com base em dados clínicos, particularmente em subsídios da laparoscopia, e anatômicos, concluiu-se tratar o caso de uma forma crônica de esquistossomose reativada, provavelmente em virtude de alterações imunológicas inusitadas do hospedeiro. Ao que tudo parece indicar, o desvio de ovos e de vermes aos pulmões deveu-se à sindrome de hipertensão portal, cujos shunts entre a circulação portal e sistêmica determinaram a rota preferencial da migração. The Authors relate a case ofsevere schistosomiasis mansoni (hepatic form, with portal hypertension, {{associated with}} pulmonary form, with pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale), o ver which develloped a severe toxi-infectious syndrome of long duration. Serial chest X-rays {{showed that the}} arteriolae were predominantly affected, besides a gross and difuse pulmonary micronodulation in both hemithoraces, and pulmonary heart configuration. Histopathology of the pulmonary biopsy material identified basically a pulmonary arteritis characteristic of chronic pulmonary schistosomiasis and, simultaneously, the presence of schistosomatous granulomata in <b>hyperergic</b> reaction mainly produced by worms, {{one of the main}} anatômica! characteristics of the toxemic form. To explain the origin of the clinical toxi- infectious constelation, the hypotheses of an association with a co-existing infectious, or not infectious but fever producing cause, and of the superposition of a toxemic form over a pre-existing chronic one were eliminated. It was concluded, on the basis of clinical data, particularly those furnished by laparoscopy and the anatomical onas, that this a chronic case of schistosomiasis reactivated probably by the host uncommon immunological alteration. Everything points to the possibility that the unusual detour of the eggs, and of the worms to the lungs was due to the portal hypertension syndrome, and that the preferential route of this migration was determined by the shunts involving the portal and systemic circulations...|$|E
40|$|O trabalho refere as observações feitas em 1947 em um foco de leishmaniose muco-cutânea na Baixada Fluminense (Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil). A existência da moléstia como uma endemia na região foi comprovada pelo encontro de 21 cicatrizes típicas, reagindo positivamente à intradermo-reação com antígeno específico, algumas datando de 5 a 15 anos. Na época dos trabalhos, entretanto, foi constatado um "surto epidêmico", o qual coincidira com uma grande derrubada florestal para fabrico de carvão vegetal. De 306 pessoas examinadas (cêrca de 50 % da população local), foram encontradas 39 com lesões leishmanióticas (12, 7 %). Dentro e fora dos domicílios foram capturados Phlebotomus intermedius. Em 12 cães examinados foi encontrado um com diagnóstico provável da moléstia. Quinze gatos examinados mostraram-se negativos e, do mesmo modo, 28 mamíferos silvestres de pequeno porte. Dos 39 paciente, 4 tinham lesões mucosas (10, 3 %); 16 apresentavam lesões múltiplas (41, 0 %); e 19 eram mulheres (48, 7 %). Havia absoluta predominância das lesões nas partes descobertas do corpo. Cêrca de 1 / 3 dos casos era em crianças até 10 anos, atestando uma intensa transmissão domiciliária. Existiam casas com 2 a 6 enfermos. Com base nos informes dos pacientes ou responsáveis quanto ao tempo de doença (e admitindo-se um período incubativo médio de 2 meses), conclui-se que, provàvelmente, a grande maioria das infecções se dera entre julho e novembro, coincidindo com a derrubada florestal acima citada. Em 36 casos foi feita a intradermo-reação de Montenegro, obtendo-se respostas duvidosas em 2 e positivas em 34, com intensidade variável. Foram feitas 18 biópsias. Na epiderme havia hiperacantose e, freqüentement, pseudoepiteliomatose com globos córneos e microabcessos; e na derme observaram-se 2 quadros característicos: ou um infiltrado de plasmócitos predominantes, ou uma reação granulomatosa, os quais, às vêzes, se associavam. Em geral, a granulomatose ocorria nos casos mais antigos, isolada ou associada à infiltração, que predominava nos casos mais recentes da enfermidade. A granulomatose traduziria um estado hiperérgico do organismo, uma vez que os indivífuos que a apresentaram tinham maior tempo de doença e reagiam fortemente à intradermo-reação. As leishmanias nunca se mostraram muito numerosas nos cortes estudados. Em 3 paciente foi observada cura espontânea. Foram tratados 26 doentes, sendo 18 com tártaro emético, 4 com "fuadina" e 4 com ambos os remédios. O tártaro mostrou-se tóxico, embora desse resultados tão bons quanto a "fuadina". Dois paciente com lesões da mucosa nasal não se curaram completamente, não obstante terem recebido ambos os remédios. Cinco anos depois dêste inquérito contatou-se pràticamente a extinção dêste foco de leishmaniose. Durante êsse tempo tinham sido feitas aspersões domiciliárias periódicas com o DDT para combate à malária (NERY GUIMARÃES & BUSTAMANTE, 1953). The paper {{reports a}} survey {{made in a}} focus of muco-cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} in a locality of the lowlands of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Baixada Fluminense). The existence of the disease as an endemic of the region was confirmed by the finding of 21 cases with typical scars and responding positively to Montenegro's intradermo-reaction with specific antigen {{and some of them}} dating back from 5 to 15 years. At the time of the survey, however, an epidemic outbreak was discovered, coincidig with a great felling of trees for the making of charcoal. Out of 306 persons examined (50 % of the local population), 39 presented leishmaniotic lesions (12, 7 %). Both within the houses and outside, adults Phlebotomus intermedius were captured. From 12 houses, 136 specimens were captured (11, 3 per house). Out of 23 dogs examined, one was found with a probable diagnosis of elishmaniasis. Fifteen cats were found negative, as well as 28 small wild mammals. From the 39 patients, 4 had mucous lesions (10, 3 %), 16 presented multiple lesions (41, 0 %), and 19 were female (48, 7 %). There was an absolute predominance of lesions on bare parts of the body. About one third of the cases were children of 10 years or less, confirming the intense domiciliary transmission. Some houses had 2 to 6 patients. On basis of informations furnished by the patients of by their relatives as to the time elapsed {{since the beginning of the}} infection, and admitting an incubation period of 2 months, it is possible to conclude that the great majority of infections probably occurred between July and December, coinciding with the great felling of trees already referred to. In 36 cases Montenegro's intradermo-reaction was made, with 2 doubtful and 34 positive results of variable intensity. Eighteen biopsies were made, the epidermis presenting hyperacanthosis, and frquently pseudoepitheliomatosis with corneous globules and micro-abscesses. The dermis showed two characteristic pictures: an infiltration with predominance of plasmocytes or a granulomatous lesion with epithelioid and giant cells. In general, granulomatosis occurred in older cases, isolated or associated to infiltration with plasmocytes. It seems that granulomatosis represents a <b>hyperergic</b> condition of the infected organism, as the patients who showed it had the disease for a longer time and reponded strongly to the intradermo-reaction. Leishmaniae were not numerous in sections. Three patients showed spontaneous cure. Twenty six patients were treated, 16 with tartar emetic, 4 with "fuadin" and 4 with both these drugs. Some of the patients treated with tartar showed toxic symptoms, although the results were as good as those obtained with "fuadin". Two patients with nasal mucous lesions were not cured, notwithstanding the use of both these drugs. Five years after this survey, muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis was absent from the region, probably as a consequence of several preiodical DDT house sprayings to combate malaria during the intervening years (NERY GHIMARÃES & BUSTAMANTE, 1953) ...|$|E
