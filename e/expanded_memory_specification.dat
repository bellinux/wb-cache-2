25|$|The first PC {{operating}} systems to integrate such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988. Since the 80286 version of Windows 2.0 (Windows/286), Windows applications {{did not suffer}} from the 640 KB barrier. Prior to DOS extenders, if a user installed additional memory and wished to use it under DOS, they would first have to install and configure drivers to support either <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> <b>specification</b> (EMS) or extended memory specification (XMS).|$|E
50|$|QEMM {{provides}} {{access to}} the Upper Memory Area (UMA) and memory through the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Specification</b> (EMS), Extended Memory Specification (XMS), Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) and DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Specification</b> or EMS is the {{specification}} {{describing the}} use of expanded memory. EMS functions are accessible through software interrupt 67h. Programs using EMS must first establish {{the presence of an}} installed expanded memory manager by checking for a device driver with the device name EMMXXXX0.|$|E
50|$|Upper memory blocks can {{be created}} by mapping {{extended}} memory into the upper memory area when running in virtual x86 mode. This is similar to how <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> can be emulated using extended memory so this method of providing upper memory blocks is usually provided by the <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> manager (for example EMM386). Ironically the application programming interface for managing the upper memory blocks is specified in the eXtended <b>Memory</b> <b>Specification.</b>|$|R
50|$|Intel {{processors}} {{from the}} 386 onward allowed a virtual 8086 mode, which simplified the hardware required to implement <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> for DOS applications. <b>Expanded</b> <b>memory</b> managers such as Quarterdeck's QEMM product and Microsoft's EMM386 supported the <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> standard without requirement for special memory boards.|$|R
5000|$|Allocation {{and use of}} <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> was not {{transparent}} to application programs. The application had to {{keep track}} of which bank of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> contained a particular piece of data, and when access to that data was required, the application had to request (through a driver program) the <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> board to map that part of memory into the processor's address space. Although applications could use <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> with relative freedom, many other software components such as drivers and TSRs were still normally constrained to reside within the 640K [...] "conventional memory" [...] area, which soon became a critically scarce resource.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} IBM PC restricted {{programs to}} 640 KB but an <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> <b>specification</b> {{was used to}} implement a bank switching scheme that fell out of use when later operating systems, such as Windows, used the larger address ranges of newer processors and implemented their own virtual memory schemes.|$|E
50|$|The first PC {{operating}} systems to integrate such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988. Since the 80286 version of Windows 2.0 (Windows/286), Windows applications {{did not suffer}} from the 640 KB barrier.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the 80386, the memory management features were enhanced to allow the system to be shifted into protected mode but also allowing the addresses to be configured in a virtual 8086 mode so that the extended memory could be mapped into addressing frames and accessible to real-mode programs such as DOS. This allowed a 386 to implement the LIM (Lotus, Intel, Microsoft) EMS (<b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> <b>specification).</b> The memory manager was easily controlled by the user with DOS program QEMM.COM.|$|E
50|$|The name EMM386 {{was used}} for the <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> {{managers}} of both Microsoft's MS-DOS and Digital Research's DR-DOS, which created <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> using extended memory on Intel 80386 CPUs. There also is an EMM386.EXE available in FreeDOS.|$|R
50|$|IBM {{developed}} their own <b>memory</b> standard called <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> Adapter (XMA); the IBM DOS driver for it was XMAEM.SYS. Unlike EMS, the IBM expansion boards could be addressed both using an <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> model and as extended <b>memory.</b> The <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> hardware interface used by XMA boards is however incompatible with EMS. A XMA2EMS.SYS driver provided however EMS emulation for XMA boards. XMA boards were first introduced for the 1986 (revamped) models of the 3270 PC.|$|R
50|$|Later, some {{motherboard}} chipsets of Intel 80286-based computers implemented an <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> {{scheme that}} did not require add-on boards, notably the NEAT chipset. Typically, software switches determined how much memory should be used as <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> and how much should be used as extended memory.|$|R
50|$|Hardware {{extensions}} allowed {{access to}} more memory than the 8086 CPU could address through paging memory. This memory was known as expanded memory. An industry de facto standard {{was developed by the}} LIM consortium, composed of Lotus, Intel and Microsoft. This standard was the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Specification</b> (EMS). Pages of memory from expanded memory hardware were accessible through an addressing window placed into a free area in the UMA space, and by exchanging it for other pages when needed to access other memory. EMS supported 16 MB of space.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985 the {{companies}} Lotus and Intel introduced <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Specification</b> (EMS) 3.0 {{for use in}} IBM PC compatible computers running MS-DOS. Microsoft joined for versions 3.2 in 1986 and 4.0 in 1987 and the specification became known as Lotus-Intel-Microsoft EMS or LIM EMS. It {{is a form of}} bank switching technique that allows more than the 640 KB of RAM defined by the original IBM PC architecture, by letting it appear piecewise in a 64 KB [...] "window" [...] located in the Upper Memory Area. The 64 KB is divided into four 16 KB [...] "pages" [...] which can each be independently switched. Some computer games made use of this, and though EMS is obsolete, the feature is nowadays emulated by later Microsoft Windows operating systems to provide backwards compatibility with those programs.|$|E
50|$|Specifications were {{developed}} to allow access to additional memory. The first was the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Specification</b> (EMS) which originally allowed memory on an add-on card to be accessed via a 64 KB page frame in the reserved upper memory area. 80386 and later systems could use a virtual 8086 mode (V86) mode memory manager like EMM386 to create expanded memory from extended memory without the need of an add-on card. The second specification was the Extended Memory Specification (XMS) for 80286 and later systems. This provided a way to copy data to and from extended memory, access to the 65520-byte High Memory Area (HMA) directly above the first megabyte of memory and the Upper Memory Block (UMB) area. Generally XMS support was provided by HIMEM.SYS or a V86 mode memory manager like QEMM or 386MAX which also supported EMS.|$|E
50|$|This {{insertion}} of a memory {{window into the}} peripheral address space could originally be accomplished only through specific expansion boards, plugged into the ISA expansion bus of the computer. Famous 1980s <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> boards were AST RAMpage, IBM PS/2 80286 Memory Expansion Option, AT&T <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> Adapter and the Intel Above Board. Given the price of RAM during the period, up to several hundred dollars per MiB, and the quality and reputation of the above brand names, an <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> board was very expensive.|$|R

5000|$|Expanded {{memory is}} an {{umbrella}} term for several incompatible technology variants. The {{most widely used}} variant was the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Specification</b> (EMS), which was developed jointly by Lotus Software, Intel, and Microsoft, so that this specification was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "LIM EMS." [...] LIM EMS had several versions. The first widely implemented version was EMS 3.2, which supported up to 8 MB of expanded memory and uses parts of the address space normally dedicated to communication with peripherals (upper memory) to map portions of the expanded memory. EEMS, an expanded memory management standard competing with LIM EMS 3.x, was developed by AST Research, Quadram and Ashton-Tate; it could map any area of the lower 1 MB. EEMS ultimately was incorporated in LIM EMS 4.0, which supported up to 32 MB of expanded memory and provided some support for DOS multitasking as well. IBM however created its own expanded memory standard called XMA.|$|E

50|$|Extended memory {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>expanded</b> <b>memory,</b> an earlier method for expanding the IBM PC's memory capacity beyond 640 kB (655,360 bytes) using an expansion card with bank switched memory modules. Because of the available support for <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> in popular applications, device drivers were developed that emulated <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> using extended memory. Later two additional methods were developed allowing direct access to a small portion of extended memory from real mode. These memory areas are referred to as the high memory area (HMA) and the upper memory area (UMA; also referred to as upper memory blocks or UMBs).|$|R
50|$|The third line loads the EMM386 memory manager, which emulates <b>expanded</b> <b>memory.</b> The {{command line}} {{argument}} RAM allows {{the use of}} the upper memory area. Another argument that can be given to EMM386.EXE is NOEMS, which allows use of the upper memory area without emulating <b>expanded</b> <b>memory.</b> The NOEMS switch also frees up more upper memory blocks.|$|R

50|$|As memory prices declined, {{application}} {{programs such}} as spreadsheets and computer-aided drafting were changed {{to take advantage of}} more and more physical memory in the system. Virtual memory in the 8088 and 8086 was not supported by the processor hardware, and disk technology of the time would make it too slow and cumbersome to be practical. <b>Expanded</b> <b>memory</b> was a system that allowed application programs to access more RAM than directly visible to the processor's address space. The process was a form of bank switching. When extra RAM was needed, driver software would temporarily make a piece of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> accessible to the processor; when the data in that piece of memory was updated, another part could be swapped into the processor's address space. For the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT, with only 20 address lines, special-purpose <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> cards were made containing perhaps a mebibyte, or more, of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory,</b> with logic on the board to make that memory accessible to the processor in defined parts of the 8088 address space.|$|R
