40|$|This article can {{be viewed}} as an attempt to explore the {{consequences}} of two propositions. (1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of <b>intentionality</b> <b>The</b> main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> relevant <b>intentionality.</b> These two propositions <b>have</b> <b>the</b> following consequences (3) The explanation of how <b>the</b> brain produces <b>intentionality</b> cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would <b>have</b> to duplicate <b>the</b> causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4...|$|R

40|$|Searle's {{philosophical}} {{construction of}} social reality has three basic 2 ̆ 2 building blocks 2 ̆ 2 : collective intentionality, constitutive rules, and {{the imposition of}} functions. This article {{will focus on the}} first of these, collective intentionality, which is taken to be the central span on the bridge from physics to society. Searle analyzes this notion in terms of his own internalist theory of intentionality. In his view, we could <b>have</b> all <b>the</b> collective <b>intentionality</b> we <b>have</b> even if we were a brain in a vat, i. e., even if we were radically mistaken about the outside world.

40|$|Several {{conditions}} {{for being an}} intrinsically intentional agent are put forward. On a first level of <b>intentionality</b> <b>the</b> agent <b>has</b> representations. Two kinds are described: cued and detached. An agent with both kinds is able to represent both what is prompted by the context and what is absent from it. An intermediate level of intentionality is achieved by having an inner world, that is, a coherent system of detached representations that model the world. The inner world is used, e. g., for conditional and counterfactual thinking. Contextual or indexical representations are necessary in order that the inner world relates to the actual external world and thus {{can be used as}} a basis for action. To <b>have</b> full-blown <b>intentionality,</b> <b>the</b> agent should also have a detached self-awareness, that is, be able to entertain self-representations that are independent of the contex...|$|R

40|$|It is an {{integral}} part of the phenomenology of mature perceptual experience that it seems to present to us an experience-independent world. I shall call this feature 'perceptual intentionality'. In this paper, I argue that perceptual intentionality is constructed by the structure of more basic sensory features, features that are not intentional themselves. This theory can explain why the same sensory feature can figure both in presentational and non-presentational experiences.

40|$|Education as {{object of}} inquiry is {{susceptible}} to multiple interpretations, which -most of them- {{run the risk of}} falling only in the understanding of structural factors or in internalist aspects. Reason why one feels like exploring routes that do not engage in a determinist paradox of the type: society determines education or education determines society. That is the reason for this document to pursue a double purpose: one show the contributions of Jon Elster {{to the study of the}} social aspect; and the other, the ludic pretension of attracting Elster for the analysis of education. The methodological individualism and the theory of the games both part from the importance of recognizing the individuals as capable of taking decisions once they <b>have</b> valued <b>the</b> <b>intentionalities</b> that may arise in the own representation of the stage to which the decision corresponds. Let’s say that there is a comprehension of the different actors before they carry out an action, which is valued in terms of the maximization of results in close relation to the interests of the ones involved. The article is divided in two great sections: the first one, a panoramic view of Jon Elster is presented, divided in a brief portrait, the context of his theoretical assumptions, the itinerary of his through his main works and his contribution about the explanation of the social. In the second one, the analysis of education is explored from the vision of the methodological individualism, for that purpose, an initial comment is offered about the meaning of such a intention, to proceed later on with the representation of different examples of maximazing the notions of Elster in the classroom and the academy...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 66 - 67) The controversy {{between the}} scientific realism of Wilfrid Sellars and the Brentano-Chisholm psychological thesis of intentionality is evaluated {{in terms of}} their explication of the notion of meaning in the context ???????????? means ___. ??? <b>The</b> <b>intentionality</b> thesis holds that the language we use to describe or express mental phenomena such as beliefs, wishes, hopes, desires, etc., cannot be reduced to or translated into a nonmental or physicalist language. Thus there are certain criteria which language used to express or describe mental phenomena, but which language used to describe nonmental phenomena fails to meet. These criteria then, constitute reliable standards for distinguishing the mental from the nonmental [...] <b>The</b> <b>intentionality</b> thesis is therefore construed as a defense of mind-body dualism and, while conceiving language to be primarily the expression of thought, as providing no causal account of thought. The scientific realism of Wilfrid Sellars is construed as an attempt to provide a causal account of thought. Thus Sellars' argument is not directed against the criteria established by <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> thesis, but towards suggesting nonmental sources for <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of thought. Sellars does not deny that an intentional language is proper for describing or expressing mental phenomena, but claims that once the semantical nature of this language is understood, it will be seen to be compatible with a metalinguistic vocabulary that pertains fundamentally to overt verbal behavior. Such compatibility would help explain both the phenomena of mental acts and mental actions and the propriety of an intentional language in behaviorism...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{asks whether}} there is a {{relation}} between action-serving and meaning-serving intentions. The idea that the intentions involved in meaning and action are nominally designated alike as intentionalities does not guarantee any special logical or conceptual connections between <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of referential thoughts and thought-expressive speech acts with <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of doing. <b>The</b> latter category is typified by overt physical actions in order to communicate by engaging in speech acts, but also includes at the origin of all artistic and symbolic expression such cerebral and linguistic doings as thinking propositional thoughts. There are exactly four possibilities by which meaning and action intentionalities might be related to be systematically investigated. Meaning-serving and action-serving intentionalities, topologically speaking, might exclude one another, partially overlap with one another, or subsume one in the other or the other in the one. The theoretical separation of the two ostensible categories of intendings is criticized, as is their partial overlap, in light of the proposal that thinking and artistic and symbolic expression are activities that favor the inclusion of paradigm meaning-serving intentions as among a larger domain of action-serving intentions. The only remaining alternative is then developed, of including action-serving intentions reductively in meaning-serving intentions, and is defended as offering in an unexpected way the most cogent universal reductive ontology in which <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of doing generally relates to <b>the</b> specific <b>intentionality</b> of referring in thought to the objects of predications, and of its artistic and symbolic expression...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} and entertaining philosophical discussions of the last few decades is the discussion between Daniel Dennett and John Searle on the existence of intrinsic <b>intentionality.</b> Dennett denies <b>the</b> existence of phenomena with intrinsic intentionality. Searle, however, is convinced that some mental phenomena exhibit intrinsic intentionality. According to me, this discussion has been obscured by some serious misunderstandings with regard to the concept 'intrinsic intentionality'. For instance, most philosophers fail to realize that it is possible that <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of a phenomenon is partly intrinsic and partly observer relative. Moreover, many philosophers are mixing up the concepts 'original intentionality' and 'intrinsic intentionality'. In fact, there is, in the philosophical literature, no strict and unambiguous definition of the concept 'intrinsic intentionality'. In this article, I will try to remedy this. I will also try to give strict and unambiguous definitions of the concepts 'observer relative intentionality', 'original intentionality', and 'derived intentionality'. These definitions will be used for an examination of <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of formal mathematical systems. In conclusion, I will make a comparison between <b>the</b> (intrinsic) <b>intentionality</b> of formal mathematical systems on the one hand, and <b>the</b> (intrinsic) <b>intentionality</b> of human beings on the other hand. © Springer 2006.

40|$|What is the {{relation}} between language and thought—or, more exactly, between the representational, or intentional, characteristics of language and those of propositional attitudes such as believing and intending? An answer many find attractive is that we must “explicate the intentional characteristics of language by reference to believing and to other psychological attitudes. ” 1 In other words, it is only our intentional mental states—believing, intending, and <b>the</b> like—that <b>have</b> original <b>intentionality,</b> intentionality that doesn’t have its source in something else’s intentionality; <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of words and speech acts is derived intentionality, intentionality inherited from that of associated mental states. That answer raises two questions: how is <b>the</b> original <b>intentionality</b> of thought to be explained, and how does <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of language “derive ” from <b>the</b> original <b>intentionality</b> of thought? <b>The</b> focus of this chapter {{will be on the}} second question, although the first question can’t be ignored entirely, and I shall touch on it in the final section of this chapter. Although many philosophers seem to accept the derivation view, hardly any of them attempt to spell out how it works. In fact, I can think of only two programs that attempt to explain how <b>the</b> <b>intentionality</b> of language reduces to that of thought, and only one of these programs ventures to reduce all questions about linguistic representation to questions about mental representation. The more ambitious program is one that derives from the Grice-inspired program of intention-based semantics (IBS); the other derives from David Lewis’s project of defining what I shall call the public-language relation. I shall start with a reconstruction of Lewis’s account of {{the relation}} in Convention 2 because a problem that immediately arises for that account provides a natural segue to the more ambitious IBS project...|$|R

Objections to this associational manner of conceiving of intentionality are responded to and evidence in support of the overall conception is provided. The paper concludes with a brief explanation of how this characterization of direction of fit applies to other domains of mental activity that exhibit intentionality...|$|R
