However, sample D has a large value of <b>accumulation</b> <b>capacitance</b> compared with the other samples before and after annealing. There are two reasons for this phenomenon.

Secondly, the use of O 3 as the oxidant improved electrical properties of the LaxAlyO films by suppressing the formation of complex interfacial layers and La(OH) 3 [24].|$|R

As high-k layer is {{on the top of}} the IL, the capacitance of high-k layer is in series of the IL capacitance. When the thickness of the IL is increased, the capacitance of the IL is decreased, and it is no longer much larger than the high-k layer capacitance. Therefore, the total capacitance (including the capacitance of the high-k layer and the IL capacitance) is decreased significantly. Generally speaking, the most obvious effect of annealing is therefore to weaken the <b>accumulation</b> <b>capacitance</b> and hence reduce the k-value.

Each system presents its own unique challenges in the drive to {{the ultimate goal of}} developing smaller, faster and lower powered devices. On silicon substrates, an in-situ analysis of hafnium oxide grown by micro e-beam deposition in an oxygen atmosphere on an ultra-thin SiO 2 buffer layer was carried out using XPS and synchrotron radiation. The self-limiting growth of an interfacial hafnium silicate layer was observed and the substrate temperature during the hafnium oxide depositions was found effect the onset temperature of hafnium silicide formation during post-deposition anneals. Hafnium oxide has also been grown ex-situ on silicon substrates by e-beam deposition in an oxygen atmosphere. The affects of an argon plasma ion assisted deposition technique (used in the growth of optical coatings to aid in film densification) and the oxygen back pressure on the growth of an interfacial oxide region were investigated by XPS. On gallium arsenide substrates, the elimination of anomalous frequency dispersion of the <b>accumulation</b> <b>capacitance</b> of GaAs high dielectric constant (high-κ) MOS devices by the use of a passivating silicon interfacial layer has been investigated. It has typically been assumed that this affect is due to a high interface state density and associated Fermi level pinning which is avoided by utilizing a high-κ/Si interface instead of the high-κ/GaAs interface. The surface treatment prior to silicon deposition is shown here to be a critical step in reducing this effect.
