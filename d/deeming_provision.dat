40|$|Two {{categories}} of alienage-jurisdiction cases have proven troublesome: cases involving permanent-resident aliens and cases involving international corporations. Jurisdiction in these categories {{depends upon the}} construction of 28 U. S. C. § 1332 ’s deeming provisions. The permanent-resident <b>deeming</b> <b>provision</b> and the corporate <b>deeming</b> <b>provision</b> operate uncontroversially to remove certain cases from federal jurisdiction, but controversy exists as to what extent they create jurisdiction {{that did not exist}} before the amendments that added the deeming provisions. The results and analytical approaches in these categories have varied, and the resulting confusion is unsatisfactory. The cases in this area are plagued by a structural flaw—while framing their analyses in terms of “clear” or “unambiguous” text, the courts have actually imposed no construction at all, instead jumping extratextually to the what-would-Congress-have-wanted question. Further, the courts faced with cases in each category have decided the cases without reference to the other category. My solution is a modest one but provides the consistency needed in a jurisdictional inquiry. I give the words “shall be deemed” a consistent construction in the two deeming provisions and resolve the missing-word problem that lurks in the background. Under my solution, the words “shall be deemed” perform a simple function in the deeming provisions—they confer State citizenship on certain litigants. But they do not strip a party of preexisting alien status. When construed this way and combined with the § 1332 (a) jurisdiction-granting subcategories, the deeming provisions create no jurisdiction that did not exist before the deeming provisions. My solution provides several benefits. First, it provides the consistency and coherence needed in a jurisdictional inquiry. Second, it is textually faithful and gives effect to the similar language used in the deeming provisions and differing language used elsewhere in § 1332. And third, it avoids the constitutional problems that arise under alternative construction. To be sure, one might conjure up scenarios where, {{in the view of the}} conjurer, exercising jurisdiction would better serve the purposes of alienage jurisdiction. But those scenarios are rare, and desirability of results cannot distort the task—giving effect to the statute. Among permissible solutions, mine yields the best results. It simply is not an acceptable method of statutory interpretation to determine: when no construction yields the construer’s desired result in every case, the statute need be given no construction except what Congress should have intended in each case...|$|E

The Explanatory Memorandum makes it clear that ‘mere membership’ of such organisation or group is sufficient to fail the character test. There is no requirement that there be a ‘demonstration of special knowledge of, or participation in, the suspected criminal conduct by the visa applicant or visa holder’ (Explanatory Memorandum, 2014, 9). Indeed, in Roach v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2016] FCA 750, Perry J concluded that this membership provision, as amended by the Character Act, is in effect a <b>deeming</b> <b>provision.</b> That is, a person who is suspected of being a member of a group or organisation that is suspected of being involved in criminal activities will automatically fail the character test (similarly to someone who has a ‘substantial criminal record’).

40|$|The {{establishing}} of {{good cause}} subsequent to a deemed dismissal, as practiced currently {{only in the}} public sector, has been a controversial issue for the courts, labour law commentators and academics alike. It has been so because {{of a number of}} legislative deficiencies which caused the inconsistent application of the <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> across the public service. Amongst others, the legislative deficiencies regarding establishing good cause are; the time-limit for establishing good cause, what happens when the employee returns, whether establishing of good cause should be entertained through written response or a hearing, the Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No. 158) is silent on the <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions,</b> review of the employer’s discretion not to reinstate the absconding employee and the legal position regarding the traditional healer’s certificate. There will be an intensive investigation on the validity of the traditional healer’s certificate. Majority of South Africans rely on the THP for a number of illnesses. In some cases, they use the traditional healer’s certificate to establish good cause subsequent to a deemed dismissal. The traditional healer’s certificate is not yet valid given the pending legislative processes. This issue will be broadly explored in order to uncover the causes for the delay in finalising this crucial issue. Most of the absconding employees have a problem of alcoholism. There is a causal relationship between deemed dismissal and alcoholism. It is again the intention of this study to fully investigate this phenomenon and provide solutions for the employers faced with this challenge. Practical solutions will be proposed for each identified legislative deficiency and any related challenge to help employers to manage the <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> in a very effective and efficient manner...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{scheme of}} the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (the Act) aims {{to prevent the}} {{diversion}} of income from the donor–parent to his minor–child. This is achieved through the <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> in the Act and the attribution rules in the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) provisions. These provisions allow the South African Revenue Services (SARS) {{to ignore the fact}} that income has accrued to the minor child and to draw the income or capital gain through to a donor–parent's income. The immediate practical issue which arises from these provisions is that the Act itself does not establish any limit to the amounts that may be attributed to the donor–parent. This research examines the limits to the amount of income and capital gains that may be attributed to a donor–parent in terms of the <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> in section 7 (3) of the Income Tax Act (the Act) and the attribution rules set out in paragraph 69 of the Eighth Schedule to the Act. The research is conducted against the background of a case study, based on a typical estate planning strategy, in terms of which an asset is sold to a trust on an interest–free loan account basis. Three key cases being, Joss v Secretary for Inland Revenue 1980 1 SA 674 (T), Ovenstone v Secretary for Inland Revenue 1980 2 SA 721 (A), and Commissioner for South African Revenue Services v Woulidge 1999 4 SA 519 (C) are examined in order to establish a practical basis for apportioning income and capital gains between the donor–parent and his minor child. The conclusion reached is that there certainly are limits to the amount of income as well as capital gains that may be attributed to a donor–parent. Importantly, in the context of estate planning, the <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions,</b> contrary to perception, {{can be seen as a}} help rather than a hindrance. They provide an opportunity for diverting income and capital gains from the donor–parent to his minor child. In addition they can be utilised to deplete donor–parent's estate in favour of the minor child or trust's estate. Master...|$|R

However, to properly consider that proposition, it is necessary to review the context within which section 40 arose, its practical effect in that context, and the perceived issues that might be addressed in New Zealand by way of a statutory deeming regime. In particular, it is necessary to acknowledge the juxtaposition of sections 40 and 54 of the Insurance Contracts Act (Cth), and the implications of section 9 of New Zealand's Insurance Law Reform Act 1977...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} and discusses the application and {{constitutionality of the}} general onus of proof provision (section 82 of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 [the “Act”]), the presumption in favour of the State when criminal sanctions are applied to an offending taxpayer (section 104 (2) of the Act) and the mechanics for imposing administrative sanctions in terms of section 76 (1) (b) of the Act. The conclusion reached is that the reverse onus presumption, as provided for in terms of section 104 (2) of the Act, is unconstitutional. It is penal in nature and offends against the constitutional right of an accused {{to a fair trial}} (sections 35 (3) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act, 108 of 1996 [the “Constitution”]). The section 36 limitation of rights clause of the Constitution does not save it. Section 76 (1) (b) of the Act read in conjunction with the <b>deeming</b> <b>provision</b> of section 76 (5) of the Act, is inextricably linked to the section 82 general reverse onus provision of the Act. Hence, when these three sections are applied together, they create a reverse onus that, prima facie, violates the right to just administrative action (section 33 of the Constitution). Regarding the general reverse onus burden as provided for in terms of section 82 of the Act, the conclusion reached is that it is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society and can therefore be regarded as constitutional.

40|$|Extract] Subdivision 108 - 0 {{contains}} <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> {{that operates}} to separate what the general law would regard as one asset into {{two or more}} assets for CGT purposes: s 108 - 50. Where Subdiv 108 - 0 applies, the principles of property law that whatever is affixed to the land {{becomes part of the}} land and an accessory thing when annexed to a principal thing becomes part of the principal thing are to be ignored for the purposes of CGT. Thus the effect of Subdiv 108 - 0 is that where it operates, the CGT provisions have to be applied separately to the "original" asset and to that part of the asset that is deemed to be a separate asset. The primary significance of Subdiv 108 - 0 in practice is to bring certain post-CGT alterations and additions to pre-CGT land, buildings, structures and other assets, within the CGT provisions. Whilst the Subdivision can also apply to treat other assets and capital improvements to post-CGT assets as separate CGT assets the significance of this has been lessened by the substitution of the CGT discount for indexation. The provisions essentially distinguish between additions and improvements to land and additions and improvements to other assets. Within the later category a distinction is drawn between post and pre-CGT assets. The commentary will, accordingly, adhere to this categorization...|$|R

40|$|Fraudsters {{periodically}} {{attempt to}} enrich themselves by employing {{a raft of}} tricks and schemes to exploit investors and financial markets. Market manipulation (‘manipulation’) is one such class of illegitimate conduct. It perverts the market price formation process and undermines public confidence in financial market integrity. An effective prohibition on manipulation is thus required to protect investors from fraud and promote market integrity, thereby fostering investment and economic growth. Chapter 1 of this thesis defines manipulation and argues that the current anti-manipulation regime, ss 1041 A– 1041 C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), requires substantive reform. This regime is predicated on a conceptually unsound understanding of manipulation. It fails to articulate the nature and role of manipulative intention {{and is based on}} an unclear distinction between civil penalties and criminal offences. As such, the scope of liability is sometimes too broad and at other times too narrow. Additionally, the provisions are internally defective, as they suffer from ambiguous language. They are also overly complex and have inconsistent physical and fault requirements. The Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) exacerbates these problems. Chapter 2 advances a two-pronged proposal for substantive law reform. Principally, two criminal prohibitions on manipulation should replace the current regime. These will prohibit a person from executing a transaction, or doing, or omitting to do, an act, when motivated by the dominant purpose of manipulating the market for, or price of, a financial product. The provisions clearly articulate the requisite manipulative intention and have an appropriate scope of liability. They are also easier to enforce than the current regime, as two <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> facilitate proof of manipulative intention. 4 The proposed regime is complemented by a Serious Financial Market Crimes Act 2014 (Cth). This contains prohibitions on manipulation and other conduct that undermines financial market integrity, reinforcing the serious criminal nature of manipulation and enhancing the credibility of ASIC’s enforcement actions. It may also motivate Parliament to articulate its policy objectives in greater detail. Together, these proposals would effectively deter manipulation and promote financial market integrity...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and {{throughout}} the 1980s a significant strand on AI and Law work involved the production of executable models of legislation. Originating in the LEGOL work of Ronald Stamper [...] {{the idea was to}} represent legislation using a formal language and to use this formalisation (typically with some sort of user interface to gather the facts of a particular case) as the basis for an expert system. This became popular, mainly using the Horn Clause subset of first order predicate calculus. In particular Sergot et al.'s representation of the British Nationality Act did much to popularise the approach. In fact, as later work showed, this was an untypically suitable piece of legislation on which to employ the approach: it was new, and so had not been amended, relatively simple and almost all of the concepts were non-technical. Later work, such as that on Supplementary Benefits, showed that larger, more complicated (containing many cross references, exceptions, counterfactuals, and <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions),</b> legislation which used many highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions) and which had been the subject of many amendments produced a far less satisfactory final system. Some efforts were made to improve matters from a software engineering perspective, especially to handle problems such as cross reference, verification and frequent amendment. The use of hierarchical representations [...] was suggested to address the first problem, and so-called isomorphic representation was intended to address the other two. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became largely absorbed in the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called ontologies), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber. Early examples in AI and Law include Valente's functional ontology and the frame based ontologies of Visser and van Kralingen. Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologies to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation.|$|R

40|$|Fundamental to any {{contract}} of employment is the obligation that rests on an employee not to be absent from work without justification. Under the common law, if an employee did that, the employer would be entitled to dismiss him or her on notice. The International Labour Organization Convention (ILO) 158 of 1982 provides that the employer must have a reason for a dismissal and sets out broad categories or reasons for dismissals. Section 23 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1998) provides that “Everyone {{has the right to}} fair labour practices”. Section 33 of the Constitution provides that “Everyone has the right to administrative action that is lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair. The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (PAJA) is designed to give effect to just administrative action. Section 1 and 3 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995 (Act 66 of 1995) (LRA) require compliance with Article 7 and 8 of the ILO Convention 158 of 1982, when the employment of a worker has been terminated by his or her employer. The LRA protects employees against unfair dismissal. In the Department of Education, Section 14 (1) (a) of the Employment of Educators Act, 1998 provides for the discharge of an educator in the event that he or she absents himself or herself from work for a period exceeding 14 consecutive days without the permission of the employer. A similar provision, Section 17 (5) (a) (i) of the Public Service Act, 1994 provides for the discharge of an officer other than an educator who absents himself or herself from his or her official duties without the permission of the Head of Department for a period exceeding one calendar month. Section 14 (2) of the Employment of Educators Act, 1998 and 17 (5) (b) of the Public Service Act, 1994 afford an employee who has been deemed discharged to show good cause why he or she should be reinstated.

Data were sourced from legislation, Parliamentary records (Hansard), case law, published research on international drug law, research on drug user behaviour and our own experience in the prosecution of drug offenders. Analysis shows that Australian deemed supply laws were introduced to overcome perceived difficulties in the prosecution and sanction of drug traffickers. Yet such laws conflict with the dominant international practice that sanctions trafficking without the use of <b>deemed</b> supply <b>provisions.</b> They contribute towards harms to users and miscarriages of justice and increase pressure to use police and prosecutorial discretion in ways that may ultimately adversely affect community confidence in the administration of the criminal law.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Laws (LLM) Workplace-related death, {{injuries}} and illness remain {{a major concern}} for Australian society in the 21 st century. This thesis addresses {{one aspect of the}} prevention of avoidable risks to occupational health and safety - the issue of how a company officer, whether a board member or other manager, may be held personally accountable for the consequences of such risks. Research shows that the potential for such personal liability is a major factor which focusses the attention of company officers on the need for due diligence in implementing safety systems. This thesis explores the limits of the legal liability of officers, both for awards of damages under civil law, and for criminal penalties. The thesis aims, as a legal doctrinal study, to demonstrate that the existing common law and statutory personal liability of company officers is already much wider than is commonly assumed. It suggests that this liability may be relied on to further the goals of effective compensation for, and prevention of, workplace accidents. It demonstrates that a company officer is not always protected by the “corporate veil” from the consequences of negligent actions or omissions which lead to death or injury of workers. A duty of care will often exist between the individual officer and workers whose safety is put at risk by a company culture which ignores or downplays safety issues. Breach of this duty may result in a substantial award of damages against the officer personally. The criminal law may also be invoked against a company officer. Where a death is involved a company may be found guilty of manslaughter. An officer may also be convicted of manslaughter, either through their own actions or omissions, or through their complicity with the company. While cases where these options will apply are rare, company officers are already subject, under specific workplace safety statutes such as the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW), to personal criminal liability if the company commits an offence. The operation and interpretation of <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> in this and similar statutes in other States is explored, through an analysis of a number of decided cases, and suggestions made to improve the effectiveness of the provisions. In particular it is recommended that these and the more general criminal provisions be used more often, in appropriate cases, to target board members of larger corporations. As recent amendments to NSW legislation confirm, a systems-based approach to the improvement of workplace safety holds out the best hope for workplace risks to be effectively dealt with. In many cases death or injury flows from a systemic management failure rather than simply from the careless action of an individual manager. Ensuring that board members are aware of their potential liability, even when they are not directly involved in the workplace, will hopefully lead to more attention being paid at higher levels to improving the culture of workplace safety in a company. Many companies already have proper workplace safety procedures in place.

They enumerate powers that the national legislature and judiciary, respectively, are permitted to exercise and thereby implicitly prohibit these two branches of government from exercising powers not enumerated. According to conventional thinking, this strategy has failed in connection with Article I and succeeded in connection with Article III. That is, it is widely acknowledged that Congress routinely exercises powers that are difficult to square with the Article I enumeration; but it is commonly thought that the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts is, in fact, limited to the nine categories of cases specified in Article III, Section 2. If one examines the crucial cases governing the constitutional limits on federal court jurisdiction, however, it becomes apparent that the enumeration in Article II, Section 2, like its cousin in Article L does little work when it comes to reining in federal power This is reflected most dramatically {{in the fact that the}} Supreme Court has never struck down a federal statute on the ground that it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts in cases lying outside the enumeration in Article III. Instead, over the years, Congress has enacted numerous jurisdictional statutes that push hard on the limits specified in Article 111, Section 2, and the Justices have consistently found ways-through a series of highly tendentious interpretive moves-to avoid <b>deeming</b> these <b>provisions</b> unconstitutional. This Article explores the similarity of our practice under Articles I and 1. It seeks to demonstrate, in particulart,h at despite the strict enumeration rhetoric that pervades the case law and scholarly commentary relating to federal court jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has shown little interest in keeping the federal courts within the subject matter limits ofArticle III, Section 2...|$|R

To this effect, the National Construction Code (NCC) 2013 stipulates the minimum energy performance for residential buildings as 114 MJ/m 2 per annum or 6 stars on an energy rating scale. Compliance with this minimum is mandatory but there are several methods through which residential buildings can be rated {{to comply with the}} <b>deemed</b> to satisfy <b>provisions</b> outlined in the NCC.

Meanwhile, Building Information Modelling (BIM), using software such as ArchiCAD has gained a foothold in the industry. The energy simulation software within ArchiCAD, EcoDesigner, enables the reporting on the energy performance based on BIM elements that contain thermal information. This research is founded on a comparative study between FirstRate 5 and EcoDesigner. Three building types were analysed and compared. The comparison finds significant differences between simulations, being, measured areas, thermal loads and potentially serious shortcomings within FirstRate 5, that are discussed along with the future potential of a fully BIM-integrated model for energy rating certification in Victoria...|$|R

'The railway company' (that is, the {{plaintiff}} in error) 'retook {{possession of the}} car and unloaded it, and in a few days sold, as perishable property, a part of the flour alleged to be damaged, and on December 23, 1910, sold the remainder. On June 3, 1910, after the Grocery Company had turned the flour back to the railway company, B. C. Prince, traffic manager of the Georgia, Florida, & Alabama Railway Company, telegraphed to the Blish Milling Company as follows: 'Flour order notify Draper-Garrett Grocery Company refused account damage. Hold at your risk and expense. Advise disposition.' On the next day the Miling Company replied by telegraphing to Prince, 'Sending our representative there. What is nature of damage?' To this Prince replied: 'Flour transferred in route. Slight damage by water, apparently rough handling. When will your representative reach Bainbridge?' The Blish Milling Company replied that its man would be there that night or the next day. On June 7 (after the Milling Company's representative had reached Bainbridge and conferred with the agents of the railway company and with the Grocery Company) the Milling Company sent a final telegram, saying, 'We will make claim against railroad for entire contents of car at invoice price. Must refuse shipment as we cannot handle.' It appears, from the evidence of Mr. Draper, that the price of flour declined after his order was given and before the flour reached Bainbridge. There U.S. 190, 194 is conflict in the evidence as to a tender of the flour by the railway company to the Milling Company's representative. According to some of the testimony, about 18 barrels of the flour had been sold by the railway company before the alleged tender was made, and therefore it was not within the power of the carrier to tender the shipment in its entirety.' The verdict in favor of the Milling Company was for $1,084.50, from which the court of appeals required a deduction of the amount of the unpaid freight, which was held to have been erroneously included. With other defenses the railway company pleaded that the shipper had failed to comply with the following provision of the bill of lading, issued by the initial carrier: 'Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be made in writing to the carrier at the point of delivery or at the point of origin within four months after the delivery of the property, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless claims are so made, the carrier shall not be liable.' This defense was overruled.

40|$|A {{charge of}} drug {{trafficking}} {{becomes the first}} test of the Victorian Charter of Human Rights in the High Court. Fiona Chong looks at the results in this High Court Watch for APO The recent case of Momcilovic v The Queen involved an appeal by Vera Momcilovic against her drug trafficking conviction. Despite giving evidence {{that she had no}} knowledge of the drugs found in her apartment, and although her partner admitted that they were his, Momcilovic was convicted in 2008 {{as a result of a}} convergence of <b>deeming</b> <b>provisions</b> in the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic) (‘Drugs Act’). In particular, section 5 of that Act provides that a substance found on the premises of a person is deemed to be in the possession of the person, unless he/she satisfies the court to the contrary. This provision, which is understood to place a legal onus on the defendant to disprove possession, runs counter to a defendant’s right to be presumed innocent. This right is protected by the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities 2006 (Vic) and formed the centrepiece of Momcilovic’s appeals in the Victorian Court of Appeal and subsequently, the High Court. The appeal was ultimately successful in the High Court on the basis that the provision in the Drugs Act had been incorrectly applied to the drug trafficking offence in Momcilovic’s case. However, the judgment is significant for reasons that transcend that particular finding – most notably for the High Court’s examination of the validity and scope of provisions in the Victorian Charter. This was the first occasion on which Australia’s most senior court squarely engaged with the Victorian Charter and the case was widely anticipated as having significance not just for that enactment and the prospect of equivalent laws in other states but also for the constitutional viability of any future national charter or bill of rights. With those issues at stake, what did the Court actually find? Rights-Compatible Statutory Interpretation By a 6 : 1 majority, the High Court upheld the validity of section 32 of the Victorian Charter – a provision that requires courts to construe legislation in a way that is ‘compatible’ with human rights, so far as it is possible to do so consistently with Parliament’s purpose. Notable, however, is the divergence of approaches taken by the six majority judges on the proper function of section 32, and in particular, its relationship with section 7 of the Victorian Charter. Section 7 provides that the human rights protected by later sections of the Charter are not absolute; rather, they may be subject to such reasonable limits as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. This raises the following question – is the operation of section 32 to be informed by section 7 ? This question was answered in the negative by three of the six majority judges (Chief Justice French and Justices Crennan and Kiefel). On this view, the court should seek to apply section 32 of the Victorian Charter to achieve an interpretation of the impugned legislation that is ‘compatible’ with human rights in their absolute and unlimited form. If this is not possible (that is, the court cannot arrive at an interpretation that does not limit a human right, consistent with the purpose of the legislation), the court is then to ascertain whether the limit is ‘reasonable’ pursuant to section 7. Hence, section 7 has no role to play in the process of interpretation, and is only engaged after the meaning of the statute has been established, and for the purpose of determining whether the court is to issue a declaration of incompatibility.    By way of contrast, the other three majority judges (Justices Gummow, Hayne and Bell) held that section 32 is to be informed by section 7. On this view, the court is to determine whether the impugned legislation limits a human right, and if so, whether that limit is ‘reasonable’ under section 7. If the limit is found to be unreasonable, the court is to apply section 32 in order to achieve an interpretation of the statute that does place reasonable limits on the right in question and is moreover consistent with the purpose of the legislation. Heydon J also took this approach; however, he did so only to find that section 32 was invalid for conferring an impermissible, non-judicial power on the courts. So, although the High Court has confirmed the validity of section 32, its operation remains unclear. Allowing section 7 to inform the application of section 32 seems the preferable view as it provides section 32 with greater remedial scope. That is, in cases where it is not possible to interpret a statute so that it does not infringe a human right, section 32 would allow the court to construe legislation so that only ‘reasonable’ limits are placed on the right, rather than requiring the court to issue a declaration of inconsistent interpretation. In contrast the Victorian Court of Appeal’s adoption of the narrower approach to section 32 led it to conclude that section 5 of the Victorian Drugs Act was incompatible with Momcilovic’s right to be presumed innocent.   Declaration of Inconsistent Interpretation The validity of such declarations of incompatibility was the second significant issue considered by the High Court in Momcilovic.   Specifically, the Court considered the validity of section 36 of the Victorian Charter, which empowers a court to issue a declaration of inconsistent interpretation if the impugned legislation cannot be interpreted so as to achieve a rights-compatible result. This mechanism is an important component of the ‘dialogue model’ of human rights protection: in this model, the court does not strike down legislation that is incompatible with human rights, but rather, alerts parliament to any such incompatibility. Parliament retains the ultimate power to determine whether the impugned provision is to be retained, amended or repealed. By 4 : 3, the High Court upheld the validity of section 36. However, again, the majority judges took different approaches in arriving at this result. Justices Crennan and Kiefel held that section 36 was valid as an exercise of power incidental to judicial power. However, they held that a declaration should not have been made by the Victorian Court of Appeal in this proceeding. By way of contrast, Chief Justice French and Justice Bell held that section 36 was valid as an exercise of non-judicial function that could permissibly be conferred upon state courts. The dissenting judges (Justices Gummow, Hayne and Heydon) held that section 36 was invalid, regardless of the level of the court, because it impermissibly impaired the constitutional integrity of the court by requiring it to perform a function incompatible with its exercise of judicial power derived from the Commonwealth Constitution. The finding of these three judges, combined with that of Justices Crennan and Kiefel, resulted in the setting aside of the declaration of inconsistent interpretation made by the Victorian Court of Appeal in this case. It is notable that although the decision in Momcilovic confirms the power of state courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility, the same result would not apply at the federal level. When the decision of the three dissenting judges (that the power under section 36 cannot be validly conferred on any court) is combined with that of Chief Justice French and Justice Bell (who hold that section 36 involves a non-judicial power), it is evident that federal courts would not be able to make a declaration of incompatibility because this would breach the separation of powers entrenched in the Australian Constitution – a principle that applies at the federal, but not state, level. Whilst this does not invalidate the entire concept of a national human rights charter – given that the power to issue a declaration of incompatibility can always be conferred on an independent, non-judicial body – the High Court decision appears to suggest that the dialogue model currently operating in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory cannot be perfectly replicated at the federal level.   All in all, the High Court judgment in Momcilovic provides a degree of clarity on the constitutional issues affecting the adoption and design of charters of human rights in Australia. However, as the range of competing views adopted by the High Court itself demonstrates, significant issues remain contested. We can expect the national, state and territory debates on the introduction of formal human rights protections to continue for so long as that is the case.
