5|$|Although this {{represented}} {{a huge number}} of available aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) was still recovering from losses suffered at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June. While units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time, pilot quality was <b>in</b> <b>clear</b> decline. Moreover, though the overall number of planes committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force that Japan had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force was capable of committing a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E

5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons {{at a number of}} sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site <b>in</b> <b>clear</b> violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased <b>in</b> <b>clear</b> plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and <b>in</b> <b>clear</b> weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft {{for the first}} time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations <b>in</b> <b>clear</b> weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E

5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, <b>in</b> <b>clear</b> breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E

5|$|Friday's late {{afternoon}} qualification session {{was divided into}} two groups lasting 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All cars were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each, with the starting order determined by the competitors' fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The session took place <b>in</b> <b>clear,</b> mild and dry weather. Hülkenberg's first timed lap of 1:55.130 surpassed the LMP1 pole position record time only to be surpassed by Hartley's 1:54.777 lap time to place the No. 17 Porsche in provisional pole position. Bernhard took over from Hartley and recorded a lap that was 0.027 seconds faster than the latter lowering the car's two-lap average time to 1:54.767 clinching pole position. It was the third consecutive event where Bernhard, Mark Webber and Hartley started from pole position.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Clear</b> Lake City, heavy {{rainfall}} collapsed {{a portion of}} a grocery store roof, killing two workers. The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern portions of Harris County; over 400homes and 40businesses were flooded. Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly halted the METRORail and closed several state roads. One person drowned after driving into a retention pond. Several people required rescue assistance, and in Comal County a car accident caused three fatalities. The passage of the storm temporarily left about 20,000electrical customers without power, though most outages were quickly restored. In San Antonio, one body was recovered from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was swept into a drainage ditch in which four others survived. In Sisterdale, two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek. In Taylor County, near Abilene, flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2,000people. Damage in Texas totaled over $45million (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>clear</b> and {{forceful}} language Floyd reasserted {{the state}} sovereignty theory of government, as {{guaranteed by the}} 'Compact or Constitution,' holding the Federal Government to be merely the 'Agent of the States' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate 'externally' and 'upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy.' He {{called attention to the}} disregard with which 'an unrestrained majority' had received the memorials and protests of some of the 'sovereign states,' justifying their acts by precedent and expediency and thus melting away 'the solder of the Federal chain;' also {{to the fact that it}} was then 'strongly insinuated' that the states could not 'interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure.' Such a course, he was certain, could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants <b>in</b> <b>Clear</b> Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E

Following a brief stop he took off <b>in</b> <b>clear,</b> sunny weather bound for Santa Monica, but {{a few minutes later}} he crashed and died about 6.5 miles (11km) south of the airfield in a dry lake bed. The wreckage was discovered by park rangers on the morning of 31 January, and was later examined by investigators who did not determine a cause for the accident. Jackson was survived by two brothers and two sisters, and by his fourth wife, Terri, their daughter Brianna, and Aja, Jackson's stepdaughter. He was survived by his third wife Betty Bennett and their son Lindsey and daughter Alex. Jackson was survived by his second wife Ruth Davis who sang background vocals for Springsteen. He was also survived by his first wife Margaret who married him when they were both 21 years old.

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton was fastest {{in the first}} free practice session, run <b>in</b> <b>clear</b> and sunny conditions, lapping {{in a time of}} 1m43.754s, over one-tenth of a second faster than teammate Rosberg in second. Rosberg had set new fastest sector times on his last fast run, but a mistake in {{the last part of the}} track lost him a chance at the best time. Kimi Räikkönen was third fastest for Ferrari, ahead of Daniil Kvyat. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Ricciardo changed back to his older specification Renault power unit, after being unsatisfied with the performance of his updated unit at the previous race in Brazil. He finished the session seventh fastest. At Lotus, Jolyon Palmer replaced Romain Grosjean, but had to sit out most of the session due to a water leak, managing just nine laps.|$|E
