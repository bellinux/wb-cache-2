The people themselves do not use this label or identify as part of a single ethnic group, however, and prefer to identify along other kinship or geopolitical lines; the name Mahafaly holds no meaning for the people originating from this area and instead is a label imposed from the outside. The majority of the population is concentrated {{along the banks of the}} rivers that run through the otherwise largely arid territory.|$|E

The first mention of Goguryeo as a <b>group</b> <b>label</b> associated with Yemaek tribes is a reference in the Han Shu that discusses a Goguryeo revolt in 12 CE, during which they broke away from the influence of the Chinese at Xuantu.|$|E

Before the single's release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London's Hyde Park at a concert {{to raise money for the}} Prince's Trust charity. She sang [...] "Out of Your Mind" [...] to a 100,000-strong audience. Beckham then signed a recording contract with her <b>group</b> <b>label</b> Virgin Records. Her next single as a solo artist, [...] "Not Such An Innocent Girl", was released on 17 September 2001. Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue's single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head". Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6. Beckham's eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached Number 10 in the UK album chart. The album cost a reputed £5 million to produce and it sold a modest 50,000 copies.|$|E

40|$|A <b>Group</b> <b>Labeled</b> Graph {{is a pair}} (G,Λ) where G is an {{oriented}} graph and Λ is a mapping from the arcs of G to elements of a group. A (not necessarily directed) cycle C is called non-null if for any cyclic ordering of the arcs in C, the group element obtained by `adding' the labels on forward arcs and `subtracting' the labels on reverse arcs is not the identity element of the group. Non-null cycles in <b>group</b> <b>labeled</b> graphs generalize several well-known graph structures, including odd cycles. In this paper, we prove that non-null cycles on <b>Group</b> <b>Labeled</b> Graphs have the half-integral Erdös-Pósa property.
