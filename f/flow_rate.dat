40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the effects of medications and systemic diseases on major salivary gland <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Unstimulated and 2 % citrate-stimulated parotid and submandibular salivas were collected from 293 subjects of the oral physiology component of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.

40|$|Sap flow {{measurements}} {{have become}} integral in many physiological and ecological investigations. A number of methods {{are used to}} estimate sap <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in trees, but probably the most popular is the heat dissipation method (Granier) because of its affordability, relatively low power consumption and ease of use. However, there have been questions {{about the use of}} this method in ring-porous species and whether individual species and site calibrations are needed. We made concurrent measurements of sap <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> using heat dissipation sensors and the heat balance method (Čerm&# 225;k) in two oak species (Quercus prinus Willd. and Quercus velutina Lam.) and one pine species (Pinus echinata Mill.). We also made concurrent measurements of sap <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> using both 1 -cm long and 2 -cm long Granier-style heat dissipation sensors in both oak species. We found that both the heat dissipation and heat balance systems tended to match well in the pine individual, but sap <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were underestimated by 2 -cm long heat dissipation sensors in five individuals of the two ring-porous oak species. Underestimations of 20 - 35 % occurred in Q. prinus even when a Clearwater correction was applied to account for the shallowness of the sapwood depth relative to the sensor length and <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were underestimated by up to 50 % in Q. velutina. Two-cm long heat dissipation sensors also underestimated <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> compared with 1 -cm long sensors in Q. prinus, but only at large <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> When 2 -cm long sensor data in Q. prinus were scaled using the regression with 1 -cm long data, daily <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> matched well with the rates measured by the heat balance system. Daily plot-level transpiration estimated using heat dissipation sap <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> was about 15 % lower than those estimated by the heat balance method at the highest <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Therefore, these results suggest that 1 -cm long sensors are appropriate in species with shallow sapwood, however more corrections may be necessary in ring-porous species...|$|R
