50|$|Genetic {{engineering}} has {{applications in}} medicine, research, industry and agriculture {{and can be}} used {{on a wide range of}} plants, animals and micro organisms. Bacteria, the first organisms to be <b>genetically</b> <b>modified,</b> can have plasmid DNA inserted containing new genes that code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other substrates. Plants have been modified for insect protection, herbicide resistance, virus resistance, enhanced nutrition, tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of edible vaccines. Most commercialised GMOs are insect resistant and/or herbicide tolerant crop plants. <b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>animals</b> have been used for research, model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products. The <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>animals</b> include animals with genes knocked out, increased susceptibility to disease, hormones for extra growth and the ability to express proteins in their milk.|$|R

The mice and rats derived from embryos electroporated with Cas 9 mRNA, gRNA and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) comprised the edited targeted gene as a knockout (67 % of mice and 88 % of rats) or knock-in (both 33 %).

40|$|The use of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>animals</b> in {{biomedical}} research has increased during {{recent years and}} its ethical aspects {{have been subject to}} academic discussion. In order to make this discussion more concrete, we analyzed applications submitted to animal ethics committees in Sweden in 2002. The aim was to investigate the researchers’ statements concerning the production and use of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>animals</b> as well as the committees’ assessments. For our analysis, we constructed an Analytic Form. In part, we followed the questions and categories of the mandatory Application Form, noting for example species, degree of severity as regards pain and distress, handling of pain, and endpoints. In part, we created questions and categories of our own and classified the applications accordingly. We focused particularly on methods of production and on expected clinical symptoms due to genetic modification and experimental use. Our analysis – partly quantitative, partly qualitative – showed, inter alia, that applications were often approved in spite of insufficient information regarding ethically relevant aspects, that the arguments for using <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>animals</b> were often unclear, and that some applicants indicated awareness of the possibility of unintended welfare effects due to genetic modification, while others did not. We noted that many applicants stressed that certain GM animals were to be used without manifesting any clinical symptoms. This was obviously viewed as an ethical advantage.

50|$|Genetic {{modification}} {{caused by}} human activity has been occurring since around 12,000 BC, when humans {{first began to}} domesticate organisms.

The first <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>animal</b> was a mouse created in 1974 by Rudolf Jaenisch.

50|$|In {{the past}} decade Dr. Crews made seminal {{contributions}} to the emerging area of behavioral epigenetics. He {{was the first to}} demonstrate that behavioral differences among genetically modified mice may be exaggerated or blurred by the postnatal environment. For example, mice develop in litters of varying sex ratios and genotypes, and it is possible that some of the diagnostic behavioral characteristics may result from an interaction of the sex ratio and genotype ratio of the litter. By varying sex ratios and genotypes, he was able to show that the diagnostic behavioral characteristics and their underlying neural activity result from an interaction of sex and genotype ratio of the litter. This type of work calls attention to the need for researchers using <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>animal</b> models to consider {{the context in which the}} phenotypes emerge.|$|E
