5|$|At the 2008 New York Comic Con, American-based graphic novel {{publisher}} Yen Press {{announced that}} they had acquired the rights to publish An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> and would release it in full color. Rights were acquired from Xiao Pan, rather than Tian Jin Creator World Comic Co. On March 24, 2009, Yen Press released An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> in North America as a single volume; at 176pages long, the volume also includes character sketches, the additional French covers, and information on the author, illustrator, and Chinese publisher.|$|E
5|$|An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World,</b> {{authored}} by Weidong Chen {{and illustrated by}} Chao Peng, was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company and entitled Seek Self's World. It {{is part of the}} company's Cunren Fairy Tale series. An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> was licensed by the French manhua company Xiao Pan, as well as several other companies, which released it in five volumes entitled Un Monde Idéal ("An Ideal World") from September 15, 2006 to March 14, 2007. Contracts were made that allowed for the French, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese companies to release the five volumes {{at the same time as}} the original company; French, Chinese, and Korean language editions were published through a partnership with Beijing Total Vision Culture Spreads. An Ideal Worlds global release was meant to aid in the development of the Chinese comic industry and create a new business model, and its release marked the first simultaneous global release for a comic. Xiao Pan also made an omnibus of the original Chinese version available for purchase.|$|E
40|$|Ode to a Nightingale by John Keats in 1819 and Sailing to Byzantium by W. B.

5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{value of}} the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th-century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age. Scholars like Dr. Venkata Subramanian, Dr. N. Subrahmanian, Dr. Sundararajan and J.K. Pillay concur with this view. Noted historian K.A.N. Sastri dates the presently available Sangam corpus to the early centuries of the Christian Era. He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must {{have been based on}} solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, culture and society of the early Pandyan kingdom. Kanakalatha Mukund, while describing the mercantile history of Tamilakam, points out that the heroic poetry in Sangam literature often described an <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> rather than reality, but the basic facts are reliable and an important source of Tamil history. Her reasoning is that they have been supported by archaeological and numismatic evidence and the fact that similar vivid descriptions are found in works by different poets. Dr. Husaini relies on Sangam literature to describe the early Pandyan society and justifies his source by saying that some of the poetical works contain really trustworthy accounts of early Pandyan kings and present facts as they occurred, though they never throw much light about the chronology of their rule.|$|E
5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

40|$|Standard deontic logics {{are about}} what obtains in deontically <b>ideal</b> <b>worlds.</b> Deontic {{reasoning}} {{from the perspective}} of event semantics and the disquotation (ESD) theory, which we describe briefly, is about individual obligations, permissions, etc. in this, admittedly non-ideal world. Standard deontic logics are beset with a number of puzzling paradoxes and anomalies. Our suggestion here is {{that at least some of}} these problems can be dispelled if we take the perspective of event semantics and disquotation with regard to deontic reasoning. We make good on this suggestion by discussing how ESD theory succeeds in treating puzzles of action conjunction in deontic contexts and in treating the paradox of deontic disjunction...|$|R
5000|$|Thus {{the poet}} boldly announces, “I lay down my head where {{the door to}} {{language}} is shut.” Jabbing at Descartes’ famous maxim “I think, therefore I am,” he says, “I exist completely as a poet only where language is absent.” Jang’s belief that ‘dance’ and ‘music’ are free from ‘language’ and ‘morality’ stems from his own individual ideas about language. Constantly absorbing worldly ideas and moral standards, language is impure and polluted. Yet language can never be abandoned because it serves {{as the basis for}} human thought and expression. Though it is impure, the poet tries attaining to expressions of <b>ideal</b> <b>worlds</b> such as ‘dance’ and ‘music.’ ...|$|R

Partial reform of planned economies allows new private owners of means of production to lock in the advantages of initial property allocations by employing their newly won resources to exercise pressures on the political process.

500|$|An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> has {{received}} mixed reviews from Western critics, who generally praised the book's artwork and second half {{but did not}} like the beginning. School Library Journal's Lori Henderson reviewed An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> positively; she praised the [...] "Wizard of Oz feel" [...] ending and the message that A You [...] "controls his life, and he has the power to change it". Henderson called the characters [...] "great" [...] and the world [...] "fantastic", also noting that the [...] "cartoonish" [...] and [...] "exaggerated" [...] artwork worked with the story. However, she remarked that the beginning of An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> was [...] "slow and plodding" [...] and could [...] "leave you wondering if it's ever going to go anywhere".

500|$|Publishers Weekly praised An <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> for {{its message}} and art, but criticized how [...] "the book gets {{bogged down in}} talky heavy-handedness, as if someone put nice fantasy {{illustrations}} into a business self-help book".

5000|$|Stifter's work is {{characterized}} by the pursuit of beauty; his characters strive to be moral and move in gorgeous landscapes luxuriously described. Evil, cruelty, and suffering rarely appear on the surface of his writing, but Thomas Mann noted that [...] "behind the quiet, inward exactitude of his descriptions of Nature in particular there is at work a predilection for the excessive, the elemental and the catastrophic, the pathological." [...] Although considered by some to be one-dimensional compared to his more famous and realistic contemporaries, his visions of <b>ideal</b> <b>worlds</b> reflect his informal allegiance to the Biedermeier movement in literature.

40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} contrary-to-duty {{obligations}} can be represented in dyadic deontic logics of the Hansson-Lewis family, which interpret obligations {{in terms of a}} preference ordering on worlds. The Hansson-Lewis systems are extended in two ways. First a notion of alethic necessity is added, which sheds light on the difference between what we have earlier called `contextual' obligations and conditional obligations (whether defeasible or not) as ordinarily understood. This extension also facilitates a comparison with temporal deontic logics, including the critical observation that the commonly accepted treatment of temporal contrary-to-duty structures neglects some important problems. The second extension is a set of conditions on the preference orderings intended to ensure that non-ideal worlds are ranked according to how well they resemble or measure up to more <b>ideal</b> <b>worlds.</b> The aim here is to establish that the Hansson-Lewis account of obligation must be extended [...] ...|$|R
