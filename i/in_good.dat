This paper examines the rationality {{of such an}} asymmetry in the liberalization policies by making a welfare comparison between countries under four different international economic regimes, (i) free trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> only, (ii) free trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and labor force, (iii) free trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and capital and (iv) free trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and the factors of production in a general equilibrium model with the intra-industry trade which stems from monopolistic competition and increasing-returns-to-scale technologies using capital as a fixed input and labor as a variable input. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, we explore empirically to what extent the {{determinants}} of trade in services differ from those of trade <b>in</b> <b>goods.</b> Second, by the use of instrumental variables, we explore potential complementarities between bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and bilateral trade in services. Using a gravity framework, the main results show that bilateral trust and contract enforcement environment, networks, labour market regulations and variables denoting technology of communication have a higher impact on services trade than on goods trade. Finally, after using instrumental variables, we find that bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> explains bilateral trade in services the resulting estimated elasticity is close to 1. Reciprocally, bilateral trade in services also affects bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods,</b> though to a lesser extent we find an estimated (positive) elasticity of 0. 46. international trade in services, trade <b>in</b> <b>goods,</b> gravity equations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} large dataset to explore whether the {{liberalization}} of trade in services is beneficial for the international trade <b>in</b> <b>goods.</b> We find empirical evidence supporting this notion. We investigate which types of trade in services are {{more important for the}} international trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and find that trade in transportation and communication services generate the largest impacts on trade <b>in</b> <b>goods.</b> We also investigate which types of trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> are likely to benefit from the liberalization of trade in services and find that, under the 2 -digit ISTC classification, all the categories are likely to exhibit a positive impact.

40|$|Gravity {{models have}} been widely used to {{describe}} bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods.</b> Recently, Portes and Rey [1999] applied this framework to cross border equity flows and found that distance, which proxies information asymmetries in financial markets, is a surprisingly very large barrier to cross-border asset trade. We adopt here {{a different point of view}} and explore the complementarity between bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and bilateral asset holdings. We jointly study trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and banking assets in a simultaneous gravity equations framework using different instruments for both endogenous variables. To instrument trade <b>in</b> <b>goods,</b> we choose geographical variables (excluding distance) and data on bilateral transport costs. For asset holdings, we use legal similarities between countries and data on the international taxation of withheld capital. We find that the strong correlation between bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and asset holdings is not simply due to distance: bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> generates bilateral asset holdings and vice versa. Those effects are of first order magnitude: a 10 % increase in trade generates a 6 to 7 % increase of asset holdings, and a 10 % increase in banking claims induces a 2 to 3 % increase in trade. Finally, we investigate the question of the remaining impact of distance. We find out that the impact of distance on trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> is only slightly reduced, while for asset holdings, a large part of the effect of distance is going through trade.

40|$|Using a newly assembled, {{consistent}} and disaggregated dataset (12 goods and 7 services) on internal and bilateral trade for 25 European countries, we analyse {{the difference between}} trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and services. The measurement of both trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and trade <b>in</b> services is improved over earlier research, allowing us to compare trade <b>in</b> <b>goods</b> and services <b>in</b> a coherent and systematic way. First, our dataset is made consistent with the domestic demand and production and the total exports and imports at the sector and product level. Second, we explicitly control for re-exports. We find that, although goods are more often bilaterally traded than services, the volume of bilateral trade in services does not attenuate less with distance than the volume of bilateral trade <b>in</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|R
