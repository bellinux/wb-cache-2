60|$|He {{chose the}} night on which in the {{ordinary}} state of affairs the schooner should be lying alongside the wharf; and keeping a keen lookout for friends and foes both, {{made his way to}} the Minories and down Tower Hill. He had pictured it as teeming with people he knew, and the bare street and closed warehouses, with a chance docker or two slouching slowly along, struck him with an odd sense of disappointment. The place seemed changed. He hurried past the wharf; that too was deserted, and after a loving peep at the spars of his schooner he drifted slowly across the road to the Albion, and, pushing the door a little way open, peeped cautiously in. The faces were all unfamiliar, and letting the <b>door</b> <b>swing</b> quietly back he walked on until he came to the Town of Yarmouth.|$|E
60|$|The {{house was}} very quiet. The leaves of a catalpa, across the roadway, hung motionless. Somebody yawned {{on the veranda}} below. I threw away my half-finished cigar, and closed my eyes. I think I had not lost {{consciousness}} {{for more than a}} few seconds before I was awakened by the shaking and thrilling of the whole building. As I staggered to my feet, I saw the four pictures hanging against the wall swing outwardly from it on their cords, and my <b>door</b> <b>swing</b> back against the wall. At the same moment, acted upon by the same potential impulse, the door of the end room in the hall, opposite the stairs, also swung open. In that brief moment I had a glimpse of the interior of the room, of two figures, a man and a woman, the latter clinging to her companion in abject terror. It was only for an instant, for a second thrill passed through the house, the pictures clattered back against the wall, the door of the end room closed violently on its strange revelation, and my own door swung back also. Apprehensive of what might happen, I sprang toward it, but only to arrest it an inch or two before it should shut, when, as my experience had taught me, it might stick by the subsidence of the walls. But it did stick ajar, and remained firmly fixed in that position. From the clattering of the knob of the other door, and the sound of hurried voices behind it, I knew that the same thing had happened there when that door had fully closed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations whose aim was to describe the influence of the pressure difference level on the ability of contaminants migration between neighbouring rooms in dynamic conditions associated with <b>door</b> <b>swing.</b> The analysis was based on airflow visualization made with cold smoke, which simulated the heavy contaminants. The test room was pressurized to a specific level and then the door was opened to observe the trail of the smoke plume in the plane of the door. The door was opened in both directions: to the positively and negatively pressurized room. This study focuses on the visualization of smoke plume discharge and an uncertainty analysis is not applicable. Unlike other studies which focus on the analysis of pressure difference, the present study looks at the contaminants which are heavier than air and on "pumping out" the contaminants by means of <b>door</b> <b>swing.</b> Setting the proper level of pressure difference between the contaminated room and the neighbouring rooms can prove instrumental in ensuring protection against toxic contaminants migration. This study helped to establish the threshold of pressure difference necessary to reduce migration of heavy contaminants to neighbouring rooms...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{requirements}} for the Degree of Masters of Science in Fire Protection Engineering from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, a prescriptive and performance based design analysis was conducted for the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center building (Cal Poly campus). The purpose of this analysis was to review the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center’s compliance with applicable and recognized fire and building codes with regards to its fire protection systems and features. The fire protection systems and features analyzed in this report include: 1) Egress Systems, 2) Structural Fire Protection, 3) Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, 4) Fire Suppression Systems. Prescriptive analysis of the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center was performed {{in order to determine}} if the building adhered to standards set forth within applicable standards and codes. Analysis was based primarily upon both the International Building Code 2009 Edition and NFPA 101 : Life Safety Code 2012 Edition. Where required, other NFPA codes and standards were utilized, including the 2010 Editions of NFPA 13 : Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems and NFPA 72 : National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. The egress systems in the building largely met prescriptive code requirements except for a few issues related to room 104 and its change in occupancy use (<b>door</b> <b>swing</b> direction, locks without panic hardware, etc). The structural system is a Type II-B classification and was found to meet prescriptive code requirements. Some shortcomings with the detection and alarm systems were discovered during the analysis, mainly with respect to spacing gaps. Several visible notification devices on the second floor did not meet prescriptive code due to gaps in required coverage. Additionally, it was determined that detailed measurements of the average ambient sound level should be taken in order to better analyze the audible notification systems. Lastly, the sprinkler system was found to meet prescriptive code requirements, both for water demand and bracing. Performance based design analysis was performed in order to gain understanding on the ability of the building to safely egress occupants during various fire scenarios when built to the prescriptive approaches set forth in the codes and standards. This performance based design analysis was based upon standards set forth in Chapter 5 of the Life Safety Code. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Pathfinder computer simulators were utilized to carry out the performance based design. ASET vs. RSET analysis solidified the code requirements which prohibit highly combustible materials from within atrium spaces...|$|E

40|$|A Fire and Life Safety Analysis was {{performed}} {{as one of}} the requirements for the Master of Science Degree in Fire Protection Engineering from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo. The Fire and Life Safety Analysis consists of a prescriptive analysis as well as a performance based analysis. These analyses were performed on the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center which is part of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The prescriptive analysis consisted of the four following parts: Egress Analysis and Design, Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, Water-based Fire Suppression, and Structural Fire Protection. The purpose of the prescriptive analysis was to determine if the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center adhered to the codes and standards applicable to the building. The prescriptive analysis {{was performed}} using primarily the 2013 edition of the California Building Code (CBC) along with the 2013 editions of NFPA codes. The egress analysis and design met most of the code requirements. One area that the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center did not meet was <b>door</b> <b>swing</b> direction. Room 104 (See Appendix A for building layout) was originally an office classification, but since construction has been utilized as an assembly space. The decreased occupant load factor resulted in a new occupant load which is greater than 50 persons. Per CBC 1008. 1. 2 exit doors must swing in the direction of egress travel where serving a room or area containing an occupant load of 50 or more persons, which the building does not adhere to. The fire detection and alarm systems analysis was performed primarily utilizing NFPA 72. The building had multiple shortcomings in regards to spacing gaps of the detection devices. These shortcomings were found on the first and second floor, including the lobby, robotics room, project integration room and computer cluster room. The water-based fire suppression system analysis was performed primarily utilizing NFPA 13 and NFPA 25. The water supply and sprinkler system are acceptable. The structural fire protection analysis was performed primarily utilizing the CBC. The main shortcoming discovered was in relation to the atrium. The building must have a 1 hour fire barrier separating atrium spaces from adjacent spaces or it must provide an acceptable smoke control system. The building provides neither of these provisions. The performance based analysis was performed in order to ascertain the ability for the occupant of a building to evacuate safely {{in the event of a}} fire. Two separate fire scenarios were evaluated using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Pathfinder. Tenability criteria was determined and used in conjunction with FDS in order to determine the available safe egress time (ASET). This was compared against the required safe egress time (RSET) which was determined using Pathfinder. The RSET time was greater than the ASET time, meaning occupants would not be able to safely evacuate the building in the event of an emergency...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{physical}} security measures is a specialized technical area {{that does not}} fall in the normal skill record and resume of commanders, architects, engineers, and project managers. This document provides guidance to those parties tasked with implementing existing and emerging physical protection system requirements: -    Creation of a single-source reference for the design and construction of physical security measures for high-risk personnel (HRP). -    Promulgation of multi-service standard recommendations and considerations. -    Potential increase of productivity of HRP and reduced temporary housing costs through clarification of considerations, guidance on planning, and provision of design solutions. -    Reduction of facility project costs. -    Better performance of modernized facilities, in terms of force protection, than original facilities. Throughout this process you must ensure: confidentiality, appropriate Public Relations, sustainability, compliance with all industrial guidelines and legal and regulatory requirement, constant review and revision to accommodate new circumstances or threats. Introduction Physical security is an extremely broad topic. It encompasses access control devices such as smart cards, air filtration and fireproofing. It is also heavily reliant on infrastructure. This means {{that many of the}} ideal physical security measures may not be economically or physically feasible for existing sites. Many businesses do not have the option of building their own facility from the ground up; thus physical security often must be integrated into an existing structure. This limits the overall set of security measures that can be installed. There is an aspect of physical security that is often overlooked; the humans that interact with it. Humans commit crime for a number of reasons. The document focuses on two building types: the HRP office and the HRP residence. HRP are personnel who are likely to be terrorist or criminal targets based on their grade, assignment, symbolic value, criticality, and threat and vulnerability assessment. Levels of protection The recommendations contained in this criterion are intended to minimize the possibility of HRP casualties in buildings or portions of buildings in which they work and live. These recommendations provide appropriate and implementable measures to establish a level of protection against terrorist attacks where no known threat of terrorist activity currently exists. While complete protection against all potential threats is cost prohibitive, the intent of these recommendations can be achieved through prudent master planning, real estate acquisition, and design and construction practices. Tag number The tag number {{at the beginning of each}} physical security measure (recommendation) is unique and is intended to be a communication aid when linking the requirement (recommendation) to the supporting text or commentary. The three-character tag number uses the following legend. Tag Number First Character -The first character is an abbreviation for the defense zone layer that is most applicable for the countermeasure. “S” is used to represent site or external zone issues. “P” is used to represent the perimeter zone. “G” is used to represent issues relative to the property grounds. “E” is used to represent issues associated with the building exterior of the HRP office or residence. “I” is used to represent issues associated with the building interior. “H” is used to represent issues associated with the safe room or safe haven. Tag Number Second Character - The second character is a sequential number for countermeasures in a given zone - a requirement or a recommendation. This number ensures a unique tag number. Tag Number Third Character- The third character indicates whether the countermeasure is applicable to offices, residences, or both (common). “O” indicates a requirement or recommendation unique to offices. “R” represents a requirement or recommendation to residences. “C” represents a common requirement or recommendation applicable to offices and residences. Alternate and equivalent means or methods While listed physical security measures may be very specific, the intent is to achieve a certain level of protection for the HRP. If a requirement can be met by alternate and equivalent means or methods, then that variance should be accepted when proven to provide the equivalent level of protection. Common recommendations The recommendations in this section apply to both HRP offices and residences - S- 1 C: Final Approach Routes, S- 2 C: HRP Vehicle Parking, S- 3 C: Response Forces, S- 4 C: DoD Compound, P- 1 C: Subterranean Openings, E- 1 C: Number of Levels, E- 2 C: Window Locks, E- 3 C: Minimize Number of Exterior Doors, E- 4 C: Exterior Door Material, E- 5 C: <b>Door</b> <b>Swing,</b> E- 6 C: Exterior Door Hinges, E- 7 C: Exterior Door Jambs, I- 1 C: Skylights, I- 2 C: Furniture Layout, H- 1 C: Safe Room/Haven. Office recommendations In addition to the common recommendations for HRP buildings, the following additional physical protection measures are recommended for HRP offices - S- 5 O: Minimum Standards, I- 3 O: Internal Controlled Access Area, I- 4 O: Primary Access Door, I- 5 O: Other Access Doors, I- 6 O: HRP Office Door Frame Construction, I- 7 O: Office Construction, I- 8 O: CCTV. Residence recommendations In addition to the common recommendations for both HRP buildings, additional physical protection measures are recommended for HRP residences. Many of the recommendations are based on the assumption that the HRP residence is not located on a military installation- S- 6 R: Neighborhood, S- 7 R: Building Appearance, S- 8 R: Commute Route, S- 9 R: Emergency Services, S- 10 R: Crime Area, S- 11 R: Vehicular Approaches, P- 2 R: Perimeter Boundary, P- 3 R: Egress Route Viewing, P- 4 R: Vehicle Access Points, P- 5 R: Perimeter CCTV, P- 6 R: Perimeter IDS, G- 1 R: Standoff Distance, G- 2 R: Vantage Points, G- 3 R: HRP POV Parking, G- 4 R: Security Lighting: Provide security lighting around the residential exterior, G- 5 R: Unobstructed Space, G- 6 R: Access Control Point, G- 7 R: Visitor Parking, E- 8 R: Exterior Door Locks, E- 9 R: Windows, E- 10 R: Under-building Access Control, E- 11 R: Roof Access, E- 12 R: Residential Mailbox Guidelines, E- 13 R: Trash Receptacles, I- 9 R: Fire Protection System, I- 10 R: Intrusion Detection System (IDS).   Conclusion The challenge is twofold. The first challenge is to reach an agreement that something needs to be done. This involves altering mindsets, building consensus and getting senior management support. The second challenge is in developing and implementing an effective and tailor-made integrated physical security plan. This plan consists of three mutually supporting elements – physical security measures, operational procedures and policies. Physical security covers all the devices, technologies and specialist materials for perimeter, external and internal protection. This covers everything from sensors and closed-circuit television to barriers, lighting and access controls for HRP offices and residences. The following crucial elements must be taken into account – deterrence, detection, delay and response and then recovery and re-assessment. All are mitigation measures. These are the foundations on which any integrated physical security plan must be built. </p...|$|E
