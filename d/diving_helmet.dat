5|$|The street started {{being used}} for {{commercial}} purposes {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century and houses were converted for this use. Ground floors became used as shops, while upper floors and back rooms were used as workshops, particularly for metalwork. Augustus Siebe, the pioneer of the <b>diving</b> <b>helmet,</b> lived and worked on the street, and today there is an English Heritage blue plaque commemorating him on the house where he lived.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a <b>diving</b> <b>helmet.</b> Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the <b>diving</b> <b>helmet,</b> allowing the diver to dictate observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|E

25|$|The era {{of modern}} salvage {{operations}} was inaugurated {{with the development}} of the first surface supplied <b>diving</b> <b>helmets</b> by the inventors, Charles and John Deane and Augustus Siebe, in the 1830s. , a 100-gun first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, sank undergoing routine maintenance work in 1782, and the Deane brothers were commissioned to perform salvage work on the wreck. Using their new air-pumped <b>diving</b> <b>helmets,</b> they managed to recover about two dozen cannons.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1836, a group of five {{fishermen}} caught their nets on timbers protruding {{from the bottom of}} the Solent. They contacted a diver to help them remove the hindrance, and on , Henry Abbinett became the first person to see the Mary Rose in almost 300 years. Later, two other professional divers, John Deane and William Edwards, were employed. Using a recently invented rubber suit and metal <b>diving</b> <b>helmet,</b> Deane and Edwards began to examine the wreck and salvage items from it. Along with an assortment of timbers and wooden objects, including several longbows, they brought up several bronze and iron guns, which were sold to the Board of Ordnance for over £220. Initially, this caused a dispute between Deane (who had also brought in his brother Charles into the project), Abbinett and the fishermen who had hired them. The matter was eventually settled by allowing the fishermen a share of the proceeds from the sale of the first salvaged guns, while Deane received exclusive salvage rights at the expense of Abbinett. The wreck was soon identified as the Mary Rose from the inscriptions of one of the bronze guns manufactured in 1537.|$|E

The remaining guns were buried under mud and the timbers of the wreck and were unable to be recovered.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide more}} {{protection}} {{to the head}} against impact, to secure the airway, and to permit easy communication with the surface and between divers, a rigid metal or fibre-reinforced plastic <b>diving</b> <b>helmet</b> may be worn with the dry suit.

25|$|A diving mask (also half mask, {{dive mask}} or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or <b>diving</b> <b>helmet,</b> but in some systems the half mask may be used. When the human eye is {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle and the eye is unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, light enters normally and the eye is able to focus correctly.|$|E
25|$|Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Brian Baird {{recognized}} Smith's {{service on}} the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, whose district includes the Florida Keys and who had met Smith during a visit to the Aquarius facility, also offered a statement of condolence. On May 15, 2009, at a panel at International Space Medicine Summit III devoted to human performance in analog environments, astronaut-aquanaut Dafydd Williams, who had participated in two NEEMO missions, asked for a moment of silence in Smith's memory. Aquarius donated a Superlite 17 <b>diving</b> <b>helmet,</b> the helmet most frequently worn by Aquarius aquanauts, to the History of Diving Museum in Islamorada, Florida in memory of Smith.|$|E
50|$|Free-flow <b>diving</b> <b>helmets</b> {{avoid the}} dead space problem by {{supplying}} far more air than the diver can use, {{this makes the}} whole interior of the helmet effectively fresh air {{at the cost of}} significantly higher gas usage in open circuit systems.|$|R

25|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>helmet</b> squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the gas supply hose is severed above the diver and the {{non-return}} valve at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} hydrostatic pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas supply flow rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brothers}} had insufficient funds {{to build the}} equipment themselves so they sold the patent to their employer Edward Barnard. It was not until 1827 that the first smoke helmets were built by German-born British engineer Augustus Siebe. In 1828 they decided to find another application for their device and converted it into a <b>diving</b> <b>helmet.</b> They marketed the helmet with a loosely attached [...] "diving suit" [...] so that a diver could perform salvage work but only in a full vertical position, otherwise water entered the suit.|$|E
2500|$|Dry {{suits for}} {{commercial}} and military diving {{tend to be}} heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they will endure a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as underwater welding. A boiler suit may be worn over the dry suit for additional protection of the suit. Some commercial dry suits are rated for contaminated environment diving, and when combined with a suitably rated <b>diving</b> <b>helmet</b> can completely isolate and protect the diver from hazardous environments such as sewage pits and chemical storage tanks. These [...] "hazmat suits" [...] are most often made of vulcanized rubber laminated to a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate because of its slick surface, than other dry suit materials.|$|E
25|$|Other British {{attempts}} at countermeasures {{were not so}} effective. An early plan was to use 100,000 fans to disperse the gas. Burning coal or carborundum dust was tried. A proposal was made to equip front-line sentries with <b>diving</b> <b>helmets,</b> air being pumped to them through a 100ft (30 m) hose.|$|R
5000|$|Inspired by William F. Saddler, Heinke {{started using}} solid brass for diving helmets' breastplates, instead of copper sheet. Heinke's <b>diving</b> <b>helmets</b> had three similarly-shaped {{circular}} windows. They {{did not have}} the outer protective grills as in other helmets; thus they had better visibility for divers, and it was easier to keep the windows clean.|$|R
25|$|Most {{professional}} diving {{equipment such as}} {{full face}} diving masks and <b>diving</b> <b>helmets</b> include voice communication equipment, but recreational divers generally rely on hand signals and occasionally on light signals, touch signals and text written on a slate Through-water voice communications is available for recreational diving, but is restricted to full face masks and is not in general use.|$|R
