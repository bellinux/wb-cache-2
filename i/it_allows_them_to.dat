25|$|Hastings is {{connected}} to Napier through the Hawke's Bay Expressway, {{also known as the}} Napier-Hastings Expressway, and provides a more direct and efficient link between the two cities compared to SH2, and better access to Hawke's Bay Airport. The expressway also provides a more direct and efficient route to the Port of Napier for heavy-vehicle traffic coming from Hastings, as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> avoid travelling through too much of the Hastings urban area. The expressway has connections to many of Hastings's arterial roads that lead to the city centre and outlying suburbs, such as the junctions at Omahu Road, York Road/Flaxmere Ave and Evenden Road.|$|E

25|$|As the {{awakening}} movement gained momentum, its goals matured and shifted from promoting modesty and Islamic identity towards {{more of a}} political stance in terms of retaining support for Islamic nationalism and to resist western influences. Today the hijab means many different things for different people. For Islamic women who choose to wear the hijab <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> retain their modesty, morals and freedom of choice. They choose to cover because they believe it is liberating and allows them to avoid harassment. Many people (both Muslim and non-Muslim) are against the wearing of the hijab and argue that the hijab causes issues with gender relations, works to silence and repress women both physically and metaphorically, and have many other problems with the practice. This difference in opinions has generated a plethora of discussion on the subject, both emotional and academic, which continues today.|$|E
25|$|Polygynous marriages can be {{distinguished}} between sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters, and non-sororal, where the co-wives are not related. For men, the benefits of polygyny are that <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have more children, may provide them with more productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with {{a greater number of}} kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when their work load is lightened by the addition of junior wives to the family. Wives', especially senior wives', status in the community can be increased by the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or are a sign of conspicuous consumption (much like a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations would be in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for a second wife.|$|E

25|$|The spathe {{provides}} a safe breeding {{area for the}} beetles. As such, the male beetles are often followed by female beetles {{with the intent of}} mating with the males within the spathe. The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the spathe covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process and thus providing philodendrons a means of sexual reproduction. In addition to gaining a safe location to mate, the male beetles may benefit from having a central location, because <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> broadcast to females that they are willing and able to mate. Females which see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate know that they can find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because {{they do not have to}} produce pheromones to attract females, since the philodendrons do it for them. Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females, which is not necessarily certain otherwise. In doing so, the philodendron provides male beetles a more efficient way to find females than what they could achieve on their own. Interestingly, pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. In addition to the reproductive benefits to beetles, the philodendrons provide food in two forms. Pollen from the fertile male flowers is eaten by the beetles throughout the night. Secondly, the sterile male flowers consumed by the beetles are rich in lipids.|$|E
500|$|The {{amount of}} energy stored in the tendons {{increases}} with the animal's speed {{and the weight of}} the load it is carrying. This is particularly helpful for mothers carrying young, [...] and explains why tammars can increase their hopping speed without using more energy. [...] The tammar shares this characteristic with other plains-dwelling macropods like the red kangaroo. By comparison, rock wallabies, such as the yellow-footed rock-wallaby, have traded efficient energy saving for greater tendon thickness; an adaption for steep rocky terrain as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leap higher and lowers the risk of their tendons rupturing.|$|E
500|$|Except {{for when}} Hagstr√∂m needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing. Haake says about his songwriting, [...] "Sometimes I'll sample guitar parts, cut them up, pitch-shift and tweak them until I've built the riffs I want, just for demoing purposes. But {{most of the}} time I'll just present the drums, and explain my ideas {{for the rest of the}} song, sing some riffs." [...] The band uses Cubase to record the tracks, and the guitars are routed through {{software}} amplifier modeling, because <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded.|$|E

5000|$|Companies liked {{structured}} settlements because <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{taxes to}} a certain extent, and plaintiffs liked <b>them</b> because <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> receive tax-free payments of what became, over time, a much larger amount of money than the original amount paid out by the settling party. Such settlements were also considered an especially good idea for minors, as they held the money safe for adulthood and ensured that youth would not find the money wasted or ill-spent. ‚ÄúDespite the best intentions of plaintiffs, lump sum settlement awards are often quickly dissipated because of excessive spending, poor financial management, {{or a combination of}} both. Statistics showed that twenty-five to thirty percent of all cash awards are exhausted within two months, and ninety percent are exhausted within five years.‚Äù ...|$|R

500|$|Many {{people who}} self-harm state that <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> [...] "go away" [...] or dissociate, {{separating}} the mind from feelings that are causing anguish. This may {{be achieved by}} tricking the mind into believing that the present suffering being felt {{is caused by the}} self-harm instead of the issues they were facing previously: the physical pain therefore acts as a distraction from the original emotional pain. To complement this theory, one can consider the need to [...] "stop" [...] feeling emotional pain and mental agitation. [...] "A person may be hyper-sensitive and overwhelmed; a great many thoughts may be revolving within their mind, and they may either become triggered or could make a decision to stop the overwhelming feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|Nancy is also {{treated with}} respect: her {{decisions}} are rarely questioned {{and she is}} trusted by those around her.

[...] Nancy's father not only imposes no restrictions on his daughter, but trusts her both with her own car and his gun (in the original version of The Hidden Staircase [...] ), asks her advice on a frequent basis, and accedes to all her requests. Some critics, such as Betsy Caprio and Ilana Nash, argue that Nancy's relationship with her continually approving father is satisfying to girl readers because <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> vicariously experience a fulfilled Electra complex.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the forces}} that affect {{tropical}} cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during {{the life of a}} tropical system. The deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth of the troposphere, is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared, use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude, such as at the 70kPa pressure surface ( [...] above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term [...] of the storm as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> determine a more accurate long-term trajectory. High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with increased understanding {{of the forces}} that act on tropical cyclones, as well as with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades. However, scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones. The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development. [...] New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.|$|E

2500|$|Mathew McCubbins and Thomas Schwartz have {{categorized}} oversight {{into two}} types- police patrol and fire alarm patrol. Police patrol refers to oversight when legislators instigate investigations into bureaucracies and actively search for bureaucratic drift. Such oversight may involve legislators monitoring agencies, reading reports, conducting field studies, and questioning officials. Unlike police patrol, Congress also uses fire-alarm patrol by constructing procedures that allow citizens {{and interest groups}} to alert legislators of drift. This method involves less action by congress, and McCubbins and Schwartz {{argue that it is}} preferred by legislators as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> devote less time and resources to oversight. However, other scholars criticize fire-alarm patrol by arguing that citizens' complaints may never reach legislators and those that do may be deceitful, thus sounding [...] "false alarms".|$|E
2500|$|Swarming is {{advantageous}} to less powerful countries and groups, because <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> balance their disadvantage in firepower and numbers. Despite being less technically advanced, Communist forces made {{good use of}} swarming in Asia during the Cold War. The Chinese {{were able to make}} up for their lack of firepower by attacking from all sides and then quickly advancing to the rear. The Vietcong were famous from attacking from all directions out of nowhere and then quickly disappearing. When they did come into close contact, they used a technique called [...] "hugging the belt", which meant they were too close for the US to employ air and artillery support. If the attackers [...] "hugged" [...] at several points, [...] "pulsing" [...] their attacks, they both neutralized external fire support, but also made it difficult for the US commander to know where to commit reserves.|$|E
60|$|To {{most of our}} {{wild birds}} man must appear as a being {{eccentric}} and contradictory in his actions. By turns he is hostile, indifferent, friendly towards them, so that they never quite know what to expect. Take {{the case of a}} blackbird who has gradually acquired trustful habits, and builds its nest in the garden or shrubbery in sight of the friends that have fed it in frosty weather; so little does it fear that <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come a dozen times a day, put the branches aside and look upon it, and even stroke its back as it sits on its eggs. By and by a neighbour's egg-hunting boy creeps in, discovers the nest, and pulls it down. The bird finds itself betrayed by its confidence; had it suspected the boy's evil intentions it would have made an outcry at his approach, as at the appearance of a cat, and the nest would perhaps have been saved. The result of such an accident would probably be the unsettling of an acquired habit, the return to the usual suspicious attitude.|$|E

50|$|During {{the spring}} of 411 BC, the Eretrians drove the Athenians out of Oropos {{with the help of}} the Boeotians.
