40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the luteolytic effect of <b>fenprostalene,</b> a prostaglandin F 2 α analogue, in mares Ten mares, that included seven cyclic mares, lactating mares and a pregnant mare were used in two experiments. In the first experiment, seven mares were treated subcutaneously with 250 μg <b>fenprostalene</b> {{and in the second}} experiment ten mares, including the seven mares used in the first experiment, were treated with <b>fenprostalene</b> and artificially inseminated during the induced estrus. <b>Fenprostalene</b> caused luteolysis in the normal cycling mares and the pregnant mare. Mares showed estrus within one to five days after treatment. Six of the ten mares conceived during the induced estrus and a further two conceived during the next estrus. The compound produced a side effect consisting of a small, raised, sometimes painful skin swelling at the injection site, which lasted for one to two days...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-two {{dairy cows}} {{diagnosed}} as having cystic ovarian degeneration were used to study the correlation between rectal palpation findings and plasma progesterone concentrations and the response of cysts to treatment using <b>fenprostalene,</b> a luteolytic agent. Rectal palpation accurately determined the presence of luteal cysts as confirmed by plasma progesterone concentrations of 3 ng/mL or more. Treatment with <b>fenprostalene</b> was very effective for luteal cysts: {{a high percentage of}} treated cows exhibited estrus within seven days after treatment. The conception rate following artifical insemination during the induced estrus was 87. 5 % (21 / 24). Rectal palpation was much less accurate for the diagnosis of follicular cysts. Cows {{diagnosed as having}} follicular cysts had wide variations in plasma progesterone concentrations. Response to <b>fenprostalene</b> treatment was poor in cows with nonluteinized cystic follicles associated with low progesterone concentrations. However, cows diagnosed as having follicular cysts, but with progesterone concentrations of 1 ng/mL or more, responded better to <b>fenprostalene</b> treatment than cows with low progesterone concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Alfavet® (alfaprostol), an {{experimental}} prostaglandin analog for inducing abortion in feedlot heifers, was evaluated for efficacy. Abortion was induced within 8 days following injection of 5 mg alfaprostol in 45 of 51 heifers (88. 2 %) ranging from 40 to 150 days in gestation. Bovilene® (<b>fenprostalene),</b> injected at 1 mg per head resulted in abortion in 45 of 49 heifers (91. 8 %) of similar pregnancy status. Both products were 95 - 100 % effective from 40 to 120 days of pregnancy, but only 75 % effective from 121 to 150 days...|$|E
