Most {{of the courses}} in this field are conventional organised by <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching.</b> Modern interactive forms of further education like business games or role-games are found. The advantage of these forms is that the participant can sample different roles, their relationship and the dependencies. Especially complex topics with different actors can be presented and sampled in this way very descriptively with {{the effect that the}} participants better understand and remind the topic. In this paper a business game for the topic planning and management of train paths is elaborated. This new seminar will replenish the existing educational program of the railway operation research centre which will be introduced at first...|$|E

A customized user-interface based on palettes is optimized for use in class, and notebooks provide associated math content with a strong emphasis on visualization. The multilingual nature of the learning units makes them useful for transnational school collaboration projects, as has been demonstrated in a pilot project. The problems and exercises are oriented towards applications and encourage explorative group projects. This leads, in particular, to an improved image of mathematics and math instruction among students. 1 Introduction- The LTM Project While classical <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching</b> is still the most widespread form of math-instruction in high schools, there is an increasing percentage of teachers who regard computer-supported ways of teaching a welcome means of arousing interest in students and increasing their leve...|$|E
40|$|Preface I came to Denmark {{in summer}} 2005 {{in order to}} {{complete}} a study year as an exchange student within the Erasmus programme at Roskilde University. After four semesters at the universities in Trier and Münster in Germany I wanted to try something different. I explored the study possibilities in Denmark on the websites of the universities and stumbled upon Roskilde University’s geography department. There was some information about this ominous problem-oriented project work, students could conduct nearly independently. This sounded like the total opposite of <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching</b> and uncritical repetition of the lectures content in long lasting written examinations. As this thesis documents, I am still at Roskilde University. Continuing and now finishing my studies in geography and communication, by learning on one’s own responsibility with input from very interesting courses, was the right choice for me. Consequently, the motivation for taking Roskilde University as a case in this thesis derives from my status as exchange student in the beginning, successively {{becoming more and more}} involved in the universities everyday life, also during some jobs as a student assistant.

40|$|Today, {{companies}} {{are faced with}} decreasing profit margins due to economic crisis and global competition. At the same time, in many higher educational institutions, students attend rather unattractive courses by sitting and listening to lecturers <b>teaching</b> <b>ex-cathedra.</b> This paper describes how Lean Learning Academy, an innovative training programme on lean manufacturing, {{can contribute to the}} competitiveness of companies, to the employability of employees and students, to the motivation of students, and to the attractiveness of engineering curricula. The training programme can be considered as a successful innovative alternative for the traditional way of teaching. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Attendance at {{classical}} lectures usually {{leads to}} rather poor learning success. A {{wide variety of}} studies show that while lectures are as effective as any other method for transmitting information, they are inferior in many other dimensions. Lectures are not as effective as discussion methods in promoting thought and they are ineffective at teaching behavioral skills and subject-related values {{as well as at}} awakening interest in a subject. Still <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching</b> is a favored way to cope with a high student-to-teacher ratio. To solve this conflict between organizational and pedagogical requirements, a group of researchers at the Institute of Teacher Education at the University of Zurich has developed a hybrid course setting using an online learning platform. Their setting incorporates a dialog among students within a large lecture class. Furthermore a feedback loop enables the lecturer to continuously adjust the content of the lecture to the learning process of the students. In this article, the authors first present the structure of this setting and then illustrate how to implement it by the web-based open source learning management system OLAT (Online Learning and Training). Based on their research, they focus on key components for the success of their hybrid dialog. They show how individual and group learning can be fostered with corresponding assignments, assessments, and assigned roles such as moderators. Thus, the authors will define their position that the challenge of a large lecture class can be met while successfully implementing social learning and process-oriented assessments of academic achievement...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{percentage of}} modern industry is active {{on the global}} market. Their work is increasingly organized in projects consisting of globally distributed engineers. For this they {{must be able to}} rely on special competences often not learned from university courses. Professional intercultural collaboration requires competences that are rather acquired from training on the job than from <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching.</b> Filling this gap at the university level is a major challenge of modern engineering education. To face this challenge the Technische Universität Berlin (TUB), Berlin, Germany, the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Carlos, Brazil, are collaborating since 2004 in a special course named Global Engineering Teams (GET). Here students work for six month in teams evenly composed of future engineers from the involved university partners. The projects are actual problems from the reality of the involved industrial partners. There are no case studies or training exercises involved, so the project results are desirous expected by the industry. The concept of GET was constantly improved and is accompanied by constant action research. During the last six years GET included more global university partners every year. Today GET consists of five partner Universities: SOCIESC, Brazil, Stellenbosch University (SBU), South Africa, TUB, Germany, University of Botswana (UoB), Botswana, and USP, Brazil. In this paper the idea and working principle of GET is described. The benefits for the students engineering education are explained. An overview over the projects of the year 2008 will be given. The effects on competences of this form of project oriented engineering education will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Die Dissertation „Spielend lernen?“ beschäftigt sich mit einer methodisch-didaktischen Vergleichsstudie zu den Unterrichtsmethoden Lernspiel und fragend-entwickelndem Unterricht im Hinblick auf die Parameter Lernerfolg, Motivation und veränderte Spieleinstellungen durch die Schullaufbahn. Ziel der Studie war es, die Einsatzmöglichkeiten und die Effizienz des Unterrichtskonzepts Lernspiel, stellvertretend für eine Vielzahl alternativer Unterrichtsmethoden, mit dem altbewährten fragend-entwickelnden Unterricht zu vergleichen. An der Studie nahmen 382 Gymnasialschüler/innen der Jahrgangsstufen sechs, acht, elf und dreizehn in den Unterrichtsfächern Biologie, Pädagogik und Deutsch teil. Beide Methodenkonzepte wurden aufbereitet und in Unterrichtseinheiten der Sekundarstufen auf ihre jeweiligen Effekte hin verglichen. Mittels Kontrollgruppendesign, Leistungstests und eines Schülerfragebogens wurden die Ergebnisse zum Einfluss von Lernspielen auf die Konstrukte gewonnen. Ausgehend vom aktuellen Forschungsstand vereint das Lernspiel überdurchschnittlich viele lern-, sozial- und motivationsfördernde Elemente, was sich in einer Effektsteigerung in den Konstruktbereichen auswirken könnte. Entgegen der Erwartungen schnitten Lernspiel und fragend-entwickelnder Unterricht im Hinblick auf den Lernerfolg gleich stark ab. Auf motivationaler Ebene setzte sich das Lernspiel hingegen deutlich ab. Sozialisationsbedingte Zuschreibungsprozesse beeinflussten die Einschätzungen der Schüler/innen im Hinblick auf einem effektiven Lernspieleinsatz durch die Schullaufbahn. Zusätzlich zeigte sich ein hoher Grad an Lernpassivität auf Seiten der Schüler/innen, eine Stigmatisierung des Lernens und des Spielens, erlernte Hilflosigkeit gegenüber unbekannten Unterrichtsmethoden und der deutliche Wunsch nach einer Lehrerpersönlichkeit mit methodischem Rückgrat. Diese Aspekte wurden in der vorliegenden Arbeit vertiefend diskutiert. Motivated by {{the current}} debate on {{education}} as well as {{against the background of}} requirements for a reformation of the German educational system a methodical comparative study was realised at a secondary school in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). The study included 382 pupils at the age of ten to twenty. The aim was to compare the effect on learning archievement and motivation and to explore general opportunities of a modern educational concept, the educational game, as a representative for a multiplicity of alternative teaching concepts with traditional <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching</b> concepts. Both educational concepts were developed for and tested in a sixth, eighth, eleventh and thirteenth form at a grammar school. Empirical results concerning the influence of educational design on learning achievement and motivation as well as gaming attitude through school career were based on control-group design, performance tests, student-questionnaires and teachers monitoring. Based on the current research status, the modern educational game combines superior elements of (social) learning and motivational advancement. These aspects are supposed to {{have a positive effect on}} the constructs of the present empirical study. Despite all expectations, the pupils learning through educational games showed no significantly better school performance in any categories than the pupils of the control-group, taught by <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching</b> concept. There was only one exception: The pupils using the educational games were more motivated to learn intensively than the control-group. Another aspect was also interesting to recognize: Over the years the general attitude towards gaming changed as expected, whereas educational games were rated to be advantageous rather for younger children than for older ones. Through their school career, pupils are accustomed to remain passive in most lessons, because the teachers take the active part. Pupils often show obedience related to teaching methods their teachers prefer - which is in most cases the traditional ex-cathedra way. During thirteen years of school, pupils reveal a sort of acquired helplessness towards modern teaching methods. New teaching methods such as educational games are connected with fun which does not fit with the pupils` experiences with learning. Pupils tend to stigmatize the learning process during school days based on plenty of negative experiences. This stigmatism is not the only critical aspect the empirical study revealed: Pupils show a clear wish for teacher personalities who stand behind the methodical teaching concepts they use. Teachers with methodical willingness are required to have courage to break new grounds through trying out new didactical teaching methods with no regrets but the capability of critical reflection...|$|E
40|$|Universities {{are facing}} new {{problems}} {{because of the}} current enormous growth of knowledge and increasing requirements in veterinary medical education. Next to basic education the veterinary medical educational institutions are requested to enable specialization to students and to provide postgraduate education. For this there is a search for new ways of knowledge transfer. In connection with academic education, e-learning is of increasing importance. The objective of this project was design and development of e-learning materials and their use in university courses. Acceptance of e-learning and its possibilities of integration into the veterinary medical education was evaluated. As an example the course Basics of naturopathic treatment was developed into {{the form of a}} blended-learning course. The weekly <b>ex-cathedra</b> <b>teaching</b> was supplemented by e-learning materials. The interactive materials served as preparation and post-processing, as well as for absorption of the contents of the course. The students should be given the possibility to deal with the contents not depending on any given time and at their own chosen speed. The course was offered to students from the 5 th to 8 th term of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Freie Universität Berlin. For creation and management of the e-learning materials the Learning-Management-System Blackboard (Blackboard ® Inc.) was used. This system allowed besides course management and supply of communication tools the integration of different formats into a virtual learning environment. The e-learning materials could then be accessed via the internet. In order to evaluate the method of e-learning and the offered course, two questionnaires were created, one was handed out {{at the start of the}} course; whilst the other was handed out at the end of the course. The students considered e-learning a reasonable supplement to conventional teaching methods and enjoyed using it. E-Learning was judged as being suitable for the learning, from basic methods to full expertise. It was valued as better than lectures but not as good as textbooks. The students were generally open-minded about the new teaching methods and approved the wider use of e-learning in academic education. In the future it is intended to create more courses and to offer this course in form of a pure e-learning course. Furthermore the collaboration with other universities will be intensified...|$|E
