5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats {{lost control of}} the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt even {{extended}} {{an invitation}} to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, traditional supporter of the Social <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> opponent of the Moderate Party.

5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E

5|$|During {{its early}} years, the Centre Democrats {{received}} extensive media attention on two occasions. The first {{occurred when the}} Centre <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Centre Party met on 29 March 1986 in Kedichem.

5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide.

The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E

The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E
