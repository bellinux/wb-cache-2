Tomkins kept {{his place in}} the England team when they played France in a mid-season friendly, and he responded by scoring four tries on England's way to a 60–6 win, a record-equalling tally for an England player in a single match. Tomkins appeared in all three of England's matches at the 2010 Four Nations, firstly in a defeat by New Zealand where a Kevin Brown try scored from a Tomkins kick was disallowed by the video referee due to Tomkins pushing Greg Eastwood in the process. Another comprehensive defeat by Australia ended England's hopes of reaching the final, in a match where Tomkins made his first <b>international</b> <b>switch</b> from the halves to fullback. He stayed in this position for England's final match against Papua New Guinea, a 36–10 victory in which Tony Clubb equalled Tomkins' four-try record.|$|E

Only after the rapid expansion of ESS terminal offices did operator handling of international calls begin to be off-loaded into the domestic network structure, as international calling services began to be customer dialable, ca. the mid-1980s.

40|$|Minister 2 ̆ 7 s foreward As {{technology}} evolves, {{consumers are}} demanding always-on, anywhere {{access to their}} favourite content – whether {{it is on the}} television, their mobile phone or their computer. It is this passion for new services and improved technology that is driving the <b>international</b> <b>switch</b> to digital. Digital television is more efficient, more interactive, offers better picture and sound quality and delivers innovative new services to consumers. Across the globe, governments are considering how best to help their countries make the digital switch. For its part, the Government wants to work towards a Digital Australia for the many benefits it brings. Digital switchover is a key element of a package of broader reforms to the Australian media landscape. As part of these reforms, Australian consumers will see the emergence of a range of new digital only services to help make the digital experience more attractive. New digital channels will emerge and current free-to-air broadcasters will be able to boost their range of services with secondary digital channels. In addition to improved picture and sound quality and new services for Australian consumers, the switch to digital will also deliver a digital dividend to all Australians by bringing to an end the costly simulcast period and freeing up valuable spectrum for better and more efficient use. Over the next few years Australians will hear more and more about digital—its benefi ts, new channels that will be on offer and information about Australia’s transition to digital switchover which will commence in 2010 – 12. During the transition to digital television the Government’s priority is consumers. We want to ensure that all Australians can benefit from the switch to digital. The Government will work closely with the broadcasting industry to ensure the transition to digital switchover is as smooth as possible and keep consumers informed every step of the way. This is an exciting moment for Australian television—the journey to a Digital Australia has begun.
