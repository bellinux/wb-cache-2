Selma later wrote, [...] "Because I lost my mother very early and therefore had a rather difficult youth, a strong need grew in me to give people that which I had missed so much: mother-love and love of human beings. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> profession of nursing".|$|E
500|$|The costume {{designer}} {{for the series}} is Giovanna Ottobre-Melton, who felt comfortable with the series' period setting after spending months researching American styles in the 1940s for the 2013 television series Mob City. She noted that [...] "many comic books were all blended by the color, style, and fabrics" [...] from 1940s New York. Due to {{the large amount of}} action in the series, fabrics [...] "with the feel and texture of the 1940s" [...] had to be sourced in large quantities, to allow for the creation of four, five, or more of each costume. Ottobre-Melton's process [...] "for each episode, [...] read the script first, and then search for historic photos that relate to what the episode is about. Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> fabrics, and then begin to design the outfits." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} Stiffelio (attributable not {{least to the}} censors of the time taking offence at the taboo subject of the {{supposed}} adultery of a clergyman's wife and interfering with the text and roles) incited Verdi to take pains to rework it, although even in the completely recycled version of Aroldo (1857) it still failed to please. Rigoletto, with its intended murder of royalty, and its sordid attributes, also upset the censors. Verdi would not compromise: What does the sack matter to the police? Are they worried about the effect it will produce?...Do they think they know better than I?...I see the hero has been made no longer ugly and hunchbacked!! Why? [...] A singing hunchback...why not?...I think it splendid to show this character as outwardly deformed and ridiculous, and inwardly passionate and full of love. <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> subject for these very qualities...if they are removed I can no longer set it to music.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did <b>I</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> latter," [...] said I, with an {{assumption}} of sudden airiness {{and such a}} grimace as was {{part and parcel of}} my old-time trade, [...] "then were I truly worthy of the former, for I should have proved myself, indeed, a fool. Yet if <b>I</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> former, <b>I</b> pray that you'll not follow the same course of reasoning, and hold me worthy of the latter." ...|$|R

500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} out to you that <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E
500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E
2500|$|Francis {{acknowledged}} that he carried his emphasis on mercy too far when he reduced the penalty of a pedophile priest from imprisonment to a lifetime of prayer and being barred from saying Mass or being near children, along with five years of psychotherapy. He said of the case: [...] "I was new and I didn't understand these things well, and before two choices <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> more benevolent one. ...It {{was the only time}} I did it, and never again".|$|E

2500|$|In January 1994, Minogue married actor Julian McMahon, {{whom she}} met in 1991 {{while working on}} the {{television}} series Home and Away. McMahon {{is the son of}} the former Prime Minister of Australia Sir William McMahon. Minogue and McMahon were married for less than two years and divorced in 1995. In October 1995, Minogue posed nude in the Australian edition of Playboy. Commenting on the reason she posed nude, Minogue said she [...] "just had a marriage break-up. Most women go to the hairdressers – I did Playboy. <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> photographer, the location, what I did or didn't want to wear and everything else about the pictures. I found it a really liberating, empowering experience". The edition featuring Minogue sold out in under four days and became one of the best-selling editions in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Mayweather {{said of the}} fight, [...] "This was my last fight. Tonight, {{ladies and}} gentlemen, for sure <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> right dance partner to dance with. Conor McGregor, you are {{a hell of a}} champion." [...] He added, “He’s a tough {{competitor}} and I think we gave the fans what they wanted to see. I owed them for the Pacquiao fight. I must come straight ahead and give the fans a show, and that’s what I gave them.” McGregor felt the fight was stopped prematurely, but nevertheless respected the decision and admitted he was tired. Mayweather agreed with the stoppage, and explained that he avoided inflicting more damage on McGregor to protect him from brain damage, saying [...] "He has a career. You know, he still has a career. ...(It could've been) very damaging." ...|$|E
