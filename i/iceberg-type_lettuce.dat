Average (median) levels of nitrate in lettuce, <b>iceberg-type</b> <b>lettuce</b> and spinach (1156, 798 and 1410 mg kg- 1 w. w. respectively) were lower than the maximum limits established by the EU legislation. Thirteen fresh spinach samples exceeded the regulatory limits. Median nitrate values in other vegetables for which a maximum limit has not been fixed by the European Commission were 196, 203, 1597, 96, 4474 and 2572 mg kg- 1 w. w. (for potato, carrot, chard, artichoke, rucola and lab's lettuce respectively). The estimated nitrate daily intake through vegetable consumption for adult, extreme consumers and children {{were found to be}} about 29 %, 79. 8 % and 15. 1 % respectively, of the acceptable daily intake (3. 7 mg kg- 1). The levels (median value 60. 4 mg kg- 1 w. w.) found in vegetable-based baby foods were, in all cases, lower the maximum level proposed by EU legislation. The estimated nitrate daily intake through baby foods for infants between 0 - 1 and 1 - 2 years were 13 % and 18 % respectively, of the acceptable daily intake...|$|E
