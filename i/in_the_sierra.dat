5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further {{modified}} the region starting about 2 to 3 {{million years ago}} and ending sometime around 10,000 BP.

The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers.

5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results showed}} that fire is a common and {{important}} disturbance agent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> de Córdoba, with large fires affecting the four studied sierran ranges.

Nevertheless, fire activity differs among the four sierran ranges, especially in fire seasonality and frequency. This is the first research using spatially explicit fire data at mid-high resolution (30 m) to study <b>the</b> fire regimes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> de Córdoba (Argentina) including semiarid Chaco forests.

5|$|Plectania nannfeldtii is {{typically}} found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris, often {{in or near}} snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a preference for the wood of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa {{as well as other}} conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada and in higher elevations of the Pacific Coast Ranges.

5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra)</b> and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, DiCaprio {{was made}} a {{commander}} of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture for his contributions to the arts. The following year, the actor starred in both Blood Diamond and The Departed. In Edward Zwick's war film Blood Diamond, he starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone Civil War. The film itself received generally favorable reviews, and DiCaprio was praised for the authenticity of his South African Afrikaner accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate. In Scorsese's The Departed he {{played the role of}} Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an Irish Mob in Boston. Highly anticipated, the film was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006. Budgeted at US$90 million, it also emerged as DiCaprio and Scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date, easily beating The Aviator´s previous record of US$213.7 million. DiCaprio's performance in The Departed was applauded by critics and earned him a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor. The same year, both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild nominated DiCaprio twice in the Best Actor category for both of his 2006 features, and in addition, DiCaprio earned his third Academy Award nomination for Blood Diamond.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1999, the Lomé Peace Accord was signed. Among other provisions, the {{agreement}} mandated an immediate ceasefire between the main {{parties to the}} civil war and the disarmament of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) and the RUF. It also gave the RUF status as a legitimate political party, a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone Government, and four of the twenty-two seats in the cabinet. Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, was given responsibility for the diamond mines—an appointment much criticised by observers and the international media given the RUF's history of diamond smuggling. However, Peter Hain, Minister of State for Africa, suggested that the British government {{had no choice but to}} endorse the Lomé agreement given the RUF's dominance, and that the only alternative was continued civil war. A military intervention by the United Kingdom in 1999 was ruled out as the British government had received no request for military assistance and felt it lacked the backing of the international community for a unilateral intervention. An intervention was also deemed to be politically and militarily impractical given the British military's involvement with NATO operations in Yugoslavia.|$|E
