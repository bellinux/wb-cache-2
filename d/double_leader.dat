40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a novel method for enhancing protein import into mitochondria, by tandemly duplicating the N-terminal cleavable leader peptide using a gene manipulation strategy. The import into isolated yeast mitochondria of passenger proteins (yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase subunits 8 and 9 and some mutagenised derivatives) that show {{little or no}} import when endowed with one such leader (that of Neurospora crassa mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit 9) is remarkably improved when the leader is tandemly duplicated. The import of these chimacric proteins bearing a <b>double</b> <b>leader</b> is so rapid that a series of partially processed precursor intermediates accumulates inside the mitochondria before the final proteolytic release of leader sequences from the passenger proteins. It is considered that the duplicated leader greatly accelerates delivery of the import precursors to outer membrane receptor elements and the associated translocation systems, thereby enhancing precursor uptake into mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was {{to find out how}} the wood quality differed among Silver birch provenances. The study was conducted in family, provenance and tree species experiments in SW Sweden. External features like stem straightness, spike knots, <b>double</b> <b>leader,</b> diameter, tree height, leaning and other defects were measured and analyzed. Significant differences were found between birch families and provenances for a number of measured parameters. In the family experiment, significant differences between families were found for the parameters straight trees and diameter while {{no significant differences were found}} for others measured parameters like spike knots, forking, leaning and tree height. The local provenance “Tönnersjöheden” had the best overall quality and growth in the provenance experiment while Kulbäcksliden provenance (North Sweden) had a low overall quality. In the tree species experiment, significant differences between provenances were only found for the frequency of straight and leaning trees. Asarum was suggested a good quality provenance with an overall high quality performance and a low percentage of leaning trees while Visingsö was judged a bad quality provenance with a high percentage of crooked stems and a many leaning trees...|$|E

40|$|Listeria innocua 743 {{produces}} an inhibitory activity demonstrating broad-spectrum inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Gel-electrophoretic analysis of culture supernatants indicated that two inhibitors with different molecular weights were produced by this strain. Insertion of Tn 917 into a 2. 9 Kb plasmid (pHC 743) generated mutants with either an impaired ability or {{a loss in}} ability to produce one of the inhibitors. Sequence analysis of the transposon insertion regions revealed the presence of two continuous open reading frames, the first encoding a new pediocin-like bacteriocin (lisA) and the second encoding a protein homologous with genes involved in immunity toward other bacteriocins (lisB). Translation of the bacteriocin gene (lisA) initiates from a noncanonical start codon and encodes a 71 -amino-acid prebacteriocin which lacked the <b>double</b> glycine <b>leader</b> peptidase processing site common in other type II bacteriocins. Alignment of the sequence with the processed N termini of related bacteriocins suggests that the mature bacteriocin consists of 43 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 4, 484 Da. Mutants containing insertions into lisA were sensitive to the inhibitor, indicating that lisAB forms a single operon and that lisB represents the immunity protein. Cloning of an amplicon containing the lisAB operon into Escherichia coli resulted in expression and export of the bacteriocin. This finding confirms that the phenotype {{is dependent on the}} structural and immunity gene only and that export of this bacteriocin is sec dependent. This is the first confirmation of bacteriocin production in a Listeria spp., and it is of interest that this bacteriocin is closely related to the pediocin family of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Colicins and microcins are {{proteinaceous}} {{antimicrobial agents}} produced {{by members of}} the Enterobacteriaceae which are active against other members of this family. Colicin 24 is a novel bacteriocin produced by a uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli isolated at Christchurch Hospital. Through detailed genetic analysis of the DNA encoding this toxin and assaying the toxic activity, colicin 24 was re-classified as microcin 24 and has been shown to have a similar genetic organisation to that of colicin V and a novel mode of activity. The region of DNA encoding microcin 24 was subcloned from pGOB 34 into pBR 322 generating pGOB 18 (5. 44 kb). Mutagenesis, DNA sequencing and transcomplementation identified two regions with high sequence similarity and functional homology to the ColV transporters CvaA and CvaB. The insert DNA of pGOB 18 was sequenced in both directions and has been found to contain 5267 bp encoding five open reading frames, mdbA, mtft, mtfS, mtfA and mtfB, forming three operons mdbA, mtfI/mtfS and mtfA/mtfB all of which were transcribed in the same direction. The predicted protein products of all the open reading frames except mtfB were confirmed by expressing the genes in minicells. Further mutagenesis and trans-complementation has identified mdbA as a cis acting positive regulatory gene with sequence similarity to the histone-like proteins. The mtfI and mtfS genes were confirmed as the Mcc 24 immunity gene and the Mcc 24 structural gene respectively. The genes mtfA and mtfB were found to encode the transport proteins homologous to CvaA and CvaB respectively, with mtfB encoding a protein which {{is a member of the}} ABC family of bacterial transporters. Transport also requires the TolC outer membrane protein. Analysis of the mtfS DNA sequence has identified a <b>double</b> glycine <b>leader</b> sequence, making MtfS the second microcin after ColV to belong to this class of peptide antibiotics. Experimental evidence suggested that unlike ColV, Mcc 24 is inactive within the producing cell, however both toxins require the ABC transporter for post-translational modification of the pre-peptide. The regulation of Mcc 24 synthesis is controlled by the interaction between σs, Fur, and MdbA, encoded by the mdbA gene. Analysis of the promoter sequences has identified putative regions of DNA bending which might facilitate the binding of σs and MdbA. A Fur-box with good sequence similarity to the consensus Fur-box has been identified in the mtfI/mtfS promoter and is the proposed site for Fur binding. The activity spectrum of Mcc 24 is restricted to enteric bacteria and SernA, the MccE 492 receptor, is also required as the receptor for Mcc 24. Extracts of Mcc 24 have been found to degrade both linearised and covalently closed circular DNA in vitro. The activity is absent in extracts from mtfS - strains, suggesting that Mcc 24 inhibits the growth of sensitive cells by degrading DNA. The effect of Mcc 24 expression on the virulence of E. coli was tested using the embryo lethality assay, however unlike ColV which increases the virulence of strains, the expression of Mcc 24 did not appear to have a significant effect on E. coli virulence in this system...|$|R
50|$|Leyton House {{started the}} 1991 season with Maurício Gugelmin and Ivan Capelli. The CG911 {{did not have}} a {{successful}} début at the 1991 United States Grand Prix; both cars had retired by lap 40 with gearbox trouble. In fact, it would not be until the seventh race (the 1991 French Grand Prix) of the season that Leyton House finished a race; Gugelmin took seventh place, whilst Capelli crashed out of the race after colliding with the Minardi of Gianni Morbidelli. It was the unreliability of the Ilmor engine that caused most of the team's problems; by the French Grand Prix, six of the retirements had been caused by engine failure. After two more races with double retirements, the CG911's best result of the season came at the 1991 Hungarian Grand Prix; not only did both cars finish, but Capelli was able to take sixth place, one lap behind the <b>leader.</b> <b>Double</b> engine failure followed at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, but both CG911s finished at the 1991 Italian Grand Prix, albeit out of the points (Capelli, in eighth, was the highest-placed of the two drivers). Gugelmin followed this with seventh place at both the 1991 Portuguese Grand Prix and the 1991 Spanish Grand Prix. However, Akagi was arrested in connection with the Fuji Bank scandal, and, needing the funds to keep going, Leyton House replaced Capelli with Karl Wendlinger for the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix, who brought backing from Mercedes-Benz. Although Wendlinger had an unsuccessful début for the team, as he was taken out by Andrea de Cesaris's Jordan (as were both the Dallaras of JJ Lehto and Emanuele Pirro), Gugelmin continued his run of finishes with an eighth place. Leyton House finished the season on a sour note at the 1991 Australian Grand Prix; Gugelmin crashed in the pit lane on lap 13 due to heavy rain, injuring two marshalls in the process, and Wendlinger was running dead-last in 20th, two laps down, when the race was stopped on lap 14. Leyton House thus finished the season 12th, and last of the classified teams, in the Constructors' Championship, whilst Capelli finished 20th in the Drivers' Championship.|$|R
5000|$|The band's name (meaning [...] "dancing manias" [...] in German) {{came about}} by {{randomly}} pointing to {{words in a}} German dictionary, the same technique Stipe had employed to find the R.E.M. moniker (except with an English dictionary). The band toured the U.S. southeast and recorded a single for David Healy's Dasht Hopes label. In his book [...] "It crawled from the South", Marcus Grey writes: [...] "Determined to pursue his art-noise interests parallel to his more conventional activities with R.E.M., Michael hooked up with William Lee Self, Neil McArthur and David Pierce in Tanzplagen. The connection was strengthened when Oh-OK Lynda Stipe and Linda Hopper contributed backing vocals at a 40 Watt Club appearance that was taped to provide a rough-and ready three track demo. It includes the Self compositions 'Living By the Neck' and 'Peter Pan', and the Stipe-Self song 'meeting'. In addition to further occasional appearances in town and one short local tour Tanzplagen even {{got as far as}} recording tracks for a single, intended for release on David Healys ill-fated Dasht Hopes label. The studio chosen was Bombay in Smyrna where back in February R.E.M. had made its first recordings. Neil McArthur had left {{by the time of the}} session, and so William Lee Self, the groups real <b>leader,</b> <b>doubled</b> on bass while Lynda Stipe supplied vocals. However it is Michaels contribution to the two songs recorded ('meeting' and Self's 'treason') that Producer Joe Perry remembers: 'Micheal would sing and bang on a Farfisa organ creating a large explosion. It was a different time. Experimental stuff'". Soon later, R.E.M. were signed to IRS and released the Chronic Town EP (which had been recorded for Healy's label's debut release), but the Tanzplagen single went unreleased until 1991 when Strangeways Records brought it out as their inaugural release. The CD includes a duet with Stipe and his sister Lynda and some improvised live recordings that include Linda Hopper, her band mate at the time in the band Oh-OK. Self describes the contents of [...] "The Lost Single and Live at the 40 Watt club, Athens Georgia 1981": [...] "thus I wrote the song 'Living By The Neck' but had no title for it, Stipe came up with the title only meaning 'living by the guitar neck'. We also intentionally booked all our in town shows on full moon nights - this truly made a drastic but wonderful difference in the atmosphere and audiences behaviour." [...] Tanzplagen dissolved in late 1982 when Self relocated to Germany. David Pierce went on to form Buzz Of Delight with Mathew Sweet. Neil McArthur continued his studies at the University of Georgia.|$|R
