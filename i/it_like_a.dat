5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across <b>it,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E
5|$|Boys Don't Cry {{aired in}} Canada at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 1999. It premiered in the U.S. at the New York Film Festival on October 8, 1999, to {{critical}} acclaim. It was {{shown at the}} Reel Affirmations International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in early October, where it won further praise and appeared at the Venice International Film Festival. Boys Don't Cry was given a special screening in snippets at the Sundance Film Festival. At that time, the film was still called Take <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Man. The film received a limited release theatrically on October 22, 1999, in the U.S., where it was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox that specializes in independent films. Initially, many viewers complained via email to Peirce that the film was not being shown near them, as the film was only being shown on 25 screens across the country. However, this number increased to nearly 200 by March 2000. The film grossed $73,720 in its opening week. By December 5, the film had grossed in excess of $2 million. By May 2000, it had a U.S. total gross of $11,540,607—more than three times its production budget. Internationally, the film was released on March 2, 2000 in Australia and on April 9, 2000, in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
25|$|Harper Collins {{published}} his first autobiography, Take <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Man, in 1995, written with Spencer Bright. The book was released {{at the same}} time as George's solo album Cheapness and Beauty and dealt with the same themes, including a number of photographs. Take <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Man was a best-seller in the UK.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Kirk Brandon sued George for libel {{claiming}} that George mentioned {{a love affair}} between them in George's autobiography, Take <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Man. George won the court case and Brandon was ordered to pay £200,000 to Virgin Records, EMI Virgin Music and the book publisher in costs. Brandon declared himself bankrupt, which resulted in Boy George paying over £20,000 in legal fees.|$|E

This allows Green to float with <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hot-air balloon as well as block narrow passageways—a tactic instrumental in helping Silver and her escape the Masked Man. It evolved in Breaking the Restraint into a Wigglytuff alongside two of Green's other Pokémon with the power of her Moon Stones.|$|E
25|$|The shot of Petersen {{running along}} the top of the {{dividers}} between the terminal's moving sidewalk at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police. The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen's safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he hurt himself. The actor told Friedkin that they should do the stunt anyway so the director proposed that they treat <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials.|$|E

Their music and their act were part of a tradition in jazz and rhythm and blues, but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience. In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a short subject entitled Round Up of Rhythm, performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.|$|E

25|$|Brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) {{have been}} {{observed}} to methodically use bark pieces to remove other flakes of bark from a tree. The birds insert the bark piece underneath an attached bark scale, using <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wedge and lever, to expose hiding insects. Occasionally, they reuse the same piece of bark several times and sometimes even fly short distances carrying the bark flake in their beak. The evolutionary origin of this tool use {{might be related to}} these birds frequently wedging seeds into cracks in the bark to hammer them open with their beak, which can lead to bark coming off.|$|E
25|$|Soon a {{coach at}} the school, Gennadiy Korshunov, noticed her. She had drawn a balance beam {{in the sand and}} was practising moves on <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real gymnast. He invited her into the school. He asked his wife, Ina, also a {{gymnastics}} {{coach at the}} school, to train Davydova in her group. Yuri Shtukman, the administrator at the school, did not like this initiative by his new training staff and reprimanded the Korshunovs; however he allowed Davydova to stay in the school. It soon became apparent that she was a talented gymnast and Gennadiy took over her coaching himself. By 1972 Davydova was the best in her age group at the school.|$|E
25|$|Act Two {{begins with}} fitness queen, Brooke Wyndham, and her fitness team's workout video, {{which is being}} viewed by Elle, Callahan, Emmett, Vivienne, Warner, and Enid ("Whipped Into Shape"). Callahan tells the legal team that Brooke is accused of murdering her billionaire husband. At the jail, the legal team are unable to get Brooke to tell them her alibi and refuses to plead guilty. Upon {{learning}} that they were both Delta Nu sisters, Brooke then privately tells Elle her alibi that she was getting liposuction, but makes Elle promise not to tell anyone ("Delta Nu Nu Nu"). Because of Elle's loyalty to her client and refusal to state the alibi, Elle and Emmett are shunned by the group. To cheer Emmett up and to increase his chances of impressing Callahan, Elle gives him a makeover ("Take <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>A</b> Man").|$|E
