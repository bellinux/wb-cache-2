50|$|MG Sport & Racing built two MG ZR 160's to Group N Specification for the 2003 National Saloon Car Championship. After {{only two}} events, {{and due to}} poor grids, the 'Team Airconstruct' cars were {{modified}} with <b>dry-break</b> refuelling systems and entered into the EERC Britcar Endurance Series run by James Tucker.Driven by car owner John Hammersley and teenager Andrew Dunlop, car # 34 was a late entry into the Series, with only eight races remaining. In a remarkable season the Hammersley/Dunlop pairing scored maximum points in Britcar Class 4 in seven out of eight events, missing out on the overall title, and a perfect score, by only two points to Andy Rouse in a DTM Mercedes, and Callum Lockie in a BMW M3.John Hammersley with son Mark took the Series win {{in the following year}} with the car, which had by then been upgraded to 'works' specification , Group N+ Spec. The MG ZR is now raced in the MGCC in two classes, 160s and 190. The races are close and fun filled.|$|E
