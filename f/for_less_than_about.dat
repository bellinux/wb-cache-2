We show how this, in its own right, gives a fast and effective clustering of data.

40|$|Coherent diffractive imaging with ultrashort pulses has the {{potential}} to break many limits inherent in imaging and structural analysis, especially for biological objects [1, 2]. One limitation to imaging is set by the wavelength, with shorter wavelengths resolving finer structures. However, in X-ray microscopy using conventional sources, damage due to this ionizing radiation sets a maximum dose which limits the signal, and hence the resolution that can be achieved, to about 30 nm [3]. We are applying the concept of “diffraction before destruction, ” using pulses shorter than the damage timescales. Coherent diffractive imaging is lensless. By avoiding the use of a lens, the technological limitation of lens-based X-ray microscopy is also avoided. Yet another limitation to conventional imaging is the requirement to mount the sample on a substrate, and possibly cryogenically cool it to extend radiation tolerance. We inject particles into the beam at speeds up to ~ 100 ms- 1 [4]. Hydrated samples are in a vacuum environment <b>for</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 100 µs before interaction with the pulse, and no further sample preparation or cooling is required.

40|$|The recent {{theoretical}} {{discovery of}} families of travelling wave solutions in pipe flow at Reynolds numbers {{lower than the}} transitional range naturally {{raises the question of}} their relevance to the turbulent transition process. Here a series of numerical experiments are conducted in which we look for the spatial signature of these travelling waves in transitionary flows. Working within a periodic pipe of 5 D (diameters) length, we find that travelling waves with low wall shear stresses (lower branch solutions) are on a surface which separates initial conditions which uneventfully relaminarise and those which lead to a turbulent evolution. Evidence for recurrent travelling wave visits is found in both 5 D and 10 D long periodic pipes but only for those travelling waves with low-to-intermediate wall shear stress and <b>for</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 10 % of the time in turbulent flow. Given this, it seems unlikely that the mean turbulent properties such as wall shear stress can be predicted as an expansion over the travelling waves in which their individual properties are appropriately weighted. Rather, further dynamical structures such as periodic orbits need to be isolated and included in any such expansion. Comment: 37 pages, 27 figure...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since their}} first {{discovery}} in 1960, {{the origin of}} the relatively short-lived radionuclides, now extinct but alive in the early solar system, has been under debate. Possible scenarios are either nucleosynthetic production in stellar sources, e. g., asymptotic giant branch stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, novae, and supernovae, with subsequent injection into the solar nebula, or the production by spallation reactions in the early solar system. Here we present model calculations for the second scenario, the production of the relatively short-lived radionuclides by solar energetic particle events {{at the start of the}} solar system. The model is based on our current best knowledge of the nuclear reaction probabilities. In addition, the modeling depends on the relative fluence contribution of protons, 3 He, and 4 He in the solar particle events as well as on their energy distribution. The relative fluence contribution is the only free parameter in the system. Finally, the modeling depends on the chemical composition assumed for the irradiated target. The model simultaneously describes the observed solar system initial ratios 7 Be/ 9 Be, 10 Be/ 9 Be, 26 Al/ 27 Al, 41 Ca/ 40 Ca, 53 Mn/ 55 Mn, and 92 Nb/ 93 Nb. In the framework of the local production scenario, the concordance of measured and modeled data for nuclides with half-lives ranging from 53 days up to 36 Myr enables us to put some stringent constraints on possible calcium-aluminum-rich refractory inclusion (CAI) production and its timing. One important requirement in such a scenario is that the material forming most of the CAIs must have experienced a surprisingly homogenous particle fluence. CAIs showing evidence for live 10 Be, 26 Al, 41 Ca, 53 Mn, and 92 Nb close to the inferred solar system initial ratios would have to have been irradiated within ∼ 1 Myr. Much more stringent would be the time constraint for the one CAI for which formerly live 7 Be has been reported. Such CAIs would have to have been irradiated <b>for</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>about</b> 1 yr. Such a short timescale requires flux densities as high as ∼ 10 16 cm- 2 s- 1. To allow further tests of the local production scenario, we also predict solar system initial ratios for 14 C/ 12 C, 22 Na/ 23 Na, 36 Cl/ 35 Cl, 44 Ti/ 48 Ti, 54 Mn/ 55 Mn, 63 Ni/ 60 Ni, and 91 Nb/ 93 Nb, whose correlated shifts in the daughter isotopes would help to further test the local production scenario...|$|E

40|$|CoRoT, {{the pioneer}} space-based transit search, {{steadily}} provides thousands of high-precision light curves with continuous time sampling over periods {{of up to}} 5 months. The transits of a planet perturbed by an additional object are not strictly periodic. By studying the transit timing variations (TTVs), additional objects can be detected in the system. A transit timing analysis of CoRoT- 1 b is carried out to constrain the existence of additional planets in the system. We used data obtained by an improved version of the CoRoT data pipeline (version 2. 0). Individual transits were fitted to determine the mid-transit times, and we analyzed the derived O-C diagram. N-body integrations were used to place limits on secondary planets. No periodic timing variations with a period shorter than the observational window (55 days) are found. The presence of an Earth-mass Trojan is not likely.
