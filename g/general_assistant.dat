40|$|Magister Curationis - MCurThe {{current debate}} on knowledge, attitudes and {{perceptions}} of medical staff and the broader community towards mentally ill patients across the world is also quite extensive in South Africa. The literature on the subject matter demonstrates poor knowledge of mental illness {{in the general population}} and also indicates that people often have stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness. However, while most studies have explored the attitudes, perceptions and behaviour towards mentally ill patients with respect to various staff categories such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, psychologist and the community globally and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, few studies have extended the analysis to include <b>general</b> <b>assistants.</b> Moreover, little research has been carried out on the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards mental illness and mentally ill patients of non-medical staff such as <b>general</b> <b>assistants,</b> who on a daily basis spend time with mentally health care users, ensuring hygiene in psychiatric hospitals in South Africa. This study intended to fill the gap by using a quantitative, descriptive approach encompassing a cross-sectional survey design to identify the level of basic mental health knowledge and determine attitudes {{and perceptions of}} <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> towards mental illness and mentally ill patients in four government funded psychiatric hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa. A random sample of 124 was selected from the <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> of the four psychiatric hospitals in Cape Town. The results established that the majority of <b>General</b> <b>Assistants</b> (75. 6 %) in all four psychiatric hospitals demonstrated fair basic mental health knowledge pertaining to mental illness and positive attitudes and perceptions towards mentally ill patients. Although the attitudes and perceptions are mostly positive, item analysis revealed that there are disparities in the results. One third of the <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> find it stressful to work with mentally ill people. Others displayed frustration (30, 1 %), mistrust (52 %) and fear(12 %). In addition, 82. 9 % of the <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> like working with mentally ill people and the majority of the <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> are comfortable working with mentally ill patients. The recommendation is that basic mental health awareness programmes or in-service training should be implemented for <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> especially newly appointed <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> to improve the knowledge and understanding, attitudes and perceptions of <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> and to reduce fear and negative perceptions and attitudes in order to enhance positive patient experiences...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. (Educational Management) The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assess the management role of the principal of a state-aided school with regard to the management of <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> employed by the governing body of such a school. To ensure efficient management, the principal must implement the principles of planning, organizing leadership and control in the process of managing <b>general</b> <b>assistants.</b> Planning should be aimed at reaching short-term goals while a more mechanistic and bureaucratic organizational structure will be more effective. Communication and interaction with <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> are prerequisites for efficient leadership. Duties performed by <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> must be continuously controlled to ensure that the activities are in line with the goals of the school. The principal is essentially a manager of human resources and therefore also a personnel manager. In respect of <b>general</b> <b>assistants,</b> labour unrest must be prevented. This task represents a new dimension of management for principals of state-aided schools where labour relations have become an important issue. As of 1 September 1988, the Labour Relations Act (Act 28 of 1956) is applicable to black <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> employed at state-aided schools. Therefore the management of state-aided schools must take cognisance of the mechanisms for collective bargaining, namely, industrial councils, conciliation boards, mediation, arbitration and the Industrial Court. Collective bargaining takes place between an employer and a workers' union representing the employees...|$|R

This study aimed to identify gaps in the knowledge and attitudes of <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> about infection control and to determine if their infection control practices are in line with current policies and guidelines. In investigating the practices of <b>general</b> <b>assistants,</b> the institution was assisted to identify gaps in knowledge and try to strengthen practices. Methodology: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Letaba hospital in Mopani district. The knowledge, attitudes and practices of 97 <b>general</b> <b>assistants</b> towards infection control at a given point in time was measured through a structured questionnaire which was administered to those who consented to participate. Purposive sampling was used as only those who were at work during the data collection period were included in the study. Results - This study revealed that over 50...|$|R

500|$|The {{shore party}} of ten {{who were to}} winter at Cape Adare {{consisted}} of Borchgrevink, five scientists, a medical officer, a cook who {{also served as a}} <b>general</b> <b>assistant,</b> and two dog drivers. Of this party, five were Norwegians, two were English, one was Australian and two, the dog experts, were Samis from Northern Norway, sometimes described in expedition accounts as Lapps or [...] "Finns". Among the scientists was the Tasmanian Louis Bernacchi, who had studied magnetism and meteorology at the Melbourne Observatory. He had been appointed to the Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897–99, but had been unable to take up his post; that expedition's ship, Belgica, had failed to call at Melbourne on its way south, leaving Bernacchi stranded. Bernacchi then travelled to London and secured a place on Borchgrevink's scientific staff. His chronicle of the Southern Cross Expedition, which was published in 1901, was critical of aspects of Borchgrevink's leadership, but defended the expedition's scientific achievements. In 1901 Bernacchi went back to Antarctica as a physicist on [...] Scott's Discovery Expedition. Another of Borchgrevink's men who was to serve Scott's expedition (in command of Discoverys relief ship Morning) was Englishman William Colbeck, an experienced seaman who held a lieutenant's commission in the Royal Naval Reserve. In preparation for the Southern Cross Expedition Colbeck had taken a course in magnetism at Kew Observatory.|$|E

By means of one of his warlike exploits, the old fellow had become possessed of a very capital fowling-piece, plunder obtained from some slain English officer, I always supposed; and this arm he invariably kept near his person, as a trophy of his own success. The shooting of Westchester, however and that of the forest, were very different branches of the same art. Jaap belonged to the school of the former, in which the pointer and the setter were used. The game was [...] "put up," [...] and [...] "marked down," [...] and the bird was invariably shot on the wing. My attention was early called to this distinction, by overhearing a conversation between the negro and the Indian, that took place within a few minutes after our arrival, and a portion of which I shall now proceed to relate.|$|E
