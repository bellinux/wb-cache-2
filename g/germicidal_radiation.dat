40|$|The {{synergistic}} effect between each of two minor contaminating UV wavelengths has been studied. The TC- 7 host cell-capacity system was used. The macromolecular damage induced in monolayers of cell cultures {{as the result}} of exposure to UV radiation was measured by determining the ability of irradiated cells to support the replication of Herpes simplex virus. The macromolecule involved {{has been shown to be}} DNA and the damage is probably due to the formation of thymine dimers plus some undefined chromosphore associated with the DNA of the cell. Preliminary experiments showed that low exposures of <b>germicidal</b> <b>radiation</b> are less effective in decreasing the survival of capacity while higher exposures are more effective when compared to monochromatic 254 nm radiation. Subsequent experiments showed a synergistic interaction between 254 nm and either 295 nm or 313 nm radiation at doses comparable to those emitted from a germicidal lamp as well as greatly increased doses...|$|E

The sensitive HPLC tandem mass spectrometry assay was used to identify and quantify the different bipyrimidine photoproducts induced in the DNA of microorganisms by <b>germicidal</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> The yields of photoproducts per applied fluence were very similar among vegetative cells but twofold reduced in spores. This similarity in DNA photoreactivity greatly contrasted with the 11 -fold range determined in the fluence causing a decimal reduction of survival. It was {{also found that the}} spectrum of UV-induced bipyrimidine lesions was species-specific and the formation rates of bi-thymine and bi-cytosine photoproducts correlated with the genomic frequencies of thymine and cytosine dinucleotides in the bacterial model systems. ...|$|R

Of the forty-four thermophilic algae studied, eighteen appeared to have growth rates as great as Chlorella 71105. Optimization of the physical and chemical environments of these strains is recommended as a way to further improve growth rates and concomitant oxygen production. The mutation study revealed that Chlorella 71105 is relatively resistant to <b>germicidal</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation.</b> No high temperature mutants of Chlorella 71105 were found...|$|R
40|$|TLD- 100 (lithium fluoride) {{thermoluminescence}} dosimeters {{are widely}} employed {{for the detection}} of ionizing radiations. This paper shows that these dosimeters may also serve as practical <b>germicidal</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> dosimeters. To measure ultraviolet radiation, the TLD- 100 dosimeters are first exposed to 500, 000 roentgens of gamma radiation and then annealed at 300 °C. Subsequent dosage of ultraviolet radiation may be determined by observation of photostimulated thermoluminescence of the crystal. The presented data indicate that the thermoluminescence response is linear for exposures up to 6, 000 µjoule/cm 2 and independent of exposure rate from 0. 1 µ watt/cm 2 to above 50 µwatt/cm 2. Optical absorption, emission spectra, and sensitivity as a function of temperature of the dosimeters during ultraviolet exposure are presented. Also, a partial model of the photostimulated thermoluminescence process is presented...|$|R
40|$|Although {{ultraviolet}} (UV) disinfection {{of drinking}} water {{has been shown to}} be effective and cost efficient, one barrier to more widespread adoption is uncertainty surrounding the possible accumulation of fouling materials on quartz surfaces within UV reactors. These quartz surfaces serve as protection for the UV lamps that are immersed in the water being treated, and in many cases they can become coated with precipitated minerals and impacted particles that limit the transmission of <b>germicidal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> from the lamp into the water that is to be treated. While much of the past research on the subject of quartz fouling in UV systems has investigated the formation of foulants in reactors treating wastewater, differences in reactor geometry, lamp type, and water chemistry between these scenarios and drinking water treatment applications makes it difficult to understand how past research may apply to drinking water. Currently, there is limited information available about the chemical composition, rate of formation, and means of predicting the formation of the foulant materials that accumulate. ^ Laboratory and field experiments were conducted at several locations to investigate the relationship between water chemistry and foulant composition, formation, and UV absorbance characteristics. Low Pressure High Output (LPHO) lamp sleeves in a parallel flow configuration were examined for metals accumulation, UV transmittance, and rate of accumulation, and models of solution chemistry were used to understand the formation of mineral species. Zero order kinetics for foulant accumulation were consistently observed. Medium Pressure (MP) lamp sleeves were utilized in a perpendicular flow reactor configuration disinfecting a surface water to determine variations in fouling that can occur when reactor geometry and higher UV intensities are used. Regression modeling was utilized to develop an understanding of the absorbance characteristics of foulant components, and iron and calcium were found to be primary contributors to <b>radiation</b> absorption of <b>germicidal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> by fouled lamp sleeves. Comparisons of foulant buildup and fouling effects among multiple groundwater based treatment facilities highlighted the impact of treatment steps that cause changes in oxidation reduction potential, mineral solubility, and fouling rate. ...|$|R

Ltd., Japan) at 10  cm height, for 3 – 12  s and incubated in dark, at 28  °C, for 5 – 7  days. A specially fabricated UV exposure chamber that did not require switching the lamp on and off repeatedly was used for exposing the plates to UV for accurate time interval.

40|$|A {{new form}} of {{antimicrobial}} surface was developed, which relies on an optical mechanism rather than chemical inactivation of microorganisms. Through the photoluminescence process of upconversion, low energy photons can be amplified into higher energy photons, and in this case, phosphors capable of converting visible light into <b>germicidal</b> UVC <b>radiation</b> were synthesized. Host crystals were doped with a praseodymium activator ion and shown to emit UVC photons upon excitation by blue or violet light. Surface coatings were prepared and proof-of-concept experiments demonstrated that, under exposure to a household fluorescent lamp, sufficient UVC radiation was emitted from the surfaces to achieve observable inactivation of surface bacterial spores and inhibition of biofilm growth. Material engineering was conducted to achieve higher optical conversion efficiency, wherein lithium codoping and development of alternative oxyfluoride host crystals were found to significantly improve upconversion emission. Implications of polychromatic excitation were investigated by conducting photoluminescence spectroscopy under combined laser beam excitation, while the effects of other application parameters are also discussed. These findings show that upconversion-based antimicrobial materials have strong potential for offering sustainable and effective technology {{for the prevention of}} diseases.

40|$|Coxiella burneti phase I, {{purified}} from a formalin-inactivated yolk-sac vaccine, {{was separated}} into two bands of morphologically distinct cell types when subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. Recycling {{of the less}} dense, rod-shaped cells in unbuffered sucrose gradients (pH 5. 5 to 6. 0) resulted {{in the formation of}} bands having the location and appearance of the original two bands. Recycling of the denser band of larger ovoid-shaped cells yielded a single band, suggesting that the larger cell type arose from the smaller cell. In contrast to vaccine-derived rickettsiae, live, cell culture-propagated phase I organisms formed a single band in unbuffered sucrose gradients, at the same density as the upper band of the vaccine preparation. Centrifugation of cell culture-derived rickettsiae for 26 to 48 h in sucrose gradients of pH 5. 5 resulted in the formation of a second band, at the same density as the lower band of the vaccine preparation. This did not occur in gradients of pH 7. 0. Treatment of cell culture-propagated rickettsiae with formalin or <b>germicidal</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> induced a total shift of the less dense cell population to a zone of higher density when centrifuged isopycnically in CsC 1 gradients.

40|$|Field-scale UV systems deliver {{spatially}} non-uniform UV irradiance fields. Locations {{characterized by}} relatively high velocity and low irradiance {{are critical to}} the overall performance of UV systems {{in that they are}} responsible for delivery of relatively low UV doses. In this study, an experimental method, “local actinometry” was developed to monitor the UV irradiance at a location that approached the size of a point in the system. The actinometer used in this study was (E) - 5 -[2 -(methoxycarbonyl) ethenyl]cytidine (S), which is photo-transformed to 3 -β-D-ribofuranosyl- 2, 7 -dioxopyrido[2, 3 - d]pyrimidine (P) when subjected to UV radiation. The photoproduct, P, is strongly fluorescent. Quantum yields for P from S were estimated for <b>germicidal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> at wavelengths of 222 nm, 254 nm, and 282 nm, respectively. Quartz capillary tubes were utilized as actinometer solution conduits, and were placed at well-defined critical positions inside UV systems. The photoproduct yields were quantified by HPLC, or monitored continuously by a continuous-flow fluorometer. The measured photoproduct yields were translated to the local irradiance at the location corresponding to the capillary tube. A numerical model was developed to accurately represent the photochemical and optical behavior of the actinometer in the quartz capillary tube. A spherical source summation (SSS) model was developed to estimate UV irradiance in close proximity to UV lamps. The conjunction of these numerical models was used to accomplish the interpretation from photoproduct yields to the local UV irradiance. As such, local actinometry can be used for experimental validation of UV irradiance field models, as well as correlation with dose delivery in a continuous-flow system. ...|$|R
40|$|Outer space, {{the final}} frontier, is a hostile and unforgiving place for {{any form of}} {{life as we know}} it. The unique {{environment}} of space allows for a close simulation of Mars surface conditions that cannot be simulated as accurately on the Earth. For this experiment, we tested the resistance of Deinococcus radiodurans to survive exposure to simulated Mars-like conditions in low-Earth orbit for a prolonged period of time as part of the Biology and Mars experiment (BIOMEX) project. Special focus was placed on the integrity of the carotenoid deinoxanthin, which may serve as a potential biomarker to search for remnants of life on other planets. Survival was investigated by evaluating colony forming units, damage inflicted to the 16 S rRNA gene by quantitative PCR, and the integrity and detectability of deinoxanthin by Raman spectroscopy. Exposure to space conditions had a strong detrimental effect on the survival of the strains and the 16 S rRNA integrity, yet results show that deinoxanthin survives exposure to conditions as they prevail on Mars. Solar radiation is not only strongly detrimental to the survival and 16 S rRNA integrity but also to the Raman signal of deinoxanthin. Samples not exposed to solar radiation showed only minuscule signs of deterioration. To test whether deinoxanthin is able to withstand the tested parameters without the protection of the cell, it was extracted from cell homogenate and exposed to high/low temperatures, vacuum, <b>germicidal</b> UV-C <b>radiation,</b> and simulated solar radiation. Results obtained by Raman investigations showed a strong resistance of deinoxanthin against outer space and Mars conditions, with the only exception of the exposure to simulated solar radiation. Therefore, deinoxanthin proved to be a suitable easily detectable biomarker for the search of Earth-like organic pigment-containing life on other planets...|$|R

Results of the laboratory works. Silber ions in the water were separated through the centrifuge, absorbed in the activated carbon, not influenced by boiling, strengthened their germicidal power by adding the carban dioxide and weakened by adding the oxygen to the water, not influenced their <b>germicidal</b> power through <b>radiation</b> with ultraviolet rays, infrared rays or ultrasound waves. The resistance against silber ions of typhoid fever was the least, and against bacillary dysentery and colon bacillus were less. And against the strain of yellow Pus cocci was the most resistant among 4 kinds of strains, which we have examined. Among several sorts of metals, copper and silber presented the strongst germicidal power and this power was directly proportional to their surface area to the water temperature. We have measured the amount of silber ions in the water by the colorimetric method with Dubosq's apparatus adding p-dimethylaminobenzalrhodamine to the test water. 2. Results of the field works.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{a combined}} adsorption and advanced oxidation technology for trapping {{and destruction of}} organic pollutants in waste water. The adsorbed/immobilized pollutant {{onto the surface of}} metal supported catalyst is oxidized via advanced oxidation technology. The advanced oxidation process is carried out using Co[superscript] 2 +/KHSO[subscript] 5 (Cobalt/peroxymonosulphate) reagent to generate highly active sulphate radical (SO[subscript] 4 *), which can readily attack and oxidize the organic pollutants in waste water. The reaction mechanism of Co[superscript] 2 +/KHSO[subscript] 5 reagent follows similarly to the Fenton reagent (Fe[superscript] 2 +/H[subscript] 2 O[subscript] 2) which is used to generate hydroxyl radical (OH*). Co[superscript] 2 +/KHSO[subscript] 5 reagent has been successfully utilized for bleaching applications and oxidation of organic contaminants. Compared to hydroxyl radical, the sulphate radical is highly potent to oxidize contaminants even at basic pH. However the biggest disadvantage of using Co[superscript] 2 +/KHSO[subscript] 5 reagent is the dissolution of Co[superscript] 2 + ion into the water which poses a severe environmental hazard. In the current study, cobalt ion is incorporated into supporting media and utilized for advanced oxidation. Very few studies have so far explored the heterogeneous oxidation technology based on Co[superscript] 2 +/KHSO[subscript] 5 for the treatment of organic contaminants in water. With this research focus, various support media have been utilized to load cobalt ions, which included Zeolite A, Zeolite X, ZSM- 5, SBA- 15, Silica and Activated Carbon. Cobalt metal was incorporated into commercial Zeolites by ion exchange technique whereas in-situ cobalt loading was carried out during the synthesis of SBA- 15. Cobalt loading was done into Silica and Activated Carbon by conventional impregnation technique. The choice of cobalt loading technique inherently determines the oxidation state of cobalt species loaded into the sample which in turn determines the oxidation efficiency. Furthermore, the choice of cobalt precursor significantly affects the metal-support bonding which has been investigated by loading on silica support with different types of cobalt precursor such as cobalt chloride, cobalt acetate and cobalt nitrate. Many of these supports such as Zeolite ZSM- 5 and Activated Carbon have never been tested before for cobalt loading and oxidation via sulphate based oxidant and demonstrate efficient oxidation of phenolic pollutants. The investigation of organic oxidation using sulphate based oxidants was further extended into photocatalytic reactions. Photo degradation was carried out using artificial solar light and <b>germicidal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> in the presence of ZnO and oxidants such as peroxymonosulphate, peroxidisulphate and hydrogen peroxide. The comparison of photochemical and photocatalytic oxidation was carried out and their synergy of combination was explored. The thesis provides a thorough exploration of heterogeneous oxidation via sulphate based oxidant for the treatment of organic pollutants. The supported catalysts investigated here can be further improved and utilized as a PRB media for groundwater remediation. A final chapter discusses about the mathematical modeling of a column test to mimic a lab scale PRB in order to investigate the process parameters affecting the PRB design. The column modeling also directs towards a development of a novel “Reactive Adsorber” for the treatment of industrial waste by combined adsorption and oxidation...|$|R
