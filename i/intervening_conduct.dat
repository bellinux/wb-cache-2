The Constitution has given rise to debate about the extent to which courts may <b>intervene</b> in the <b>conduct</b> of the affairs of other arms of government, spawned by accusations by other branches of government, especially the legislature that the judiciary is exceeding its mandate by interfering in the affairs of the other arms of government. An attempt to determine to what extent the judicial arm may intervene as such must directly interrogate the theoretical nature of the judicial function, and the judicial function in the context of the Constitution of Kenya. This article will seek to define the extent to which the judicial arm may <b>intervene</b> in the <b>conduct</b> of affairs of other arms of government. The subject is divided into three substantive parts.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the extent to which hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) exists unsuspected and undetected in the general population. BACKGROUNDHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease with diverse natural history for which the potential to produce adverse consequences has been emphasized. However, the possibility of this disease remaining clinically dormant for many years has not been as widely appreciated. Certainly, the clinical recognition of previously undiagnosed patients with HCM may be advantageous by permitting risk stratification for sudden cardiac death or for timely pharmacologic therapy when symptoms <b>intervene.</b> METHODSWe prospectively <b>conducted</b> an echocardiographic survey in 64 primarily rural communities within Minnesota (populations < 10, 000) over a 33 -month period. RESULTSA total of 15, 137 echocardiograms were performed at the request of primary care physicians for the purpose of excluding cardiovascular abnormalities. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was identified in 44 patients during the survey (0. 29 %), and 29 of these patients (0. 19 % of the 15, 137 echocardiograms) had not been previously identified as having cardiac disease or HCM. At diagnosis, ages were 16 to 87 years (mean 57); 14 patients were ≥ 60 years of age, and only two were < 30 years. Twenty-four patients (83 %) had either no or only mild or transient symptoms; 5 (17 %) evidenced severe functional limitation; in eight patients the onset of symptoms had been deferred until ≥ 70 years of age. Basal left ventricular outflow obstruction (gradients 20 to 82 mm Hg) was evident in 11 patients (38 %). Relatively mild phenotypic expression of the disease was substantiated by localized patterns of left ventricular wall thickening occurring more commonly than diffusely distributed hypertrophy (48 % vs. 7 %, respectively), and electrocardiograms that were frequently normal (about 25 %) and rarely showed evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (10 %). CONCLUSIONSThese prospectively assembled data show that HCM may remain clinically dormant and undetected within community-based rural populations for many years (often to advanced ages) with a not inconsequential prevalence similar to that of HCM in the general population...|$|R
40|$|In April 2015 the government’s pension freedoms {{came into}} effect, {{removing}} {{the requirement for}} pensioners to turn their pension pot into an annuity in order to retain the tax benefits. Later last year they announced plans to extend these freedoms to pensioners who had already bought annuities from April 2017, by creating a secondary market and allowing pensioners to sell their annuities on it. The government’s expressed aims were to “achieve parity between those {{who are able to}} access their pension savings flexibly… and those with existing annuities” by developing a secondary annuity market that “best suits the interests of pensioners” (HM Treasury, 2015 b). Creating a secondary annuities market that works well will be a difficult task. It is an unusual and complex market, with ‘consumers’ as the sellers, firms as the buyers, prices that are individual to each pensioner, legal complexities with the original annuity provider having to agree to any sale, and the product being {{one of the most important}} we ever purchase – an income for life. There is huge potential for it to go very wrong, with the details of government policy and regulatory action likely to play a big role in whether or not the market works for pensioners. To inform the debate, and help the government and regulator decide how best to <b>intervene,</b> we have <b>conducted</b> a study of the secondary annuity market: how one might function, what problems are likely to require addressing, and which policies appear most promising in doing so. A secondary annuity market must function on two axes if it is to deliver good outcomes for pensioners:  Competition must be effective in driving value-for-money  Pensioners must be adequately protected from harm. Neither of these axes is as simple as they may seem. The role and potential advantages of the original annuity provider in the secondary market may present a barrier to the emergence of competition, and the behaviour of pensioners and information difficulties may render it ineffective. Preventing harm to pensioners involves not just regulation to protect the most vulnerable, but also stopping ordinary people from making significant mistakes. Our analysis suggests there are fundamental problems that need addressing, which the government and regulators have underestimated when designing their proposals, including a real risk that there will be no functioning market at all when the laws come into force next year. Normally a study such as this would analyse how the market is currently working and look for evidence of market failure, however this market does not yet exist. Instead we have focused on how the market might develop and the potential impacts policies may have on our two axes – effective competition and consumer protection – both of which there is considerable uncertainty about. We therefore caution against overconfidence in any particular option, and strongly recommend that the government and regulator review the market carefully once it has launched and reconsider what intervention is necessary and beneficial in light of that evidence...|$|R
40|$|Systems thinking. Systems theory. The systems approach. All these {{concepts}} have in various guises been claimed {{as central to}} logistics management, since its dawning in the mid twentieth century. Such claims are {{the starting point of}} this dissertation, the purpose of which is to contribute to an increased understanding of systems thinking in logistics management research, both present and for future advances. The primary unit of analysis in this dissertation is thus logistics management research. The purpose is pursued through a strategy of triangulation of research approaches, via two research objectives: To describe the nature of systems thinking in logistics management research. To explore the merits for logistics management research of an interpretive approach to actors’ systems thinking. The term systems thinking in this dissertation denotes any somewhat ‘organised’ bodies of thought with aspirations to be ‘holistic’ in the sense of aiming for comprehensiveness. This part relates mostly to the systems part of the term. With regard to the other part, systems thinking is also regarded as a term that encompasses thinking about, and in terms of, systems; either that of researchers or that of actors in logistics practices. Systems thinking can sometimes be theorised on {{in such a way that}} it seems fair to label it as systems theory. Another term that is also frequently employed is systems approach. This denotes any approach to <b>intervene</b> in and/or <b>conduct</b> research on enterprises, with a holistic ambition. Such approaches can or cannot be informed by systems theory. By approach is meant the fundamental assumptions of the effort, such as ontological and epistemological positions, views on human nature, and methodologies. This dissertation employs an approach informed by a strand of systems theory labelled Critical Systems Thinking (CST). This builds on a pluralist strategy, which entails an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of all types of systems approaches, and thus strives towards putting them to work under such circumstances in which they are best suited. The first objective is pursued by means of a combined inductive-deductive approach presented mainly through two peer-reviewed, published journal articles. The first is an extensive literature review of academic publications in logistics management; the second is a survey of logistics management academics. Results show that the systems thinking within the discipline most often is not informed by systems theory, and is oriented towards a narrow section of the available systems approaches. This is an approach that builds on an objective world-view (realist ontology), and which seeks knowledge in terms of different kinds of law-like regularities. There are variations to the kinds of knowledge that are sought, in the sense that some search for deeper, underlying generative mechanisms (structuralist epistemology), some seek causal relationships among observable phenomena (positivist epistemology). The common view on human nature is determinist, and methodologies are often quantitative. It is concluded that logistics management employs a functionalist systems approach, which implicitly assumes homogeneity in actors’ systems thinking in mutual contexts (i. e. shared logistics practices). The second objective is pursued by adopting an interpretive systems approach, thus embracing a nominalist ontology and interpretivist epistemology, in order to explore what benefits such a perspective can lend to logistics management. Informed by the pluralist commitment of CST, theoretical constructs and methods grounded in cognitive psychology are employed to study logistics management practitioners’ systems thinking through cognitive mapping. If this reveals heterogeneities in systems thinking among actors of a mutual context, in which a high degree of homogeneity can be expected, the rationale is that the dominant homogeneity assumption is insufficient. The study, presented through an unpublished working paper, concludes that actors’ systems thinking can differ in ways that render the assumptions of the functionalist systems approach inadequate. More thought, debate, and research on an interpretive systems approach within logistics management is called for. With constant expansions in the scope of ambition for logistics management in mind – towards larger enterprise systems in the spirit of supply chain management, towards more goals for enterprises than the traditional financial ones, and towards new application areas (e. g. healthcare) – it is recognised that more and more actors become stakeholders in the practices that logistics management research seeks to incorporate within its domain of normative ambitions. This leads to an expanding scope of voices that ought to be heard in order to legitimise efforts to improve logistics management practices. This in turn motivates that we should seek to accommodate not only interpretive systems approaches, but also emancipatory, in order to ensure normative prescriptions that are legitimate from the perspectives of as many stakeholders as possible, not only from the common a priori efficiency perspectives of functionalist logistics management research...|$|R
40|$|A presente tese tem como objeto a formulação de limites jurídicos à instituição de incentivos fiscais ambientais. Partindo da constatação de que a crise {{ambiental}} ora em voga requer que sejam adotados diversos instrumentos para conter a poluição e inibir a escassez dos ativos ambientais, geradas pelo atual padrão de produção e consumo, envereda-se pela análise da tutela constitucional da questão ambiental. Examina-se, com destaque, a parte final do comando contido no art. 170, VI, da Lei Maior, cuja norma (inserida no rol dos princípios da ordem econômica) estabelece um tratamento diferenciado de produtos e serviços, bem como dos seus processos de produção, de acordo com o critério de proteção ambiental. Ademais, é conferida ênfase ao conteúdo plasmado no art. 225 da CF/ 88, segundo o qual a preservação e a defesa do meio ambiente consubstanciam um dever do Poder Público e da Sociedade, sendo o meio ambiente ecologicamente equilibrado um direito das presentes e futuras gerações. Diante dos robustos comandos que ressaltam o dever de todos de promover, no país, um desenvolvimento sustentável, investigam-se as formas de atuação do Estado na economia e os fundamentos que embasam intervenções de tal ente sobre as condutas dos particulares, com vistas a induzir comportamentos ambientalmente orientados. Nesta trilha e {{considerando que}} nos Estados atuais a tributação consubstancia a sua maior fonte de receita, envolvendo, portanto, considerável parcela da riqueza da nação, analisa-se o alcance da tributação extrafiscal no que concerne à concessão de incentivos fiscais para o fomento de atividades que impactem positivamente o meio ambiente. Por ser o Brasil um Estado Democrático e Social de Direito, regido por uma Carta Política que alberga inúmeros interesses, bens e princípios conflitantes, a investigação das fronteiras para a instituição dos estímulos tributários em comento é pautada pela análise ponderada dos mais diversos desígnios constitucionais. Busca-se identificar, à luz do ordenamento jurídico brasileiro, balizas que irão permitir que a lei tributária instituidora do incentivo fiscal ecológico consubstancie instrumento hábil a induzir condutas ambientalmente orientadas, sem restringir desproporcionalmente outros fins, princípios e valores constitucionais, a exemplo da igualdade e da livre concorrência. Neste compasso, pretende-se demonstrar que a criação do instituto em tela, realizada com base nos parâmetros ora sistematizados, constitui significativo instrumento voltado à construção de uma economia baseada nos pilares da sustentabilidade. Assim, espera-se, em última análise, contribuir para que os entes tributantes veiculem, com maior segurança e propriedade, estímulos fiscais de viés ambiental, disseminando-se diplomas legais que efetivamente concretizam a defesa do meio ambiente. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to define legal boundaries {{in order to establish}} environmental fiscal incentives. It required an analysis of the matter concerning environment constitutional management, {{due to the fact that}} the existing environment crisis demands the implementation of several tools to restraint pollution and inhibit the shortage of environment assets caused by current production and consumption standards. It is pointed out the final item of the command contained in the Art. # 170 of the Federal Constitution, whose norm included within the roll of the Economical Order principles directs towards differentiate handling of products and services, besides their related production processes in line with environment protection criteria. Also, the Art. # 225 of the 1988 Federal Constitution - included under the Title concerning Social Order - emphasizes the fact that both Government and Society are accountable for the preservation and defense of the environment and that an ecologically balanced environment is the right to present and future generations. Considering the stressed commands that refer to the general responsibility to support sustainable development in the country, this thesis assesses the way the State acts in the economy and the basis for <b>intervening</b> in the <b>conduct</b> of private citizens, aiming at promoting environment-oriented behavior. Following this line of thought and taking into account that taxes represent the States major source of income, thus absorbing large part of the country wealth, it is analyzed the extra-fiscal taxation range related to the concession of fiscal incentives to promote activities involving positive impact on the environment. Therefore, since Brazil is a Democratic and Social of Right State, ruled by a political Federal Constitution that comprehends several conflicting interests, goods and principles, the investigation of the boundaries to implement the fiscal incentives, in which this thesis is focused, is based upon thorough analysis of a great variety of constitutional directives. Its target is to identify, under the Brazilian judicial point of view, the foundations to allow that the fiscal law to support the ecological fiscal incentive substantiates an appropriate instrument to encourage environment-oriented actions, without restraining other constitutional objects, principles and values disproportionately, as equality and free competition principles, among others. As a consequence, based on the analyzed parameters, this thesis intends to demonstrate that the establishment of the institute therein proposed represents relevant tool to construct an economy founded on sustainability. Therefore, the expectation is that, at least, this work might contribute to the tax offices to promote more solid and accurate environmental fiscal incentives, and issue legal norms in order to consolidate the environment defense efficiently...|$|R
