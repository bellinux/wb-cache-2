Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, <b>fatty</b> <b>substance</b> found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
2500|$|Glial cells (named {{from the}} Greek for [...] "glue") are non-neuronal cells that provide support and nutrition, {{maintain}} homeostasis, form myelin, {{and participate in}} signal transmission in the nervous system. In the human brain, {{it is estimated that}} the total number of glia roughly equals the number of neurons, although the proportions vary in different brain areas. [...] Among the most important functions of glial cells are to support neurons and hold them in place; to supply nutrients to neurons; to insulate neurons electrically; to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons; and to provide guidance cues directing the axons of neurons to their targets. [...] A very important type of glial cell (oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system) generates layers of a <b>fatty</b> <b>substance</b> called myelin that wraps around axons and provides electrical insulation which allows them to transmit action potentials much more rapidly and efficiently. Recent findings indicate that glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, serve as important resident immune cells within the central nervous system.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{chemical}} parameters {{has been proposed}} and sometimes adopted as time passes, {{with the aim of}} assess identity and quality of <b>fatty</b> <b>substances.</b> In this paper, the advancement of knowledges about <b>fatty</b> <b>substances</b> composition is stressed as highlighted by analytical instrumentation developments. Furthermore, a number of acquisition are rewieved, as they become available by hyphenation of analytical instrumentation, as LC-GC, LC-LC and LC-LC-GC. New trends in analytical evaluation of olive oils deal with application of NMR as well as Raman spectroscopy and Near Infrared Reflectance analysis. The main problem of <b>fatty</b> <b>substances</b> is oxidation: a number of recent knowledges are reported, dealing with products of oxidation of sterols, catalysed by heat and light, photo oxidation products and thermo oxidation products of sterols have been studied and identified. This lead to explain the possibility of newly formed sterenes in refined oils: their structure characterised by one more double bond in the rings is in good agreement with the dehydration of oxysterols. The antioxidative properties of a number of natural substances can be studied by means of stressed conditions, as realised in the Rancimat test or in the presence of free radicals at lower temperature, as realised in the crocine test.

As a result, the fatty substances accumulate to deadly levels in the brain and spinal cord. The buildup of GM2 ganglioside causes progressive damage to the nerve cells. This is the cause of the signs and symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5000|$|In 1844 Heller {{established}} a laboratory of pathological chemistry in Vienna's General Hospital, but his appointment {{as head of}} the lab was delayed until 1855 because some of the faculty thought that the position should be occupied by a medical doctor.

50|$|Mutations in the SMPD1 gene cause Niemann-Pick Types A and B. This gene carries {{instructions}} for cells {{to produce a}} lysosomal enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase. Insufficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase causes the buildup of toxic amounts of sphingomyelin, a <b>fatty</b> <b>substance</b> present in every cell of the body. This enzyme is found in special compartments within cells called lysosomes (compartments that digest and recycle materials in the cell), and is required to metabolize the lipid sphingomyelin. If sphingomyelinase is absent or not functioning properly, sphingomyelin cannot be metabolized properly and is accumulated within the cell, eventually causing cell death and the malfunction of major organ systems.|$|E

50|$|Hairstyling {{products}} {{have had a}} significant impact on the creation of various hairstyles and trends throughout history. For the ancient Egyptians, physical appearance was very important to the embalming process. Hair was often styled to maintain the individuality of the deceased. A <b>fatty</b> <b>substance,</b> now known as hair gel, was used to style hair and keep it in place. The ancient Gauls had invented a waxy soap-like substance, similar to hair wax, as a hair styling agent. Many years later, the same soap-like substance was used as a cleaning agent. In 1948, Chase Products became the first company to package hair spray. Hair spray became very popular in the 1950s due to its ability to keep hair in place and prevent hair from falling out of a styled look.|$|E
