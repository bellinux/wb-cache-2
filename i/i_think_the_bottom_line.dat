In the context of the Russell Group's reputation in the sector, he continued: [...] "particularly dangerous, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half of <b>the</b> Russell Group…The problem with the Russell Group is that it represents neither the sector as a whole nor, in many cases, the best of the sector.” Performance in research intensity showed that there were dozens of other UK universities “above <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> Russellers”.|$|R

How can I be but melted by emotion! I {{see that it is}} solely your nobleness of soul that renders you unhappy.

[...] "You know how much I have always, essentially and at heart, been attached to the King your Brother.

2500|$|Flea has {{displayed}} {{a wide variety}} of techniques throughout the years, ranging from his initial use of slapping and popping to the more traditional methods he has employed since Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Greg Prato of Allmusic has noted, that [...] "by combining funk-style bass with psychedelic, punk, and hard rock, Flea created an original playing style that has been copied numerous times". Flea stated in an interview, that he was influenced greatly by Louis Armstrong. Flea has been considered one of the greatest bassists of all time, with Greg Tate of Rolling Stone saying [...] "if there were a Most Valuable Bass Player award given out in rock, Flea could have laid claim to that bitch ten years running". Smashing Pumpkins front man Billy Corgan recalls, that when he first saw the Chili Peppers in 1984, [...] "Flea was playing so aggressively that he had worn a hole in his thumb and he was literally screaming in pain in-between songs because it hurt so bad. Someone kept coming out and pouring crazy glue into the hole." [...] Flea's sound is also determined by what type of instrument he plays. Before Californication, he did not believe the actual bass held much significance: [...] "what mattered was how you hit them [...] and your emotional intent, and <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> that's <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> line." [...] Flea owns a 1961 Fender Jazz Bass, treasuring it for its [...] "old wood sound".|$|R
