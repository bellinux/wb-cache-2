In its superseding report, the NTSB {{determined that the}} probable cause of the accident was the sudden opening of the cargo door, which was attributed to improper wiring and deficiencies in the door's design. It appeared {{in this case that}} a short circuit caused an uncommanded rotation of the latch cams, which forced the weak locking sectors to distort and allow the rotation, thus enabling the pressure differential and aerodynamic forces to blow the door off the fuselage, ripping away the <b>hinge</b> <b>fixing</b> structure, the cabin floor and side fuselage skin, causing the explosive decompression.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cars have {{various types}} of doors. The {{swinging}} doors which {{are the most common}} are almost the most complicated parts in a car since they not only determine the general guidelines of car style, but also are vital for passenger's safety by protecting humans from side crashes. Comparison between FEA results and targets led to the necessity to split lower opening of front door into two parts to increase stiffness. Also, thickness of window regulator engine fixing in both front and rear doors are increased. Predetermined values from previous works conducted on a similar existing SUV vehicle were used as targets to be achieved by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of car doors.

Through the simulation of combined spiral movement, the workspace of the flexible cable-driven parallel mechanism is larger than that of the mechanism with <b>fixed</b> <b>hinge</b> and reduce the interferece of long and big track.

40|$|Kinematic pile-soil {{interaction}} is investigated analytically through a Beam-on-Dynamic-Winkler-Foundation model. A cylindrical vertical pile in a homogeneous stratum, excited by vertically-propagating harmonic shear waves, is {{examined in the}} realm of linear viscoelastic material behaviour. New closed-form solutions for bending, as well as displacements and rotations atop the pile, are derived for different boundary conditions at the head (free, fixed) and tip (free, <b>hinged,</b> <b>fixed).</b> Contrary to classical elastodynamic theory where pile response is governed by six dimensionless ratios, {{in the realm of}} Winkler analysis three dimensionless parameters suffice for describing pile-soil interaction: (1) a mechanical slenderness accounting for geometry and pile-soil stiffness contrast, (2) a dimensionless frequency (which is different from the classical elastodynamic parameter a 0 =ωd/Vs), (3) soil material damping. With reference to kinematic pile bending, insight into the physics of the problem is gained through a rigorous superposition scheme involving an infinitely-long pile excited kinematically, and a pile of finite length excited by a concentrated force and a moment at the tip. It is shown that for long piles kinematic response is governed by a single dimensionless frequency parameter, leading to a single master curve pertaining to all pile lengths and pile-soil stiffness ratios...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the concentrations of cobalt, chromium, and molybdenum in the serum of paediatric tumour patients after <b>fixed</b> <b>hinge</b> total knee arthroplasty. Further, these metal ion levels were compared with serum metal ion levels of patients with other orthopaedic devices such as hip and knee prostheses with metal-on-metal or metal-on-polyethylene articulation to find differences between anatomical locations, abrasion characteristics, and bearing surfaces. After an average follow-up of 108 months (range: 67 to 163) of 11 paediatric patients with <b>fixed</b> <b>hinge</b> total knee arthroplasty, the mean concentrations for Co and Cr were significantly increased while Mo was within the limits compared to the upper values from the reference laboratory. Furthermore, these serum concentrations were significantly higher compared to patients with a standard rotating hinge device (P= 0. 002 and P< 0. 001) and preoperative controls (P< 0. 001). On the other hand, the serum levels of patients following MoM THA or rotating hinge arthroplasty using megaprostheses were higher. Therefore, periodic long-term follow-ups are recommended due to the rising concerns about systemic metal ion exposure in the literature.

40|$|Abstract: A {{plastic hinge}} {{is a type}} of energy {{dampening}} device allowing plastic rotation of an otherwise rigid column connection. This device is composed of a weakened portion of the column prevented from rotating by relatively small steel members. These small bars are designed to yield and allow rotation before the capacity of the column is reached, thus acting as mechanical fuses protecting the column from fatigue. After a seismic event the fuse bars can be easily replaced, restoring the column to its original condition. To function properly the hinge must become plastic before the column above it yields, but limiting the deflection {{at the top of the}} column is also desirable for the stability of the overlying structure, necessitating a hinge with some degree of strength. The experimental setup of this study was constructed in the University at Buffalo’s Structural Engineering and Earthquake Simulation Laboratory in 2004 and was comprised of a steel column subjected to lateral displacement at the top with a plastic <b>hinge</b> <b>fixed</b> at the base, simulating earthquake-induced ground motion on a bridge column. The purpose of this research was to develop an accurate model of the column-hinge system in the elastic range of the fuse bars, allowing consideration of the above design criteria for later testing. Plastic behavior of the fuse bars was not tested. Experimental data was generated using a quasi-static cyclic loading pattern. The behavior of the system was shown to be in agreement with the analytical model...|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} in the maximum normalized vertical displacement between the <b>hinged</b> and <b>fixed</b> end restraint cases {{was found to be}} quite small (less than 0.2  %) due to the low modulus of elasticity for PVC pipes. For the studied cases, the maximum normalized pipe displacement was found to be about 6  %, corresponding to the relative increase in volumetric water content, about 20  % (approximately corresponds to the change from the field condition to full saturation). The maximum pipe displacements were approximately 2.1, 3.7, and 5.3  %, with a relative increase in volumetric water content of 5, 10, and 15  % in the active zone, respectively.|$|R
