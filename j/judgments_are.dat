5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E
5000|$|Vacated Judgment: a {{judgment}} of an appellate court whereby the <b>judgment</b> under review <b>is</b> set aside {{and a new}} trial is ordered. A vacated <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> rendered where the original judgment failed to make an order {{in accordance with the}} law and a new trial is ordered to ensure a just outcome. The process of vacating a <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> sometimes referred to as vacatur. The result of a vacated <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> a trial de novo.|$|R
50|$|The state {{respondents}} initially {{failed to}} defend the application. Default <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> therefore issued in the applicants' favour in March 2014. The default <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> rescinded with the parties’ consent on 19 March 2014.|$|R

25|$|Judgments of {{learning}} (JOLs) or metamemory <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> made when knowledge is acquired. Metamnemonic <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> based on different sources of information, and target information {{is important for}} JOLs. Intrinsic cues (based on the target information) and mnemonic cues (based on previous JOL performance) are especially important for JOLs. Judgment {{of learning}} {{can be divided into}} four categories: ease-of-learning judgments, paired-associate JOLs, ease-of-recognition judgments, and free-recall JOLs.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophers}} Randall Dipert and Roderick Long {{have argued}} that Objectivist epistemology conflates the perceptual process by which <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> formed with {{the way in which}} they are to be justified, thereby leaving it unclear how sensory data can validate propositionally structured judgments.|$|E
25|$|To {{solve the}} problem of libel tourism, the SPEECH Act makes foreign libel {{judgments}} unenforceable in U.S. courts, unless those <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> compliant with the U.S. First Amendment. The act was passed by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} precision of the pCI rule through three experiments. The results show that first, the tendency of the subjects’ casual <b>judgments</b> <b>was</b> basically similar to the pCI rule. But (a + d) / n predicted human’s casual <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> even better; second, the increase of subjects’ casual <b>judgments</b> <b>was</b> milder than the pCI rule, and the subjects needed time to construct their own way of judging relationship; finally, different people had different ways of causal <b>judgments,</b> and could <b>be</b> grouped into some categories...|$|R

25|$|Since the 1970s, the European Court of Human Rights has {{condemned}} Turkey for {{the thousands}} of human rights abuses against Kurdish people. The <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> related to systematic executions of Kurdish civilians, forced recruitments, torturing, forced displacements, thousands of destroyed villages, arbitrary arrests, murdered and disappeared Kurdish journalists.|$|E
25|$|Judgments of {{numerical}} {{differences are}} anchored on left-most digits, a behavioral phenomenon {{referred to as}} the left-digit anchoring effect. This hypothesis suggests that people perceive the difference between 1.99 and 3.00 to be closer to 2.01 than to 1.01 because their <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> anchored on the left-most digit.|$|E
25|$|An individual's FOK <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> not {{necessarily}} accurate, and attributes {{of all three}} metamemory hypotheses are apparent in {{the factors that influence}} FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more likely to give a higher FOK rating, indicating that they do know the answer, when presented with questions they feel they should know the answer to. This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as the familiarity of the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis.|$|E

5000|$|Interlocutory judgment: an {{interlocutory}} <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> rendered {{when the}} court has enough information to make a decision. [...] An interlocutory <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> considered to <b>be</b> a final <b>judgment</b> and not subject to appeal unless the court deems further consideration necessary.|$|R
5000|$|On March 28, 2008 the {{defendants}} won a legal victory when their motion for partial summary <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> granted, and the plaintiffs' motion for summary <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> denied.

25|$|<b>Judgments</b> <b>are,</b> for Kant, the {{preconditions}} of any thought. Man thinks via judgments, so {{all possible}} judgments must be listed and the perceptions connected within them put aside, {{so as to}} make it possible to examine the moments when the understanding is engaged in constructing judgments. For the categories are equivalent to these moments, in that they are concepts of intuitions in general, so far as they are determined by these moments universally and necessarily. Thus by listing all the moments, one can deduce from them all of the categories.|$|E
25|$|Divine {{pronouncement}} {{of three}} <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> then laid against all culprits (3:14–19). A judgement oracle {{and the nature}} of the crime is first laid upon the serpent, then the woman, and finally Adam. After the serpent is cursed by Yahweh, the woman receives a penalty that impacts two primary roles: childbearing and her subservient relationship to her husband. Adam's penalty thus follows. The reaction of Adam, the naming of Eve, and Yahweh making skin garments are described in a concise narrative (3:20-21). The garden account ends with an intradivine monologue, determining the couple's expulsion, and the execution of that deliberation (3:22–24).|$|E
25|$|One may now ask: How many {{possible}} <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> there? Kant believed {{that all the}} possible propositions within Aristotle's syllogistic logic are equivalent to all possible judgments, and that all the logical operators within the propositions are equivalent to the moments of the understanding within judgments. Thus he listed Aristotle's system in four groups of three: quantity (universal, particular, singular), quality (affirmative, negative, infinite), relation (categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive) and modality (problematic, assertoric, apodeictic). The parallelism with Kant's categories is obvious: quantity (unity, plurality, totality), quality (reality, negation, limitation), relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity).|$|E

50|$|Under full {{faith and}} credit, the local {{law of the}} state of {{rendition}} will be applied to determine whether the <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> modifiable and, if so, in what respects. This law will determine whether the <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> modifiable with respect to past due installments and with respect to future installments. As between states, full faith and credit requires application of the local law {{of the state of}} rendition to determine whether the <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> modifiable and, if so, in what respects.|$|R

25|$|Paired-Associate Judgment of Learning: These <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> made at {{the time}} of study on cue-target pairs and are {{responsible}} for predicting later memory performance (on cued recall or cued recognition). One example of paired-associate JOLs is the cue-target JOL, where the subject determines the retrievability of the target when both the cue and target of the to-be-learned pair are presented. Another example is the cue-only JOL, where the subject must determine the retrievability of the target when only the cue is presented {{at the time of}} judgment. These two types of JOLs differ in their accuracy in predicting future performance, and delayed judgments tend to be more accurate.|$|E
25|$|In Mills v. Duryee, , the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the merits of a case, as settled by courts of one state, must be {{recognized}} by the courts of other states; state courts may not reopen cases which have been conclusively decided by the courts of another state. Later, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested that the judgment of one state court must be recognized by other states' courts as final. However, in McElmoyle v. Cohen, , the court heard a case where one party obtained a judgment in South Carolina and sought to enforce it in Georgia, which had a statute of limitations that barred actions on judgments after {{a certain amount of}} time had passed since the judgment was entered. The court upheld Georgia's refusal to enforce the South Carolina judgment. The court found that out-of-state <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> subject to the procedural law of the states where they are enforced, notwithstanding any priority accorded in the states in which they are issued.|$|E
25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E

500|$|Feminist economists {{depart from}} {{traditional}} economics {{in that they}} say [...] "ethical <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> a valid, inescapable, and in fact desirable part of economic analysis." [...] For example, Lourdes Beneria argues that judgments about policies leading to greater well-being should be central to economic analysis. Similarly, Shahra Razavi says better understanding of care work [...] "would allow us to shift our priorities from 'making money' or 'making stuff' to 'making livable lives' and 'enriching networks of care and relationship'" [...] which should be central to economics.|$|E
500|$|Moralistic {{judgments}} implying wrongness or badness on {{the part}} of people who don't act in harmony with our values. Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons, and diagnoses are all said to be forms of judgment. (Moralistic <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> {{not to be confused with}} value judgments as to the qualities we value.) The use of moralistic judgments is characterized as an impersonal way of expressing oneself that does not require one to reveal what is going on inside of oneself. This way of speaking is said to have the result that [...] "Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others need and are not getting." ...|$|E
500|$|Croatia has a three-tiered, {{independent}} {{judicial system}} {{governed by the}} constitution and national legislation enacted by the Sabor. The Supreme Court (...) is the highest court of appeal in Croatia; its hearings are open and <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> made publicly, except {{in cases where the}} privacy of the accused is to be protected. Judges are appointed by the National Judicial Council and judicial office is permanent until seventy years of age. The president of the Supreme Court is elected for a four-year term by the Croatian Parliament at the proposal of the President of the Republic. As of 2011, the president of the Supreme Court is Branko Hrvatin. The Supreme Court has civil and criminal departments. The lower two levels of the three-tiered judiciary consist of county courts and municipal courts. There are fifteen county courts and sixty-seven municipal courts in the country.|$|E
