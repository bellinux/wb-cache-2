40|$|Purpose: Stress is a {{significant}} concern for individuals and organisations. Few studies have explored stress, burnout and patient safety in hospital nursing {{on a daily basis}} at the individual level. This study aimed {{to examine the effects of}} chronic stress and daily <b>hassles</b> on safety perceptions, the effect of chronic stress on daily <b>hassles</b> experienced and chronic stress as a potential moderator. Method: Utilising a daily diary design, 83 UK hospital nurses completed three end-of-shift diaries, yielding 324 person days. <b>Hassles,</b> safety perceptions and workplace cognitive failure were measured daily, and a baseline questionnaire included a measure of chronic stress. Hierarchical multivariate linear modelling was used to analyse the data. Results: Higher chronic stress was associated with more daily <b>hassles,</b> poorer perceptions of safety and being less able to practise safely, but not more workplace cognitive failure. Reporting more daily <b>hassles</b> was associated with poorer perceptions of safety, being less able to practise safely and more workplace cognitive failure. Chronic stress did not moderate daily associations. The <b>hassles</b> reported illustrate the wide-ranging <b>hassles</b> nurses experienced. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate, in addition to chronic stress, the importance of daily <b>hassles</b> for nurses’ perceptions of safety and the <b>hassles</b> experienced by hospital nurses on a daily basis. Nurses perceive chronic stress and daily <b>hassles</b> to contribute to their perceptions of safety. Measuring the number of daily <b>hassles</b> experienced could proactively highlight when patient safety threats may arise, and as a result, interventions could usefully focus on the management of daily <b>hassles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{widely held}} {{assumption}} within {{the general public}} is that {{one way in which}} people cope with their daily <b>hassles</b> is by drinking alcohol. Although the idea of drinking to compensate for daily <b>hassles</b> is intuit, empirical evidence is actually rather scarce. This study aimed to test whether structure of everyday life results in more daily <b>hassles</b> and has a protective effect regarding alcohol consumption (as predicted by classic role theory) or – in case the relation between daily <b>hassles</b> and alcohol consumption is positive (as predicted by tension reduction theories) – daily <b>hassles</b> would decrease the protective effect of having a more structured everyday life. Methods A general population panel study (N [*]=[*] 2, 440; 47 % women; age: M[*]=[*] 52 years, SD[*]=[*] 17), measuring structure of everyday life and daily <b>hassles</b> (T 1; 90 % response rate) as well as alcohol consumption (T 2; 85 % response rate). Results In line with classic role theory – structure of everyday life was positively associated with daily <b>hassles</b> and had a negative effect on alcohol consumption. Daily <b>hassles</b> was not associated with alcohol consumption.

40|$|Using daily {{telephone}} interviews of a U.

Four separate hypotheses are examined. The first explores the association between chronic stressors and daily <b>hassles.</b> The second tests whether daily <b>hassles</b> function as an intervening variable between chronic stressors and psychological distress. The third tests whether a chronic stressor moderates the relationship between daily <b>hassles</b> and psycho-logical distress. The fourth hypothesis tests for cross-domain effects of chronic stressors and daily <b>hassles.</b> Findings indicate that chronic stressors and daily <b>hassles</b> are distinct types of stressors with unique contributions to psychologi-cal distress. The study provides support for chronic home stressors functioning as a moderating factor {{on the relationship between}} daily <b>hassles</b> and psycho-logical distress both within and across domains. 17 The study examines the unique and interac-tive effects of role-related chronic stressors and daily <b>hassles</b> in the domains of work and family on psychological distress. For these purposes, the use of a two-stage longitudinal data collection made it possible to measure chronic work and family role-related stressors separate from, and prior to, subsequent report-ing of daily <b>hassles</b> in the areas of work and family. More specifically, the study explores the relationship between chronic role-related stressors and role-related daily <b>hassles</b> from three different perspectives derived from theo-ries of the stress process.

In explaining beginning teachers’ stress, previous research mainly focused on either trait-like personality characteristics or general work-related stressors. In contrast, the present study focused on the day-to-day experience. The aim of the current study was (a) to identify the task-related daily uplifts and <b>hassles</b> of beginning teachers, (b) to examine the association of daily uplifts and <b>hassles</b> with teachers’ socio-demographic and personality characteristics, and (c) to investigate the effect of daily uplifts and <b>hassles</b> on teachers’ emotional exhaustion. The sample consisted of 141 beginning teachers up to four years in the profession who completed an online diary for 14 consecutive days. Results showed that most daily uplifts and <b>hassles</b> were related to teaching in class and interacting with colleagues. Both <b>hassles</b> and uplifts showed only a few unsystematic correlations with teachers’ characteristics. However, daily uplifts and <b>hassles</b> significantly explained beginning teachers’ daily emotional exhaustion...|$|R

40|$|U. S. {{working mothers}} {{experience}} frequent daily <b>hassles,</b> yet {{little is known}} about how working mothers have disproportionate abilities to handle stress. The purpose of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine the}} extent to which coping self-efficacy mediated the effect that cumulative daily <b>hassles</b> had on working mothers 2 ̆ 7 health outcomes (i. e., physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). The transactional model of stress and coping, social cognitive theory, and self-efficacy theory provided the theoretical foundations for this study. Daily <b>hassles</b> were used for this study as an additional theoretical approach for measuring stress. A total of 235 working mothers completed the Daily <b>Hassles</b> Scale, Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, and Short Form 36 version 2 (SF- 36 v 2 ï£¨) on a secure online website. The respondents reported moderate confidence in their abilities to cope with life despite experiencing an average of 44 daily <b>hassles</b> per month. Simple regressions confirmed repeated exposure to daily <b>hassles</b> was significantly associated with reduced coping self-efficacy and health outcomes. Mediation with multiple regression analysis revealed that coping self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between cumulative daily <b>hassles</b> and health outcomes, suggesting coping self-efficacy was a protective psychosocial factor for working mothers. This study contributes to positive social change by aiding practitioners in identifying protective psychosocial factors and helping working mothers to implement the findings with the intention of reducing daily <b>hassles</b> and improving health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The study {{attempted}} {{to explore the}} relationships among recreation <b>hassles,</b> coping, and hiker satisfaction and to examine the moderating role of coping {{in the relationship between}} <b>hassles</b> and satisfaction. Questionnaire surveys were conducted on trails in Yangmingshan National Park in Taiwan in spring 2011. Overall, 316 questionnaires were completed, of which 301 were valid. The results indicated that recreation <b>hassles</b> correlated positively with all coping strategies. Further analysis indicated that the coping behaviors of rationalization significantly moderated the relationship between recreation <b>hassles</b> and hiker satisfaction. The study suggested that an increase in the perceived <b>hassles</b> decreases the satisfaction of hikers. It also indicated that the engagement of the coping strategy of rationalization was likely to decrease the negative effects of <b>hassles</b> on hiker satisfaction. Although {{a number of studies have}} discussed a similar argument, relevant empirical works were insufficient. This study clearly confirmed the moderating effect of emotion-focused coping on the relationship between recreation <b>hassles</b> and hiker satisfaction.

The theoretical underpinning for this quantitative, descriptive study was the cognitive appraisal theory (CAT), but the concept of stress and the effects stress has on the body was the broad framework that connected all the variables. The CAT was used to develop the central research question designed to investigate if there was a difference in the <b>hassles</b> total, frequency, and severity between the 2 research groups. There were 54 persons without type 2 diabetes (59. 3 %) and 37 with type 2 diabetes (40. 7 %). The <b>hassles</b> portion of the Combined <b>Hassles</b> and Uplifts Scale was used for data collection and interpretation. A t test for independent means was used to determine the differences in <b>hassles</b> between the 2 groups. Data analysis indicated that those with a self-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes reported more total <b>hassles</b> (p. 005), frequency of <b>hassles</b> (p. 003), and severity of <b>hassles</b> (p. 006) than those without a self-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The study will contribute to positive social change by facilitating creation of opportunities by healthcare providers, to develop client-specific, culturally-sensitive programs and best practice interventions that underscore daily <b>hassles</b> that affect the lived experiences of persons with type 2 diabetes.

25|$|The Palais-Royal in Paris, {{which opened}} to the public in 1784 and {{became one of the most}} {{important}} marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example in the grand shopping arcades. The Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewelry, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the <b>hassle</b> of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favorite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building. London's Burlington Arcade, which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue from the outset. Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's Çiçek Pasajı opened in 1870 and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II first opened in 1877. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall.|$|E

Undergraduate university students, 258 in total, in responding to a questionnaire, provided information regarding depressive symptomatology, daily <b>hassles,</b> and gender role orientation.

To examine emotion regulation in later life, we contrasted the modified hedonic treadmill theory with developmental theories, using <b>hassles</b> and uplifts to assess emotion regulation in context. The sample was 1, 315 men from the VA Normative Aging Study aged 53 to 85 years, who completed 3, 894 observations between 1989 and 2004. We computed three scores for both <b>hassles</b> and uplifts: intensity (ratings reflecting emotion regulation), exposure (count), and summary (total) scores. Computing growth curves over age showed marked differences in trajectory patterns for intensity and exposure scores. Although exposure to <b>hassles</b> and uplifts decreased in later life, intensity scores increased. Growth mixture models (GMM) showed individual differences in patterns of <b>hassles</b> and uplifts intensity and exposure, with relative stability in uplifts intensity, normative non-linear changes in <b>hassles</b> intensity, and complex patterns of individual differences in exposure for both <b>hassles</b> and uplifts. Analyses with the summary scores showed that emotion regulation in later life is a function of both developmental change and contextual exposure, with different patterns emerging for <b>hassles</b> and uplifts. Thus, support was found for both hedonic treadmill and development change theories, reflecting different aspects of change in emotion regulation with age...|$|R
