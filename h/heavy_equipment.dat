5|$|DST clock shifts {{sometimes}} complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{and sleep}} patterns. Computer software often adjusts clocks automatically, but policy changes by various jurisdictions of DST dates and timings may be confusing.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{applications}} include shipbuilding, pipelines, mining, offshore construction, aerospace, {{white goods}} (e.g. washing machines), <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> such as bulldozers, office furniture, steel wool, tools, and armour {{in the form}} of personal vests or vehicle armour (better known as rolled homogeneous armour in this role).|$|E
5|$|After {{their success}} {{in the first month}} of the war, mass {{production}} was ordered and the development of other models proceeded. The Katyusha was inexpensive and could be manufactured in light industrial installations which did not have the <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> to build conventional artillery gun barrels. By the end of 1942, 3,237 Katyusha launchers of all types had been built, {{and by the end of}} the war total production reached about 10,000.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 21 August, tanks of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had linked with Polish forces at Coudehard, and the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry {{divisions}} had secured St. Lambert and the northern passage to Chambois; the Falaise pocket had been sealed. Approximately 20–50,000 German troops, minus <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment,</b> escaped through the gap and were reorganized and rearmed, in time to slow the Allied advance into the Netherlands and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Changing the bogies on a {{rail car}} takes hours and special, <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment.</b> In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another {{in as little as}} 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.|$|E
5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment.</b> They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck. Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{equipment}} theft, is {{the criminal}} act of stealing or attempting to steal construction equipment, including all type of <b>heavy</b> <b>equipments.</b> Construction equipment theft {{has been recognized}} as a significant problem in the United States {{and elsewhere in the}} world, including Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>equipment's</b> primary {{function}} of wildfire suppression {{is through the}} application of <b>heavy</b> construction style <b>equipment</b> to move large amounts or earth or remove vegetation.

5|$|In rural areas, law {{enforcement}} that operates outside of incorporated cities {{may also have}} mounted units. These include specially deputised, paid or volunteer mounted search and rescue units sent into roadless areas on horseback to locate missing people. Law enforcement in protected areas may use horses in places where mechanised transport is difficult or prohibited. Horses can be {{an essential part of}} an overall team effort as they can move faster on the ground than a human on foot, can transport <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment,</b> and provide a more rested rescue worker when a subject is found.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} strike against the Trade Federation, Kael, Sykes, Ved, Lutin Hollis and Kol Kotha, a {{mercenary}} agent of Borvo's, destroy the communications satellite Comm 4. The satellite's destruction temporarily disables a Federation {{base on the}} planet, allowing the resistance to successfully attack it and destroy numerous droids and <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment.</b> During the fight, Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and uses it to liberate labor camps along the Andrevea River, escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north.|$|E
5000|$|The {{base was}} covered in rocks which were on average three meters high and about five meters wide, {{preventing}} the immediate evacuation {{of the dead and}} wounded, who were buried underneath 1,500 tons of rock and soil. Removing the rocks was only possible with <b>heavy</b> mechanical <b>equipment.</b> Initially, the <b>heavy</b> mechanical <b>equipment</b> arrived from the nearby Dead Sea Works potash plant, and later <b>heavy</b> mechanical <b>equipment</b> was also sent from the Combat Engineering Corps.|$|R

5|$|On 21 November, the {{commander}} of the 9th Division, Major General Leslie Morshead, was informed by General Harold Alexander, {{the commander}}-in-chief of the Middle East Command, that a decision had been made to return the division to Australia. Churchill told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned, the resultant diversion of shipping would reduce the size of the build-up of United States military forces in Britain and North Africa by 30,000 men. In the same cable, Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division's <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> would need to remain in the Middle East. On 3 December Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa. Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the US Army's 25th Infantry Division would be transferred to Australia during December. Following these messages the Australian Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment,</b> and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia.|$|E
5|$|On Crete, Kippenberger was {{promoted}} to temporary colonel and given command of the 10th Brigade, an ad-hoc formation, which included a 750-man composite battalion consisting mainly of artillery and Army Service Corps men (sans most of their <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> and trucks), New Zealand Divisional Cavalry, some machine gunners and two Greek regiments (although Kippenberger assessed the Greek units to be of limited use). His 20th Battalion was {{also part of the}} brigade but strict controls were in place around its deployment and use.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements {{arrived by}} glider around 04:00 (Mission Chicago and Mission Detroit), and 21:00 (Mission Keokuk and Mission Elmira), {{bringing}} additional troops and <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment.</b> Like the paratroopers, many landed {{far from their}} drop zones. Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty, with heavy cargo such as Jeeps shifting during landing, crashing through the wooden fuselage, {{and in some cases}} crushing personnel on board.|$|E

50|$|In 1840 {{the line}} was regauged to {{standard}} gauge and connected with the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway at Kilwinning station. The permanent way was largely relaid with <b>heavier</b> <b>equipment</b> to accommodate locomotive operation, and {{the line was}} doubled. In 1854 both lines merged with the new Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|R
5000|$|Gliders {{could carry}} and deliver much bulkier and <b>heavier</b> <b>equipment</b> (such as {{anti-tank}} guns, or vehicles such as jeeps or even light tanks) {{that could not}} be parachuted from the side-loading transport aircraft normally used in World War 2. Thus glider infantry units were usually better equipped than their parachute infantry counterparts.|$|R
5|$|Stella met Bruce Nickell in 1974. Nickell was a <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> {{operator}} with {{a drinking}} habit, which suited Stella's lifestyle, {{and the two}} were married in 1976. In {{the course of their}} ten-year marriage, Bruce Nickell entered rehab and gave up drinking. Reportedly, Stella resented this. Her bar visits were curtailed by Bruce's sobriety, and Stella cultivated a home aquarium as a new hobby.|$|E
5|$|Supplies and {{materials}} {{of all kinds}} poured in: 2,157 carloads of electrical equipment, 1,219 of <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment,</b> 5,389 of lumber, 1,407 of pipe and fittings, 1,188 of steel, 257 of valves, and 11 of welding electrodes. The racetracks required 85,000 vacuum tubes. Where possible, off-the-shelf components were used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique. Two purchasing departments were established, one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment, and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Young Adult Conservation Corps {{was also}} based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program {{employed}} up to 45young people for local conservation {{projects in the}} state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the industrial complex as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation began a <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> training school at Piper, which is still in operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{evacuation}} of British and French forces (Operation Dynamo) began on 26 May with air cover {{provided by the}} RAF at heavy cost. Over the following ten days, 338,226 French and British soldiers were evacuated to Britain. Most of the personnel were brought back to Britain, {{but many of the}} army's vehicles, tanks, guns, ammunition and <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> and the RAF's ground equipment and stores were left behind in France. Some soldiers even returned without their rifles. A further 215,000 were evacuated from ports south of the Channel in Operation Ariel during June.|$|E
5|$|Using forces {{delivered}} to Guadalcanal in this manner, the Japanese army tried {{three times to}} retake Henderson Field, but was defeated each time. After the third failure, {{an attempt by the}} IJN to deliver the rest of the IJA 38th Infantry Division and its <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment</b> failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal from 12–15 November. Because of this failure, the Japanese cancelled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.|$|E
5|$|As a teenager, {{he worked}} in the woods, shoed horses, and drove <b>heavy</b> <b>equipment.</b> He met Emile Dupré in 1957, who told him to {{consider}} a career in professional wrestling. Cormier began training, and later moved to Indianapolis, Indiana to continue his preparation under trainer Les Ruffen, and made his debut in 1963. At first, he used the ring name Pierre Lebelle before switching to Ivan the Lumberjack. In Texas, he was known as Joe Gump. When he later ventured to the Mid-Atlantic territory, Jim Crockett, Sr. named him The Beast. At that time, he had thick, untamed hair and a large, curly beard.|$|E
50|$|Before 1939, {{there were}} two Army Maintenance Workshops in Malaya, one was located at Belakang Mati {{and the other was}} located at Changi.
