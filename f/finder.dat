5|$|The {{earliest}} search radars installed {{were the}} SK air-search radar and SG surface-search radar during World War II. They were {{located on the}} mainmast and forward fire-control tower of the battleships, respectively. As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search radar and SG surface-search radar; the Iowa class was updated {{to make use of}} these systems between 1945 and 1952. At the same time, the ships' radar systems were augmented with the installation of the SP height <b>finder</b> on the main mast. In 1952, AN/SPS-10 surface-search radar and AN/SPS-6 air-search radar replaced the SK and SG radar systems, respectively. Two years later the SP height <b>finder</b> was replaced by the AN/SPS-8 height <b>finder,</b> which was installed on the main mast of the battleships.|$|E

5|$|<b>Finder</b> No. 3, Mark IV, for the Army, but the Army {{cancelled}} {{the order}} in August 1941 when the prototype was nearly complete. In January 1942, he was seconded to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney to develop secret valves for a Radio Direction <b>Finder.</b> He teamed up with Eric Burhop to build a magnetron, producing a working prototype on 23 May 1942. He {{then went on to}} build an original magnetron that generated 25centimetre microwave radiation. These magnetrons were used in radar equipment by the Army, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Wishing to return to Melbourne, he stepped down as Deputy Chief of the Division of Radiophysics in January 1944, and took charge of the Valve Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
50|$|Since 1998, many {{developments}} and improvements {{have been made}} to the internal capacitor stud <b>finders</b> and increased their popularity. Recent innovators developed stud <b>finders</b> with multiple sensor plates that sense the wall in multiple places instantly. These sensors can indicate the location, width, and lack of studs simultaneously. With more sensors, these instant stud <b>finders</b> avoid the shortcomings of previous electronic stud <b>finders,</b> which require calibration and do not adapt to inconsistencies in wall construction. While the instant stud <b>finders</b> have made finding studs an easy and efficient task, many people still use magnetic stud detectors.|$|R
50|$|Key <b>Finders,</b> {{also known}} as Keyfinders or Key Locators or Electronic <b>Finders,</b> are small {{electronic}} devices used to recover misplaced or lost key sets. Their goal {{is to reduce the}} time it takes to locate keys or other personal items, while remaining unobtrusive. Some key <b>finders</b> beep on-demand.|$|R
50|$|The Eye-Level and AE <b>Finders</b> are {{the basic}} {{eye-level}} prism <b>finders,</b> similar to most other SLR systems' prism <b>finders.</b> Both include a hot shoe for on-camera flash, or attachments to remotely trigger the shutter. Both also include an integral eyepiece shutter, which closes over the eyepiece to prevent light leakage during long exposures.|$|R
5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as <b>finder</b> of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the <b>finder,</b> tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet <b>Finder,</b> it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

5|$|Most ships {{had their}} director-control tower and {{rangefinder}} above the bridge removed {{in exchange for}} a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio direction <b>finder</b> on a short mainmast.|$|E
5|$|Some Tornado {{variants}} carry different avionics and equipment, {{depending on}} their mission. The Tornado ECR is devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) missions, operated by Germany and Italy. The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter-locator system (ELS) to spot radar use. German ECRs have a Honeywell infrared imaging system for reconnaissance flights. RAF and RSAF Tornados have the Laser Range <b>Finder</b> and Marked Target Seekers (LRMTS) for targeting laser-guided munitions. In 1991, the RAF introduced TIALD, allowing Tornado GR1s to laser-designate their own targets.|$|E
5|$|The <b>finder</b> did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the <b>finder.</b> Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate, retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E
50|$|Instant stud <b>finders</b> are {{a recent}} innovation. Instant stud <b>finders</b> have {{multiple}} sensor plates, {{and do not}} need to be moved across the wall to detect a stud, overcoming the effects of bumpy wall texture. They use an algorithm to analyze the readings from the multiple sensor plates for a quicker, more accurate indication. Instant stud <b>finders</b> sense multiple regions of a wall simultaneously including the center of a stud, edges of the stud, and regions without studs. Instant stud <b>finders</b> will indicate varied widths of studs and the location of multiple studs at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Triangulation range <b>finders</b> {{are exactly}} the opposite. They have a limited range of some meters, but their {{accuracy}} is relatively high. The accuracy of triangulation range <b>finders</b> is {{on the order of}} tens of micrometers.|$|R
5000|$|Trial {{courts are}} courts that hold trials. Sometimes termed [...] "courts of first instance", trial courts have varying {{original}} jurisdiction. Trial courts may conduct trials with juries as the <b>finders</b> of fact (these {{are known as}} jury trials) or trials in which judges act as both <b>finders</b> of fact and <b>finders</b> of law (in some jurisdictions these are known as bench trials). Juries are less common in court systems outside the Anglo-American common law tradition.|$|R

During their training, the player can collect stamps by completing minigames, and only one stamp can be collected per day. When a certain numbers of stamps are collected, new minigames and features are unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the find}} was {{reported}} under the Portable Antiquities Scheme, {{it was not}} declared treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act because single items of non-precious metal {{are not covered by}} the act. The <b>finder</b> and landowner were thus free to dispose of the helmet as they saw fit. The discovery was publicly announced by Christie's in mid-September 2010; the helmet was the centrepiece of its 7 October auction catalogue, featuring on the cover and six more pages. Its value was put at £200,000 – £300,000 ($309,200 – $463,800). The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing the helmet and making it the focus of a new Roman frontier gallery due to open in 2011. The campaign immediately attracted numerous donations, including £50,000 from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public (it was); a £1 million offer from the National Heritage Memorial Fund; a £300,000 pledge from the Headley Trust and the Monument Trust; £200,000 from the Art Fund; and £75,000 from the J Paul Getty Jr Charitable Trust. By the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched, the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £1.7 million. Behind the scenes, efforts were made to persuade the <b>finder</b> and landowner to agree a private sale with the museum, but these approaches failed.|$|E
5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos. Drunken Barnaby is a {{scene of}} a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career. The Coral <b>Finder</b> is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the instant}} stud <b>finders</b> use {{multiple}} readings {{to determine the}} location of studs they are less vulnerable to construction anomalies (such as uneven paint, wall textures, wallpaper, uneven plaster, etc.) that can disorient center and edge <b>finders.</b>|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} {{sequencing technology}} is advancing genome sequencing at an unprecedented level. By unravelling the code within a pathogen’s genome, every possible protein (prior to post-translational modifications) can theoretically be discovered, irrespective of life cycle stages and environmental stimuli. Now {{more than ever}} {{there is a great}} need for high-throughput ab initio gene finding. Ab initio gene <b>finders</b> use statistical models to predict genes and their exon-intron structures from the genome sequence alone. This paper evaluates whether existing ab initio gene <b>finders</b> can effectively predict genes to deduce proteins that have presently missed capture by laboratory techniques. An aim here is to identify possible patterns of prediction inaccuracies for gene <b>finders</b> as a whole irrespective of the target pathogen. All currently available ab initio gene <b>finders</b> are considered in the evaluation but only four fulfil high-throughput capability: AUGUSTUS, GeneMark_hmm, GlimmerHMM, and SNAP. These gene <b>finders</b> require training data specific to a target pathogen and consequently the evaluation results are inextricably linked to the availability and quality of the data. The pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, is used to illustrate the evaluation methods. The results support current opinion that predicted exons by ab initio gene <b>finders</b> are inaccurate in the absence of experimental evidence. However, the results reveal some patterns of inaccuracy that are common to all gene <b>finders</b> and these inaccuracies may provide a focus area for future gene finde...|$|R

5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral <b>Finder,</b> Cleopatra is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are out of proportion to each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the <b>Finder</b> would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the <b>finder</b> of fact determines did occur.|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} introduced a biologically realistic and reliable significance {{analysis of the}} output of a popular class of motif <b>finders</b> [16]. In this paper we further improve our significance analysis by incorporating local base composition information. Relying on realistic biological data simulation, {{as well as on}} FDR analysis applied to real data, we show that our method is significantly better than the increasingly popular practice of using the normal approximation to estimate the significance of a <b>finder’s</b> output. Finally we turn to leveraging our reliable significance analysis to improve the actual motif finding task. Specifically, endowing a variant of the Gibbs Sampler [18] with our improved significance analysis we demonstrate that de novo <b>finders</b> can perform better than has been perceived. Significantly, our new variant outperforms all the <b>finders</b> reviewed in a recently published comprehensive analysis [23] of the Harbison genome-wide binding location data [9]. Interestingly, many of these <b>finders</b> incorporate additional information such as nucleosome positioning and the significance of binding data. 1...|$|R
