5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} look for Simorg, the Bird of Ages, on the {{mountain}} Kaf. While wandering, he meets an old woman, Maimuna, who is a sorceress. She casts a spell upon him and he {{is sent to the}} land of Mohareb, by now an evil Sultan. However, Maimuna's sister, Khawla, <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Thalaba is killed that Mohareb would also be killed and she seeks to kill Thalaba to remove Mohareb. Finding this out, Mohareb joins with Thalaba and returns the ring. After telling Thalaba to turn to the darker powers, Thalaba leaves. Khawla attempts to user her magic to kill Thalaba, but the ring protects him. When Maimuna tries to user her own magic against Thalaba, she witnesses the goodness of the universe and represents her evil ways. She repays him by using her magic to bring him back to the mountain, and Thalaba is able to return to his search for Simorg. After wandering through snow, Thalaba comes across the Font of Fire with the sleeping Laila trapped inside. It turns out she was placed there by her father, the sorcerer Okba and one of the murderers of Thalaba's family.|$|E

In our planning we have not ignored the problem of ending the war, nor would we ignore it {{in the event of a}} war. And, of course, we have, and we will keep, a survivable and enduring capability to attack the full range of targets, including the Soviet economic base, if that is the appropriate response to a Soviet strike.|$|E
500|$|One triumphant day, Amir {{wins the}} local kite {{fighting}} tournament and finally earns Baba's praise. Hassan {{runs for the}} last cut kite, a great trophy, saying to Amir, [...] "For you, a thousand times over." [...] However, after finding the kite, Hassan encounters Assef in an alleyway. Hassan refuses {{to give up the}} kite, and Assef severely beats him and rapes him. Amir witnesses the act but is too scared to intervene. He <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he fails to bring home the kite, Baba would be less proud of him. He feels incredibly guilty but knows his cowardice would destroy any hopes for Baba's affections, so he keeps quiet about the incident. Afterwards, Amir keeps distant from Hassan; his feelings of guilt prevent him from interacting with the boy.|$|E

Thanks to assured performances, exacting direction and, of course, inspired writing, it does, in subtle, glorious ways". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker graded the film with an [...] "A–", saying it [...] "should enthral even those who haven't read" [...] the novel. Tucker concluded that the film was [...] "the sort of passionate yet precise comedy that reminds me why Austen remains such a vital writer". Susan Ostrov Weisser, a professor of nineteenth-century literature, called the film a [...] "faithful parade of Austen's world", and praised Root as the film's [...] "crown jewel" [...] for playing a [...] "fiercely intelligent, regretful, and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance". In 2008, James Rampton of The Independent rated it the fourth best Austen adaptation of all time.|$|E

2500|$|When Edmund {{reveals that}} he has tuberculosis, Mary refuses to believe it, and {{attempts}} to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and most importantly {{the severity of the}} situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of tuberculosis, and then, before exiting, he adds {{how difficult it is to}} have a [...] "dope fiend for a mother." [...] By herself, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will “accidentally” overdose, because she <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James comes back with more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund’s birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.|$|E
2500|$|McManaman {{had also}} been noted for his {{versatility}} in his free role, switching {{from right to left}} wings, and his ability to play in central midfield, behind the front pair, or as a forward, with many notable managers including then Ajax coach Louis van Gaal, describing it as a role few could pull off the way McManaman had. McManaman was credited for making the role manager Evans gave him work, with the result being that Liverpool were playing some of the most aesthetically pleasing attacking football at the time in England. McManaman was also said to have been {{one of only a handful}} of so-called [...] "talismanic" [...] players along with Eric Cantona and Gianfranco Zola in the league at the time believed to have the charisma to lift supporters from their seats each time they got the ball. Managers would deploy a man-marker specifically to follow him for an entire game, with Gianfranco Zola noting that McManaman was the player the Italian national players monitored the most. Howard Wilkinson said McManaman was [...] "virtually unstoppable" [...] at times, while then Middlesbrough manager, Bryan Robson, was quoted as saying that [...] "everyone in the Premiership <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you stop McManaman, you stop Liverpool". Roy Evans, attempting to diminish the attention on marking McManaman, stated, [...] "I would hate to think we are no more than a one-man team."
