The main design issues found in FBMC systems are generated by the incorporation of band-limited shaping pulses. Yet, these pulses have many advantages in terms of performance, such as providing either improved spectral confinement or no frequency overlap between adjacent subcarriers. They also benefit from robustness in front of narrowband interferences, and reduced out-of-band power emission, among others. However, the advantages of FBMC schemes are often obscured {{when it comes to}} the implementation point of view. This is particularly true for the flexible FBMC systems, where on top of incorporating band-limited shaping pulses, no restrictions are imposed on the signal parameters (i. <b>e.</b> <b>symbol</b> rate, carrier spacing or sampling frequency).

40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of two scientifically based academic reading interventions upon students who had no previous opportunity for interventions prior to qualification for special education. The Lindamood-Bell Learning Process offers two programs to intensively intervene with students having difficulty in reading. One of the programs, Seeing Stars, focuses on the development of symbol imagery in phonemic awareness. The other, Visualizing-Verbalizing, develops students' concept imagery. This study compared the effectiveness of the two programs on reading comprehension for middle school English language (EL) learners eligible for special education in the category of Specific Learning Disabilities. In this quantitative study, the independent variable was the method of instruction (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>symbol</b> imagery instruction versus visualize-verbalize instruction). The dependent variable was the pre-post change of students' reading comprehension as measured by the Basic Reading Inventory, Ekwall/Shanker Reading Inventory, and the Gray Oral Reading Test (GORT). Overall, the results show reading comprehension growth for most students using either intervention. Except for three students, over the six-week instructional period, participants showed from six months to two years growth, with the mean growth over both intervention groups being nine months. Results suggest that both reading interventions can have a powerful positive impact with English language learners eligible for special education.

40|$|AbstractIn {{a closed}} nonregular {{equilateral}} polygonal curve, angles cannot be permuted arbitrarily without opening the curve. Here we investigate the possible angle permutations that leave a polygonal curve closed. To this end we introduce angle sequences, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>symbol</b> sequences describing {{the number and}} arrangement of like angle values in classes of forms. We find that there exist “universal angle sequences” giving closed polygons for arbitrary angle values provided that the angle sum is kept constant at one of certain permissible values. The universal angle sequences are periodic: they consist {{of at least two}} identical series of symbols. Within a series, the symbols can be permuted freely on condition that in all other series the very same permutation is applied. All these correlated permutations, when applied to the angles of a corresponding polygonal curve, leave this curve closed. Polygons belonging to a given angle sequence (form class) constitute a submanifold of the manifold MI of equilateral polygons within the form space. These submanifolds structure MI in a hierarchical manner so that the form class concept gives a valuable complementary classification scheme for the forms of MI. Furthermore, we find that polygons with constant angle composition (the term “composition” is used here in its chemical sense) show a wide variety of possible shapes (from quasi-circular to wormlike and even self-intersecting ones) corresponding to different degrees of “segregation” of like angles within the polygonal curve...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} synchronization strings as a novel way of efficiently {{dealing with}} synchronization errors, i. e., insertions and deletions. Synchronization errors are strictly more general and {{much harder to}} deal with than commonly considered half-errors, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>symbol</b> corruptions and erasures. For every ϵ > 0, synchronization strings allow to index a sequence with an ϵ^-O(1) size alphabet such that one can efficiently transform k synchronization errors into (1 +ϵ) k half-errors. This powerful new technique has many applications. In this paper, we focus on designing insdel codes, i. e., error correcting block codes (ECCs) for insertion deletion channels. While ECCs for both half-errors and synchronization errors have been intensely studied, the later has largely resisted progress. Indeed, it took until 1999 for the first insdel codes with constant rate, constant distance, and constant alphabet size to be constructed by Schulman and Zuckerman. Insdel codes for asymptotically large or small noise rates were given in 2016 by Guruswami et al. but these codes are still polynomially far from the optimal rate-distance tradeoff. This makes the understanding of insdel codes up to this work equivalent to what was known for regular ECCs after Forney introduced concatenated codes in his doctoral thesis 50 years ago. A direct application of our synchronization strings based indexing method gives a simple black-box construction which transforms any ECC into an equally efficient insdel code with a slightly larger alphabet size. This instantly transfers much of the highly developed understanding for regular ECCs over large constant alphabets {{into the realm of}} insdel codes. Most notably, we obtain efficient insdel codes which get arbitrarily close to the optimal rate-distance tradeoff given by the Singleton bound for the complete noise spectrum...|$|E
40|$|In the {{information}} age in which we now live, reliable transmission and storage of digital information is of paramount importance. What makes such reliable transmission and storage possible, despite the errors inherent to communication channels and storage media, are error-correcting codes, first conceived by Claude Shannon over 60 years ago. Recent advances made by two NSF-supported scientists [...] - Venkatesan Guruswami at the University of Washington and Alexander Vardy at the University of California San Diego, along with their graduate students [...] - {{have led to the}} discovery of error-correcting codes with the best possible trade-off between error-correction capability and redundancy. The newly discovered codes yield an improvement by a factor of two over conventional error-correction algorithms that are currently used in every CD player and every desktop PC, as well as a myriad other devices that directly impact our daily lives (Figure 1). The basic idea of error-correction coding is relatively simple. Suppose that a sender (Alice) wishes to communicate to a receiver (Bob) a message consisting of ksymbols {{in such a way that}} Bob can always recover the message perfectly, even if <b>e</b> <b>symbol</b> errors occur during its transmission. To do so, Alice first encodes the message in a string of n> k symbols, using an error-correcting code that is capable of correcting any e transmission errors. The ratio R = k/n is called the "information rate " of the code, while the ratio t = e/n is known as its "error-correction radius. " Obviously, we would like both R and t to be as large as possible, transmitting information at a high rate while, at the same time, correcting many errors. However, these are conflicting goals: to correct more errors, one has to add more redundan...|$|E

Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. NurulChojimah, M. Pd. 	Keywords:language style, Michael Jackson, song lyrics. Language is {{essentially}} important {{in human life}} {{as a means of}} communication. It is one of the vital factors to create an interaction one another and many ways to create it and set up communication with others by using expression. Many form of expression can express author’s idea. They outpoure their feeling become a text which has message, such as song, poem, novel, drama and many others. The author makes song and writes the lyrics by using language style. Language style is the choice among the other alternatives in using language. It refers to the way to convey the same information by using different expression. To analyze the language style, the writer chose Michael Jackson because Michael Jackson {{is one of the great}} music heroes of the late 20 th century. The formulation of the research problems were: 1) What language styles are used in Michael Jackson’s selected song lyrics? 2) What are the meanings of language style used in Michael Jackson’s selected song lyrics? The purposes of this study were to: 1) know the language style that used in Michael Jackson’s selected song lyrics, 2) identify the meaning of language style used in Michael Jackson’s selected song lyrics. The research method that writer used: 1) the research design in this study was library research with qualitative approach, 2) the data of this study are utterances containing language style, meanwhile the source of all the data are taken from Michael Jackson’s selected song lyrics, 3) the data collected by documentation, 4) the step of data analysis are: a) reading the whole song lyrics to find some language styles, b) determining each stanza containing language styles, c) classifying the language styles found into its styles, d) making conclusion. The result of this study showed that Michael Jackson’s selected song contain into language styles. There are eleven language styles in 15 Michael Jackson’s song lyrics. The language style involves simile, hyperbole, repetition, personification, symbol, apostrophe, rhetoric, asyndeton, hysteron proteron, euphemism, metaphor, and simile is the dominant. The data are: 20 simile, 13 hyperbole, 10 repetition, 8 personification, 5 symbol, 2 apostrophe, 2 rhetoric, 2 asyndeton, 1 hysteron proteron, 1 euphemism, 1 and metaphor. The conclusion is based on summary of the finding and analyzing of the language style found in Michael Jackson’s song lyrics. Based on the finding, there are eleven language style found in Michael Jackson’s song lyrics. They are (a) simile, (b) hyperbole, (c) repetition, (d) personification, (<b>e)</b> <b>symbol,</b> (f) apostrophe, (g) rhetoric, (h) asyndeton, (i) hysteron proteron, (j) euphemism, and (k) metaphor and language style which mostly appears is simile. The researcher proposes some suggestion, but this does not mean that it has perfect finding. For the readers and the further researcher who are interested in analyzing literary works about song lyrics. It is suggested to understand the whole of song. Understanding the language style will make them easier to catch the meaning, even the theme of the song. For the further researcher, it is hoped that this thesis can be used as referenced to conduct another research on language style in other object...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is about}} how {{international}} housing assistance to societies affected by war contributes toward long-term recovery. Or does not. Current wars are characterized by large, often identity specific population movements causing an extreme and urgent need for shelter. This research does not deal with (emergency) ‘shelter’, but with (permanent) ‘housing’, which {{has come to be}} one of the largest funding sectors of international aid to countries ravaged by war. It is my contention that housing re/construction, because of its socio-material nature and high economic value may contribute towards long-term recovery. My research is therefore focusing on the relationship between the overall process of recovery and the way internationally funded housing projects are implemented. Recovery is conceptualized as a time limited, complex and reflexive activity, i. e. guided by past experience, both of pre-war conditions, and of the war itself. This makes recovery an endogenously driven process. In examining the implementation of foreign funded housing programs I submit, aided by prevailing theory, three chief attributes of housing: 1) that of physical object with its technical determinants and functional responsiveness, 2) that of object of meaning, i. <b>e.</b> <b>symbol,</b> which allows for, or even determines human action, and 3) that of vehicle of development, both by its backward linkages. i. e. creating demand and employment, but also by forward linkages, i. e. what people with housing will be able to do. All these attributes refer back to “what houses can do”, not only to “what houses are”. The New Wars create a new and extremely complex context for international housing interventions. Unlike the indiscriminate mass destruction of housing of former wars, today housing is destroyed as a function of the owners’ identity. The destruction of housing has become an integral part of ethnic cleansing. This fact has lead donors to concentrate on rebuilding the destroyed housing as a means of reintegrating the displaced, an idea that seems simplistic given the meaning of recovery, the nature of housing - and the grave political complexity of the new wars. Ideology as well as practical considerations have made the international NGOs the major agents of international aid. Their new role comes from that fact that most of the NGOs now receive substantial parts of their income from governments – to carry out government sponsored projects. Housing is a favored sector of intervention in war affected areas. Yet very few NGOs have any experience with housing. They make up for it by hiring building professionals on short-term field contracts. What little there is of theoretical writing that on housing re/construction after current wars, indicate that the NGOs – guided by their donors – apply an emergency approach also to permanent housing. Housing is conceived as shelter, which makes it a logistical challenge to fulfill basic short-term needs. If such an approach is applied, will it still contribute towards societal recovery? Within this frame I have examined three multi-phased housing projects in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I explore their performance and capacity to enhance long-term recovery. Acknowledging the endogenous, reflexive nature of recovery, I had to approach it qualitatively, yet be able to draw theoretical conclusions on a broader scale. I have investigated how the housing projects are performing as physical entities, as generators or inhibitors of social and socio-material interaction, and I have examined how the housing projects have impacted local markets, production and the buildings industry. I do this by applying a societal capital approach which holds (re) development a function of beneficial flows from four societal capitals, i. e. fixed, environmental, human and social capital. Recovery is supported when housing investments also replenish the other capitals modes so that the inhabitants may draw benefits from their enriched interaction. My cases are 1) set at different times in the reconstruction process, 2) set at different places and 3) executed differently by different NGOs. They yielded different, yet consistent conclusions within the three aspects of housing: physical object, symbol and strategy: • The long-term nature of housing construction is ignored in that technical solutions, workmanship – and not least – the choice of location reflect an emergency attitude where inappropriate solutions are accepted “because it is war”. There is a reluctance to plan beyond the immediate even for structures that can last generations. • The symbolic power of housing is reconfirmed for those who are able to reestablish livelihood networks at their place of origin. Return does not make strategic sense, hence is not a “durable solution”, for those whose networks are irreparably destroyed. For those who can return, housing reconstruction becomes a symbolic act, both to reestablish ontological security, but also to demonstrate against former perpetrators. Housing reconstruction in itself is therefore not a vehicle towards reconciliation. • Housing re/construction in times of war is a way of disseminating purchasing power through employment. There is no production, no social or financial institutions by which the building industry can develop. Internationally funded reconstruction therefore relies on large scale – and tax free - imports of buildings materials. However, my cases show that domestic demand more often than that of NGOs draws upon imports. Recovery momentum is lost in not supporting the (re) establishment of the local building materials industry. • My cases confirm the recovery powers of local agency. When substantive decisions on reconstruction are transferred from the NGO to the local community as part of the material support to housing re/construction, the community is also entrusted with support from external agents, like their own diaspora. This combination replenishes all capital modes of the community. The validity of this observation is inversely confirmed by another case where the inhabitants were not at all entrusted with decision-making powers, i. e. their human and social capitals were depleted. This also becomes apparent in that fixed and environmental capitals are also eroded. I have concluded by presenting implications for policy, practice and research...|$|E
