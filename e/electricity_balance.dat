50|$|The {{transmission}} system operator (TSO) {{is responsible for}} managing the <b>electricity</b> <b>balance</b> on the grid: at any time, electricity production has to match consumption. Therefore, the use of production means is scheduled in advance in order to respond to load profiles. The load corresponds to the total electricity consumption over the area of interest. Load profiles are usually given by load forecasts which are of high accuracy. For making up the daily schedule, TSOs may consider their own power production means, if they have any, and/or they can purchase power generation from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and utilities, via bilateral contracts or electricity pools. In the context of deregulation, more and more players appear on the market, thus breaking the traditional situation of vertically-integrated utilities with quasi local monopolies. Two main mechanisms compose electricity markets. The first one is the spot market where participants propose quantities of energy for the following day at a given production cost. An auction system permits to settle the electricity spot price for the various periods depending on the different bids. The second mechanism is the balancing of power generation, which is coordinated by the TSO. Depending on the energy lacks and surplus (e.g. due to power plant failures or to intermittence {{in the case of}} wind power installations), the TSO determines the penalties that will be paid by IPPs who missed in their obligations. In some cases, an intra-day market is also present, in order to take corrective actions.|$|E

However, this electricity conversion is not exempt from environmental drawbacks. In our study, the electricity production phases of four geothermal electricity plants are analyzed by means of a careful airborne emissions assessment carried out over the entire LCA of the plants. The impact categories considered are global warming (GWP), acidification (ACP) and human toxicology (HTP). The functional unit used is 1 MWh of electric energy produced from geothermal power plants in Mount Amiata area. For the environmental impact categories considered, the impact potentials are evaluated {{for each of the four}} geothermal power plants as follows: 380 - 1045 kg CO 2 eq/MWh for GWP, 0. 1 - 44. 8 kg SO 2 eq/MWh for ACP and 1. 1 - 31. 6 kg, 1. 4 -DB eq/MWh for HTP.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{process for}} the {{production}} of pure hydrogen from natural gas based on the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs) is presented. In this configuration, the SOFC is fed by natural gas and provides electricity and heat to the SOEC, which carries out the separation of steam into hydrogen and oxygen. Depending on the system layout considered, the oxygen available at the SOEC anode outlet can be either mixed with the SOFC cathode stream in order to improve the SOFC performance or regarded as a co-product. Two configurations of the cell stack are studied. The first consists of a stack with the same number of SOFCs and SOECs working at the same current density. In this case, since in typical operating conditions the voltage delivered by the SOFC is lower than the one required by the SOEC, the required additional power is supplied by means of an electric grid connection.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the energy balance of a {{hypothetical}} microalgae-based wastewater treatment plant (10, 000 PE) located in the Mediterranean Region, where harvested microalgal biomass and primary sludge would be co-digested to produce biogas and bioenergy. The assessment was based on experimental results obtained over one year in pilot high rate algal ponds followed by anaerobic digesters for biogas production from harvested microalgal biomass and primary sludge. The energy balance compared four scenarios: 1) anaerobic co-digestion of microalgal biomass and primary sludge, and cogeneration from biogas in a combined with heat and power (CHP) unit; 2) co-digestion with thermal pretreatment of microalgal biomass, and cogeneration from biogas in a CHP unit; 3) co-digestion and heat generation from biogas in a boiler; and 4) co-digestion with thermal pretreatment of microalgal biomass, and heat generation from biogas in a boiler. According to the results, when biogas was used to cogenerate electricity and heat (scenarios 1 and 2), the <b>electricity</b> <b>balance</b> was always positive, and the best results were obtained with pretreated microalgal biomass (scenario 2). Similarly, the heat balance was always positive when biomass was thermally pretreated (scenario 2).

40|$|The {{integration}} of the increasing share of fluctuating renewable energy sources into the energy system requires more options in flexibility. A promising attempt is the power-to-gas concept (PtG) which allows the production of hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG) from electricity and the storage in caverns or existing gas storage facilities. However, an economic operation in Germany is not expected before 2030, when the amount of surplus energy, mainly generated in wind parks, will be sufficient. Currently, a hardly analyzed aspect is the potential commercialization of the flexible electrolysis as controllable load on the <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> market. This offers opportunities to generate additional revenues and to obtain cheap electricity {{in the form of}} balancing energy. The present article has been designed to analyze this aspect and to examine the impact of a potential commercialization of balancing energy on the gas production costs within the PtG concept. At first, the current legal framework, the funding instruments of SNG and the differences between the notion "Speichergas" and Biogas will be outlined. An overview of the current balancing market will be given and the development of prices on the secondary balancing market will be evaluated as well as expected market trends will be presented.

40|$|This work investigates {{and compares}} the {{thermodynamic}} performance of alternative platform chemicals {{for the production}} of light olefins (i. e., ethylene, propylene, and mixed butylenes) via gasification of lignocellulosic biomass (forest residues). Two concepts based on the same general process layout are considered: (i) via methanol synthesis and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) synthesis; (ii) via direct dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis and DME-to-olefins (DTO) synthesis. The work is based on process models established in Aspen Plus to obtain mass and energy balances. Heat recovery targets for integration of a steam network for combined heat and power production are investigated using pinch analysis tools. The different process alternatives are compared in terms of energy efficiency (?en). Additionally, to identify key process differences, the cold gas efficiency (?cg,i) and carbon conversion (Cconv,i) from biomass feedstock to various intermediate products along the process value chain are compared. The results show that light olefins could be produced with an energy efficiency of approximately 52 – 54 % (higher heating value (HHV) basis) using methanol and DME as platform chemicals. The two investigated concepts had similar cold gas efficiency along the process value chain and overall <b>electricity</b> <b>balance.</b> Accordingly, no significant thermodynamic difference could be identified for the two investigated cases. One interesting feature that is identified is that the same amount of the renewable carbon in the feedstock is lost, mainly as CO 2, regardless of whether the methanol or DME route is adopted.

40|$|The {{production}} of biofuels via a low temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis could potentially increase {{the utilization of}} biofuels without having to change the currently used combustion engines. Furthermore, the upgrading process needed to convert the FT-crude obtained just after the synthesis into commercial motor fuels {{could be done in}} a state-of-the-art refinery. In addition, current infrastructures would still be suitable for the distribution of the FT-fuels. To gain knowledge about this synthesis, a model has been developed with particular focus on the FT-synthesis of hydrocarbons from biomass derived syngas. The general Biomass-To-Liquid process would also include the upstream gasification process which converts biomass into syngas and the further upgrading of the FT-crude into diesel and gasoline. The main features of this model are: a chain growth probability, α, dependent on temperature, H 2 and CO mole fraction, a concomitant {{production of}} olefins and paraffins considered and kinetics of the FT-synthesis reaction taken into account. The starting point of the modelled processes is a cleaned syngas which was previously derived from biomass through a gasification process. This syngas is then converted into a FT-crude stream. However, not all of the H 2 and CO in the fresh syngas is converted in the FT-synthesis. Therefore, it can be recycled into the reactor to increase the overall conversion. Alternatively, the light hydrocarbons in the syngas obtained after crude condensation can be reformed to H 2 and CO, thus increasing the fresh syngas available for the synthesis. To avoid a build-up of inert components, some of the recycled stream is purged. Four different process configurations have been modelled and analysed in this work. They differ by the way the syngas loop is handled (with and without reformer) and by the final utilization of the purge gas (simple combustion in a boiler or used to fuel a gas turbine for power production). This work discusses the results of a parametric study of the different configurations in order to investigate the impact of the reactor operating temperature, pressure and of the desired CO conversion on different indicators. Within this study the product distribution has been investigated according to the characteristics required for products in the carbon ranges of interest. Catalyst amount and reactor volume needed to achieve a certain CO conversion have been calculated as well as efficiencies of the process using different system boundaries. The <b>electricity</b> <b>balance</b> of the processes has also been considered for further evaluation. The results highlight that there is a trade-off between {{the quality and quantity of}} FT-crude production and the reactor size which mainly depends on the temperature. With an increase in temperature the reactor volume decreases, however, the amount of long chain hydrocarbons decreases as well and the production of C 1 - 4 is favoured. This gives a less valuable product stream. The same trend is applicable for the system and conversion efficiency of the modelled process. Due to the applied model for the chain growth probability (α) of the hydrocarbons, the pressure only has a minor impact except for the electricity consumption. It can be generally concluded that the electricity demand of the FT synthesis process increases with the pressure. It is furthermore shown that the same impact on the electricity consumption can be observed with an increase of the CO conversion within the FT reactor. Considering the impact of an upgrading process for the recirculating gas flow, it can be concluded that the utilisation of a reformer helps to a large extent to reduce the need for a water gas shift prior the synthesis step. However, with the syngas composition considered in this work (similar to that of a biomass indirect gasifier product gas) the reformer’s contribution is not enough to completely avoid this part of the system. The model of the FT-reactor provided by this study can be used in the future to investigate a more complete process where the syngas production, e. g. by biomass gasification, as well as the following upgrading of the FT-crude to motor fuels is also included. The major advantage of this model with respect to other literature models is that kinetic has been taken into account...|$|E
