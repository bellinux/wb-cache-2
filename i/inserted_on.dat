25|$|The {{adductor}} hallucis has two heads; {{a stronger}} oblique head which {{arises from the}} cuboid and lateral cuneiform bones and the bases of {{the second and third}} metatarsals; and a transverse head which arises from the distal ends of the third-fifth metatarsals. Both heads are <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> the lateral sesamoid bone of the first digit. The muscle acts as a tensor to the arches of the foot, but can also adduct the first digit and plantar flex its first phalanx.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} the iliopsoas, {{a group of}} two or three muscles with a shared insertion on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas major originates from the last vertebra and along the lumbar spine to stretch down into the pelvis. The iliacus originates on the iliac fossa on the interior side of the pelvis. The two muscles unite to form the iliopsoas muscle which is <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas minor, only present in about 50 per cent of subjects, originates above psoas major to stretch obliquely down to its insertion on the interior side of the major muscle.|$|E
25|$|ODA 555 ("Triple Nickel") from Bravo Company, 2nd Btn, 5th SFG was, with ODA 595, {{one of two}} ODA units <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> 19 October.

25|$|On 26 September 1970, {{to begin}} Operation Counterpunch, Vang Pao sent {{one of his}} battalions to raid {{communist}} supply caches along Route 4. Meeting little opposition on this sweep, the battalion was redirected on 2 October to recapture a formerly lost stronghold at Khang Kho. On 8 October, they were reinforced and feinted northwards towards the strategically vital Plain of Jars. In conjunction with this, an ad hoc regiment, Groupement Mobile 22 (GM 22) was <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> the hilltop of Phou Long Mat. On 11 October, the original battalion split into two columns. One of them linked up with GM 22 in the Muang Pot Valley. The other skirted the southwest fringe of the Plain.|$|E
25|$|The Thai Chulasakarat {{calendar}} uses {{a slightly}} different method to place the intercalary day. Instead {{of it in a}} leap year as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small leap year has 355 days while the Thai great leap year has 384 days. Both systems arrive at the same number of days in a 19-year cycle however. Furthermore, in contrast to Indian calendars, the Burmese calendar follows a Metonic cycle in which intercalary months are <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> a set schedule. However, because the Burmese calendar has to adjust for the use of Indian-calendar-derived sidereal years with the Metonic cycle's tropical years, maintaining a set Metonic cycle has been a challenge.|$|E
25|$|The opponens digiti minimi {{originates}} {{from the}} long plantar ligament and the plantar tendinous sheath of peroneus longus and is <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> the fifth metatarsal. When present, it acts to plantar flex the fifth digit and supports the plantar arch. The flexor digiti minimi arises from the region of base of the fifth metatarsal and is inserted onto {{the base of the}} first phalanx of the fifth digit where it is usually merged with the abductor of the first digit. It acts to plantar flex the last digit. The largest and longest muscles of the little toe is the abductor digiti minimi. Stretching from the lateral process of the calcaneus, with a second attachment on the base of the fifth metatarsal, {{to the base of the}} fifth digit's first phalanx, the muscle forms the lateral edge of the sole. Except for supporting the arch, it plantar flexes the little toe and also acts as an abductor.|$|E

25|$|The Pontifex Maximus {{determined}} when an intercalary {{month was}} to be <b>inserted.</b> <b>On</b> average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through intercalary months broke down at least twice: {{the first time was}} during and after the Second Punic War. It led to the reform of the 191 Acilian Law on Intercalation, the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The second breakdown {{was in the middle of}} the first century and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected Roman magistrates was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would have reason to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.|$|E
25|$|Three of the {{anterior}} muscles are extensors. From its origin on the lateral {{surface of the}} tibia and the interosseus membrane, the three-sided belly of the tibialis anterior extends down below the superior and inferior extensor retinacula to its insertion on the plantar side of the medial cuneiform bone and the first metatarsal bone. In the non-weight-bearing leg, {{the anterior}} tibialis dorsal flexes the foot and lifts the medial edge of the foot. In the weight-bearing leg, it pulls the leg towards the foot. The extensor digitorum longus has a wide origin stretching from the lateral condyle of the tibia down along the anterior side of the fibula, and the interosseus membrane. At the ankle, the tendon divides into four that stretch across the foot to the dorsal aponeuroses of the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. In the non-weight-bearing leg, the muscle extends the digits and dorsiflexes the foot, and in the weight-bearing leg acts similar to the tibialis anterior. The extensor hallucis longus has its origin on the fibula and the interosseus membrane between the two other extensors and is, similarly to the extensor digitorum, is <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> the last phalanx of big toe ("hallux"). The muscle dorsiflexes the hallux, and acts similar to the tibialis anterior in the weight-bearing leg.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1969 Pearson moved 9 RAR from Nui Dat {{to relieve}} 1 RAR in the Long Thanh {{district}} of Bien Hoa province. Under {{the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Alan Morrison, the battalion subsequently took over operations in AO Wondai. Supported by the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery they occupied FSB Diggers Rest. The battalion then mounted a series of company sweeps through the area while watching for large-scale movement of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces. For the Australians, Operation Goodwood then became a 'cat and mouse' game, with 1 ATF manoeuvring {{in the hope of}} engaging the Viet Cong in order to destroy their bases and restricting their movement. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong struggled to maintain their resupply system, and in response to this pressure they opted to disperse in an attempt to bypass the Australians, only consolidating to fight when an opportunity to arose to inflict a setback on the allies. Meanwhile, a number of SAS patrols were inserted by air and road on 6 January 1969 to gather information on communist troop movements. Further patrols were deployed to the southern Bien Hoa-Firestone Trail area in mid-January, while additional SAS patrols were <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> 29 January in an attempt to ascertain communist troop movements.|$|E

25|$|Flower buds {{are formed}} in March and April and these open from October {{to the end}} of December varying {{according}} to location and altitude. The inflorescence sits {{at the end of the}} branches in an umbel-like panicle that consists of five to ten flowers. Each flower is hermaphrodite, starsymmetric, 2½—3½cm in diameter and produces copious amounts of nectar, but apparently does not emit a scent. The five sepals are broadly oval, covered in downy hairs and 5–6mm long. The five petals are overlapping in the bud, white, felty, spoon-shaped with a narrow base (or claw). The claw is 1½-2cm long and is <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> a 5-lobed disc. The five stamens extend well beyond the corolla and alternate with the five lobes of the disc at the centre of the flower. The filaments are very long and white. The anthers are connected to the filaments midlength and open in lengthwise slits towards the middle of the flower. Pollen grains have five slits. The nectar is produced by the ledges of the disc, just above the petal inplant. The five styles that rise from the disc are sometimes free from each other at their based and are twisting and fused higher up.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E
25|$|The typical and usual {{segments}} of the insect leg are divided into the coxa, one trochanter, the femur, the tibia, the tarsus, and the pretarsus. The coxa in its more symmetrical form, has {{the shape of a}} short cylinder or truncate cone, though commonly it is ovate and may be almost spherical. The proximal end of the coxa is girdled by a submarginal basicostal suture that forms internally a ridge, or basicosta, and sets off a marginal flange, the coxomarginale, or basicoxite. The basicosta strengthens the base of the coxa and is commonly enlarged on the outer wall to give insertion to muscles; on the mesal half of the coxa, however, it is usually weak and often confluent with the coxal margin. The trochanteral muscles that take their origin in the coxa are always attached distal to the basicosta. The coxa is attached to the body by an articular membrane, the coxal corium, which surrounds its base. These two articulations are perhaps the primary dorsal and ventral articular points of the subcoxo-coxal hinge. In addition, the insect coxa has often an anterior articulation with the anterior, ventral end of the trochantin, but the trochantinal articulation does not coexist with a sternal articulation. The pleural articular surface of the coxa is borne on a mesal inflection of the coxal wall. If the coxa is movable on the pleural articulation alone, the coxal articular surface is usually inflected to a sufficient depth to give a leverage to the abductor muscles <b>inserted</b> <b>on</b> the outer rim of the coxal base. Distally the coxa bears an anterior and a posterior articulation with the trochanter. The outer wall of the coxa is often marked by a suture extending from the base to the anterior trochanteral articulation. In some insects the coxal suture falls in line with the pleural suture, and in such cases the coxa appears to be divided into two parts corresponding to the episternum and epimeron of the pleuron. The coxal suture is absent in many insects.|$|E
