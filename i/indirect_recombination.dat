40|$|Auger {{recombination}} is {{an important}} nonradiative carrier recombination mechanism in many classes of optoelectronic devices. The microscopic Auger processes can be either direct or indirect, mediated by an additional scattering mechanism such as the electron-phonon interaction and alloy disorder scattering. <b>Indirect</b> Auger <b>recombination</b> is particularly strong in nitride materials and affects the efficiency of nitride optoelectronic devices at high powers. Here, we present a first-principles computational formalism {{for the study of}} direct and <b>indirect</b> Auger <b>recombination</b> in direct-band-gap semiconductors and apply it to the case of nitride materials. We show that direct Auger recombination is weak in the nitrides and cannot account for experimental measurements. On the other hand, carrier scattering by phonons and alloy disorder enables indirect Auger processes that can explain the observed loss in devices. We analyze the dominant phonon contributions to the Auger recombination rate and the influence of temperature and strain on the values of the Auger coefficients. Auger processes assisted by charged-defect scattering are much weaker than the phonon-assisted ones for realistic defect densities and not important for the device performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanism}} of charge recombination of the S 2 QA- state in photosystem II was investigated by modifying the free energy {{gap between the}} quinone acceptor QA and the primary pheophytin acceptor Ph. This was done either by changing the midpoint potential of Ph (using mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis with a modified hydrogen bond to this cofactor), or that of QA (using different inhibitors of the QB pocket). The {{results show that the}} recombination rate is dependent on the free energy gap between Ph and QA, which confirms that the <b>indirect</b> <b>recombination</b> pathway involving formation of Ph-has a significant contribution. In the mutant with the largest free energy gap, direct electron transfer from QA- to P+ predominates. The temperature dependence of the recombination rate was investigated, showing a lower activation enthalpy in this mutant compared with the WT. The data allow the determination of the rate of the direct route and of its relative weight in the various strains. The set of currently accepted values for the midpoint potentials of the QA/QA-, Ph/Ph-, and P+/P * couples is not consistent with the relatively rapid rate of the <b>indirect</b> <b>recombination</b> pathway found here, nor with the 3 % yield of delayed fluorescence as previously estimated by de Grooth and van Gorkom (1981, Biochim.

40|$|Abstract. The angular {{distributions}} {{of the products}} of dissociative recombination of diatomic molecular ions are derived. The distributions {{are determined by the}} dominant partial waves of the captured electrons. For a single dominant wave, the neutral product distribution is described by the same spherical harmonic that describes the electron partial wave. The derived distributions take into account both direct and <b>indirect</b> dissociative <b>recombination</b> and are essential for modeling the projected distributions measured in storage ring experiments. All prior storage ring experiments have assumed that the product angular distributions can be described by spherical harmonics with angular momenta ≤ 1 and isotropic product distributions for ”zero ” eV electron capture. These assumptions are tested here by deriving the projected distributions for the dissociative recombination of CH+. For CH+, it is shown that the ”zero” eV storage ring experimental results cannot be explained by only isotropic dissociation. Instead, an anisotropic model product distribution is required. The anisotropic model yields a quantum yield of 1. 0 for C(1 D) instead of the incorrect value of 0. 79 derived previously using an isotropic model. The quantum yields of all prior storage ring experiments on other molecular ions at ”zero ” eV electron energy must be reassessed in view of these findings. 1...|$|R
