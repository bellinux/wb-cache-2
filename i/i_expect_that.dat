[...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt {{against the backdrop of}} what I had read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?'

It was a great experience to record The Last Romance and it remains {{one of my favorite}} recordings." ...|$|E

To make certain that occurs, however, I am in favor of adding language to H.R. 25 during the 111th Congress that includes a sunset provision, meaning that either we succeed in repealing the Sixteenth Amendment within {{five years after the}} implementation of the FairTax or the FairTax goes away. In my view, we simply cannot risk having both a national income tax and a national sales tax in place at the same time." ...|$|E

[...] "They {{have nothing to do}} with the affair, and they believe us to be pirates. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> we shall get on board unnoticed. Then with a cheer go at them with the flat of your cutlasses. You can use the edge on the whites if they resist. But <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> the blacks will all jump {{overboard}} in a panic, and that then the whites, seeing that they are outnumbered, will surrender." ...|$|E
