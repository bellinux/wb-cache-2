5|$|She {{also appears}} in the {{flashback}} sequences in the Marvel digital comic book Max Payne 3: After the Fall. <b>Her</b> <b>clothes</b> for the Xbox Live Avatar were released by Rockstar Games on the Xbox LIVE Marketplace.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song revolve around Brown asking his lover to take off <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> {{so that they can}} have sex.|$|E
5|$|Will {{encounters}} Hollywood superstar Anna Scott {{when she}} enters his shop. Minutes later, they collide {{in the street}} and his drink spills on <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> Will offers his house nearby for Anna to change. Before leaving, she impulsively kisses him and then asks him not to mention what just occurred.|$|E
60|$|The maid {{glanced over}} her {{shoulder}} and went on preparing <b>her</b> mistress's <b>clothes.</b>|$|R
60|$|ANN. They're hopeless, all three--especially her. Wish I hadn't given <b>her</b> my <b>clothes</b> now.|$|R
60|$|Then {{interruption}} came, {{suddenly and}} tragically. Without knock or ring, {{the door was}} flung open and slammed again. Beatrice stood there, still in <b>her</b> shabby <b>clothes,</b> <b>her</b> veil pushed back, gloveless and breathless. Her clenched hand flew out towards Philip as though she would have struck him.|$|R
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow <b>her</b> <b>clothes,</b> as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
5|$|On the January 2, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria was {{attacked}} and stripped of <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> by Vince's Devils (Victoria, Torrie Wilson, and Candice Michelle), {{but she was}} saved by Ashley Massaro. During a commercial break that night, Vince McMahon announced a Gauntlet Bra & Panties Match for New Year's Revolution between all five girls. At the event, Maria {{was the first to}} enter the Gauntlet match and eliminated Michelle and Wilson before being eliminated by Victoria. The match was ultimately won by Massaro.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting {{that she is a}} witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E
60|$|He frowned for {{a moment}} thoughtfully. He was looking at <b>her</b> {{expensive}} <b>clothes.</b> He did not understand.|$|R
60|$|Then Catherine put on <b>her</b> best <b>clothes</b> {{and went}} to the court, and looked more {{beautiful}} than any woman there.|$|R
60|$|Had mamma {{discovered}} her? With a despairing {{sense of}} being caught {{she looked down at}} <b>her</b> tell-tale <b>clothes</b> and the unslept-in bed.|$|R
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. <b>Her</b> <b>clothes</b> are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
5|$|Wings is {{also one}} of the first widely {{released}} films to show nudity. In the enlistment office are nude men undergoing physical exams, who can be seen from behind through a door which is opened and closed. Bow's breasts are revealed for a second during the Paris bedroom scene when military police barge in as she is changing <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> In the scene in which Rogers becomes drunk, the intoxication displayed on screen was genuine, as although 22 years of age, he had never tasted liquor before, and quickly became inebriated from drinking champagne. A boom was built with the camera mounted on an extension to shoot the Café de Paris scene.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E
60|$|It was on {{a bright}} June morning that Billy told Saxon to put on <b>her</b> riding <b>clothes</b> to try out a saddle-horse.|$|R
5000|$|She was [...] "only {{a little}} over 5 feet tall" [...] {{and said that she}} had to alter <b>her</b> own <b>clothes</b> to fit.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "The Madonna of the Humble" by Robert Ferazzi, depicting the Madonna with child, [s. d. ]. The Madonna is pictured from the waist up. She is turned to the side, and cradles an infant in <b>her</b> tattered <b>clothes,</b> <b>her</b> hood pulled halfway over her head. The infant wears white. The picture file card lists this painting as "New Madonna"...|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up {{with his}} friends, the Terenzi {{brothers}} (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi), and using the intercom on an ice cream truck, they drive around town attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn stuck to <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> from her earlier encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attack her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrive and trap her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink liquefied townspeople, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and <b>her</b> <b>clothes,</b> consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
5000|$|Fleure's {{modelling}} {{work has}} included fronting Brands Exclusive's [...] "Celebrity Shopping, Reality Prices" [...] campaign in 2016. Brands Exclusive sells <b>her</b> Pialia <b>clothes</b> line.|$|R
25|$|Randell {{worked the}} dance scene and discothèques, usually backed by The Spinning Wheels, with <b>her</b> trendsetting <b>clothes</b> and mod style {{carefully}} orchestrated by manager, West.|$|R
6000|$|Amelius looked round. Simple Sally {{had heard}} it all. She was dressed in <b>her</b> wretched <b>clothes,</b> and was {{standing}} at the open bedroom door, crying, ...|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> old and worn.|$|E
5|$|Pauline Bonaparte first {{appears on}} the ship of dogs being transported from Cuba to Haiti in Part Two of the novel. She is {{described}} as a beautiful woman who, despite her tender years, is familiar with the male body. She enjoyed tempting the men on board and for that reason would let the wind ruffle her hair and breeze through <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> to reveal the grace of her breasts. She would also sleep out in the open. Pauline has Solimán massage her body and tend to her beauty. They form a relationship and when her husband, Leclerc, falls ill she puts her faith in the voodoo of Solimán designed to cure him. Leclerc dies and Pauline makes her way back to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) informs Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) {{that she}} can no longer dress as a goth, alarmed by a spate of pseudo-vampirism in the school, {{inspired}} by the Twilight series. She briefly changes her style, before dressing as a vampire and convincing Figgins {{that if he does}} not allow her to wear <b>her</b> preferred <b>clothes,</b> <b>her</b> vicious Asian vampire father will bite him.|$|R
5000|$|Hampton’s sister, Beverley Hampton intervened {{with the}} Austrian {{authorities}} in November 2009 to prevent <b>her</b> brother's <b>clothes,</b> worn {{at the time}} of his death, from being destroyed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sit {{down and}} warm yourself, {{and tell me}} about Ranza,' said the kind elder sister, who liked the confiding little girl, in spite of <b>her</b> shabby <b>clothes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Selfe's {{funeral was}} held at St Paul's Church, Wahroonga, {{where he had been}} a churchwarden. He was buried in Gore Hill {{cemetery}} {{in the presence of a}} large gathering of businessmen and representatives of the organisations he had been involved with. He was survived by his two daughters from his first marriage, Rhoda and Norma, and his second wife, Marion. His estate was valued for probate at nearly £5000. Twenty-one years later, on 11 March 1932 Marion's charred body was found in her new house, also in Normanhurst where she lived alone, having reportedly set fire to <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> when lighting a candle. Marion was buried alongside Norman in plot CE I:7. Rhoda's ashes were also placed nearby when she died aged 69 in 1954, still living in Gilligaloola.|$|E
5|$|The police arrest {{a second}} suspect named Tweety (Vincent Miller), who {{was found in}} {{possession}} of the murdered woman's locket. The detectives question Marvin and Tweety separately until Tweety identifies the shooter as 19-year-old Vaughn Perkins (Lloyd Goodman). Howard is surprised to learn Vaughn has a mostly clean criminal record, and his family insists Vaughn would never kill anybody. Vaughn is arrested without incident, but Ellison is unable to identify the three suspects {{because he does not}} remember their faces. Meanwhile, Ellison sees his wife's body in the morgue, and gets upset that <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and wedding ring have been removed. Bayliss later returns the ring to Ellison, who admits he feels guilty for not protecting his wife or stopping the shooter. Ellison asks to hold Bayliss' gun just to know how it feels, and Bayliss reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
25|$|A talented {{dressmaker}} and designer, Board {{often made}} <b>her</b> own <b>clothes,</b> including a pink coat she wore {{to receive the}} MBE from Queen Elizabeth II in January 1970.|$|R
60|$|I ushered {{her into}} my sitting-room. She was wearing what I {{recognized}} as <b>her</b> best <b>clothes,</b> {{and not being}} entirely at her ease she talked loudly and rapidly.|$|R
