5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large subunit and {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequence data, the results of which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as F.ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus gabonensis, P.caribaeo-quercicolus and the newly described P.castanopsidis. The four species share morphological characteristics, and form a monophyletic clade. This clade resolved more closely with the Phellinus type species P.igniarius than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Fomitiporia type species F.langloisii, and so the authors proposed a transference of F.ellipsoidea to Phellinus, naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus. While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study, MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway.|$|E
5|$|Skywalker Sound {{supplied}} the development team with sound directly from The Phantom Menace {{for use in}} Battle for Naboo. Because its music is fully interactive and in real-time, the game required new material to be composed and pieces from the movie to be rewritten. Factor 5 again used its own sound drivers called MusyX to handle the game's sound, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Rogue Squadron (then called MOsys FX Surround). The game includes voice work from voice actors Jeff Coopwood, Roger L. Jackson, Doug Boyd and Terence McGovern.|$|E

5|$|The LRDG {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in February 1945, operating around Istria and Dalmatia, where Germany still held {{portions of the}} mainland and certain strategic islands. The Germans had heavily mined the southern Adriatic and were attempting to cover their shipping by moving only by night, close to shore, and heaving to during the day under camouflage nets. The LRDG was tasked to patrol the coast, find the ships and report their locations {{to the air force}} for bombing. This <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> success. It remained in Yugoslavia {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E

For {{much of the}} 1930s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed. Construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge served to alleviate some {{of the effects of}} the economic downturn by employing 1,400 men between 1924 and 1932.

25|$|Some {{very few}} Britannica-appointed {{contributors}} are mistaken. A notorious instance from the Britannica's early {{years is the}} rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig, the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity {{was caused by the}} classical element of fire. The Britannica has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> William Robertson Smith's articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).|$|E

25|$|However, the {{popularity}} of the programme, dealing as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> matters of controversy and politics, caused complaints of left-wing bias from within the BBC and from commentators outside. The BBC attempted to modify the format of the programme to avoid this but also sought to avoid damaging the shows popularity. With military criticism of Sincerely Yours, general complaints about the bawdy humour in Shipmates Ashore and political criticism of The Brains Trust, the BBC sought a scapegoat and pressured Howard Thomas to leave. In 1944, he resigned.|$|E

Proponents of SNES emulation cite discontinued production of the SNES constituting abandonware status, the right of the owner of the respective game to make a personal backup via devices such as the Retrode, space shifting for private use, the desire to develop homebrew games for the system, the frailty of SNES ROM cartridges and consoles, and the lack of certain foreign imports.|$|E

His father was General James Bankhead, a brigadier general who {{distinguished}} himself in the Mexican–American War. His mother was Ann Smith Pyne. Bankhead's family were prominent citizens from both Virginia and South Carolina. As the Civil War approached secession badly divided his family as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> so many others in these states. Bankhead's two brothers, Henry C., a regular army officer who also sided with the Union and Smith Pyne, a lawyer in Memphis, Tennessee, who joined the Confederate army became a colonel. Major General John Bankhead Magruder was a cousin who left the Union and served under the Confederate flag.|$|E

In February 2009 CCP announced that they planned to discontinue the official Linux client with the next major patch, and advised on using third-party programs to run the Windows version of the client under Linux (namely Wine). The discontinuation of the official Linux client was primarily because the game ran better using the Windows client via Wine than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the official one, as a result many Linux users were already using Wine instead.|$|E
