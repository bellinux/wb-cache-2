25|$|A {{passenger}} airbag was offered {{as an option}} in the Series II facelift of October 1995. The unique design allowed it to protect the not only the <b>front</b> <b>passenger,</b> but the <b>centre</b> <b>passenger</b> as well (only the entry-level GLi was offered with the optional bench seat). The Fairmont Ghia was the only trim level to receive dual airbags as standard, which also benefited from the XR6 engine, leather upholstery, extensive use of chrome and lowered suspension. With the use of neoprene rubber insulation, road and wind noise was cut off from within the cabin, contributing to vehicle refinement. Ford also dropped the XR6 station wagon from the lineup in the Series II.|$|R

50|$|The driver's door {{provides}} {{access to}} the driver’s cockpit, and to the rear jump seat. The {{other side of the}} car is a purposely asymmetrical arrangement. Eliminating the glovebox and minimizing the instrument panel allows shifting the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> about six-inches ahead of the driver’s seating position. In turn, the second inside passenger, sitting in tandem behind the inside passenger, has approximately the same leg, shoulder, and headroom as the <b>front</b> <b>passenger.</b> The Kabura includes a secondary passenger-side door, allowing easier access to the seat behind the <b>front</b> <b>passenger.</b> After the <b>front</b> door is opened, touching a button slides the rear door straight back into a cavity notched into the rear-quarter panel area, instead of swinging on hinges.|$|R

40|$|This study applies NASS/CDS, GES and FARS data {{to examine}} {{occupant}} exposure plus injury and fatality rates for belted occupants in frontal crashes by seating position, age and gender. The NASS data {{was used to}} examine the distributions by crash severity. The GES data showed that when two elderly occupants (age 65 +) were present, the female occupied the right <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> position 73 % of the time. A paired comparison analysis using FARS data showed that, for elderly occupants (age 65 +), the fatality risk for elderly right <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> is 42 % higher than for elderly drivers. The NASS/CDS analysis found 74 % of the seriously injured vulnerable passengers with MAIS 3 + injuries were in crashes less severe than 26 mph. This group of injured occupants was made up of 43 % aged 50 and older and 42 % younger females. The injury rates for the older (age 50 +) right <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> were 1. 8 times the rates for the elderly drivers. These results suggest the need for more benign safety systems for the right <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> that are appropriate for the lower injury tolerance of the predominant occupants of that seating position...|$|R
