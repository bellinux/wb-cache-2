5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene <b>for</b> <b>reporters</b> visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
25|$|The {{response}} from law enforcement has been mixed.

The Ottawa Police, the first Ontario police force to adopt the Taser, held a Taser demonstration <b>for</b> <b>reporters</b> to illustrate their safety. Both the Toronto Police and the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, meanwhile, have put large orders of Tasers for their front-line officers on hold.|$|E

25|$|He {{looked to}} Ayeni and Wilson v. Layne, {{decided by the}} Supreme Court the year before, as precedents. In the latter case the Court had {{unanimously}} held it was unconstitutional <b>for</b> <b>reporters</b> to accompany federal marshals executing an arrest warrant in a private residence since their presence served no valid law enforcement purpose. Since the two cases involved private homes with a reasonable expectation of privacy, he distinguished Lauro's by noting the perp walk had occurred on a public street and {{sidewalk in front of}} the police station.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge to}} {{arriving at a}} definitive assessment of the event is that independent corroboration of the government's claims has not been possible. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the lack of independent information made the incident {{one of the most}} difficult stories <b>for</b> <b>reporters</b> in Beijing to report. The New York Times stated that conflicting claims were difficult to assess [...] "ith propaganda streaming in from seemingly opposite ends of the universe... especially since the remaining Falun Gong practitioners have been driven underground." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{press pass}} (alternatively {{referred}} to as a press card or a journalist pass) grants some type of special privilege to journalists. [...] Some cards have recognized legal status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing journalist. [...] The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing agency, of which there are three major categories: news organizations, law-enforcement agencies, and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair like a corporate press conference). [...] Each type of card grants different authorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable <b>for</b> <b>reporters</b> to hold multiple press passes simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|Human Rights Watch (HRW) {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{incident}} was [...] {{of the most}} difficult stories <b>for</b> <b>reporters</b> in Beijing at the time to report on" [...] {{because of a lack of}} independent information available. The self-immolation victims were accessible only to reporters from China's state-run press; international media, and even the victims' family members, were barred from contacting them. A wide variety of opinions and interpretations of what may have happened then emerged: the event may have been set up by the government to frame Falun Gong; it may have been an authentic protest; the self-immolators could have been [...] "new or unschooled" [...] Falun Gong practitioners; and other views.|$|E
500|$|William Speirs Bruce {{was born}} at 43 Kensington Gardens Square [...] in London, the fourth child of Samuel Noble Bruce, a Scottish physician, and his Welsh wife Mary, née Lloyd. His middle name came from another branch of the family; its unusual spelling, as {{distinct}} from the more common [...] "Spiers", tended to cause problems <b>for</b> <b>reporters,</b> reviewers and biographers. William passed his early childhood in the family's London home at 18 Royal Crescent, Holland Park, {{under the tutelage of}} his grandfather, the Revd William Bruce. There were regular visits to nearby Kensington Gardens, and sometimes to the Natural History Museum; according to Samuel Bruce these outings first ignited young William's interest in life and nature.|$|E

Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, said, [...] "If the preview {{is representative of the}} finished film, Argentina can wipe away its tears." [...] Barry Walters of The San Francisco Examiner stated, [...] "Rather than showing the best moments from every scene, the trailer concentrates on a few that prove what Madonna, Banderas and Pryce can do musically. The results are impressive." [...] Evita premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on December 14, 1996, the Savoy Cinema in Dublin, Ireland, on December 19, 1996, and the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, London, on December 20, 1996.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{system used}} on The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man was {{originally}} prototyped for the attraction at Islands of Adventure, before being installed at Universal Studios Japan. It {{has since been}} utilized for [...] at Universal Studios Singapore, Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. The ride vehicles, developed by Oceaneering International, are mounted to a track-roaming platform that provides the forward motion to move the vehicle through each show scene. The yaw motor and a stewart platform with {{six degrees of freedom}} attaching it to the platform allows the vehicle to move 360 degrees at different angles along the track. The track switches were manufactured by Dynamic Structures. Each of the vehicles are themed as the Daily Bugles new [...] "Scoop" [...] vehicle <b>for</b> <b>reporters,</b> with each accommodating twelve riders. Each row of four riders is restrained by a single lapbar. This system was invented by Universal Creative employees Philip Hettema, William Mason, and Gary Goddard.

500|$|The Stork Club {{previously}} provided {{live entertainment}} but after Billingsley realized {{the reason people}} came to the club was to watch people, he abandoned the floor shows in favor of giving expensive gifts to regular customers of the club. A live band was provided in the main dining room for dancing. Billingsley had a keen sense for business. Before he purchased the building the Stork Club was in, the yearly rent for the space it occupied was $12,000. Billingsley rented out the hat and coat check area to a separate concession for $27,000 a year. [...] This paid the rent for the Stork Club, leaving $15,000 annually to cover bad checks. [...] When Ernest Hemingway wanted to pay his bill with a $100,000 check he received for the movie rights to For Whom the Bell Tolls, Billingsley {{told him he would}} be able to cash the check after the club closed at 4:00 a.m. He kept the Stork Club's name vivid in the minds of his patrons through mailing lists and a club news letter. Billingsley was also aware of the need for a good working relationship with the press; food and drink <b>for</b> <b>reporters</b> and photographers assigned to cover the Stork Club were on the house.|$|E

500|$|As the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{negotiations}} collapsed amid protests at {{a summit}} in Seattle, Trump {{appeared on the}} December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. [...] He said that the WTO was not [...] "necessarily fair" [...] to the United States, and argued that [...] "our best, and our smartest, and our brightest" [...] were not being used to negotiate the deal. [...] He renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley {{did not know how}} to negotiate. Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made hand sanitizer readily available <b>for</b> <b>reporters,</b> presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America We Deserve. [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president. [...] He received a large ovation when he proclaimed, [...] "people want to hear straight talk. We're tired of being bullied by these moron politicians." [...] Overall, The Weekly Standard praised Trump for his candor on the campaign trail.|$|E

[...] The case was argued February 23, 1972 and decided June 29 of the same year. [...] The reporter lost his case by a vote of 5-4.

2500|$|At {{this early}} stage of the war (and {{continuing}} to its end) the South Vietnamese people themselves were viewed by the media with the condescension, contempt, and disdain that characterized the American attitude toward them.
