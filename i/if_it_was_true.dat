500|$|Pfefferberg, {{one of the}} Schindlerjuden, made it his life's {{mission to}} tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg {{attempted}} to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with MGM in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through. In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> [...] "I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character," [...] he said. [...] "What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?" [...] Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years. In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.|$|E

2500|$|Xerneas {{is a large}} stag-like Pokémon {{adorned with}} glowing antlers and Yveltal is a large {{y-shaped}} bird. Part of a Legendary trio alongside Zygarde, the designs of Xerneas and Yveltal are rooted in Norse Mythology. Xerneas traces to the Eikþyrnir, a stag that stands atop Valhalla, while Yveltal is inspired by the Hræsvelgr, a giant eagle {{able to make the}} wind blow by flapping its wings. Some fans speculate that the two Pokémon also draw inspiration from the three layers of an organism in biology: neurons (Xerneas), blood vessels and muscles (Yveltal), and endodermal tissue (Zygarde). When asked about this theory by Kotaku, J.C. Smith of The Pokémon Company International stated he personally did not know <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> but called the idea [...] "fascinating and well thought out".|$|E
2500|$|Beyond general {{algorithms}} {{and their}} implementation on an abstract machine, concrete source code level choices {{can make a}} significant difference. For example, on early C compilers, while(1) was slower than for( [...] ;;) for an unconditional loop, because while(1) evaluated 1 and then had a conditional jump which tested <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> while for ( [...] ;;) had an unconditional jump [...] Some optimizations (such as this one) can nowadays be performed by optimizing compilers. This depends on the source language, the target machine language, and the compiler, and can be both difficult to understand or predict and changes over time; this is a key place where understanding of compilers and machine code can improve performance. Loop-invariant code motion and return value optimization are examples of optimizations that {{reduce the need for}} auxiliary variables and can even result in faster performance by avoiding round-about optimizations.|$|E

2500|$|As David Mitchell says at {{the start}} of the programme, [...] "the rules are very simple". The panel is made up of four players. In the game each of the panellists is given a subject on which they give a short lecture. Most of the lecture is {{composed}} of lies, but during the course of the speech the lecturer must try to smuggle five true statements past the rest of the panel. The challenging panellists must buzz in when they believe that what the lecturer is saying is true. They must state what they believe the fact was. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> the challenger is awarded one point. If it was a lie, then they are deducted one point. One point is given to the lecturer for each truth they smuggle successfully without it being detected at the end of the lecture. The winner is the panellist with the most points. A perfect score is 20 points (by hiding all five of their truths, and spotting the five truths in all three of the other players' routines without making any wrong challenges), plus additional points for [...] "unintentional" [...] truths revealed during the monologue. However, nobody has reached this score yet, and in fact many contests have been amusingly low scoring, with most panellists having a negative number of points due to high number of guesses. On occasion, panellists have included more than five truths during in their talk, often unintentionally, although Jo Brand included an extra fact about Henry VIII as she thought it was so fantastic.|$|E
2500|$|The prosecution, to show {{a pattern}} of behavior, claimed they would present evidence, {{admissible}} under California Evidence Code 1108, that Jackson had molested five boys in the past. Three {{of the people they}} named, Macaulay Culkin, Brett Barnes, and Wade Robson, all testified that they were long-time family friends of Jackson and had slept in his bed, but that Jackson never molested them or did anything sexual with them. Culkin said he'd [...] "never seen him do anything improper with anybody" [...] and called the allegations [...] "absolutely ridiculous," [...] while Barnes said they made him [...] "very mad." [...] All three men described the time they spent in Jackson's 2-story bedroom as childish fun, with video games, movies, and many people sleeping in the room at one time. Culkin added that he'd [...] "never seen [...] do anything improper with anybody" [...] and that he was shocked the prosecution would put on witnesses who said Jackson molested him without even asking Culkin <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> The witnesses, three ex-employees at Neverland Ranch who testified that they'd seen Jackson molest these young men, were Ralph Chacon, Kassim Abdool, and Adrian McManus. These three belonged to a group of five ex-employees who had sued Michael Jackson for wrongful termination in 1995. [...] Jackson, counterclaiming that they had stolen property and sold some of it to tabloids, won the suit and was awarded $60,000 in damages; the ex-employees were fined for lying in court and were ordered to pay $1.4million for Jackson's legal fees.|$|E
