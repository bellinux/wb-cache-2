5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications <b>for</b> <b>quality</b> of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak is graded <b>for</b> <b>quality,</b> {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{measurement}} the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency.

From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical quality is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern <b>for</b> <b>quality,</b> and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D.

The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|Americium-241 {{has been}} used as a {{portable}} source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409keV gamma ray emissions from 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as <b>for</b> <b>quality</b> control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.|$|E

Differences between arid and non-arid landscape characteristics, soil, topography, vegetation, climate and hydrology and their effect on buffers <b>for</b> water <b>quality</b> were also researched.

5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation <b>for</b> <b>quality</b> and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

The company had lost $58 million in 1998 and was predicted to lose over $90 million in 1999. Baker responded by cutting the workforce by 90 people, increasing premiums, establishing new contracts with Massachusetts physicians, reassessing the company's financial structure, and outsourcing its information technology.

5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand <b>for</b> <b>quality</b> accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E
