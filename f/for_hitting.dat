5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term gun {{is often used}} incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and a flat trajectory, useful <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> the sides of targets such as walls, as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and fire indirectly, lobbing shells up and over obstacles to hit the target from above.|$|E

5|$|Bottomley {{also holds}} the single-season {{record for most}} unassisted double plays by a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley {{is also known as}} the only man to be sued <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he was not looking. He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley was the second player in {{baseball}} history to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first) and the first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{made his}} MLB debut on September 2, 2002 against the Texas Rangers. He was {{starting}} {{in place of}} Roy Oswalt, who was serving a suspension <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> a batter with a pitch. He allowed two runs in 2⅔ innings and got the loss in his only start that year. He got his second decision in a 5–2 loss to the San Francisco Giants on September 28. In the game, the Giants clinched a playoff spot, and Barry Bonds {{hit a home run}} off Robertson into McCovey Cove to seal the game for them. He finished the season with a 6.52 ERA in 9⅔ innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The American League {{defeated}} the National League by {{a score of}} 5–4. Ichiro Suzuki won the MVP award for the game <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star history. As per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the American League champion (which eventually came to be the Boston Red Sox) received home field advantage in the 2007 World Series. The victory was the 10th consecutive (excluding the 2002 tie) for the AL, and their 11-game unbeaten streak is only beaten by the NL's 11-game winning streak from 1972 to 1982 in All-Star history.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a {{standard}} match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when {{he was able to}} execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won the match after Guerrero was disqualified <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> him with a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|Garvey, Leonard, and Albert Pujols hit four {{home runs}} in their winning series—Garvey in his first win. Adam Kennedy won the 2002 ALCS MVP <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> 3 {{home runs in}} 5 games; he had hit 7 {{during the regular season}} and hit 80 in his 14-year career. David Ortiz had 11 runs batted in (RBI) during the 2004 ALCS and Iván Rodríguez had 10 during the 2003 NLCS—the only two players to reach double-digit RBI in the series {{in the history of the}} award. From the pitcher's mound, Steve Avery threw 16 innings without giving up a run in the 1991 NLCS, and John Smoltz amassed 19 strikeouts the {{following}} year. Liván Hernández won the 1997 NLCS MVP after winning his only start and earning a win out of the bullpen in relief; he struck out 16 in 10 innings. Daniel Murphy won the 2015 NLCS MVP after hitting home runs in six consecutive games, setting a major league record.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. The match began with Angle and Cena locking up, leading to Angle taking Cena {{down with a}} {{headlock}} takeover. Cena countered many attacks by Angle {{and was able to}} reverse the ankle lock. Cena attempted an FU but Angle delivered an Angle Slam. Eric Bischoff came down the ramp and cheered for Angle, who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena. Cena rolled out of the move, grabbed the championship belt, which Bischoff had brought with him, and hit Angle with it. The referee saw this and called for the bell. As a result, Cena was disqualified <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> Angle with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, Angle attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on Angle.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, Cloutier was re-signed to a one-year, $2.5 million {{contract}} on July 15, 2003. Nearly two {{months into the}} subsequent season, Cloutier recorded his 100th career NHL win, making 31 saves in a 3–1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on November 27, 2003. As the season progressed, Cloutier suffered several more injuries, {{the first of which}} was a groin injury in December 2003 that sidelined him for three games. He missed three more games before the season ended with cases of the flu and a lower-body injury. On February 14, 2004, he was fined $1,000 by the league <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> opposing forward Ronald Petrovický in the face with his blocker during a game against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} the Survivor Series match between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven) versus Team Triple H (World Heavyweight Champion Triple H, Batista, Edge, and Snitsky).

Jericho was eliminated by Edge after a spear. Edge was eliminated by Orton after an RKO. Triple H was eliminated by Orton after an RKO, leaving Orton {{as the sole}} survivor.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} spotlight shone {{briefly on}} Feldman on August 16, 2006, when he sparked a violent bench-clearing brawl {{in the ninth}} inning of a game between the Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Tensions between the two division rivals were already high after two Ranger starting pitchers — Adam Eaton and Vicente Padilla — had been ejected in previous games that month for throwing at Angel hitters, along with Texas manager Buck Showalter. Before Feldman took the mound in relief, on a night with a game-time temperature of 101 degrees, two Angel pitchers (Kevin Gregg and Brendan Donnelly) had already been thrown out of the game <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> Ranger batters, and Angel manager Mike Scioscia and acting manager/bench coach Ron Roenicke had been ejected as well.|$|E

5|$|With {{the match}} {{entering}} extra {{time and the}} golden goal rule applying, both sides had chances to score the decisive goal. In the second minute, Henry beat two defenders to enter the opponent's area, but his shot went just across the goal. Shortly after, Hagi received a straight red card, after game footage showed the player holding and striking Adams in the back; the Arsenal captain was awarded a yellow card <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> Hagi during the altercation. As a result, Arsenal began to put the Turkish side under pressure by creating more chances through Henry, who almost won the game when he directed a header on goal from a long cross by Parlour, which Taffarel managed to keep out. Overmars's effort was then blocked by a Galatasaray defender.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{six feet}} tall, O'Neill was {{compared}} to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because {{of his ability to}} score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> across the line early in his innings.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Rockets {{for a second}} time in as many weeks, this time in Cleveland. The Rockets opened the scoring with a 74-yard pass from quarterback Jesse Freitas to {{receiver}} Eddie Prokop in the first four minutes of the game, and added a field goal by Jim McCarthy {{near the end of the}} second quarter. The Browns did not score in the first half, but came back to win the game in the second. Rockets defenders were double-teaming Cleveland's ends, and the Browns adjusted by sending halfbacks out to receive deep passes. Cleveland halfbacks Dub Jones and Bill Boedeker both caught long touchdown passes from Graham in the third quarter. Boedeker ran in for another touchdown in the fourth quarter to make the final score 21–10. As in the previous game, there were several cases of rough play: tackle Lou Rymkus was ejected from the game <b>for</b> <b>hitting</b> Jim Pearcy of the Rockets. A Rockets player picked up a handful of sand from the stadium's baseball infield and threw it in Mac Speedie's face during the game, temporarily blinding him. Hirsch was accidentally kicked by a Browns player and suffered a skull fracture.|$|E
