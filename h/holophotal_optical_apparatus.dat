500|$|The cost of {{the tower}} and cottages was nearly £24,000, £19,000 for the {{construction}} of the tower and £5,000 for the <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus,</b> a Chance Bros. 1st order bivalve dioptric Fresnel lens with 700 prisms ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{base of the}} tower, [...] in {{diameter}} and [...] high, was constructed of bolted cast iron segments. Both the tower and the dwellings were constructed of timber frame, clad in galvanized iron. The original <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> was a second order lens.|$|R
50|$|All the {{external}} {{walls of the}} structure are cement rendered and painted white.

40|$|Background: In {{cases of}} meningioma {{surrounding}} the <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus,</b> this {{study sought to}} {{reduce the incidence of}} radiation-induced optical neuropathy resulting from gamma knife surgery (GKS) by dividing the treatment volume into 2 or 3 fractions. Methods: Four patients with a large skull base meningioma (1 male and 3 females; median age: 42 years; range: 33 – 43  yrs) were treated using volume-staged GKS. In stage I, the large basal part of the tumor (13. 2  mL; range: 3. 9 – 54. 7  mL) was treated with a marginal dose of 13. 5  Gy (range: 12 – 15  Gy). In stage II, treatment focused on the smaller upper portion of the tumor located close to the <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> (4. 3  mL; range: 1. 5 – 16. 2  mL), and the marginal dose was 9  Gy (range: 8 – 10  Gy). Results: All patients tolerated the treatments well, and tumors regressed over a median follow-up period of 100. 5 months (range: 42 – 122  mos). Specifically, a 34 – 46 % reduction in tumor volume was observed. All four patients presented improvements in the neurological deficits observed prior to GKS treatment, albeit to varying degrees. No adverse effects of radiation or new visual deterioration were observed during the follow-up period. Furthermore, no evidence of new endocrine dysfunction or new cranial nerve neuropathy was observed within a follow-up period of 100. 5 months. Conclusion: The application of volume-staged GKS using snowman-shape design appears to be an effective approach to control tumor growth when treating benign meningiomas surrounding the <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus.</b> This approach enables the application of higher radiation dosages to facilitate tumor control while still preserving optic nerve function...|$|R

50|$|More recently, such {{directions}} {{have turned}} out in a reflection on the peculiar status of images in our time, on the possible ethical and political implications of our relationship with them, and on the ontological dimension of the “Being in common” that would find its expression in such implications. This reflection is currently devoted to examine the influence of screens - understood as <b>optical</b> <b>apparatuses</b> by now dominant - on our collective and personal individuation.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} of respected professors of the University of Jena, the government in Weimar moved slowly with the request.  Zeiss was required to sit a written exam in August and finally, in November, received his “concession for the construction and sale of mechanical and <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{as well as the}} establishment of an atelier for fine machinery in Jena.”  After payment of a fee and swearing a ceremonial oath before the Jena authorities, everything was ready.|$|R
50|$|Several of Schrepfer's {{associates}} - including Wurmb, DuBosc, Hoffman and Von Bischoffswerder - {{managed to}} become leaders of Rosicrucian circles {{a few years}} later and some of them were among the founders of the new Mason lodge Balduin in Leipzig in 1776. Von Bisschofswerder later had some influence on Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia through a Rosicrucian lodge and ghost-raising sessions. It has been suggested that he owned and used Schrepfer's <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> to conjure up spirits.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{the street}} is {{commonly}} associated with opticians and makers of <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> such as microscopes and telescopes. A statue of the engineer James Henry Greathead was erected in 1994 in the road beside the Royal Exchange, which lies within the ward. Underneath the modern pavement is the world's first underground public toilet, which opened in 1855. Users were charged a standard fee of 1d, reputedly giving rise to the saying to [...] "spend a penny".|$|R
5000|$|Several optical {{techniques}} were explored and discarded over many months.

40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} a {{nonlinear}} <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{in which the}} direction of asymmetric steering is controllable within the apparatus, rather than by adding noise to measurements. Using a nondegenerate parametric oscillator with an injected signal field, we show how the directionality and extent of the steering can be readily controlled for output modes that can be up to one octave apart. The two down-converted modes, which exhibit the greater violations of the steering inequalities, can also be controlled to exhibit asymmetric steering in some regimes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} optical {{birefringence}} measurement is presented. It uses an electro-optic modulator {{for the high}} frequency modulation of polarization of the laser beam. The developed <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> exhibits high sensitivity. It is able to measure very small birefringence of samples down to 10 - 3 rad. The accuracy and sensitivity of the method was checked by measurement of calibrated Soleil – Babinet compensator. Method can be also used for online and accurate measurement of an optical components birefringence. This application was developed with the aim to measure Cotton-Mouton effect in air and nitrogen. ...|$|R
40|$|We prove that, {{under the}} {{condition}} of validity of the Fresnel approximation, diffraction and interference for a wave traveling in the z-direction may be {{described in terms of}} the spreading in time of the transverse (x,y) -wave packet.

50|$|Dallmeyer's {{position}} in this workshop {{appears to have}} been an unpleasant one, and led him to take, for a time, employment as French and German correspondent for a commercial firm. After a year he was, however, re-engaged by Ross as scientific adviser, and was entrusted with the testing and finishing of the highest class of <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus.</b> This appointment led to his marriage with Ross's second daughter, Hannah, and to the inheritance, at Ross's death (1859), of a third of his employer's large fortune and the telescope manufacturing portion of the business.|$|R
40|$|Dispersed {{reference}} interferometry (DRI) is {{a potentially}} useful technique for {{applications such as}} absolute displacement, surface topography and film thickness measurement. A bulk optic implementation of a short coherence dispersed reference interferometer is described with the chromatic dispersion applied using two matched transmission gratings in one arm.

An operating principle is presented and validation provided through empirical data from <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus.</b> We present experimental results for the resolution, linearity and repeatability of the investigated interferometer apparatus...|$|R
50|$|In most darkrooms, an enlarger, an <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{similar to}} a slide projector, that {{projects}} {{the image of a}} negative onto a base, finely controls the focus, intensity and duration of light, is used for printmaking. A sheet of photographic paper is exposed to the enlarged image from the negative. When making black-and-white prints, a safelight is commonly used to illuminate the work area. Since the majority of black-and-white papers are sensitive to only blue, or to blue and green light, a red- or amber-colored light can be safely used without exposing the paper.|$|R
