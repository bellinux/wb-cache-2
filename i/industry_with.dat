40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{monetary}} policy on the equity premium and the cross-section of stock returns in a general equilibrium framework. Monetary policy is conducted using an interest-rate policy rule reacting to inflation and output. Product-price rigidities in the production sector generate an equity premium {{that depends on the}} policy. The model predicts that (i) <b>industries</b> <b>with</b> lower price rigidities earn higher expected returns than <b>industries</b> <b>with</b> higher price rigidities and (ii) the difference in expected returns declines with more aggressive monetary policies. We provide an explanation for these results based on countercyclical markups. Markups of <b>industries</b> <b>with</b> low price rigidities are less variable than markups of <b>industries</b> <b>with</b> high price rigidities. When the marginal utility of consumption is high, markups in <b>industries</b> <b>with</b> high rigidities increase by more than markups in <b>industries</b> <b>with</b> low rigidities. As a result, profits of <b>industries</b> <b>with</b> low rigidities are more sensitive to policy shocks, and investors require a higher compensation for holding stocks on these industries. When the response of monetary policy to inflation is more aggressive, the markup variability reduces, and the difference in expected returns between high and low rigidity industries decreases. We find empirical evidence supporting the model’s predictions...|$|R

5|$|Farming has {{traditionally}} been the basis of Cardiganshire's economy, with dairying and stock-rearing being the main occupations. Before the first railway was built in 1866, the stock used to be herded over the mountains to England, where Rugby, Northampton and London were important destinations. At one {{time there was a}} sizeable mining industry in Cardiganshire, but the reserves of lead, silver and zinc became unprofitable to mine by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Shipping was also important in the county, with coal and lime being imported in coastal vessels, and mineral ores and oak bark for tanning being exported. Shipbuilding was an important <b>industry</b> <b>with</b> most of Wales' sailing vessels being built in Cardiganshire.|$|E

5|$|From the 18th century onwards, Royton's {{economy was}} closely tied {{with that of}} Britain's textile {{manufacture}} during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the cotton spinning sector. However, Royton also lies on the Oldham Coalfield, and coal mining had an economic role for the area in {{as early as the}} 17th century. Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200collieries in the town. Royton's pits were prone to repeated flooding, and owners began to close them. Coal production began to decline even before that of the local spinning <b>industry,</b> <b>with</b> the last pit closing in 1902.|$|E

5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain <b>industry,</b> <b>with</b> falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E
