40|$|Safety {{control of}} {{concrete}} dams is required {{due to the}} potential great loss of life and property in case of dam failure. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to <b>feed</b> <b>back</b> the operational <b>control</b> loads for concrete dam displacement using the maximum entropy method. The proposed method is not aimed at a judgement about the safety conditions of the dam. When a strong trend-line effect is evident, the method should be carefully applied. In these cases, the hydrostatic and temperature effects are added to the irreversible displacements, thus maximum operational loads should be accordingly reduced. The probability density function for the extreme load effect component of dam displacement can be selected by employing the principle of maximum entropy, which is effective to construct the least subjective probability density distribution merely given the moments information from the stated data. The critical load effect component in the warning criterion can be determined through the corresponding cumulative distribution function obtained by the maximum entropy method. Then the control loads feedback of concrete dam displacement is realized by the proposed warning criterion. The proposed method is applied to a concrete dam. A comparison of the results shows that the maximum entropy method can <b>feed</b> <b>back</b> rational <b>control</b> loads for the dam displacement. The control loads diagram obtained can be a straightforward and visual tool to the operation and management department of the concrete dam. The result from the proposed method is recommended to be used due to minimal subjectivity...|$|R

40|$|Contractile forces {{generated}} by the actomyosin cytoskeleton within individual cells collectively generate tissue-level force during epithelial morphogenesis. During Drosophila mesoderm invagination, pulsed actomyosin meshwork contractions and a ratchet-like stabilization of cell shape drive apical constriction. Here, we investigate how contractile forces are integrated across the tissue. Reducing adherens junction (AJ) levels or ablating actomyosin meshworks causes tissue-wide epithelial tears, which release tension that is predominantly oriented along the anterior–posterior (a-p) embryonic axis. Epithelial tears allow cells normally elongated along the a-p axis to constrict isotropically, which suggests that apical constriction generates anisotropic epithelial tension that <b>feeds</b> <b>back</b> to <b>control</b> cell shape. Epithelial tension requires the transcription factor Twist, which stabilizes apical myosin II, promoting {{the formation of a}} supracellular actomyosin meshwork in which radial actomyosin fibers are joined end-to-end at spot AJs. Thus, pulsed actomyosin contractions require a supracellular, tensile meshwork to transmit cellular forces to the tissue level during morphogenesis.

The latter case is dependent merely on bed fluid dynamics and could be treated by using the methodology of the residence time distribution (RTD) theory. Accordingly, a specific methodology is proposed, as follows: the fermenter has been modelled as a reactor network involving a combination of zones representing basic ideal flow patterns. The methodology is based on the wide-spread experimental gas tracer technique extended by a new systemic identification approach. The approach is based on a Mellin-modification of the Laplace transform over the relevant equations. The method allows zero-time solutions for identification analysis. Unlike the diffusion model approximation, the technique considered allows exact approximation of the RTD curves with circulation.
