25|$|There are {{speculative}} {{theories that}} claim inertia {{is produced by}} the combined mass of the universe (e.g., Mach's principle), which implies that the rest frame of the universe might be preferred by conventional measurements of natural law. If confirmed, this would imply special relativity is an approximation to a more general theory, but since the relevant comparison would (by definition) be outside the observable universe, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> (much less construct) experiments to test this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The murder remains unsolved. Under torture, the {{surviving}} Hashshashin claimed that Richard {{was behind the}} killing, though this is impossible to prove. A less likely suspect was Humphrey IV of Toron, Isabella's first husband. Saladin's involvement has also been alleged, but as Conrad {{was in the middle}} of negotiations with him, but this also seems unlikely as Saladin himself apparently had no love for the Hashshashin.

25|$|As {{with other}} criteria, {{stability}} {{is the critical}} consideration in evaluating the effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. Orbital eccentricity {{is the difference between}} a planet's farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet's surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the freezing point and boiling point of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth's oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> {{life as we know it}} having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the temperature sensitivity. The Earth's orbit is almost wholly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of Mercury) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.|$|E

Sails were not preserved in the specimens of D.incisivus and D.gigas that Cope described in his 1878 paper, but elongated spines were present in the D.rectiformis specimen he described. Cope commented on the purpose of the sail in 1886, writing, [...] "The utility <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine.</b> Unless the animal had aquatic habits, and swam on its back, the crest or fin must have been in the way of active movements... The limbs are not long enough nor the claws acute enough to demonstrate arboreal habits, as in the existing genus Basilicus, where a similar crest exists." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2015 Drax {{announced}} {{it would not be}} making any further investments [...] into the CCS scheme after completion of the feasibility study because negative changes to government support for renewable energy had made the project too financially risky, plus drops in the company's share price due to the same uncertainty had reduced Drax's ability to raise funds. Front End Engineering Design was expected to continue under Alstom and BOC with the project still being hosted at Drax. In late 2015 the UK Government withdrew its potential financial support for CCS projects – up to £1billion of funding, reversing support promised in the governing party's 2015 election manifesto.

500|$|Core intent {{would be}} where the {{defendant}} acted either to cause at least grievous bodily harm to the victim, or where the defendant acted to achieve some other aim, where the death caused was a necessary means to that other end. In general, the jury is directed that [...] "intent" [...] is to be taken as meaning what it does in ordinary life, and that the judge should not attempt to define it in other terms. However, following R v Woollin, {{it is also possible}} for a jury to convict if they [...] "feel sure that death or serious injury was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) {{as a result of the}} defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case" [...] known as [...] "oblique intent". Despite appearing to present an alternative to the primary, core sense of intent, courts have generally seen Woollin as allowing the jury to infer core intent from the evidence of virtual certainty. The jury are entitled to convict in these circumstances, and they should not be directed that they, finding virtual certainty, must convict. However, if it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> circumstances where a jury would find virtual certainty but not convict, which would support this complicating factor.
