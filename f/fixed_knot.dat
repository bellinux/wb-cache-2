40|$|For random knots, {{we discuss}} {{correlation}} functions and scattering functions, which are fundamental in the statistical mechanics of ring polymers. Random knots gives a theoretical {{model for a}} ring polymer with <b>fixed</b> <b>knot</b> in solution at the θ temperature. We introduce a model function for the probability distribution of distance between two nodes in random polygon with <b>fixed</b> <b>knot.</b> We then perform numerical simulation of random knots, and confirm that the model function gives good fitting curves to the simulation data. From the model function we obtain an analytic formula for the correlation functions of random knots. It also gives an analytic formula for the scattering functions of random knots. We thus obtain an exact description of topological correlations, which show nontrivial topological entropic effects. The result should be important in future applications to polymer physics. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the average size of self-avoiding polygons (SAP) with a <b>fixed</b> <b>knot</b> is much larger than that of no topological {{constraint}} if the excluded volume is small {{and the number of}} segments is large. We call it topological swelling. We argue an "enhancement" of the scaling exponent for random polygons with a <b>fixed</b> <b>knot.</b> We study them systematically through SAP consisting of hard cylindrical segments with various different values of the radius of segments. Here we mean by the average size the mean-square radius of gyration. Furthermore, we show numerically that the equilibrium length of a composite knot is given by the sum of those of all constituent prime knots. Here we define the equilibrium length of a knot by such a number of segments that topological entropic repulsions are balanced with the knot complexity in the average size. The additivity suggests the local knot picture. Comment: 33 pages, 7 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1704. 0751...|$|E

If we assume that p(n) (tau) similar to n(alpha(tau) - 3) mu(tau) (n), where mu(tau) is the growth constant of polygons of knot type tau, and alpha(tau) is the entropic exponent of polygons of knot type tau, then our numerical data {{are consistent with the}} relation alpha(tau) = alpha(phi) + N-f, where phi is the unknot and N-f is the number of prime factors of the knot tau.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a two-dimensional lattice {{model for the}} description of knotted polymer rings. A polymer configuration is modeled by a closed polygon drawn on the square diagonal lattice, with possible crossings describing pairs of strands of polymer passing {{on top of each}} other. Each polygon configuration can be viewed as the two- dimensional projection of a particular knot. We study numerically the statistics of large polygons with a <b>fixed</b> <b>knot</b> type, using a generalization of the BFACF algorithm for self-avoiding walks. This new algorithm incorporates both the displacement of crossings and the three types of Reidemeister transformations preserving the knot topology. Its ergodicity within a <b>fixed</b> <b>knot</b> type is not proven here rigorously but strong arguments in favor of this ergodicity are given together with a tentative sketch of proof. Assuming this ergodicity, we obtain numerically the following results for the statistics of knotted polygons: In the limit of a low crossing fugacity, we find a localization along the polygon of all the primary factors forming the knot. Increasing the crossing fugacity gives rise to a transition from a self-avoiding walk to a branched polymer behavior. Comment: 36 pages, 30 figures, latex, epsf. to appear in J. Phys. A: Math.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{efficacy}} of new, innovative, original instruments, including a left atrial retractor, silicon annuloplasty ring sizer, modified Cosgrove aortic clamp, and reusable clip for <b>fixing</b> <b>knots</b> of polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex; WL Gore & Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz) suture, to allow surgical exposure {{in an ideal}} operative setting of mini-mitral valve repair surgery was verified. MethodsSince 1998, {{a great deal of}} innovation has contributed to establishing mitral valve repair via right minithoracotomy as a routine surgical approach for mitral valve insufficiency in 252 cases. During the last 2 years, a newly launched left atrial retractor system attachable to the minithoracotomy spreader has been used. An additional retractor for the posterior wall of the left atrium was attached to the minithoracotomy spreader. The retractor moves flexibly and can be fixed in any favorable position to realize optimal exposure of the mitral valve. A 5 blade size was available depending on the left atrial size and target legion. By using the smallest size, even papillary muscles were exposed easily and clearly. Furthermore, a flexible silicon ring sizer, which could easily pass thorough a narrow working port without tissue damage, was used for sizing the annuloplasty ring. For the surgical technique, multiple chordal reconstructions by the loop technique with polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex CV- 5 sutures) were applied. A reusable clip for <b>fixing</b> <b>knots</b> made it easy to tie the Gore-Tex suture in the correct position without slipping. ResultsNo operative mortality occurred. There were 2 conversions to sternotomy for correction of aortic dissection (1) and for coronary artery bypass grafting (1). There were 2 early reoperations for failure of mitral valve repair. The mean aortic crossclamp time was 163. 5 ± 41. 6 minutes. Annuloplasty with a ring or band was performed in all cases except one. The loop technique was used in 173 cases. Among them, a combination of the loop technique and resection and suture technique was used in 56 cases.
