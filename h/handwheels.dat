2500|$|Ben-my-Chree {{was driven}} by three Parsons steam {{turbines}} which were built under licence by Vickers Sons and Maxim, the turbines developing 14,000 shaft horsepower, thereby resulting in a designed service speed of 24.5 knots. The turbines were so arranged so as to work in series, with one high-pressure ahead turbine driving the centre shaft, and two low-pressure ahead turbines driving their respective wing shaft. Astern turbines were incorporated in the casing, with each low-pressure turbine fitted with valves to control the admission of steam for ahead and astern working. These manoeuvring valves were independent of the high-pressure turbine which would run idle when the ship was manoeuvring. The valve gear was arranged for easy operation and was placed at the forward end of the high-pressure turbine. The main valves were of the vertical equilibrium type operated by large <b>handwheels.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Hanriot 1909 {{monoplane}} had an uncovered [...] rectangular-section wire-braced wooden fuselage with deeply cambered parallel-chord wings. The {{main undercarriage}} {{consisted of a}} pair of skids which carried a pair of independently sprung wheels mounted on a steel cross tube, the skids being carried on two pairs of struts which converged inwards, the aft pair being continued above the fuselage to form an inverted V cabane to which the wing bracing and warping wires were attached. The front struts terminated at the engine bearers, which were midway between the upper and lower longerons. Tail surfaces consisted of a tailplane and elevator mounted on top of the fuselage and a fixed fin mounted under the fuselage with the attached rudder underneath the horizontal tail surfaces. The aircraft was controlled with a pair of <b>handwheels</b> {{on either side of the}} cockpit operating wing warping and elevator, and foot-pedals operating the rudder.|$|E

50|$|Electric motors {{became so}} common that Singer made {{provision}} for them: the model 127/128 'modernized' versions included mounting lugs for a motor, whereas earlier models {{had to be}} drilled and tapped. Some 127/128 machines were even given motors right at the factory, and of those, a few models used a smaller lighter solid <b>handwheel</b> instead of the larger heavier spoked <b>handwheel</b> used on machines sold as treadles. The spoked <b>handwheel</b> is better for treadles because its larger inertia keeps it spinning longer, whereas the lighter solid <b>handwheel</b> is better for motors because its smaller inertia causes it to start and stop more quickly.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>handwheel</b> {{is one of}} {{the primary}} control {{mechanisms}} of automobile thus interaction between the <b>handwheel</b> and the driver is critical to safety. The driver applies forces that direct the vehicle while the <b>handwheel</b> communicates feedback information to the driver of the forces experience by the car within its environment. The <b>handwheel</b> also provides a predictable mechanical feel to the driver to allow smooth and safe control. Many researchers tried to reproduce this feeling by creating steer-by-wire systems. This paper explores this new concept of <b>handwheel</b> and it describes the modeling steps of the components including the restitution mechanism for force feedback and its various links with the vehicle lateral dynamics and the pneumatic contacts. The aim is to explore the possibility to combine a braking device within the steer-by-wire system in order to provide a more suitable and ergonomic device to the driver...|$|R

50|$|The M5 {{director}} {{is used to}} determine or estimate the altitude or slant range of the aerial target. Two observers then track the aircraft through a pair of telescopes {{on opposite sides of}} the director. The trackers turn <b>handwheels</b> to keep the crosshairs of their respective telescope on the aircraft image. The rotation of the <b>handwheels</b> provides the director with data on the aircraft's change in elevation and change in azimuth in relation to the director. As the mechanisms inside the director respond to the rotation of the <b>handwheels,</b> a firing solution is mechanically calculated and continuously updated for as long as the target is tracked. Essentially, the director predicts future position based on the aircraft's present location and how it is moving.|$|E

50|$|The {{weapon was}} of {{conventional}} design and broke down into three loads (smooth bore barrel, bipod, baseplate) for transport. Attached to the bipod were a traversing <b>handwheel</b> and a cross-leveling <b>handwheel</b> below the elevating mechanism. A panoramic sight was {{mounted on the}} traversing mechanism yoke for fine adjustments. A line on the tube {{could be used for}} rough laying.|$|R
5000|$|For example, the <b>handwheel</b> of {{a typical}} CNC control will move any of the slides of the machine by one minimum increment, such as 1 {{micrometre}} or 1 ten-thousandth of an inch, for each pulse, and the <b>handwheel</b> will give one ratchet-like click or other haptic click to confirm to the user that a single increment occurred. Several selector switches control the <b>handwheel's</b> output: one allows each of the machine's axes (X, Y, Z, and so on) to be selected in turn; another shifts through several ranges of output, so that one click of the wheel is either one minimum increment, 10 times that, or 100 times that.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith {{the desire}} bring more comfort and safety to {{disabled}} drivers, new technologies have been deemed {{appropriate for the}} development of innovative driving assistance. This paper describes the possibility of integrating these technologies {{for the development of}} a positive interacting system with disabled drivers. In this context, we suggest a new solution for a braking device that aims at helping paraplegic drivers: Integrated in a steer-by-wire <b>handwheel,</b> the driver has only to press on the <b>handwheel</b> to brake the vehicle. The device is equipped with automatic releasing of the <b>handwheel</b> movement when braking is no longer required. The proposed solution brings many advantages in terms of safety and ergonomics. Indeed, this device will enable the driver to brake and to accelerate while continuously keeping the hands on the <b>handwheel.</b> This gives the driver a significant gain in braking time. The use of an active braking feedback also provides a progressive and intuitive proportioning brake. This concept opens prospects to active braking assistance. To concretize this idea, theoretical and simulation studies are carried out for the main processes of the device. A prototype has also been developed...|$|R
50|$|The Mounting Barbette Mark V (the {{original}} mounting with Mark IX and X guns) gave {{a maximum}} elevation of 15 degrees, and maximum range of 21,000 yards. This and some modified to Mark VI (30 degrees and 29,500 yards) were manually powered, the projectile and propelling charge were manually hoisted to loading level, the projectile manually loaded and rammed, and traverse and elevation were by <b>handwheels.</b> There was an elevated platform around the breech {{area for the}} gun detachment commander (No 1) and some detachment members, and a gun shield to the front. The ordnance and mounting together weighed some 125 tons, they were well balanced and the <b>handwheels</b> needed very little effort to move the gun.|$|E

50|$|The three radar {{operators}} sat at consoles {{mounted on}} the pedestal just below the antenna cross-arm, each with their own oscilloscope display. One controlled the azimuth, another the elevation, and the third the range. Pointing the antenna was controlled by rotating large <b>handwheels,</b> the range being reported by a similar wheel.|$|E
5000|$|Range {{information}} {{was taken from}} the elevation array, and worked, as it did for most radars of the era, by triggering the trace on an [...] "A-line" [...] oscilloscope and read against a scale at the bottom. A second blip was also generated by equipment attached to the rangefinder's <b>handwheel.</b> By rotating the <b>handwheel</b> until the reference blip overlapped the one returned from the antenna, the timing could be read from the wheel. Range accuracy was about plus or minus 200 yards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{realization}} of the <b>handwheel</b> function is a key problem for development of numerical control system of micro milling machine. This paper introduced the interface specifications and hardware connecting methods of <b>handwheel</b> NK 100 AB 2, developed control program based on PMAC (Programmable Multi-Axis Controller) and industrial personal computer, finally achieved the function of axes selecting and the feed rate selecting. Based on the traditional edge detector tool setting method, an improved tool setting method is proposed. The inverted micro milling cutter hilt is used to replace the traditional edge detector, which avoids the opposite reamer error caused by the irregular cutter blade shape, finally, tool setting function is achieved through the collecting of electrical signal. The research will provide a useful reference for the {{realization of}} <b>handwheel</b> and tool setting of micro milling machine based on PMAC...|$|R

50|$|The Flakvierling weapon {{consisted}} of quad-mounted 2 cm Flak 38 AA guns with collapsing seats, folding handles, and ammunition racks. The mount had a triangular base with a jack at each leg for levelling the gun. The tracker traversed and elevated the mount manually using two <b>handwheels.</b> When raised, the weapon measured 307 cm (10 feet 1 inch) high.|$|E
50|$|The Gebirgsflak 38 {{was fired}} using a foot pedal {{on the right}} front of the flak mount. The gunlayer’s seat was mounted behind the gun and rotated with the mount in traverse. Elevating and {{traversing}} of the gun were manual using <b>handwheels</b> located {{on the right and}} left sides of the mount respectively. There are two speeds, high and low, in both elevating and traversing.|$|E
