5|$|In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) convinces the Xindi-Aquatics to aid him in {{his fight}} against the Xindi-Reptilians and <b>Insectoids</b> {{alliance}} to prevent Earth's destruction by their superweapon. In {{the midst of a}} battle between the two Xindi factions, an away team is sent to rescue Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), previously captured by the Reptilians. However, the superweapon departs for Earth, with Archer in pursuit on board a Xindi vessel.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{also are}} quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction <b>insectoids,</b> {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Xindi Council meet {{to discuss}} the {{progress}} of Enterprise. Although the Reptilians and <b>Insectoids</b> want to attack the humans, Degra advises them {{to continue with the}} plan to build the superweapon. On Enterprise, Sub-Commander T'Pol continues to help Commander Tucker with Vulcan neuropressure sessions. The ship, seeking the formula for a compound to reinforce its hull against spatial anomalies, then approaches a planet with a vast floating alien bazaar. Captain Archer leads an away team to meet with B'Rat Ud, a chemist who they have met before.|$|E
50|$|During the Monsters Unleashed storyline, Googam and {{his father}} Goom are among the monsters that are shown {{falling out of the}} sky near San Diego. Googam {{struggled}} in his fight against an <b>Insectoid</b> Leviathon causing his father to mock him. Luckily, Googam was saved by Doctor Strange who teleported the <b>Insectoid</b> Leviathon away. Three days later, Googam stormed the Sanctum Sanctorum to get revenge on Doctor Strange for humiliating him only for Doctor Strange to persuade him to help track down the <b>Insectoid</b> Leviathon. They find it in Nunavut, Canada where it shoots down Doctor Strange's aircraft causing Googam to save him. During the fight against the <b>Insectoid</b> Leviathon, Googam followed Doctor Strange's advice where he tricked the <b>Insectoid</b> Leviathon into ending up on thin ice where it fell through enough for Doctor Strange to force-feed it a mushroom that shrunk it and bind it with the Bonds of Krottak. No longer needing to get approval from his father, Googam accepted Doctor Strange's thanks for his help in subduing the <b>Insectoid</b> Leviathon.|$|R

5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of <b>insectoids</b> with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E
5|$|Vortigaunts {{are very}} {{intelligent}} and social creatures. In Half-Life, {{they serve as}} basic ground units for the Xen forces, often supporting heavier troops fighting the player and the humans in the Black Mesa Research Facility. They are capable of developing intelligent strategies and tactics to take on their enemies. Initially, Vortigaunts are enslaved to the Nihilanth, a large creature on Xen, who, in turn, claims it is a slave to unknown superiors. On Xen, the Vortigaunts are used as factory workers and drones. In Half-Life 2, Vortigaunts indicate that this slavery has lasted for generations. Despite this, Vortigaunts are shown to have developed an intellectual culture, valuing poetry, music and philosophy. In addition, Vortigaunts practise the husbandry of antlions, large <b>insectoids</b> that live in underground hives, as an ancestral tradition. The death of the Nihilanth {{at the hands of}} Gordon Freeman at the end of Half-Life frees the Vortigaunts from their slavery; consequently the Vortigaunts see Freeman as a messianic figure.|$|E
