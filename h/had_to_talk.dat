5|$|Before {{the next}} season Tim Mara signed All-American University of Michigan quarterback Harry Newman, and free agent halfback Ken Strong. Mara broke his own rule by {{offering}} Newman a contract which allowed him {{a percentage of the}} gate. That same season Wellington Mara's mother finally allowed him to spend training camp living with the team. When he inadvertently received a black eye while he was helping the team with their punting drills, his father <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> his mother out of making him come back home.|$|E
5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) {{and talk to}} a priest or nun to save the games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E
5|$|Parker was at {{home when}} the August 1896 term began, too sick to preside over the court, as he {{suffered}} from Bright's disease. The jurisdiction of the court {{came to an end}} on September 1, 1896, over lands in the Indian Territory; reporters wanted to interview him about his career but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him at his bedside. Parker died on November 17, 1896, of a number of health conditions, including heart degeneration and Bright's disease. His funeral in Fort Smith had the highest number of attenders up to that point. He is buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 November 2016, Zakharova drew {{criticism}} for joking on Russian state television that the U.S. election results {{were the result}} of a Jewish conspiracy, stating [...] "If {{you want to know what}} will happen in America, who do you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to?</b> You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> our people in Brighton Beach, naturally." [...] She also spoke in a stereotypical Jewish accent.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Wes Archer, and was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. It was originally intended to deal with Homer and Marge's problematic sex life, but later developed into {{a story about the}} relationship between Homer and Grampa. Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says that it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice {{for an extended period of}} time because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E
500|$|... "The Hounds of Baskerville" [...] took {{around four}} weeks to film, with {{shooting}} mostly taking place throughout May 2011. Additional scenes were shot later in July and August. Filming on location mostly took place across South Wales, with {{parts of the}} episode being shot on location in Dartmoor, even though the producers did not originally intend to do so. The first day took place at a cemetery. The producers {{were looking for a}} village in South Wales that was [...] "very English-looking." [...] Scenes of the fictional [...] "Cross Keys" [...] pub were filmed at the Bush Inn in St Hilary, Vale of Glamorgan. The production team donated £500 to the village after filming had finished. In one scene, after Sherlock first witnesses the hound, Sherlock makes deductions about a mother and son from a nearby table. In filming the scene, Cumberbatch has to recall multiple pages of monologue in front of camera, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> faster than he was used to.|$|E

500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E
500|$|The season {{confirms}} that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, {{was a member of}} the Kree race, who play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy. Whedon explained that [...] "We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to features about what their plans were and where they were going." [...] When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to Guardians of the Galaxy, Whedon said [...] "It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too." [...] This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own film.|$|E
500|$|The first sound {{feature film}} to receive near-universal {{critical}} approbation was Der Blaue Engel (The Blue Angel); premiering on April 1, 1930, it {{was directed by}} Josef von Sternberg in both German and English versions for Berlin's UFA studio. The first American talkie to be widely honored was All Quiet on the Western Front, directed by Lewis Milestone, which premiered April 21. The other internationally acclaimed sound drama {{of the year was}} Westfront 1918, directed by G. W. Pabst for Nero-Film of Berlin. Historian Anton Kaes points to it as an example of [...] "the new verisimilitude [...] rendered silent cinema's former emphasis on the hypnotic gaze and the symbolism of light and shadow, as well as its preference for allegorical characters, anachronistic." [...] Cultural historians consider the French L'Âge d'Or, directed by Luis Buñuel, which appeared late in 1930, to be of great aesthetic import; at the time, its erotic, blasphemous, anti-bourgeois content caused a scandal. Swiftly banned by Paris police chief Jean Chiappe, it was unavailable for fifty years. The earliest sound movie now acknowledged by most film historians as a masterpiece is Nero-Film's M, directed by Fritz Lang, which premiered May 11, 1931. As described by Roger Ebert, [...] "Many early talkies felt they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> all the time, but Lang allows his camera to prowl through the streets and dives, providing a rat's-eye view." ...|$|E

2500|$|Auditions {{were held}} in many {{locations}} around Australia. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth, the Gold Coast, Darwin and remote locations such as Dubbo, Townsville and Ballarat. Contestants were asked to cook one sausage and one egg whilst answering {{a series of questions}} about themselves and why they {{wanted to be part of}} the show. A second part of the process was a screen test where they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> more about what they would do if they had their own show and deliver a tagline or marketing slogan that summarises their personality and character.|$|E
2500|$|Grampa's {{voice is}} {{performed}} by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices numerous other characters, including Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta {{was part of}} the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done some voice-over work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. The episode [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] (season six, 1994) featured many interactions between Grampa and Homer, so Castellaneta therefore <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to himself when he recorded the voices for that episode. Castellaneta said it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E
2500|$|There were {{plans in}} 1991 {{to bring back}} the {{original}} Death's Head, which would have featured the character on trial and facing the death penalty, and flashing back to how he'd got there. Early into production the new editor Paul Neary scrapped it and commissioned Death's Head II instead: replacing the character with a new version, created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Liam Sharp. In an autumn 1992 interview with Comic World, Neary was dismissive about the original character and the aborted : [...] "I didn't like the pages that had been produced - I didn't think there was much future in Transformers-style robots and I thought we could do an awful lot better." [...] He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look,and Liam Sharp's take gave the project [...] "a kickstart". Ironically, the success of Death's Head II meant Neary was ordered to create more titles and the easiest way was to reprint the original series ("The Incomplete Death's Head"); editor John Freeman <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him into it.|$|E

2500|$|Francis's tenure was {{dogged by}} {{difficult}} relationships both with his senior players {{and with the}} directors. [...] After the flotation, Sullivan {{felt the need to}} publicly deny rumours that Bruce was lined up as manager, and the rumours resurfaced after he was dropped from the team in November 1997. In March 1998, David Gold <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> Francis into withdrawing his resignation after the inclusion of the players' lounge in a matchday corporate package, and abuse of his wife and son by people using that area, brought his poor relationship with Brady to a head. She said that if it came to a choice between the two of them, she would be the only winner. By October 2001, lack of progress had made his position untenable. After a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent. A period of caretaker management followed while the battle to secure Steve Bruce's release from employers Crystal Palace reached the High Court. Bruce shook up a stale team, taking them from mid-table into the play-offs. This time they were successful, beating Norwich City on penalties in the final, again at Cardiff; the decisive penalty was scored by the 18-year-old Birmingham fan Darren Carter.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their father's death, their mother would slip into a deep depression and {{spend a lot of}} time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E
