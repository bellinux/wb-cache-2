His own appeals—and after his death, his foundation's—for <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> {{of the need}} for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the regional organ bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had signed on to the program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Old National Library Building was a {{historical}} building at Stamford Road in the Museum Planning Area of Singapore. Originally completed in 1960, it housed the National Library {{and was a}} national icon for many Singaporeans. Despite a huge groundswell of public dissent, the library was closed on 31 March 2004, and was demolished {{to make way for}} the construction of the Fort Canning Tunnel to ease road traffic to the city. The controversy surrounding the building's demise has been credited for sparking <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> of local cultural roots and an unprecedented wave in favour of heritage conservation among Singaporeans.|$|E
5|$|Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' {{freedom was}} {{significantly}} reduced and religion became a central feature {{of social and}} political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms. In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina, Tanala and Antanosy may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country.|$|E

25|$|Canadian {{society and}} {{government}} experienced a <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> {{and sense of}} responsibility {{that led to the}} development of a wilderness consciousness and preservation ethic.

DIA's parent organization, the Department of Defense, features in fiction and media much more prominently due to the public's <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> of its existence and the general association of military organizations with warfare, rather than spycraft.|$|E
25|$|The organ has an {{integral}} place in liturgical {{music in the}} Church of the Risen Christ, and is the sole instrument that accompanies the congregation and choirs during the mass. The organ is also used together with other encouraged forms of liturgical music like choral polyphony and plainchant.

25|$|The idea of {{self-concept}} {{is known}} as the ability of a person to have opinions and beliefs that are defined confidently, consistent and stable. Early in adolescence, cognitive developments result in greater self-awareness, <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> of others and their thoughts and judgments, the ability to think about abstract, future possibilities, and the ability to consider multiple possibilities at once. As a result, adolescents experience a significant shift from the simple, concrete, and global self-descriptions typical of young children; as children, they defined themselves by physical traits whereas as adolescents, they define themselves based on their values, thoughts, and opinions.|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} {{suggest that there is}} a marked imbalance between the <b>great</b> <b>awareness</b> about climate change impacts and the adaptation measures put into practice on the ground. In order to tackle climate change challenges, it is important to provide capacities and support to the forest sector. The research presented in this paper provides evidence that despite the many uncertainties associated with climate change, forest stakeholders in Belgium show <b>great</b> <b>awareness</b> of the need to adjust forest management practices to meet the needs for adaptation to climate change. However, this finding contrasts with the perceived lack of knowledge on how to adapt. Improving communication of adaptation challenges and strategies for climate change adaptation is therefore likely to be the most effective approach for increasing action, which should also be the focus of future research.|$|R

Māori have looked to the Treaty for rights and remedies for land loss and unequal treatment by the state, with mixed success. From the late 1960s, Māori began drawing attention to breaches of the Treaty, and subsequent histories have emphasised problems with its translation. In 1975, the Waitangi Tribunal was established as a permanent commission of inquiry tasked with researching breaches of the Treaty by the British Crown or its agents, and suggesting means of redress.|$|E
25|$|To {{compensate}} for the increased risk of stroke, anticoagulants may be required. However, {{in the case of}} warfarin, if someone with AF has a yearly risk of stroke that is less than 2%, then the risks associated with taking warfarin outweigh the risk of getting a stroke from AF. However, since these older data, there is now greater recognition of the importance of good anticoagulation control (as reflected by time in therapeutic range) as well as <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> of bleeding risk factors as well as data from recent trials that aspirin carries a similar rate of major bleeding to warfarin, especially in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Body psychotherapy, part of {{the field}} of somatic psychology, focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> of the {{physical}} body and emotions.

These approaches are {{not to be confused with}} body work or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, a <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> had emerged of a unified Māori identity, {{particularly}} in comparison to Pākehā, who now overwhelmingly outnumbered the Māori as a whole. Māori and Pākehā societies remained largely separate – socially, culturally, economically and geographically – for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The key reason for this was that Māori remained almost exclusively a rural population, whereas increasingly the European population was urban especially after 1900. Nevertheless, Māori groups continued to engage with the government and in legal processes to increase their standing in – and ultimately further their incorporation into – wider New Zealand society. The main point of contact with the government were the four Māori Members of Parliament.|$|E
