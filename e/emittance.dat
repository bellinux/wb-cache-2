40|$|The {{influence}} of linear coupling due to skew quadrupoles on the transverse <b>emittances</b> is discussed using the simplified {{model of a}} smooth synchrotron with a constant-in-time skew gradient. New formulae for the coupled transverse <b>emittances</b> are derived that include the uncoupled <b>emittances,</b> the coupling strength (the tune difference on the coupling resonance) and the tune distance from the resonance. The classical formulae generally used only show a sharing of the <b>emittances</b> as coupling increases. For full coupling, i. e. on the resonance, a perfect sharing of the <b>emittances</b> is obtained.

In addition, a computer program is described which uses the formalism {{to calculate the}} coupled lattice functions, <b>emittances</b> and damping rates, The program-can either reconstruct the closed orbit from BPhI-data and dipole corrector strengths, or construct an orbit from misalignments entered into the lattice and then optionally correct the orbit with dipole correctors.

2500|$|The {{storage ring}} cell {{structure}} has a fairly compact lattice with twelve straight sections available for injection, RF cavities and 9 sections available for insertion devices. Each cell has two bending magnets detuned to allow some dispersion in the straights – the so-called double-bend achromat structure – and thus reduce the overall beam size. As {{well as the}} two bend magnets each cell has three families of quadrupole magnets and two families of sextupole magnets. The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length of 5.2m. The CLS is {{the smallest of the}} newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal beam <b>emittance</b> of 18.2nm-rad. [...] The CLS {{was also one of the}} first facilities to chicane two undulators in one straight section, to maximize the number of insertion device beamlines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advice to}} cover one's exposed skin with {{anything}} that can cast a shadow, like the picnic blanket and newspaper used by {{the family in the}} film, may seem absurd at first when one considers the capabilities of a nuclear weapon, but even the thinnest of barriers such as cloth or plant leaves would reduce the severity of burns on the skin from the thermal radiation( [...] the thermal radiation/flash is light, similar in average emission spectrum/color to sun light, emitting in the ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared range but with a higher light intensity than sunlight, with this combination of light rays capable of delivering radiant burning energy to exposed skin areas. While the duration of <b>emittance</b> of this burning thermal radiation, which can be experienced by people within range, increases with yield, it is usually at least a few seconds long.) Furthermore, great importance is given to closing eyelids and covering the location of the eyes as temporary and permanent flash blindness is a risk potential without this covering, especially at night. A photograph taken about 1.3km from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima bomb explosion showed that the shadowing effect of leaves from a nearby shrub protected a wooden utilities pole from charring discoloration due to the burst of thermal radiation, however the rest of the telephone pole, not under the protection of the leaves, was charred almost completely black.|$|E

5000|$|To {{understand}} why the RMS <b>emittance</b> takes on a particular value in a storage ring, one needs to distinguish between electron storage rings and storage rings with heavier particles (such as protons). In an electron storage ring, radiation is an important effect, whereas when other particles are stored, it is typically a small effect. When radiation is important, the particles undergo radiation damping (which slowly decreases <b>emittance</b> turn after turn) and quantum excitation causing diffusion which leads to an equilibrium <b>emittance.</b> [...] When no radiation is present, the emittances remain constant (apart from impedance effects and intrabeam scattering). In this case, the <b>emittance</b> {{is determined by the}} initial particle distribution. In particular if one injects a [...] "small" [...] <b>emittance,</b> it remains small, whereas if one injects a [...] "large" [...] <b>emittance,</b> it remains large.|$|E
