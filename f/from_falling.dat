5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am to prevent it <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|August 25, 2005– Hurricane Katrina, {{category}} 1 at the time, makes landfall {{near the}} Broward/Miami-Dade County border producing gusty winds and heavy rainfall peaking at 16.33inches (415mm) in Perrine. Damage amounts to $523million (2005USD, $656million 2017USD) {{in the southern}} portion of the state, and twelve people die in southern Florida; three from drowning, three <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> trees, and six from indirect causes.

5|$|Catholic {{doctrine}} {{has developed}} over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached.|$|E
5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and bribery. The two men were so protective of their digging sites that they would destroy smaller or damaged fossils to prevent them <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> into their rival's hands, or fill in their excavations with dirt and rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction. On one occasion the scientists' rival teams fought each other by throwing stones.|$|E
5|$|During the voyage, {{the ship}} {{encounters}} a supernova. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> just in time. The supernova then devolves {{into a black}} hole, where Arrow falls. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless insectoid crew member named Scroop.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in 1918, Moltke, {{along with}} most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a {{decision}} by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end when she was scuttled, along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 to prevent them <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> into British hands. The wreck of Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth from 1927 to 1929.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private {{pension funds}} for almost $30 billion, ostensibly {{to protect the}} {{pensions}} <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> stock prices around the world, although critics said the government simply wanted to add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 19982002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries.|$|E

5|$|In September 1985, as {{earthquakes}} and phreatic eruptions rocked the area, local officials began planning for an evacuation. In October, a hazard map was finalized {{for the area}} around Nevado del Ruiz. This map highlighted the danger <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> material—including ash and rock—near Murillo, Santa Isabel, and Libano, {{as well as the}} threat of lahars in Mariquita, Guayabal, Chinchiná and Armero.|$|E
5|$|Monitoring of {{the volcano}} and {{predictions}} of large eruptions are particularly important because of its location in a densely populated area, {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from the volcano. The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where people can take refuge <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> volcanic debris.|$|E
5|$|On the Potomac River, where tides ran {{well above}} normal, ships broke free from their {{moorings}} and drifted downstream. In one instance, a large steamship called the George Leary struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer Mary Washington and the schooner John W. Linnell. At the Washington Navy Yard, multiple buildings sustained damage. Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000, {{and at least}} two dozen individuals in the city suffered injuries <b>from</b> <b>falling</b> debris.|$|E
