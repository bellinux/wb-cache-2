5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted that {{the answer would be}} revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By the end of the book, he said that readers would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
25|$|Çatalhöyük (Central Turkey) is {{considered}} the most advanced of these, and Çayönü in the east the oldest (c. 7250 - 6750 BCE). We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of the town layout at Çayönü, based on a central square with buildings constructed of stone and mud. Archeological finds include farming tools that suggest both crops and animal husbandry as well as domestication of the dog. Religion is represented by figurines of Cybele, a mother goddess. Hacilar (Western Turkey) followed Çayönü, and has been dated to 7040 BCE.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews {{were also}} positive. Writing in 1981, Christgau {{regarded}} Quadrophenia {{as more of}} an opera than Tommy, possessing a brilliantly written albeit confusing plot, jarring but melodic music, and compassionate lyrics about [...] "Everykid as heroic fuckup, smart enough to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what's being done to him and so sensitive he gets pushed right out to the edge anyway". Chris Jones, writing for BBC Music said [...] "everything great about the Who is contained herein." [...] In 2013, Billboard, reviewing the album for its 40th anniversary, said: [...] "Filled with performances packed with life and depth and personality, Quadrophenia is 90 minutes of the Who at its very best." [...] The album has sold 1 million copies and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2000 Q magazine placed Quadrophenia at #56 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album has been ranked #267 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.|$|E

60|$|At last I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> What {{was the use}} {{of casting}} my pearls before her? I thought; some of her own chopped hay would be likelier to do the business.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is evident, Tom," [...] Guy said, as he {{took off}} his hat and cloak, and seated himself, [...] "that the doctor <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of making himself comfortable. Sit down, we may have to wait some time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Thirty women {{stand in}} a field and declare their {{agreement}} on a platitude or statement; for example, [...] "Thirty Helens agree: If you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> you should write it down." [...] One time they disagreed, but later agreed to disagree. At one point, only 29 Helens agreed that promptness was important (the thirtieth Helen was running late). The Helens appeared frequently throughout the first season, but did not appear in any subsequent seasons. According to Bruce McCulloch (in the Oral History segment of the Season 1 DVD set), 30 Helens Agree was his idea.|$|E
2500|$|In France, Burgundy was {{the centre}} of monasticism. The {{enormous}} and powerful monastery at Cluny was to have lasting effect on the layout of other monasteries and the design of their churches. Unfortunately, {{very little of the}} abbey church at Cluny remains; the [...] "Cluny II" [...] rebuilding of 963 onwards has completely vanished, but we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of the design of [...] "Cluny III" [...] from 1088 to 1130, which until the Renaissance remained the largest building in Europe. However, the church of St. Sernin at Toulouse, 1080–1120, has remained intact and demonstrates the regularity of Romanesque design with its modular form, its massive appearance and the repetition of the simple arched window motif.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} {{to take one of}} our Kaffirs. They have both turned out very well, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of cooking, and are {{accustomed}} to our ways. I don't care which I have, but I should certainly like to have one of them. He would stick to the spare horse, while the other natives would be all right if they scattered and shifted for themselves." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{have never}} been shy about cutting things up if I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> To me {{it was worth the}} price of a book for the idea it expressed, the {{interconnecting}} of different worlds. I could put a Gauguin figure in a Van Gogh landscape, make the composition work, and also say something about their relationship." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{majority}} in the years 1945-49 stated National Socialism to <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> but badly applied.|$|R
5000|$|In the Rubber-Tip Pencil case (1874), the Court {{said that}} the {{inventor}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> and <b>a</b> useful one, but his implementation of the idea merely used expedients that [...] "everybody knew" [...] already, and therefore the inventor [...] "took nothing by his patent". The Court did not provide any explanation of what was requisite for a patent on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> and useful <b>idea,</b> other than that novelty was required.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{knew that}} they would come," [...] Harry said, [...] "I would {{certainly}} say we had best stay and defend ourselves; but we can't be sure that that is their motive for assembling. They may, as you say, be going to move off, leaving perhaps half a dozen men to watch the entrance and report if we attempt to escape. That would be fatal, and our only chance would be to leave everything behind and endeavour to climb up {{one side or the}} other; and even that might not avail us, as there may be one or two men up there to see if we make off that way. I am more inclined to think that this is the course that they will take rather than risk a heavy loss of life. They must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what it would cost them to take the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|Early on Sunday {{morning we}} reached Castro, the ancient capital of Chiloe, {{but now a}} most forlorn and deserted place. The usual quadrangular {{arrangement}} of Spanish towns could be traced, but the streets and plaza were coated with fine green turf, on which sheep were browsing. The church, which stands in the middle, is entirely built of plank, and has a picturesque and venerable appearance. The poverty of the place may be conceived from the fact, that although containing some hundreds of inhabitants, one of our party was unable anywhere to purchase either a pound of sugar or an ordinary knife. No individual possessed either a watch or a clock; and {{an old man who}} was supposed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of time, was employed to strike the church bell by guess. The arrival of our boats was a rare event in this quiet retired corner of the world; and nearly all the inhabitants came down to the beach to see us pitch our tents. They were very civil, and offered us a house; and one man even sent us a cask of cider as a present. In the afternoon we paid our respects to the governor--a quiet old man, who, in his appearance and manner of life, was scarcely superior to an English cottager. At night heavy rain set in, which was hardly sufficient to drive away from our tents the large circle of lookers on. An Indian family, who had come to trade in a canoe from Caylen, bivouacked near us. They had no shelter during the rain. In the morning I asked a young Indian, who was wet to the skin, how he had passed the night. He seemed perfectly content, and answered, [...] "Muy bien, señor." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{searching for}} the birth, marriage, or death record of an Irish ancestor, {{you need to know}} or at least <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of the {{specific}} SRD and townland in order to find the record in the databases.|$|E
50|$|Ball's {{contribution}} was {{more on the}} artistic side. Ball <b>had</b> developed <b>a</b> sense for making many Desilu program proposals which would be popular to broad audiences and be successful in their original broadcast and syndication reruns. Before starring in I Love Lucy, Ball had starred in many B movies before co-founding Desilu Productions, and based on that experience, she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what television audiences wanted.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} is {{identifying}} the high availability requirements and the more serious disaster recovery requirements. This is to plan {{what to do with}} later downtime of the SAP system, caused by e.g. hardware failures, application failures or power outages. It should be noted that {{it is very important to}} calculate the cost of downtime, so that <b>an</b> organization <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of its actual availability requirements.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see that, O'Grady," [...] Ryan said, dolefully. [...] "I don't envy Terence a bit. I {{know that}} he has quite {{deserved}} what he has got, and that if I had had his start, I should never have got any farther. Still, I wish I could go with him. I {{know that he}} has always been the one who invented our plans. Still, I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> sometimes." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Giliaki or Yupi (i.e. [...] "wearing clothes made of fish-skin"; a Chinese {{appellation}} {{that was}} also used for the Nanai people) on an early 18 c. French map, whose author did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of the Strait of Tartary ...|$|E
5000|$|Representative of the game's {{negative}} reception, Computer and Video Games {{was critical}} of Battlecars, saying [...] "It's one thing to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for a game, but another one to actually write the program." [...] Your Sinclair elaborated on this criticism {{a few years later}} by noting [...] "the horrid thing kept crashing on me." ...|$|E
50|$|The Fundación Impulsar helps {{entrepreneurial}} minded {{young people}} aged between eighteen and thirty-five years old who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for a business. It focusses particularly on those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, {{who would not}} be able to find funding elsewhere. Along with seed capital, the Fundación Impulsar also provides business planning and development support and mentoring to the start ups that it helps.|$|E
5000|$|Chesney {{told the}} Nashville Music Scene that the song defines {{him as a}} person. Co-writer David Lee Murphy told The Boot that the two were just sitting around and Minor said he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for <b>a</b> song called [...] "live a little, love a lot." [...] They wrote the song {{at the end of}} summer and Murphy said [...] "we had our windows down, just singing at top of our lungs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{friends in}} college, Michael Acton Smith and Tom Boardman {{decided that they}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for <b>a</b> new {{drinking}} game - the Shot Glass Chess Set. The idea prompted them to create a completely online company where people could purchase this and other obscure but “cool” products. The idea {{was to create a}} site where the public could meet with original and interesting products. They began in Cardiff, Wales as hotbox.co.uk, then in 1999 moved to London and relaunched as Firebox.com.|$|R

50|$|The Rump Parliament {{became an}} Oligarchy after the {{execution}} of Charles I. A forty-person council of state, whose job was {{to carry out the}} directives of the Rump Parliament, was established. The Parliament took the name Custodes Libertatis Angliae (Custodians of English Liberty) for use in legal matters. Hobbes saw this as being foolish as they did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what liberty actually meant.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{critics have}} {{also noted that}} Allison's music often focuses on very {{depressing}} topics. In response to critics making this observation, Allison said, “Maybe I do tend {{to concentrate on the}} more miserable aspects of life in my work, but it’s a thrill when you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for a song, and you’re doing it, and communicating. I have really good experiences performing live, with people really responding." ...|$|E
50|$|Another of his designs was Kloveniersburgwal 95, in 1642, one of {{the most}} finely {{proportioned}} classical-school city-palaces in Amsterdam. Philips Vingboons lived during the high point of Amsterdam's power and wealth, halfway through the 17th century, and became the city's most important architect and designer. He especially designed houses since, as a Catholic, he was passed over for state commissions. In 1648 and 1674 a book was published with Philips Vingboons' designs ("Afbeeldsels"), through which we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of his work.|$|E
60|$|Joe Brace <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> {{of why the}} {{superintendent}} wished to see him, and he entered the office prepared to speak his mind plainly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Every one is {{interested}} in Sir Isaac's enterprise. Naturally. Yes, I think I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fairly <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what you mean to do. It's a great experiment." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{seemed to}} provide bidders {{sufficient}} information and flexibility to pursue backup strategies {{to promote a}} reasonably efficient assignment of licenses, without so much complexity that the FCC could not successfully implement it and bidders could not understand it. Just <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> though, is not enough. <b>Good</b> <b>ideas</b> need <b>good</b> advocates {{if they are to}} be adopted. No advocate was more persuasive than Paul Milgrom. He was so persuasive because of his vision, clarity and economy of expression, ability to understand and address FCC needs, integrity, and passion for getting things right.|$|R

50|$|Professional 1st ACs {{have many}} tricks for pulling focus in {{difficult}} situations or when accurate measurement is impossible. Often, before a scene is even rehearsed or established, the 1st AC will take surveying {{measurements of the}} general environment in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of the distance between reference points, such as patterns on the floor or walls, furniture, and whatever else might be around. These reference measurements {{can be used to}} quickly establish rough distances between the camera and the subject in chaotic shooting circumstances.|$|E

That was actually going to be a mixtape at one point. But we decided that we should make it an album." [...] Life is Good would be nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.|$|R
2500|$|Under [...] {{commission}} of George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, who is commonly called just Lord Carnarvon, Howard Carter {{and his team}} set out to Egypt in 1922 to discover the tomb of Tutankhamun, and because of other recent discoveries during that time {{in a particular area}} of the Valley of the Kings, Carter believed he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of where he would find it.

50|$|In 1813 Daniell {{decided to}} {{undertake}} {{what was to}} be his greatest artistic work, A Voyage Round Great Britain. His plan was to journey around the whole coast and record views of places of interest. An integral part of the venture was to provide a running commentary, which described the scenery and the conditions of the people. Daniell had already had excursions in England, Wales and Scotland and so he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> where to go and what he might find by way of subjects for paintings.|$|R
