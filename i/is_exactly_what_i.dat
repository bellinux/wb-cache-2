5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
2500|$|The third Casualty@Holby City {{crossover}} was {{aired in}} October 2005, {{two months after}} the interactive special. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. The crossover was broadcast in the same week that the BBC launched a new adaptation of Charles Dickens' Bleak House starring Gillian Anderson and Charles Dance, and Phil and Grant Mitchell returned to the station's soap opera EastEnders. BBC1 controller Peter Fincham explained: [...] "We have got three very different dramas playing this week that emphasise the breadth and depth of what we have to offer. Changing the scheduling of established favourites and the format for presenting period drama <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want BBC1 to be doing, challenging our audiences with top quality programming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haye was due {{to fight}} Manuel Charr at Manchester Arena on 29 June 2013. However, the fight was called off because Haye had {{suffered}} an injury. Haye later arranged a fight with Tyson Fury at the same venue on 28 September 2013. However, {{a week before the}} fight, David Haye sustained a cut to the head which required several stitches, so yet again the fight was postponed. It was originally rescheduled for 8 February 2014. However Haye dropped out of the fight on 17 November 2013 after shoulder surgery. Fury meanwhile, believed that Haye was making excuses because he didn't want the fight, with Fury himself saying [...] "I'm absolutely furious but in all honesty this <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> expected. Everyone knows I was very suspicious when he pulled out the first time and this confirms to me that he's always been afraid of me and never wanted this fight." [...] Aside from training camp expenses, Haye also cost Fury his positions in the world rankings including an IBF final eliminator bout which would have made him mandatory for a shot at the world title. Although doctors advised Haye to retire from boxing, he never officially announced his retirement.|$|E
