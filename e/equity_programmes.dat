40|$|Summary. This paper {{examines}} {{results from}} an Australia-wide survey of multicultural policies {{at the level}} of local government. Multicultural policies have the potential to advance a local ‘politics of difference’, recasting governance, such that citizenship is expanded. Multicultural policies are described in terms of access and <b>equity</b> <b>programmes,</b> community relations policies and symbolic representations of cultural diversity and inclusive citizenship. The questionnaire survey of managers within local government revealed a broad array of good practices. However, there remained signi cant service gaps for residents of non-English-speaking backgrounds as well as a general reluctance to tackle instances of serious intercommunal tension. There was also some hesitancy to embrace the notion of a diverse local citizenry...|$|E
40|$|The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 confers {{equality}} on all South African citizens {{regardless of}} race and gender. It has been reported that, under apartheid, gender inequality {{was a way of}} life and even social liberation movements observed it. Education is not exempt from gender inequality; the Department of Education in 2003 produced the Gender Equality In Education policy. The then Minister of Education committed to the policy and adopted the main-streaming of gender and the training of education administrators in the implementation of gender <b>equity</b> <b>programmes.</b> Despite these efforts, male dominance continues in areas such as educational leadership. This paper employs a case study approach to investigate the role of institutional culture in undermining the constitutional aim of attaining gender equality. Using feminist critical policy analysis theory to study the mentoring and management style employed in a South African rural high school, the article concludes that despite the policy imperatives, the conservative and patriarchal tendencies within educational leadership undermine the attainment of gender equality. To attain success, implementation of gender policies needs to be strictly monitored...|$|E

40|$|Cet article a pour but de cerner les principales {{dimensions}} de la participation des femmes à {{la formation}} en entreprise en vue d'établir une jonction entre cette dernière et l'accès à l'égalité en emploi. Les données disponibles à l'heure actuelle indiquent que les femmes sont généralement défavorisées dans la formation en entreprise. Divers facteurs explicatifs de cette situation sont examinés, notamment les critères d'attribution de la formation par les employeurs ainsi que les caractéristiques et les besoins spécifiques des travailleuses. L'analyse de ces facteurs permet de tirer des implications quant à la recherche dans ce domaine et ainsi qu'au rôle que joue la formation dans les entreprises ayant adopté un programme d'accès à l'égalité. One {{of the main}} goals of employment <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> {{is to increase the}} occupational mobility of women so that they may enter non traditional jobs. Although on-the-job training has always been considered a major tool for increasing occupational mobility, it has received very little consideration in employment <b>equity</b> <b>programmes.</b> This article identifies the major aspects of women's participation in on-the-job training programmes and proposes ways {{to bridge the gap between}} these programmes and employment equity. The first section of the article examines the current situation of women in the labour market. According to the most recent statistics, occupational segregation as well as the wage gap between males and females are still quite significant. Studies of employment <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> show that progress has, in general, been slow. Among the reasons given for these results are a lack of integration of employment <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> and employers' human resource management strategies, particularly as regards on-the-job training. In the second section we examine data depicting different aspects of women workers' participation in on-the-job training. The data originate from a wide variety of sources and show that women are disadvantaged relative to men along several dimensions, including: participation rates; duration and intensity of training; and financing. Explanations for these discrepancies are discussed in the following two sections which deal respectively with access to and outcomes of on-the-job training for women workers. An initial factor that may explain the lower participation rate of women is the fact that employers tend to offer on-the-job training to workers in qualified jobs. In this context, women's jobs are usually considered as less qualified and studies show that there is an under-investment in human capital in jobs such as clerical work where women are concentrated. Another factor that comes into play is the relation between on-the-job training and an employee's real or anticipated stability in the enterprise. Although women's periods of absence from the labour market for family reasons are much shorter now than before, they are still perceived as less attached to their jobs. It has been shown, for instance, that women with young children are less likely to be offered training by their employers. Another characteristic of women's jobs that negatively affects their participation in training is the fact that they are over-represented in areas of marginal employment such as part-time work. Employers tend to offer less training to these employees because they are considered less motivated and less productive. Finally, the positive relation that has been shown to exist between size of firm and the incidence of training may equally have an adverse impact since women are over-represented in small and mediumsized firms. Even if employers modify their practices in order to give women access to training for non-traditional jobs, some barriers can still limit positive outcomes. These barriers may exist during or after training. For instance, for reasons arising from education or the traditional nature of their job experience, women are less familiar with basic technical skills. Studies have shown that the chances of women remaining in and successfully completing these programmes are improved if, prior to training, they receive some technical or scientific instruction in areas such as refresher mathematics or technical vocabulary. Positive attitudes and awareness on the part of trainers are also important factors in avoiding discouragement and withdrawal from the programme by women workers. Finally, once training is over, occupational mobility may not necessarily follow for various reasons such as bias of supervisors against women entrants in non traditional jobs or a lack of seniority. The analysis presented in this article proposes a comprehensive framework for studying women's participation in on-the-job training programmes. One of the main features of the analysis is to demonstrate the interactions between a large number of variables. The next step is to improve our knowledge of this situation through use of a more comprehensive statistical data base, and through case studies. Given the fact that hiring has considerably slowed down for cyclical as well as structural reasons, promotions into non-traditional jobs will probably become the main avenue for employment equity, hence the importance of on-the-job training for women workers...|$|E
40|$|Gender equity {{remains a}} {{critical}} issue {{on the agenda of}} higher education worldwide. In this vein the Zimbabwe National Gender Policy (ZNGP) (2000) requires all state universities to implement gender <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> through gender mainstreaming to ensure gender equity in the higher education system. Gender mainstreaming is aimed at establishing transformative processes and practices to benefit both women and men equally by systematically integrating policies and programmes addressing gender into all aspects of an organizationâ€™s work. Thus, to mainstream gender is to move gender from the periphery to the centre focus of any activity. This paper reports on the qualitative component of an investigation of the implementation of gender policy programmes in student admissions in two selected Zimbabwe state universities. Data gathering was conducted through documentary analysis and interviews from expert informants to explore the effectiveness of gender equity in student admissions. Findings, through an appraisal of current gender policy implementation in student admissions, revealed yawning gaps between implementation obtaining in the institutions and ideal practice.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a variety}} of issues and sub-issues within the realm of equity in the academic workplace or institutions of higher learning. It starts with a clarification of the environments terminology. Debates continue to revolve around the need for preserving excellence, freedom of speech and academic freedom and whether or not equity-based programmes will threaten traditions such as these. There is a fear of displacement {{on the part of those}} who have benefited in the past as well as expectation regarding {{a variety of}} opportunities, on the part of previously disadvantaged peoples. Also, discussed in this paper are equity issues as they directly impact on academic, administrative and support staff at universities. Labelling, stereotypes, racism, sexism and other issues pertaining to organisational culture are addressed and critically explored. On many an occasion, the focus of equity-based programmes has been on race, with little or no significance attached to the status of women who are either trying to enter, as well as those who are already working or studying within the academic environment. Finally, this paper outlines some considerations with respect to implementing <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> on campuses and will conclude with a selection of examples of post-secondary educational institutions with fully operational equity-based programmes...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to elucidate why students from backgrounds of lower socio-economic status (SES) and who may be first in their family (FIF) to enter university continue to be under-represented in medical schools. Methods: Academically able high school students (n = 33) from a range of socio-economic backgrounds participated in focus groups. School careers advisors (n = 5) were interviewed. Students discussed their career and education plans and ideas about a medical career. Careers advisors discussed enablers and barriers to a medical career for their students. Results: Students of lower SES and of FIF status attending schools situated in poorer geographic locations had limited access to suitable work experience and, despite their participation in gifted and talented classes, were considered to be at greater risk of not achieving the high level of academic achievement required for admission to medical school. Conclusions: There is utility in exploring intersecting differences and Appardurai's theory of the 'capacity to aspire' for the purpose of understanding the causes of the under-representation of disadvantaged students in medical schools. A focused materialist approach to building the aspirations of disadvantaged students, particularly those attending schools located in poorer areas, is required if effective pre-entry <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> are to be developed and evaluated. Alternatively, medical schools might rethink their reliance on very high academic attainment in the admission process. Discuss ideas arising from the article at www. mededuc. com discuss...|$|E
40|$|Statistics {{indicate}} {{that women in}} management remain concentrated in junior levels while underrepresented in senior positions (Employment and Immigration Canada, 1992). Researchers have pointed {{to the effects of}} sex discrimination as responsible for women's slow progress into upper-management (Morrison & Von Glinow, 1990). Given this disadvantageous situation, the question remains: What activities do women managers initiative to improve their conditions in the organization? The {{purpose of the present study}} is to examine this issue while considering a significant situational factor: women's proportional representation. Moreover, the concept of relative deprivation was used to account for women's motivation to take an active role in the promotion of their personal and collective situation. Reactions from a total of 253 women managers were solicited. Univariate and multivariate analyses of variance uncovered four noteworthy findings: (1) greater personal deprivation was expressed among women managers who either perceived themselves as underrepresented or perceived the entrance of no new female recruits in their work group; (2) greater collective relative deprivation was reported among women who held high, rather than low personal relative deprivation scores; (3) the preferred group enhancement activity for women who expressed high, rather than low levels of collective deprivation was endorsement of employment <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> and (4) priority was given to the individual strategy, intention to leave, for women who expressed high, rather than low personal deprivation.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} study {{consists of}} a written thesis with embedded filmic dialogues and an artefact (a documentary film). The thesis explores female experience encountered while attending Australian secondary schools as a schoolgirling process. An empirical study was undertaken that included a qualitative online survey (153 participants), followed by individual, semi-structured, filmed interviews (14 participants) and a focus group (11 participants). Two intergenerational participant groups recount pedagogical interactions, experienced as affective encounters in the classroom, in a direct performative dialogue that is filmed. This is not a study of what ‘is’ but a study that attempts to understand how what ‘is’ {{has come to be}} for these participants and incorporates an understanding of how ‘is’ continues to evolve. The intergenerational participants’ testimonies enable some insights into why entrenched gendered pathways for schoolgirls still persist despite implementation of gender <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> in Australia for the past forty years. The importance of this research lies in unhinging practices that continue to be productive of inequity as a material, social, economic, physical and psychological consequence for students. Karen Barad’s (2007) agential realism theory underpins the ‘filmic methodology’ developed in the undergoing of this thesis. Filmic methodology disregards the notion of film as a truth document, as a representation of reality, and, instead, takes up the concept that film is a projection that allows the creation of a non-prescribed reality through the research encounter. Filmic methodology draws from the research domains of education, sociology and the creative arts and is my major contribution to knowledge. This study examines the process of sedimentation of pedagogical routines and practices that create inequity in secondary school. Assemblages examined evolve around the underexplored consequence of affect and, specifically, the affect of shame within classroom encounters. Recounted incidents of bullying at school, often unnamed and misrecognised, illustrate ways that shame is employed and the refractive outcome of these incidents. The subject of Mathematics emerged, unsolicited, as problematic, in a highly gendered and reductive relationship with these female participants. Participants articulated current and past life aspirations that illustrate how they not only re/negotiate their past but are actually continually re/making their future in the present. The filmic methodology employed allows an empathetic opening to examine ways that educational practices beckon students to differentiate themselves in performative ways. It does this as a pragmatic and positive operation through employing affect. In this way, it demonstrates a paradigm shift like Barad’s (2007) quantum leap into theories of new materialism. This new research method effectively draws attention to a bodily ethic that notices the pedagogical impact on precarious bodies (as affect) and the impact of non-linguistic communication in schooling. This thesis promotes an alternative ethics in education as one that promotes noticing the impact entities have on each other, in relation, as negative differentiation and then enacting an affirmative difference that may lead to greater equity for all students. This consideration may allow, and promote, desires for alternative ways of knowing {{what it is to be}} a successful girl at school and beyond. Additional material(s) submitted with thesis...|$|E

40|$|Affirmative {{action to}} redress past discriminatory {{practices}} is being implemented on a growing {{scale in the}} world, and is creating more diversity in the workforce of organizations. With the implementation of affirmative action in organizations, {{dramatic changes in the}} composition of the workforce takes place, especially at management level. Many leaders and managers have a poor awareness of the impact of changes in workforce composition on individual and organizational performance and its management. The central issue in dealing with workforce diversity is power-sharing. A heightened awareness in managers with regard to workforce diversity means becoming open to differences between employees. It also presuppose the creation of an inclusive environment that new groups will need to be let into positions of decisionmaking and influence. Beyond opening the system, organizations will need to create strategies to help staff at all levels to overcome their resistance to this demographic transformation, and deal with one another in harmonious, co-operative ways. Racial fears and tensions have historically shaped the management style of dominant groups to the point where thoughtless prejudice and stereotypical reactions have become the norm. Reactions of workers to such a management style reflects distrust. Diversity-related performance problems can be encountered in organizations, due to the role that diversity plays in individual and organizational behaviour. Dominant groups may project prejudice and stereotyping that result in relationship and task performance problems. Negative effects like absenteeism, lack of training and so forth, give rise to inefficiency and low productivity. Thus, diversity-related problems can increase with increases in diversity (due to affirmative action and employment <b>equity</b> <b>programmes),</b> resulting in an increase in its negative effects on organizational efficiency, if diversity is not managed. The South African economy cannot afford the disregard for the management of diversity. Such disregard poses three dilemmas. The first dilemma is the reality of the consequences of Affirmative action {{in the context of the}} management of diversity. Whilst any increase in the level of task non-competitiveness cannot be afforded and accommodated (which in itself is the result of increasing diversity that is not managed), affirmative action has to be implemented. Against this background, it is obvious that South African organizations do not have the option of not understanding the dynamics of affirmative action and its role in the dynamics of workforce diversity. The second dilemma is that there exists a research-need to understand workforce diversity and its issues (diversity-related problems) in South Africa as a prerequisite for developing strategies that are more effective than legislation in dealing with employee-perceptions of equity in the workplace. The third dilemma is the issue of knowing how to manage diversity. Most research in the world to date on was done on “unmanaged diversity”. The status quo of diversity in South Africa is such that diversity related problems are intrinsic to the types of diversity discussed in this study. Diversity will increase in South Africa, which may facilitate the deterioration of the status quo. To reduce the possible negative impacts of this development, the need exists for research to address the three dilemmas discussed. The research method included firstly a literature study on the most recent appropriate perspectives on the dynamics of workforce diversity, and secondly a research design that was used to determine the diversity-related organization form factors of workforce diversity in South Africa. In chapter 2 workforce diversity was studied in the context of Behavioural science, specifically in its contribution to organizational behaviour, with emphasis on group behaviour. Shortcomings of the established Interactional Model of Cultural of Diversity (IMCD) in explaining diversity-related group behaviour is remedied to satisfy research requirements of this study. A new paradigm of workforce diversity is created by integrating research perspectives on diverse-team processes, change-models and the IMCD. The outcome of this study is tested within the context of the results of a pilot-study done in 1997 on the progress made in managing diversity in South Africa. In chapter 3 the management of workforce diversity is studied. The transformation of homogeneity through affirmative action to increased diversity, is investigated. Dimensions of workforce diversity and its role and nature in diversity processes is studied. Most relevant empirical South African research perspectives on the dimensions of diversity in South Africa are integrated with conclusions of chapters 2 and 3 in the construction of a Cultural-specific change model of workforce diversity. In chapter 4 the research design was outlined The diversity-related organization form (mono-cultural, non discriminatory or multicultural), dimensions and factors of workforce diversity is empirically determined at two levels: Firstly, organization form, dimensions, and factors of workforce diversity are identified in a descriptive study. Secondly, the factors of workforce diversity is then determined in a causal study. In chapter 5 the results were reported in terms of the dimensions and organization form that was determined, and the identified factors. The results of the determination of the factors, are presented in the context of a theoretical model of workforce diversity in South Africa, that was established in the causal study. In chapter 6 conclusions and recommendations were reported strictly on the basis of the data of the empirical study and the results. The factors that were determined, are presented as transformational (long-term leadership), and transactional (short-term management) factors. Recommendations are made on appropriate strategies and interventions to manage workforce diversity. This study has limitations that impose constraints on the scope of the study. The population sample is an unrestricted non-probability convenience sample, with size n = 614. Thus, it is very difficult to estimate precision, and interpretations of variance of the mean statistic has to be done very conservatively. The results of the analysis of covariance to be used in inferential methods is affected by the sample’s status as a convenience sample, as variances affect.

40|$|Issues {{of equity}} and {{inequity}} {{have always been}} part of employment relations and are a fundamental part of the industrial landscape. For example, in most countries in the nineteenth century and {{a large part of the}} twentieth century women and members of ethnic groups (often a minority in the workforce) were barred from certain occupations, industries or work locations, and received less pay than the dominant male ethnic group for the same work. In recent decades attention has been focused on issues of equity between groups, predominantly women and different ethnic groups in the workforce. This has been embodied in industrial legislation, for example in equal pay for women and men, and frequently in specific equity legislation. In this way a whole new area of law and associated workplace practice has developed in many countries. Historically, employment relations and industrial relations research has not examined employment issues disaggregated by gender or ethnic group. Born out of concern with conflict and regulation at the workplace, studies tended to concentrate on white, male, unionized workers in manufacturing and heavy industry (Ackers, 2002, p. 4). The influential systems model crafted by Dunlop (1958) gave rise to The discipline’s preoccupation with the ‘problem of order’ [which] ensures the invisibility of women, not only because women have generally been less successful in mobilizing around their own needs and discontents, but more profoundly because this approach identifies the employment relationship as the ultimate source of power and conflict at work (Forrest, 1993, p. 410). While ‘the system approach does not deliberately exclude gender... by reproducing a very narrow research approach and understanding of issues of relevance for the research, gender is in general excluded or looked on as something of peripheral interest’ (Hansen, 2002, p. 198). However, long-lived patterns of gender segregation in occupations and industries, together with discriminatory access to work and social views about women and ethnic groups in the paid workforce, mean that the employment experience of women and ethnic groups is frequently quite different to that of men in the dominant ethnic group. Since the 1980 s, research into women and employment has figured in the employment relations literature, but it is often relegated to a separate category in specific articles or book chapters, with women implicitly or explicitly seen as the atypical or exceptional worker (Hansen, 2002; Wajcman, 2000). The same conclusion can be reached for other groups with different labour force patterns and employment outcomes. This chapter proposes that awareness of equity issues is central to employment relations. Like industrial relations legislation and approaches, each country will have a unique set of equity policies and legislation, reflecting their history and culture. Yet while most books on employment and industrial relations deal with issues of equity in a separate chapter (most commonly on equity for women or more recently on ‘diversity’), the reality in the workplace is that all types of legislation and policies which impact on the wages and working conditions interact, and their impact cannot be disentangled one from another. When discussing equity in workplaces in the twenty-first century we are now faced with a plethora of different terms in English. Terms used include discrimination, equity, equal opportunity, affirmative action and diversity with all its variants (workplace diversity, managing diversity, and so on). There is a lack of agreed definitions, particularly when the terms are used outside of a legislative context. This ‘shifting linguistic terrain’ (Kennedy-Dubourdieu, 2006 b, p. 3) varies from country to country and changes over time even within the one country. There is frequently a division made between equity and its related concepts and the range of expressions using the term ‘diversity’ (Wilson and Iles, 1999; Thomas and Ely, 1996). These present dilemmas for practitioners and researchers due to the amount and range of ideas prevalent – and the breadth of issues that are covered when we say ‘equity and diversity in employment’. To add to these dilemmas, the literature on equity and diversity has become bifurcated: the literature on workplace diversity/management diversity appears largely in the business literature while that on equity in employment appears frequently in legal and industrial relations journals. Workplaces of the twenty-first century differ from those of the nineteenth and twentieth century not only in the way they deal with individual and group differences but also in the way they interpret what are fair and equitable outcomes for different individuals and groups. These variations are the result of a range of social conditions, legislation and workplace constraints that have influenced the development of employment equity and the management of diversity. Attempts to achieve employment equity have primarily been dealt with through legislative means, and in the last fifty years this legislation has included elements of anti-discrimination, affirmative action, and equal employment opportunity in virtually all OECD countries (Mor Barak, 2005, pp. 17 – 52). Established on human rights and social justice principles, this legislation is based on the premise that systemic discrimination has and/or continues to exist in the labour force and particular groups of citizens have less advantageous employment outcomes. It is based on group identity, and employment <b>equity</b> <b>programmes</b> in general apply across all workplaces and are mandatory. The more recent notions of diversity in the workplace are based on ideas coming principally from the USA in the 1980 s which have spread widely in the Western world since the 1990 s. Broadly speaking, diversity ideas focus on individual differences either on their own or in concert with the idea of group differences. The diversity literature is based on a business case: that is diversity is profitable in a variety of ways for business, and generally lacks a social justice or human rights justification (Burgess et al., 2009, pp. 81 – 2). Managing diversity is represented at the organizational level as a voluntary and local programme. This chapter discusses some major models and theories for equity and diversity. It begins by charting the history of ideas about equity in employment and then briefly discusses what is meant by equality and equity. The chapter then analyses the major debates about the ways in which equity can be achieved. The more recent ideas about diversity are then discussed, including the history of these ideas and the principles which guide this concept. The following section discusses both major frameworks of equity and diversity. The chapter then raises some ways in which insights from the equity and diversity literature can inform employment relations. Finally, the future of equity and diversity ideas is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Community {{health workers}} (CHWs) are uniquely placed to link {{communities}} {{with the health}} system, {{playing a role in}} improving the reach of health systems and bringing health services closer to hard-to-reach and marginalised groups. A systematic review was conducted {{to determine the extent of}} <b>equity</b> of CHW <b>programmes</b> and to identify intervention design factors which influence equity of health outcomes. Methods In accordance with our published protocol, we systematically searched eight databases from 2004 to 2014 for quantitative and qualitative studies which assessed access, utilisation, quality or community empowerment following introduction of a CHW <b>programme</b> according to <b>equity</b> stratifiers (place of residence, gender, socio-economic position and disability). Thirty four papers met inclusion criteria. A thematic framework was applied and data extracted and managed, prior to charting and thematic analysis. Results To our knowledge this is the first systematic review that describes the extent of <b>equity</b> within CHW <b>programmes</b> and identifies CHW intervention design features which influence <b>equity.</b> CHW <b>programmes</b> were found to promote equity of access and utilisation for community health by reducing inequities relating to place of residence, gender, education and socio-economic position. CHWs can also contribute towards more equitable uptake of referrals at health facility level. There was no clear evidence for equitable quality of services provided by CHWs and limited information regarding the role of the CHW in generating community empowerment to respond to social determinants of health. Factors promoting greater equity of CHW services include recruitment of most poor community members as CHWs, close proximity of services to households, pre-existing social relationship with CHW, provision of home-based services, free service delivery, targeting of poor households, strengthened referral to facility, sensitisation and mobilisation of community. However, if CHW programmes are not well planned some of the barriers faced by clients at health facility level can replicate at community level. Conclusions CHWs promote equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention and use of curative services at household level. However, care must be taken by policymakers and implementers to take into account factors which can influence the equity of services during planning and implementation of CHW programmes...|$|R

CHWs can also contribute towards more equitable uptake of referrals at health facility level. There was no clear evidence for equitable quality of services provided by CHWs and limited information regarding the role of the CHW in generating community empowerment to respond to social determinants of health. Factors promoting greater equity of CHW services include recruitment of most poor community members as CHWs, close proximity of services to households, pre-existing social relationship with CHW, provision of home-based services, free service delivery, targeting of poor households, strengthened referral to facility, sensitisation and mobilisation of community. However, if CHW programmes are not well planned some of the barriers faced by clients at health facility level can replicate at community level. Conclusions CHWs promote equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention and use of curative services at household level. However, care must be taken by policymakers and implementers to take into account factors which can influence the equity of services during planning and implementation of CHW programmes.

40|$|While {{training}} in traditional branches of agricultural engineering {{has never been}} in doubt in developing countries because of the agro-based economies, of late, the relevance of this training has come under scrutiny as the world order shifts towards more market-oriented economies with the resultant requirement of efficient resource utilisation, environmental integrity and social <b>equity.</b> Traditional <b>programmes</b> as previously designed based on developed country models are becoming marginal as most conditions do not obtain in developing countries. This paper analyses the relevance of tertiary agricultural engineering education in southern Africa in the face of world and regional dynamics taking place. It will be argued that traditional agricultural engineering education is becoming dated as {{there is a need for}} more dynamic programmes. On one hand, many economies in Southern Africa are stagnating, and yet on the other, the requirements of agriculture and agro-industry are changing, leading to the need to review and modify curricula regularly. Formal research and development departments are almost non-existent in industry, but do exist in the informal sector and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) at a very basic level.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesSociology {{has made}} {{valuable}} {{contributions in the}} area of identity theory. Recent research into the identity transformation process has seen much emphasis being placed on developing specific conceptual tools to unpack the variable nature of these transformations. These conceptual tools have been extremely efficient. Their focus, however, has tended to be either too macro-social or micro-social at times. As a result, not enough attention has been given to developing existing conceptual tools that can address individual identity transformations at both the macro and micro levels. This study attempts to address this need. What is illustrated here {{is the extent to which}} the application of a particular conceptual tool can be enriched by selectively drawing on other identity concepts so as to offer a fuller and more context-laden understanding of the identity transformation process. In this study I use Anthony Giddens' (1991) notion of 'fateful moments' as an anchor concept. Giddens uses this concept to unpack the existential basis of identity transformations. I draw on additional concepts from cognitive, lifespan and phenomenological approaches to identity and show how these can be used conjunctively to enhance the efficiency of the 'fateful moment' concept for exploring the existential dimension of identity transformations. I demonstrate the use of this 'fateful moment' concept by employing it to examine the identity transformations undergone by three Coloured students participating in an <b>equity</b> development <b>programme</b> at the University of Cape Town (a historically White institution). I show how their location within an <b>equity</b> development <b>programme</b> allows them to engage in a particular type of reflexivity, through which they strive to create meaningful continuity in their lives. My focus was to gain insight into these students' significant relationships with others and to show how these relationships impacted on the ways in which they experienced their sense of location in the world. As a result, the issue of 'self' and the desire on the part of the research participants to locate an 'authentic self' became an important driver in the research process. What is illustrated, therefore, is how an existential focus is able to offer new perspectives on Coloured identity, especially in relation to its inclusion under the racial category of 'Black' in post-apartheid SA. This thesis adopts a qualitative case study approach. The experiences of three Coloured UCT students are presented as three individual case studies. I examine their home, school and university contexts to develop particular biographical narratives for each of them, so as to better locate the circumstances under which their 'fateful moments' occur and the impact thereof on their sense of self. An in-depth qualitative analysis of each of these students' identity transformation experiences was conducted, which revealed new ways in which to think about, use and define the 'fateful moment' concept. My data included reflective essays, semi-structured interviews and observational field notes. I used my initial analysis of the reflective essays and observation notes as a means to develop some of the more open-ended interview questions. The interviews therefore served as a means of triangulating the data. I drew on a combination of content analysis and constructivist grounded theory for analysing the data. I established that these students' continued classification as Coloured in their everyday social interactions, impacted negatively on their perceptions of self. The inclusion of Coloured in the overarching descriptive category of Black, surfaced as a particular source of contention, resentment and guilt for the Coloured students represented here. These students were all searching for a way of expressing an authentic sense of self that was unencumbered by the restrictive and limited possibilities that was bound up in traditional constructions of Coloured identity in SA. What becomes apparent is that the 'fateful moment' concept, when used in conjunction with other selected theoretical perspectives, offers a much more nuanced understanding of the identity transformation process. As such, the strategic use of 'fateful moments' as illustrated in its application to Coloured identity in this thesis, allows us to get a much better understanding of how race feels, thereby adding value to the way in which sociological theory constructs meaning in the world. The conceptual framework for unpacking identity transformation developed here, makes available a particular sociological lens for assessing and measuring the transformational impact of <b>equity</b> development <b>programmes</b> at institutions of higher education. It also allows a more critical stance to be developed towards the tendency to homogenise the Black South African student experience. Doing so allows institutions the space to reflect more deeply on how to strategise around issues of social justice, equity and transformation...|$|R

40|$|It is now {{recognised}} {{that many}} businesses are unsuccessful in raising equity finance {{because they are}} not investment ready. This has prompted enterprise support organisations in various countries to develop investment ready programmes. In the UK, the emphasis of these programmes is on providing information on sources of finance and how to access them, and on presentational skills. These are necessary but not sufficient conditions to get a business investment ready because they do not address business development issues which discourage potential investors. These issues are generally company specific and often require the input of significant expertise {{in order to make a}} company investable.

40|$|In {{the last}} 25 years, {{more than two-thirds}} of OECD {{countries}} have increased school choice opportunities for parents, and it is {{perhaps one of the most}} ardently discussed issues in the current education policy debate. School choice advocates often argue that the introduction of market mechanisms in education allows equal access to high quality schooling for all: expanding school choice opportunities would allow all students – including disadvantaged ones and the ones attending low performing schools – to change to better schools. Since school choice has always been available for well-off families through residential mobility and through enrolment in private schools, advocates suggest that expanding school choice to all, including low-income and minority students, will increase <b>equity.</b> Choice <b>programmes</b> can be perceived as leading to a general improvement in the quality of education, and fostering efficiency and innovation. On the other hand, school choice critics suggest that school choice can exacerbate inequities, as it increases sorting of students between schools based on their socio-economic status, their ethnicity and their ability, and quality can become increasingly unequal between schools. They argue that it further advantages those who already have had a better start in life because of their parents. They also suggest that school choice reduces the unique potential of schools as social cohesion builders, as schools are further segregated by student characteristics. This literature review on school choice analyses the impact of choice schemes on students and on school systems focusing on equity. Reviewing the evidence can be difficult, as the literature is often fragmented and inconclusive, and the political importance of this research often results in high-profile attention given to individual studies rather than systemically understanding collected from a larger empirical base (Berends, Cannata and Goldring, 2011) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis modifies {{the basic}} neoclassical DSGE model of Kiyotaki and Moore (2012) by {{introducing}} a government which levies distortionary taxes on wages and dividends, consumes general output, issues money, and holds privately-issued equity. The thesis answers two questions - Can discretionary policy relieve {{the effects of}} liquidity constraints that limit investment, and thereby stimulate economic activity in normal times? Can discretionary policy ameliorate the effects of an exogenous liquidity shock? Including distortionary taxes is a unique modification within a branch of literature that extends the work of KM and studies liquidity shocks. The thesis belongs to a branch of this literature which modifies KM's basic model, {{but none of these}} papers have distortionary taxes and none examine fiscal policy. The thesis extends the literature with a novel variant of the basic KM model and with a novel set of policies against a liquidity shock. The results are as follows. Firstly, if money supply is constant and government spending varies to always balance the fiscal budget, then across-the-board tax cuts persistently stimulate the economy and a cut in the rate of tax on dividends ameliorates a liquidity shock without additional distortions. These responses are robust to the model's calibration. Secondly, an increase in government spending, financed by more taxes or selling equity holdings, persistently worsens economic activity and exacerbates a liquidity shock; financing the policies is what brings adverse results. Thirdly, the direct effects of a government <b>equity</b> purchase <b>programme</b> are short-lived - investment rises and new equity is added to the market which partially offsets the government's purchase. Financing the programme with spending cuts do less harm than raising taxes. Adding monetary expansion to the policy mix improves aggregate supply but reduces aggregate demand. When used against a liquidity shock, the programme makes a positive but short-lived difference...|$|R
40|$|South Africa, {{the country}} with the largest HIV {{epidemic}} worldwide, has been scaling up treatment since 2003 and is rapidly expanding its eligibility criteria. The HIV treatment programme has achieved significant results, and had 1. 8 million people on treatment per 2011. Despite these achievements, it is now facing major concerns regarding (i) efficiency: alternative treatment policies may save more lives for the same budget; (ii) equity: there are large inequalities in who receives treatment; (iii) feasibility: still only 52 % of the eligible population receives treatment. Hence, decisions on the design of the present HIV treatment programme in South Africa can be considered suboptimal. We argue there are two fundamental reasons to this. First, while there is a rapidly growing evidence-base to guide priority setting decisions on HIV treatment, its included studies typically consider only one criterion at a time and thus fail to capture the broad range of values that stakeholders have. Second, priority setting on HIV treatment is a highly political process but it seems no adequate participatory processes are in place to incorporate stakeholders' views and evidences of all sorts. We propose an alternative approach that provides a better evidence base and outlines a fair policy process to improve priority setting in HIV treatment. The approach integrates two increasingly important frameworks on health care priority setting: accountability for reasonableness (A 4 R) to foster procedural fairness, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to construct an evidence-base on the feasibility, efficiency, and <b>equity</b> of <b>programme</b> options including trade-offs. The approach provides programmatic guidance on the choice of treatment strategies at various decisions levels based on a sound conceptual framework, and holds large potential to improve HIV priority setting in South Africa...|$|R

In the absence of gender-neutral HPV vaccination, targeted vaccination for MSM at sexual health clinics offers a valuable preventive opportunity. Aims To identify sexual healthcare professionals’ (SHCPs) perceived barriers and facilitators for MSM-targeted HPV vaccination. Methods Nineteen telephone interviews, with UK-based self-referred SHCPs (13 doctors, 3 nurses, 3 health advisers), were conducted in October and November 2014. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed thematically by two researchers. Results Nine themes were identified. The major perceived barriers were: ‘concerns about vaccination <b>programme</b> <b>equity</b> and equality’; ‘concerns about vaccination effectiveness’; ‘challenges with targeting MSM’; ‘obstacles with HPV vaccination delivery’ and ‘negative public reaction to targeting MSM’. The main facilitators were: ‘policies and guidelines’; ‘rising awareness’; ‘acceptable settings’ and ‘adequate vaccination procedures’. While SHCPs expressed varied and sometimes contradictory views on MSM-targeted HPV vaccination, most agreed that HPV vaccination, inclusive of all school-aged boys, {{would be the most}} suitable strategy. Conclusion Although SHCPs recognised a need to protect MSM against HPV, several challenges and obstacles associated with the introduction of MSM-targeted HPV vaccination in the UK were reported. Solutions on individual, organisational and public levels were offered. SHCPs’ perspectives and concerns need to be addressed when developing policies and guidelines for a potential MSM-targeted HPV vaccination. Future research needs to examine whether negative views of SHCPs towards MSM-targeted HPV vaccination are associated with lower HPV vaccine acceptability and uptake in MSM...|$|R

It not only reflects on dominant {{way of thinking about}} group performance in the groups literature, but also {{plays an important role in}} guiding researcher’s later research design and select modules from the input, process and output categories in carriable selection. Method: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and a two-level structural equation modelling (SEM) as the analytical methods are applied in this study. Through a single level CFA analysis, student background and characteristic variables were analyzed. The single-level model was extended to a two-level SEM so that the effects of school characteristics were studied in relation to school and student academic achievement. Results: In two models constructed using CFA and two-level SEM, significant findings are presented in the study. That is, there is education inequity in Swedish compulsory school and it is present on two labels. The single individual level model shows that student family background, student and school characteristics variables have significant impact on student academic achievement.

This programme was initiated to address the development of young Black, and in the main African, academics in order to assist with meeting future employment <b>equity</b> requirements. The <b>programme</b> in its simplest fonm offers the GA the opportunity to gain teaching experience while studying for a post graduate qualification. Between 1995 and 2000, fifty GAs were involved in the programme at TN, with the majority of GAs studying at the BTech qualification level. This case study identified the juxtaposition of two perspectives of influence, those of the instrtutional and the individual issues. lhe institutional issues identified were categorised into policy and procedural issues and the individual issues focused on staff development and mentorship issues. Although the findings cannot be generalised, significant issues have been identified which could prove of value to a wider audience. In addition to developing Black academics, the programme makes a significant contribution to increasing the achievement of higher qualifications from the technikon sector.

40|$|In recent years, African {{women have}} gained power and {{visibility}} in political and corporate arenas. Inspired by this new phenomenon, attempts {{are being made}} to define {{the extent to which}} women are developed in the public service despite patriarchal implications of male dominated African societies. (Trinh as cited by Flynn 2002 : 46). Women’s development in the public service has shown a steady increase in the proportion of women occupying positions traditionally dominated by men. African countries’ rankings continue to rise compared to other countries, such as the United States (U. S.), whose ranking continues to go down in terms of women in positions of political leadership (Coughlin, Wingard&Hollihan, 2005, p. xxiv and Inter- Parliamentary Union (IPU), 2006). It is for reasons like these and others that the focus {{of this study was to}} examine the development of women at the National Department of Agriculture (DoA) of South Africa. The study focused on ways that would enhance further development of women, thus fulfilling the government’s mandate to advance women’s empowerment within the DoA. The research question from which the general and specific objectives of the study were conceptualised follows. What is the status of development for women within the Department of Agriculture in South Africa? The current status of the development of women within the DoA was examined in questionnaires distributed among its female employees. From the analysis of the data, it was concluded that although training and education is provided for women, many other issues for enhancing development can be done. These issues include recognition in the workplace, as well as promotion to senior managerial positions. In view of the findings of the study, this researcher suggested recommendations to be implemented by the department to accelerate the status and development of women. Three necessary steps to advance women’s status include: ensuring that employment <b>equity</b> committees and <b>programmes</b> are representative and integrated, formulating gender-sensitive policies at work, and providing improved management training for female employees to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform in advanced positions.
