5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E

He almost <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> at Panathinaikos, {{but according to}} Danish media, he wanted an option {{to allow him to}} leave if he received an offer from a Spanish club. This request was not accepted by the Greeks, who chose to hire Henk ten Cate instead.|$|E
25|$|Under Ikeda's cabinet, Tanaka became {{chairman}} of the Policy Affairs Research Council, and eventually Minister of Finance. Tanaka's term as minister of finance {{saw some of the}} highest economic growth in Japanese history. When Satō became prime minister in 1965, Tanaka was slated to become the LDP's new secretary general, but the emergence of the Black Mist Scandal, where Tanaka was accused of shady land deals in Tokyo, meant that Takeo Fukuda <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> instead.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} in newspapers that Chris Schenkel {{did not intend to}} retire after the series ended, even though he was in his seventies by 1997, as he wanted to earn more money to pay for his grandchildren to go to college. When CBS picked up the PBA Tour in 1998, there was talk of Schenkel moving to that network, but it never materialized. Gary Seibel (play-by-play) and Marshall Holman (color) <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> instead.|$|R

25|$|Parallel to {{his career}} in politics, Castberg had pursued {{his career as a}} jurist. He was {{appointed}} acting public prosecutor in 1901, and <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> on a permanent basis in 1902. In 1906 he was appointed district stipendiary magistrate (sorenskriver) in the district of Toten, Vardal og Biri. He held this job until 1924, except for the periods between 1908–1910 and 1913–1914, when he was a government minister. In December 1924 he was appointed Supreme Court Justice (the formal title was Supreme Court Assessor before 1927).|$|E
50|$|Despite Gassée's {{efforts and}} those of his supporters, in 1990 he left Apple, forced out by Sculley and Apple board members {{dissatisfied}} with his performance in delivering new products. Spindler <b>got</b> <b>the</b> top <b>job.</b>|$|R

He was promoted to the advertising department.|$|R

He left the East Coker ground in the capable hands of his brother Jack.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond {{to write}} and record a theme song for the Scotland {{national}} football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign. Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job)</b> but {{he wondered if he}} had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen ("Vindaloo") and Ian Broudie ("Three Lions"), two men he had met on the same day when working on Illuminatus! in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.|$|E
25|$|Again unemployed, Riis {{returned}} to the Five Points neighborhood. He was sitting outside the Cooper Union one day when {{the principal of the}} school where he had earlier learned telegraphy happened to notice him. He said that if Riis had nothing better to do, then the New York News Association was looking for a trainee. After one more night and a hurried wash in a horse trough, Riis went for an interview. Despite his disheveled appearance he was sent for a test assignment: to observe and write about a luncheon at the Astor House. Riis covered the event competently and <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{winds of}} war were growing in Nazi Germany, and alliances were murky and shifting. In late 1938, Neumann saw a {{bulletin}} board posting at Mittweida saying that Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek needed engineers in his fight against Japanese invaders. Engineers who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> would receive deferment from conscription into the German army. Neumann decided to leave his family and embark on a long journey to the British colony of Hong Kong in May 1939. But upon arriving in Hong Kong, {{he found that the}} company for which he was to work for had disappeared. Fortunately, his skills as an auto mechanic were in great demand.|$|R
25|$|For Newcastle United, the FA Cup final {{was their}} {{final game of}} the season, meaning that they were {{uninhibited}} in their squad selection for the match. The biggest selection dilemma for manager Ruud Gullit was who to pick to play up front alongside captain Alan Shearer: Scottish forward Duncan Ferguson, who was due for an operation on his groin two days later, or Georgian Temur Ketsbaia. Ketsbaia ultimately <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> with Ferguson named as a substitute. After marking David Ginola out of the game in their semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, 20-year-old full-back Andy Griffin was selected {{on the right side of}} Newcastle's defence to perform a similar task against Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs.|$|E
25|$|Their {{friendship}} {{was also}} a working partnership; in all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; {{it is possible to}} discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery, a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army, and of sheer incompetence. Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> done.|$|E
25|$|Eiffel's {{proposal}} {{was for a}} bridge whose deck was supported by five iron piers, with the abutments of the pair on the river bank also bearing a central supporting arch. The price quoted by Eiffel was FF.965,000, far below the nearest competitor {{and so he was}} given the job, although since his company was less experienced than his rivals the Portuguese authorities appointed a committee to report on Eiffel et Cie's suitability. The members included Jean-Baptiste Krantz, Henri Dion and Léon Molinos, both of whom had known Eiffel for a long time: their report was favorable, and Eiffel <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> On-site work began in January 1876 and was complete by the end of October 1877: the bridge was ceremonially opened by King Luis I and Queen Maria Pia, after whom the bridge was named, on 4 November.|$|E
50|$|In 1951, Velebit became Yugoslav {{ambassador}} to Italy, while {{a year later}} he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> same <b>job</b> in <b>the</b> United Kingdom.

500|$|Work was scarce after Ampton's {{completion}} in 1889, and in 1890 Balfour {{applied for the}} post of surveyor for the 1st Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate, to succeed Thomas Cundy.

500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Mark Snow, who {{got involved with}} The X-Files through his friendship with executive producer Goodwin. Initially Carter had no candidates. A little over a dozen people were considered, but Goodwin continued to press for Snow, who auditioned around three times with no sign from the production staff {{as to whether they}} wanted him. One day, however, Snow's agent called him, talking about the [...] "pilot episode" [...] and hinting that he had <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it {{and no one else}} would. Unable to find other writing work, he later said that, [...] "If they had asked me to write Barbie, I would have done that, too." ...|$|E
