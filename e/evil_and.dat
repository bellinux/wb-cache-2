5|$|The central {{conflict}} in many Final Fantasy games {{focuses on a}} group of characters battling an <b>evil,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes ancient, antagonist that dominates the game's world. Stories frequently involve a sovereign state in rebellion, with the protagonists taking part in the rebellion. The heroes are often destined to defeat the <b>evil,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally gather {{as a direct result of}} the antagonist's malicious actions. Another staple of the series is the existence of two villains; the main villain is not always who it appears to be, as the primary antagonist may actually be subservient to another character or entity. The main antagonist introduced at the beginning of the game is not always the final enemy, and the characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be the final fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways of good and <b>evil</b> <b>and</b> the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and <b>evil,</b> <b>and</b> for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as}} the player's was added.|$|E

5|$|Despite the game's {{receiving}} general {{critical acclaim}} and selling well, Peter Jackson, {{director of the}} Lord of the Rings film trilogy, stated that the video game tie-in for his next film, King Kong, would not be developed by EA but by Ubisoft. Jackson's manager claimed that despite EA saying the filmmakers were heavily involved {{in the making of}} the game, the developers were not interested in Jackson's input on the game. Additionally, Jackson had played Beyond Good & <b>Evil,</b> <b>and</b> wanted to work with producer Michel Ancel, who was at Ubisoft.|$|E
