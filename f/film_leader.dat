2500|$|Following {{two years}} sabbatical, Vyjayanthimala re-attained her success in Bollywood through Raj Kapoor's first {{technicolor}} film Sangam. Termed as Kapoor's magnum opus, {{the film was}} produced with a lavish budget by his production company R. K. Films. Earlier in the 1940s, Kapoor planned to launch Sangam {{in the title of}} Gharonda with Dilip Kumar and Nargis and himself in the lead, however the film was delayed several times until 1962. Following Kumar and Dev Anand's refusal {{to be a part of}} the film, Kapoor then fixed Rajendra Kumar and himself as the male leads. Sangam was the first Indian film shot in Europe and outside of Asia. It was the longest running film in India when it was released at 238 minutes. The film also created a record by being the first film to have two cinema intervals. With cinematography by Radhu Kamarkar, the European filming locations include Venice, Paris, Switzerland and London, while the Indian locations include Ooty and Kashmir Valley. Upon release the film was well received by critics and was considered as Bollywood's greatest love triangle. Vyjayanthimala's performance too was praised by critics. Dinesh Raheja of Rediff said that: [...] "to put it simply, radiant...the maturity with which she tackles her character, the insouciance as well as the agony" [...] and called it [...] "one of commercial cinema's most unforgettable performances". Similarly, the film was commercially successful throughout India and other countries as well. On its overall theatrical run, Boxofficeindia.com reported that the film had grossed 8,00,00,000 and netted around [...] with its adjusted to inflation net gross about [...] Subsequently, the film was labelled as a blockbuster, where it was ranked as highest-grossing film of 1964 and the second highest-grossing film of the decade. The film was ranked at fourth by Boxofficeindia.co.in in their list of [...] "Top 50 Film of Last 50 Years" [...] which feature all-time highest grossing Bollywood film with its adjusted to inflation gross about [...] Sangam also had a great box office run outside of India where it was well received in countries such as China, Malaysia and Russia. For her role of Radha, who was caught between her husband and her former lover, Vyjayanthimala was awarded with the Filmfare Best Actress trophy. She then co-starred with Dilip Kumar for the sixth time in Ram Mukherjee's Leader. The film was a comeback film for Kumar, whose last film was Gunga Jumna, also with Vyjayanthimala. Like most of Vyjayanthimala and Kumar's films, their on-screen chemistry received praise from the critics, where Deepak Mahan from The Hindu said: [...] "What made the film even more enjoyable was the equally spirited response of doe-eyed Vyjayantimala, oozing oodles of impish charm in every frame. The pair carried the film on their shoulders, giving abundant joy and mirth to audiences with their outstanding histrionics. Their interactions make the film worth going miles to watch and it is certain that without their resolute shoulders". However, the <b>film</b> <b>Leader</b> did not fare well at the box office, where it was labelled as below average. During the making of Leader, Rediff describes Vyjayanthimala as [...] "recalcitrant" [...] which annoyed Kumar. The film was followed by Gemini Film's Zindagi, directed by Ramanand Sagar. A female-centric film, it features Vyjayanthimala alongside Rajendra Kumar, Raaj Kumar and Prithviraj Kapoor. Zindagi became a success at the box office, where it celebrated a silver jubilee theatrical run and was the fourth highest-grossing film of that year with a verdict of [...] "hit". Soon she signed for Anjali Pictures' Phoolon Ki Sej, with Ashok Kumar and Manoj Kumar, and this became her third consecutive hit of the year. Her last release in 1964 was Ishaara, in which she co-starred with actor Joy Mukherjee for the first time, and her performance ensured that the film was a box office success.|$|E
