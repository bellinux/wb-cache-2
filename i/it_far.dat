5|$|The USS Allegiance, an American nuclear submarine, is {{patrolling the}} Beaufort Sea {{off the coast}} of Alaska when it comes across a craft below the ice that is {{emitting}} a radio signal. The Allegiance is ordered to fire upon the craft by Pacific Command. However, the craft manages to disable the sub using a high-pitched frequency, stranding <b>it</b> <b>far</b> below the ice.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve <b>it</b> <b>far</b> beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|NGC 1664 is {{a fairly}} large open cluster, with a {{diameter}} of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is NGC 1778, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has a diameter of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. NGC 1857, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has a diameter of 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making <b>it</b> <b>far</b> more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is NGC 2126 at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.|$|E

5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. <b>It</b> <b>far</b> exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving <b>it</b> <b>far</b> enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking <b>it</b> <b>far</b> enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E

5|$|In 553, {{he crossed}} over into {{mainland}} Italy, where {{he joined the}} army of Narses {{as one of its}} generals. Facing the Frankish invasion in the summer of 553, Narses ordered Artabanes and other generals to occupy the passes of the Apennines and harass the enemy advance; after a Byzantine contingent was defeated at Parma, however, the other Byzantine generals withdrew to Faventia, until an envoy from Narses persuaded them to move up to the area of Parma again. In 554, Artabanes was stationed at Pisaurum with Byzantine and Hunnic troops. At Fanum, he ambushed and defeated the advance guard of the Frankish army of Leutharis, which was returning from a plundering expedition into southern Italy and heading back to Gaul. Most of the Franks fell, and in the confusion, the many captives escaped, taking much of the Franks' booty with them. Artabanes did not engage the main body of Leutharis' army however, since <b>it</b> <b>far</b> outnumbered his own force. He then marched south and joined Narses's main force, accompanying him in his campaign against the remaining Frankish army under Butilinus. At the decisive Byzantine victory in the Battle of Casilinum, along with Valerian, he commanded the cavalry in the Byzantine left flank. They were concealed in the woods, as part of Narses's stratagem to attack the Franks in the rear and encircle them. Nothing further is known of him after that.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Caernarfon was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants and royal officials to settle there in safety. The town of Caernarfon did not prove a successful settlement, however; by 1298 it had only 59 burgage tenementsproperties paying rent to the kingmaking <b>it</b> <b>far</b> less prosperous than either neighbouring Conwy or Beaumaris, and the situation did not improve during the 14th century. In 1400 Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule, but despite attempts to take Caernarfon in 1403 and 1404, the town's defences held out. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne resulted in {{a change in the}} way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule lessened hostilities between the Welsh and English, reducing the need to maintain Caernarfon's castle and walls and easing the restrictions on Welsh access to the townthe Welsh were finally allowed to live inside Caernarfon in 1507.|$|E

25|$|The semi-implicit Euler is a first-order integrator, {{just as the}} {{standard}} Euler method. This means that it commits a global error {{of the order of}} t. However, the semi-implicit Euler method is a symplectic integrator, unlike {{the standard}} method.

25|$|Although the harbour beyond Port Chalmers is {{regularly}} dredged, {{most of the}} port activity is centred on Port Chalmers rather than on central Dunedin.
