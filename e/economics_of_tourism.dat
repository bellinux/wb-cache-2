In section 2 we present an updated literature review. This review underlines the interest and the specicities of Opaque goods in the Tourism Industry. It also characterizes properties of the Name-Your-Own-Price (NYOP) channel introduced by Priceline and oering probabilistic goods to potential travelers. In the section 3 of the paper we present a theoretical model, in which we wonder what kind of Opaque system can be implemented by a given online monopoly. We compare the "Opaque system", a NYOP system without any possibility of rebidding and the joint implementation of these two systems. We nd that the NYOP system and the joint implementation can have challenging properties if consumer's information is complete. Then, in section 4, we analyze the case of incomplete information. We develop an appropriate setting to integrate the lack of complete information of potential passengers on their relative propensity to pay. We analyze three cases corresponding to dierent levels of uncertainty and number of tickets available. We nd that in some relevant cases (average number of tickets, moderate uncertainty), the joint implementation of 2 dierent Opaque booking systems is advantageous for the Online travel Agencies (OTAs) and airlines.

40|$|Countries {{all over}} the world {{nowadays}} perceive tourism as a sustainable means for economic prosperity in macro and micro levels. This conception is indeed supported by experiences learned from the successful ones. Nevertheless, the impact of tourism is differently observed in the economies with deficits and those of with surpluses. In the cases of deficit economies, the inputs necessary to support the tourism industry have to be largely acquired through import. Moreover, emphasizing tourism development can largely enhance the scarcity of resources for other industries and thus, result in adverse economic impacts. Therefore, an argument remains on whether accelerated tourism development is causing a deficit economy to loose more of its resources than it is earning through the same or not. The study is an effort to probe into the <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourism</b> to find out to what extent a country with a deficit economy has to give up the proceeds of the tourism to support the very industry and its growth. The methodology of the study encompasses literature review and conceptual reasoning. By nature, the study is qualitative.

The study bears immense significance on the context that, Bangladesh, with a largely deficit economy, is on is way to venture on tourism development with an expectation to boost up the economic development.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Swedish higher tourism {{education}} is presented {{by analyzing the}} development of tourism education. Descriptive information of English taught University programs has been collected with a purpose to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the general features of tourism higher education in Sweden. Methodology. The paper is based on a web-based content analysis of Swedish universities’ web-sites. In total six master degree programs at five universities were analyzed. Results of the analysis showed that the first Swedish academic program in tourism was opened in 1978 and from its inception tourism education is of growing significance. Instead of the higher number of degree programs in tourism, which are taught in Swedish, there is a limited number of those taught in English. Just one Bachelor Programme is taught in English in International Tourism is developed at Dalarna University and one Ph. D. Programme in Tourism is developed at Mid Sweden University. Master programs related to tourism are offered at Dalarna University, Linnaeus University, Lund University, Mid Sweden University, and Umeå University. Based on the curricula analysis of these programs, five main themes are identified: 1) tourism as a social phenomenon; 2) sustainable development of tourism; 3) tourism destination development; 4) <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourism,</b> and 5) tourism through service studies. The findings show that the major university programs in tourism adopt an interdisciplinary approach, which combines elements of social sciences, humanities, and business administration. According to the observed curricula, the view on tourism as on social phenomenon prevails. In the studying process, the concept of sustainable development and classical social concepts such as ethnicity, gender, class, culture, and power relations are widely integrated into different tourism courses, making the programs comprehensive, and attractive for international students. The recognition of the tourism programs is supported by the increasing number of international students obtaining degree program in Sweden. Practical implications.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the broad issues {{of power and}} politics associated with Maasai involvement in conservation-oriented tourism development in Amboseli, Kenya. Central to the study was {{the analysis of the}} intricate power interrelationships arising from the dynamic economic and political interactions between local actors and external tourism stakeholders. The study specifically looked at how and on what terms the Maasai were involved in tourism development, the nature of their engagement with outsiders, the initiatives they have undertaken to gain closer control over the organisation and <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourism,</b> and the opportunities and constraints associated with this development process. Two case studies were used to analyse the experiences of Maasai communities living around Amboseli National Park (from 2005 Game Reserve) : community-based wildlife and cultural tourism. A political ecology framework was used as a lens to understand community conflicts and struggles for political control over tourism-related resources (natural and financial). A multi-sited ethnographic approach featuring participant observation, focus group discussions, textual analysis of documents, and in-depth interviews, was used to collect data over twelve months, with intermittent breaks, between November 2003 and August 2005. The findings reveal that Maasai involvement in tourism development is a comparatively recent occurrence and is being promoted by the Kenyan government as a management tool to reconcile the interests of conservation and local communities. Despite the potential for tourism to bring benefits for local communities, stimulate local support for conservation efforts, and local development, the study found that due to competition and political rifts between clans, age-sets and on the basis of political allegiance, Maasai had not benefited as much as they should from the immense tourism potential in their area. Rather than empowering the Maasai to take control over tourism and their own development, tourism had facilitated the exploitation of the area’s tourism potential by foreign tourism investors and tour operators, the government, and a few local elites. Insights from this study shed light on the wider issues of community power and politics in tourism development, in particular the difficulty of ensuring that indigenous communities are not undermined in the face of tourism’s global reach. The study suggests that for the Maasai to realise tourism benefits and support conservation there is an urgent need for social and political justice issues such as equitable distribution of benefits, rights to land resources and livelihoods, and democratic decision-making processes, to be addressed...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{tourists}} seek authentic experiences {{from places}} they visit. For {{countries where the}} historic environment is {{a key component of}} tourism, the concept of maintaining authenticity is vital to encourage potential visitors. Historic buildings, such as castles, were built in a time when accessibility for people with disabilities was not a major concern. Today, the number of people living with a disability is increasing and is expected to continue to grow {{as a result of the}} aging population and longer life expectancy. While all people may have a desire to participate in tourism, and a similar growing interest in an authentic experience, a historic site is enjoyed by all interested visitors only when it is accessible to all. How does a service provider enhance accessibility while continuing to preserve authenticity of the historic site? A service provider of a historic site is faced with the extra challenge of juggling both disability and heritage policy requirements. Satisfying the needs of both can be difficult and may, at times, feel like accessibility at a historic site is an impossible goal. Researching the interaction between these two types of policy and the influence they have on accessibility and disability at historic sites assists in the discovery of policy areas that interfere with a service provider’s ability to enhance accessibility. This may increase knowledge of how to increase accessibility, and how policy currently influences the perpetuation of accessibility and disability at these tourist sites. The purpose of this case study is to explore Glamis Castle in Scotland to illuminate accessibility at the confluence of three power contexts: the <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourism,</b> the preservation of historic buildings, and the inclusion of people with disabilities. Stories uncovering the confluence of the three power contexts and its influence on Glamis Castle were created. Using narrative case study methodology and Roe’s (1994) approach to narrative policy analysis, stories about accessibility and disability at Glamis Castle were created through visual and textual data, and a review of policy and other related documentation. The stories reveal the current state of disability and heritage policy and its effect on Glamis Castle, the current perpetuation of disability and accessibility at the site, and current challenges that service providers may face at historic sites. The stories reveal the need for service providers, staff, and the public to be provided with more educational opportunities to help enhance accessibility at historic sites and encourage inclusion; specifically, they provide insight into the influence choice has on enhancing accessibility at the macro, organizational and individual levels...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{tourism is}} a {{long-established}} {{practice in the}} industrialised West, {{but it is a}} comparatively recent and on-going development in postsocialist contexts. This thesis examines the development of rural tourism in Romania and draws on fieldwork carried out in {{one of the oldest and}} most popular destinations of the country, as well as in a newer and less visited location. As homestays are central to rural tourism, my research has an extensive focus on what happens with guesthouses and their owners. Countryside tourism is a practice grounded in a discourse that praises images of unspoilt nature, close-knit communities, material and cultural heritage and natural healthy food. Discourses about rurality also suggest that for city dwellers, village stays in their own countries can provide a way of getting in touch with their national identity, building, at the same time a sense of belonging. In Romania, such discourses are promoted by NGOs, state institutions and tour operators that aim to develop rural tourism. In spite of their efforts, in the destinations that I studied, rural tourism has strayed away from the ideal model. Instead of bucolic cottages inspired by the vernacular architecture of the region, hosts welcome their guests into large, modern villas equipped with state-of-the art amenities. Tourists too show a strong concern with material aspects of their accommodation, they rarely venture in outdoor pursuits and have little interest in notions of ‘heritage’ or ‘traditions’. My findings show that the lived experiences of local entrepreneurs have shaped worldviews that in many respects are at odds with the ideal models and best tourism practices promoted by various institutions. I also show how hosts and guests share similar notions of achievement and success and how this has turned rural tourism into a house-centred event. In explaining why discourses have little grounding in reality, I pay close attention to the <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourism,</b> trying to understand guesthouses as businesses interlinked both with the wider forces of the market and with the socio-economic history of rural Romania. I show how the development of pensiuni was influenced by specific material and social constraints, arguing that a long history of living under oppressive regimes actually endowed locals with qualities that made them ready to embark on entrepreneurial pursuits. I also examine how kinship can be both a catalyst for growth and a factor that contributes to the stagnation or decline of businesses. Most notably, however, it was the unstable and burdensome legislative environment that had perhaps the strongest impact over the evolution of guesthouses, determining over half of the owners to stay in the shadow economy. My findings raise questions about the effectiveness and utility of many of the norms currently imposed on tourist entrepreneurs and I conclude by discussing a few ways in which institutions could respond better to the needs of guesthouse owners...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Destinations are a {{key feature}} <b>of</b> the <b>tourism</b> {{industry}} and their evolution, structure, operation, image, economy and marketing have featured widely in the research literature. Destinations are {{also one of the}} key building blocks for developing both domestic and international tourism through their function of providing a focus for visitors and investment in tourism-related activities. Over time, and as growth occurs, some destinations will also become generators of visitors. This chapter examines a range of transport issues involved in destination development and demonstrates how the transport system can stimulate tourism by analysing the emergence of Cairns (Queensland, Australia) as an international destination. The chapter draws together previous research in this area to build a theoretical basis of future study of the role of transport in destination development. Given the significant impact that new transport technologies have had on the shape, structure and <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> travel and <b>tourism</b> since Thomas Cook's addition of rail as the third passenger mode (road and sea being the first and second respectively), and the significance of that journey as the start <b>of</b> the contemporary <b>tourism</b> era 1 (Prideaux 2002 a), an understanding of the central position that transport occupies in the tourism industry is important if the future evolution of destinations is to be comprehensively understood...|$|R
