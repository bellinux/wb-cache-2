5|$|Few crashes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair.

Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global positioning system (GPS) for civilian use.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days.

Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> margin of 2–1.|$|E
