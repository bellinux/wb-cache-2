25|$|Godfrey {{used his}} {{pervasive}} fame to advocate a strong anti-Communist stance and to pitch for enhanced strategic air {{power in the}} Cold War atmosphere. In addition to his advocacy for civil rights, he became a strong promoter of his middle-class fans vacationing in Hawaii and Miami Beach, Florida, formerly enclaves for the wealthy. He made a television movie in 1953, taking the controls of an Eastern Air Lines Lockheed Constellation airliner and flying to Miami, thus showing <b>how</b> <b>safe</b> airline travel had become. As a reserve officer, he used his public position to cajole the Navy into qualifying him as a Naval Aviator, and played that against the United States Air Force, who later successfully recruited him into the Air Force Reserve. At one time during the 1950s, Godfrey had flown every active aircraft in the military inventory.|$|E

He claimed that passenger trips would soon be as commonplace as buying a ticket for them.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also <b>how</b> <b>safe</b> she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses an applied rural {{case study}} of a safer water {{intervention}} in South Africa to illustrate how three levels of economic assessment {{can be used to}} understand the impact of the intervention on people's well-being. It is set in the context of Millennium Development Goal 7 which sets a target (7 C) for safe drinking-water provision and the challenges of reaching people in remote rural areas with relatively small-scale schemes. The assessment moves from cost efficiency to cost effectiveness to a full social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) with an associated sensitivity test. In addition to demonstrating techniques of analysis, the paper brings out many of the challenges in understanding <b>how</b> <b>safer</b> drinking-water impacts on people's livelihoods. The SCBA shows the case study intervention is justified economically, though the sensitivity test suggests 'downside' vulnerability...|$|R
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} <b>how</b> <b>safe</b> the bridge {{actually}} is, or what its current lifespan {{is projected to}} be. According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), {{the federal government does}} not maintain an inventory of rail bridges or their condition. Nor is the federal government responsible for railroad bridge safety: [...] "Responsibility for railroad bridge safety rests with the owner of the track carried by the structure. The owner ensures the bridge is capable of safely accommodating all rail traffic operated over the track and specifies the maximum weight the structure can support." [...] There is also no federal law or regulation which requires railroad bridge owners {{to ensure the safety of}} their bridges. Rather, it is FRA [...] "policy" [...] that they do so by following the recommendations contained in the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association's Manual for Railway Engineering and by inspecting bridges annually using trained, experienced inspectors.|$|E
2500|$|However {{statistics}} from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the college educated are employed at a rate nearly twice that of the national average when compared to high school graduates. The type of degree one pursues will determine <b>how</b> <b>safe</b> and prosperous his/her career path is. A study published by the Pew Charitable Trusts, shows that among Americans ages 21 to 24, the drop in employment and income was much steeper among people who lacked a college degree. [...] "Among those whose highest degree {{was a high school}} diploma, only 55% had jobs even before the downturn, and that fell to 47% after it. For young people with an associates degree, the employment rate fell from 64 to 57. Bachelor's degree slipped from 69 to 65." [...] Professor Lisa Kahn of Yale stated that people who graduated from college in the most recent recession were in a position to gain better security than others.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroethics {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of issues, which can only be sampled here. Some have close ties to traditional biomedical ethics, in that different versions of these issues can arise in connection with organ systems other than the brain. [...] For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality? [...] <b>How</b> <b>safe</b> are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function? [...] These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics. [...] They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases. [...] In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics. [...] These relatively newer issues force us to think about the relation between mind and brain and its ethical implications.|$|E
