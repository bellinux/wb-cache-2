40|$|Emerging {{remediation}} {{technologies such}} as chemical amendment of dairy cattle slurry {{have the potential to}} reduce phosphorus (P) solubility and consequently reduce P losses arising from land application of dairy cattle slurry. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness of chemical amendment of slurry to reduce <b>incidental</b> <b>losses</b> of P and suspended sediment (SS) from grassland following application of dairy cattle slurry and to examine the effect of amendments on metal concentrations in runoff water. Intact grassed-soil samples were placed in two laboratory runoff boxes, each 200 -cm-long by 22. 5 -cm-wide by 5 -cm-deep, before being amended with dairy cattle slurry (the study control) and slurry amended with either: (i) alum, comprising 8 % aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) (1. 11 : 1 aluminium (Al) :total phosphorus (TP) of slurry) (ii) poly-aluminium chloride hydroxide (PAC) comprising 10 % Al 2 O 3 (0. 93 : 1 Al:TP) (iii) analytical grade ferric chloride (FeCl 2) (2 : 1 Fe:TP), (iv) and lime (Ca(OH) (2)) (10 : 1 Ca:TP). When compared with the study control. PAC was the most effective amendment, reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) by up to 86 % while alum was most effective in reducing SS (88 %), TP (94 %), particulate phosphorus (PP) (95 %), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) (81 %), and dissolved unreactive phosphorus (DUP) (86 %). Chemical amendment of slurry did not appear to significantly increase losses of Al and Fe compared to the study control, while all amendments increased Ca loss compared to control and grass-only treatment. While chemical amendments were effective, the reductions in <b>incidental</b> P <b>losses</b> observed in this study were similar to those observed in other studies where the time from slurry application to the first rainfall event was increased. Timing of slurry application may therefore be a much more feasible way to reduce <b>incidental</b> P <b>losses.</b> Future work must examine the long-term effects of amendments on P loss to runoff and not only <b>incidental</b> <b>losses.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

Depth and temperature profiles were analyzed for each haul. Three sea water temperature (t°C) values were considered: the upper and lower water layers temperature, and the difference between them. Mean values by depth stratum and the corresponding standard deviations were estimated for the three parameters, then compared between the two seasons. Haul parameters recorded during the more heterogeneous GRUND surveys (due to the vertical waters stratification occurring in summer), were fed to a GIS system in order to produce thematic spatial maps by survey and variable.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{loss from}} {{grassland}} to a waterbody can adversely affect water quality. Land application of dairy cattle slurry {{can result in}} incidental P losses to runoff in addition to increased chronic P losses from soil {{as a result of}} a build-up in Soil Test P (STP). A literature review identified chemical amendment of dairy cattle slurry as a possible mitigation measure to prevent such losses. This study comprised laboratory and field-scale experiments, which investigated the effectiveness and feasibility of chemical amendments in reducing P solubility, taking into account for the first time their pollution swapping potential. First, a controlled agitator experiment was designed to identify the most effective chemical amendment to reduce Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP) release to water overlying grassed soil cores, which received un-amended and amended dairy cattle slurry. In addition to effectiveness, the feasibility of these amendments was determined based on several criteria: estimated cost of amendment, amendment delivery to farm, addition of amendment to slurry, and slurry spreading costs due to any volume increases. The four best amendments based on effectiveness and feasibility, at optimum application rates were: ferric chloride (FeCl 2), which reduced the DRP in overlying water by 88 %, aluminium chloride (AlCl 3) (87 %), alum (83 %) and lime (81 %). These amendments were then added to slurry immediately before it was surface applied to grassed soil in runoff boxes, which were subjected to simulated rainfall events. Analysis of overland flow showed that PAC (Poly-Aluminium Chloride, a commercially available form of AlCl 3) was the most effective amendment for decreasing DRP losses in runoff following slurry application, while alum proved to be the most effective for total P (TP) and particulate P (PP) reduction. The <b>incidental</b> <b>loss</b> of metals (aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe)) in runoff during all experiments was below the maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) for receiving waters. Once the effectiveness of the amendments under laboratory conditions were quantified, their Â¿pollution swappingÂ¿ potential was examined. A laboratory-scale gas chamber experiment was conducted to examine emissions of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). After considering pollution swapping in conjunction with amendment effectiveness, the amendments recommended for a micro plot study were, from best to worst: PAC, alum and lime. This component of the study investigated how soil and chemically amended slurry interactions affect amendment effectiveness under field conditions. The results of this micro-plot study validated the results from the laboratory-scale studies. Alum and PAC reduced average flow-weighted mean concentration (FWMC) and total loads of DRP, dissolved un-reactive phosphorus (DUP), PP and TP in runoff, while amendment of slurry with lime at the rate examined in this study was not effective at reducing P losses. Alum amendment significantly increased average FWMC of ammonium-N (NH 4 -N) in runoff water during the first rainfall event after the slurry was applied (an 84 % increase). This indicates that chemical amendment of dairy cattle slurry conducted on a large scale could increase soluble N losses. Finally, a 9 -month incubation experiment was conducted using five Irish grassland soils to examine the effect of amendments on the long-term plant availability of P in soil and the effect of soil type on the stability of reductions in P solubility. The study showed that, with the exception of FeCl 2, the chemical amendments reduced water extractable phosphorus (WEP) without affecting STP. This study showed that amendments are effective and that there is no major risk of pollution swapping associated with alum and PAC. This is a significant finding as there is now potential to use amendments strategically, in combination with existing POM (programme of measures), to mitigate P losses. The next step will be to examine the use of chemical amendments at catchment-scale. It is hoped that there will be economic incentives given to farmers to reduce nutrient losses. It is possible that P mitigating methods, such as chemical amendment of dairy cattle slurry, may be used strategically within a catchment to bind P in cow and pig slurries...|$|E

Šiuo metu vyriausybės bei privačios įmonės sparčiai vysto autonominius ginklus. Tokie ginklais sugebėtų taikinio aptikimo, pasirinkimo bei puolimo stadijose veikti nepriklausomi bei nevaldomi žmogaus-operatoriaus. Taip pat tokie ginklai galėtų mąstyti ne deterministiniu, o stochastiniu būdu, bei galėtų naudoti dirbtinį intelektą, prisitaikyti prie aplinkos ir mokytis. Antroje darbo dalyje nagrinėjamas proporcingumo principas karo (tarptautinėje humanitarinėje) teisėje, jo elementai ir taikymo praktika, autonominių ginklų naudojimo grėsmes ir galimybes šio principo atžvilgiu bei dabartinio autonominių ginklų teisinio reglamentavimas. Tarptautinė humanitarinė teisė nustato proporcingumo principą, kuris įtvirtina taisyklę prieš kiekvieną puolimą įvertinti to puolimo proporcingumą, t. y. ar atsitiktinė žala, sukelta panaudotos ginkluotos jėgos, neturi akivaizdžiai viršyti tą jėgą naudojant tikėtino pasiekti tiesioginio karinio pranašumo. Kai kurie mokslininkai, teisininkai bei vyriausybinės ir nevyriausybinės institucijos teigia, kad autonominiai ginklai šio principo laikytis nesugebėtų, kadangi puolimo proporcingumo įvertinimas yra itin sudėtingas procesas, kuriam reikia turėti žmogiškąsias savybes. Autonominiai ginklai sugebėtų veikti geriau, tiksliau, efektyviau bei patikimiau negu žmonės. Tačiau yra neatmetama, kad autonominių ginklų programos gali gesti, o jų veikimas gali būti nesuderinamas su tarptautinės humanitarinės teisės principais. Todėl yra svarbu įvertinti bei ištirti, ar autonominiai ginklai galėtų laikytis proporcingumo principo. Trečioje darbo dalyje buvo sudaroma tyrimo metodologija, atliekamas tyrimas bei pateikiamos rekomendacijos, tarptautinės humanitarinės teisės reguliuotojams. Tyrimo būdais buvo pasirinkta kokybinė apklausa bei bylos analizė. Tyrimo metu nustatyta, kad autonominiai ginklai nesugebėtų laikytis proporcingumo principo, kadangi jie neturi žmogiškųjų savybių, reikalingų įvertinti puolimo proporcingumą. Karo teisės reguliuotojams pateikiama rekomendacija nustatyti, kad autonominiai ginklai, negali veikti visiškai savarankiškai karinės galios panaudojimo etape, todėl turi būti prižiūrimi žmogaus. Atlikus visus darbe keliamus uždavinius, darytina išvada, jog autonominiai ginklai nesugebėtų tinkamai pritaikyti proporcingumo principo, todėl ginamasis teiginys: autonominių ginklų panaudojimas pažeidžia proporcingumo principą, pasitvirtino. This master’s thesis {{consists}} of three parts. The first part analyzes the autonomous weapons systems development process and their operating principles. Some early types of weapons, like automatic weapons, which could operate without direct human intervention are being used for a long time. They are mostly to defend certain military objects like ships and bases. Those kind of weapons aren’t {{able to make a}} decision on their own, but rather follow a strict pre-programmed software, which tracks the criterions of possible targets, and when all the required criterions are met, the weapon engages in the attack. At the present, governmental and private companies are rapidly developing autonomous weapons. Such weapons would be capable of detecting, selecting and engaging targets independently and uncontrolled by a human operator. Also, autonomous weapons would be able to reason not only in a deterministic manner but also in stochastic. This would give the autonomous weapons an ability to make a decision, which was not pre-programmed in the software, which is controlling their behavior. Autonomous weapons would also be able to use artificial intelligence, adapt to the environment and learn on their own, which raises serious issues not limited to autonomous weapons compatibility with the current international humanitarian law, but also in the moral and ethical field. The second part analyzes the principle of proportionality in the international humanitarian (law of war) law, the elements and the practice of this principle, the possible advantages and threats in using autonomous weapons, and the current legal regulation of autonomous weapons. International humanitarian law imposes the principle of proportionality, which establishes a rule that “Launching an attack which may be expected to cause <b>incidental</b> <b>loss</b> of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited. ” Some scientists, lawyers and governmental and non-governmental organizations claim that the autonomous weapons {{would not be able to}} follow this principle because measuring the proportionality of the attack is an extremely complicated process, which requires having human qualities. Nevertheless, the usage of autonomous weapons could give some advantages in the military. Because autonomous weapons do not possess some human qualities like tiredness, hunger, exhaustion, anger, they would be able to perform better, more precise, more efficient and more reliable than people. However, the usage of autonomous weapons poses some threats also. It is not excluded that the autonomous weapons would be using advanced computers, which may experience errors, crashes, viruses, and their performance may not be compatible with the principles of international humanitarian law. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and investigate whether autonomous weapons to comply with the principle of proportionality. Currently, there is no national or international treaty or law, which would ban the development and usage of autonomous weapons in its entirety, however, USA and UK have made official policies, which state, that the usage of autonomous weapons should always be monitored by humans. Some non-governmental organizations, scientists and lawyers, advocate, that the development and usage of such weapons should be banned. The third part covers the research methodology and the investigations and makes recommendations for the international humanitarian law regulators. The chosen methods of the research are a qualitative survey and case analysis. The qualitative survey research found that the autonomous weapons would not be able to comply with the principle of proportionality, because they lack human qualities, like consciousness, will and other reasoning capabilities, needed to evaluate the proportionality of the attack. Also, assessing the proportionality of the attack is one of the most difficult decisions in the battlefield, because the expected military advantage of the attack is constantly changing, it is also contextual and subjective to the commander. The experts also noticed that it is immoral and unethical to give the robots the ability to decide upon the life of a human. Therefore autonomous weapons should only be used under the watch of a human. One of the experts also notified, that the usage of autonomous weapons requires thorough testing and studying. Because of that, the expert couldn’t give the detailed opinion on autonomous weapons. The case analysis concluded, that determining the proportionality of attack is subjective and contextual. Therefore international humanitarian law has no clear standard of proportional attack. Consequently, the author is making a conclusion, that autonomous weapons would not be able to properly assess the proportionality of the military attack. The author is making a recommendation to the regulators of the international humanitarian law, that the autonomous weapons should only be developed and used in the way, that allows the human operator to directly intervene in the process of selecting and engaging the targets. After completing all the tasks of the master’s thesis, it can be concluded that the autonomous weapons would fail to properly assess the principle of proportionality, therefore the claim that the usage of autonomous weapons would violate the principle of proportionality was confirmed...|$|E

For grassland, dissolved phosphorus is transported in surface runoff but particulate phosphorus is proportionately more important in macropore and drainflow, especially during storm events.

Aspects of P input, legislation and water quality are discussed. On sandy soils, intensive animal production systems have led to the localized build-up of P in the soil profile with subsequent leaching to shallow groundwaters, and seepage into surface waters. Regulations for production and application of manure on these soils have led to improvements in surface water quality in the last decade, but P concentrations are still too high to maintain satisfactory ecological standards in water. On peat soils, the mineralization of organic matter in the topsoil or in the subsoil can release large amounts of P, leading to high concentrations of P in surface water. However, large P losses can also occur in seepage water from peat deposits in marine sediments containing easily-soluble calcareous P minerals. On clays, <b>incidental</b> <b>losses</b> of P are dominant: surface runoff or preferential flow can lead to loss of freshly applied P, even from soils that are known to have a large retention capacity for P...|$|R

One way of immobilising DRP in runoff before discharge to a surface waterbody, is to amend soil within {{the edge of}} field area with a high phosphorus (P) sequestration material. One such amendment is iron ochre, a by-product of acid mine drainage. Batch experiments utilising two grassland soils at two depths (topsoil and sub-soil), six ochre amendment rates (0, 0. 15, 1. 5, 7. 5, 15 and 30 g kg- 1 mass per dry weight (dwt) of soil) and five P concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg L- 1) were carried out. A proportional equation, which incorporated P sources and losses, was developed and used to form a statistical model. Back calculation identified optimal rates of ochre amendment to soil to ameliorate a specific DRP concentration in runoff. Ochre amendment of soils (with no further P inputs) was effective at decreasing DRP concentrations to acceptable levels. A rate of 30 g ochre kg- 1 soil was needed to decrease DRP concentrations to acceptable levels for P inputs of ≤ 10 mg L- 1, which represents {{the vast majority of}} cases in grassland runoff experiments.

40|$|In Britain, {{frequent}} rainfall {{means that}} there is a high potential for rapid, direct (<b>incidental)</b> <b>losses</b> of phosphorus (P) to occur after fertilizer or manure application. However, despite the known contribution of P to the eutrophication of water bodies in Britain, such incidental transfers have received little experimental attention. To rectify this, we used lysimeter plots (each 3 × 10 m) to investigate incidental transfers in a composite of overland and lateral subsurface flow (0 – 27 cm) following the application of different P sources. The treatments used were triple super phosphate (TSP), dairy slurry (Slurry), an equal mix of TSP plus slurry (TSP + Slurry), and no P (Zero P). The treatments were applied to wet soil at a rate of 29 kg ha− 1 In the following 169 h, 48. 8 mm rainfall (intensity ≤ 3 mm h− 1) resulted in total phosphorus (TP) exports between 1. 8 and 2. 3 kg ha− 1 A single 4 -h period (with overland flow) accounted for 33 to 46 % of overall loads from the P-amended treatments. Concentrations in discharge from TSP + Slurry and TSP peaked at 11000 μg TP L− 1 (67 – 68 % as reactive P 0. 45 μm) and 20 % as RP < 0. 45 Even in subsurface flow, concentrations exceeded 3000 μg TP L− 1 for all P-amended treatments. Incidental TP concentrations in plot discharge were up to 110 -fold higher than those considered eutrophic in inland waters. We suggest that targeting short-term management decisions for P applications is the most immediately viable method to mitigate P loss and benefit the environment...|$|R

40|$|Land {{application}} of dairy slurry {{can result in}} <b>incidental</b> <b>losses</b> of phosphorus (P) to runoff in addition to increased loss of P from soil {{as a result of}} a buildup in soil test P (STP). An agitator test was used to identify the most effective amendments to reduce dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loss from the soil surface after land {{application of}} chemically amended dairy cattle slurry. This test involved adding slurry mixed with various amendments (mixed in a beaker using a jar test flocculator at 100 rpm), to intact soil samples at approximate field capacity. Slurry/amended slurry was applied with a spatula, submerged with overlying water and then mixed to simulate overland flow. In order of effectiveness, at optimum application rates, ferric chloride (FeCl 2) reduced the DRP in overlying water by 88 %, aluminium chloride (AlCl 2) by 87 %, alum (Al 2 (SO 4) 3 ·nH 2 O) by 83 %, lime by 81 %, aluminium water treatment residuals (Al-WTR; sieved to < 2 mm) by 77 %, flyash by 72 %, flue gas desulphurization by-product by 72 % and Al-WTR sludge by 71 %. Ferric chloride (€ 4. 82 /m 3 treated slurry) was the most cost-effective chemical amendment. However, Al compounds are preferred owing to stability of Al–P compared with Fe–P bonds. Alum is less expensive than AlCl 2 (€ 6. 67 /m 3), but the risk of effervescence needs further investigation at field-scale. Phosphorus sorbing materials (PSM) were not as efficient as chemicals in reducing DRP in overlying water. The amendments all reduced P loss from dairy slurry, but the feasibility of these amendments may be limited because of the cost of treatment. peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowshi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractManaging <b>incidental</b> <b>losses</b> {{associated}} with liquid slurry applications during closed periods has significant cost and policy implications {{and the environmental}} data required to review such a measure are difficult to capture due to storm dependencies. Over four years (2010 – 2014) in five intensive agricultural catchments, this study used high-resolution total and total reactive phosphorus (TP and TRP), total oxidised nitrogen (TON) and suspended sediment (SS) concentrations with river discharge data to investigate the magnitude and timing of nutrient losses. A large dataset of storm events (defined as 90 th percentile discharges), and associated flow-weighted mean (FWM) nutrient concentrations and TP/SS ratios, was used to indicate when losses were indicative of residual or incidental nutrient transfers. The beginning of the slurry closed period was reflective of incidental and residual transfers with high storm FWM P (TP and TRP) concentrations, with some catchments also showing elevated storm TP:SS ratios. This pattern diminished {{at the end of}} the closed period in all catchments. Total oxidised N behaved similarly to P during storms in the poorly drained catchments and revealed a long lag time in other catchments. Low storm FWM P concentrations and TP:SS ratios during the weeks following the closed period suggests that nutrients either weren't applied during this time (best times chosen) or that they were applied to less risky areas (best places chosen). For other periods such as late autumn and during wet summers, where storm FWM P concentrations and TP:SS ratios were high, it is recommended that an augmentation of farmer knowledge of soil drainage characteristics with local and detailed current and forecast soil moisture conditions will help to strengthen existing regulatory frameworks to avoid storm driven incidental nutrient transfers...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} natural {{fluorescence}} in tracing diffuse pollution, in liquid phase, following slurry {{application to land}} was assessed by field experiment using twelve one hectare lysimeters on a heavy clay soil in Devon, UK, during autumn 2007. A strong linear relationship was found between natural fluorescence intensity and slurry concentration. The ratio of indices of tryptophan-like and fulvic/humic-like fluorescence (TI:FI) varied between 2 and 5 {{for a range of}} slurries sampled from Devon farms and allowed slurry to be distinguished from uncontaminated drainage waters (TI:FI < 1). <b>Incidental</b> <b>losses</b> of slurry, indicated by significantly enhanced TI:FI ratios, high TI and high ammonium levels, occurred via the drain flow pathway of the drained lysimeters during the first small event following slurry-spreading. The maximum estimated loss from a single lysimeter was 2 - 8 kg or 0. 004 - 0. 016 % of the applied slurry. In the second larger storm event, some five weeks later, significantly enhanced TI:FI ratios in the drain flows were not associated with high TI but with high nitrate levels and, compared to the earlier storm, an increase in the humification index. This implies the loss of slurry decomposition products during this event but further work is needed to validate this. There was no significant enhancement of TI:FI in the surface/throughflow pathways of the drained or undrained lysimeters in either of the events. The observed change over a period of weeks in the strength and nature of the fluorescence signal from spread slurry restricts quantification of slurry losses to those immediately after slurry spreading. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the utility of fluorescence as an indicator of slurry in drainage waters and the importance of field drains in diffuse agricultural pollution...|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{transportation}} investment policies {{can lead}} to very different network forms in the future. The desirability of a transportation network should be assessed not only by its economic efficiency but also by its reliability and security, because {{the cost of an}} <b>incidental</b> capacity <b>loss</b> in a road network can be massive. This research concerns how investment rules shape the hierarchical structure of roads and affect network fragility to natural disasters, congestion, and accidents and vulnerability to targeted attacks. A microscopic network growth model predicts the equilibrium road networks under two alternative policy scenarios: investment based on benefit–cost analysis and investment based on bottleneck removal. A set of Monte Carlo simulation runs, in which a certain percentage of links was removed according to the type of network degradation analyzed, was carried out to evaluate the equilibrium road networks. It was found that a hierarchy existed in road networks for reasons such as economic efficiency but that an overly hierarchica...|$|R
30|$|High P {{sorption}} {{capacity of the}} loamy sand and good contact between water and soil matrix are critical for the retention of P, which was very clear {{from the results of}} this study. There was no increase in P leaching from the columns after applications of P with slurry or mineral P, despite the fact that 80 mm water was added which was approximately equivalent to one pore volume. For the loamy sand, sorption of P by the soil matrix during water percolation alone managed to {{play a crucial role in}} retention of P. This sorption was effective enough and therefore overshadowed the effect of additional sorption of P by incorporation, which did not show any differences in TP leaching compared with when P was surface-applied. Application of P at a moderate rate, i.e. 30 kg ha- 1 in this study, did not seem to be a problem in elevating concentrations of P in drainage from the sandy soil. This is consistent with the findings in a lysimeter study by Sørensen and Rubæk (2012) who did not observe detectable P leaching from a loamy sand and sandy loam to which solid pig manure was incorporated in autumn, due to sufficient P {{sorption capacity}} and absence of macropore flow. Moreover, 15 years measurements of drainage from field plots did not show any effect of yearly applications of manure on P leaching from a sandy soil, due to the high P sorption capacity of the subsoil (Liu et al. 2012 a). However, potential P leaching may greatly increase when the soil has a low sorption capacity (Weaver and Ritchie 1994; Elliott et al. 2002), a high added P surplus, which exists in many areas with intensive livestock production around the world (OECD 2008), or a high degree of saturation with P after long-term supply with animal manure (Liu et al. 2012 b). In addition, <b>incidental</b> <b>losses</b> of P occurring during rainfall instantly after P application, which is not uncommon, should be considered (Withers et al. 2003). Therefore, large P inputs to every soil may always constitute some risk of P losses. In the long-term, balanced P input with harvested biomass will be the best management practice to maintain soil fertility without increasing the risk of P losses.|$|R
