50|$|A study {{investigated}} the effects on self-concept of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and auditory subliminal stimulation (separately and in combination) on 141 undergraduate students with self-concept problems. They {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four groups receiving either Rational-Emotive Therapy, subliminal stimulation, both, or a placebo treatment. Rational-Emotive Therapy significantly improved scores on all the <b>dependent</b> <b>measures</b> (cognition, self-concept, self-esteem, anxiety), except for behavior. Results for the subliminal stimulation group were similar to those of the placebo treatment except for a significant self-concept improvement and a decline in self-concept related irrational cognitions. The combined treatment yielded results similar to those of Rational-Emotive Therapy, with tentative indications of continued improvement in irrational cognitions and self-concept from posttest to follow-up.|$|E
50|$|The {{subjects}} of Rhue and Lynn's study were 59 college students, {{both male and}} female, presumably in late adolescence or young adulthood. Students identified as extreme high, medium, and extreme low fantasy prones based on their initial scores on Wilson and Barber's test were selected from a larger population of students. The study used a cross-sectional design, but unlike that of East and Rook, this experiment gauged childhood experience from retrospective accounts. Although this left open the possibility of fabricated reports (particularly for the fantasy prone person), the researchers stressed to the subjects the need for objectivity and honesty. <b>Dependent</b> <b>measures</b> in the study included written and oral interviews that asked for recollection on items related {{to each of the}} three pathways to fantasy proneness identified by the investigators.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Terry Zuehlke and John Watkins {{conducted}} a study analyzing the effectiveness of logotherapy in treating terminally ill patients. The study’s design used 20 male Veterans Administration volunteers who {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two possible treatments - (1) group that received 8-45 minute sessions over a 2 week period and (2) group used as control that received delayed treatment. Each group was tested on 5 scales - the MMPI K Scale, MMPI L Scale, Death Anxiety Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Purpose of Life Test. The results showed an overall significant difference between the control and treatment groups. While the univariate analyses showed that there were significant group differences in 3/5 of the <b>dependent</b> <b>measures.</b> These results confirm the idea that terminally ill patients can benefit from logotherapy in coping with death.|$|E

This prediction is contrary to empirical findings reported in the rather large distribution-density effect literature, which has, for the most part, used category ratings as the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure.</b> The experiments reported here investigated this odd prediction using recall of values from memory as the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure.</b> The findings support the predictions of Choplin’s model and are not predicted by other models of distribution-density effects...|$|R
5000|$|Firstly, {{questionable}} research practices (QRPs) {{have been}} identified as common in the field. [...] Such practices, while not intentionally fraudulent, involve capitalizing on the gray area of acceptable scientific practices or exploiting flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting, often in an effort to obtain a desired outcome. Examples of QRPs include selective reporting or partial publication of data (reporting only some of the study conditions or collected <b>dependent</b> <b>measures</b> in a publication), optional stopping (choosing when to stop data collection, often based on statistical significance of tests), p-value rounding (rounding p-values down to [...]05 to suggest statistical significance), file drawer effect (nonpublication of data), post-hoc storytelling (framing exploratory analyses as confirmatory analyses), and manipulation of outliers (either removing outliers or leaving outliers in a dataset to cause a statistical test to be significant). A survey of over 2,000 psychologists indicated that a majority of respondents admitted to using at least one QRP. False positive conclusions, often resulting from the pressure to publish or the author's own confirmation bias, are an inherent hazard in the field, requiring a certain degree of skepticism on the part of readers.|$|E
5000|$|The study, {{called the}} Waterloo Longitudinal Project, {{followed}} {{a group of}} 88 mostly middle-class male and female children from grade 2 (average age 7 years) to grade 9 (age 14). As a result of attrition, only 60 of the subjects remained in the study for the full seven years. The main independent variable {{in the study was}} a classification of second-grade children by social type. To differentiate between the aggressive, withdrawn, and socially competent second-grade children, the researchers constructed aggregates of several measures. In one scale, the Revised Class Play method pioneered by Masten, Morison, and Pellegrini, children were asked to nominate peers who best fit into each of the three social categories. Three of the seven items designed to measure isolation were deleted, however, because they seemed to record peer rejection rather than withdrawal, and in two cases (e.g. [...] "someone who has trouble making friends") were as applicable to aggressive children as to their withdrawn peers—underscoring the tendency of the two groups of unpopular children to overlap. Other indicators added to the aggregate measures of aggression, withdrawal, and social competence were a peer-assessed sociometric rating of each child's popularity, teacher ratings, and observations by the researchers during 15-minute play sessions. The <b>dependent</b> <b>measures</b> consisted of questionnaire items regarding each ninth-grade adolescent's delinquency and substance abuse, perceived security in both family and peer groups, loneliness, and self-regard.|$|E
5000|$|Stimulus-onset {{asynchrony}} (SOA) is {{a measure}} used in experimental psychology. SOA denotes {{the amount of time}} between the start of one stimulus, S1, and the start of another stimulus, S2 (Figure 1). In this respect, a stimulus may consist of, e.g., a presented image, sound or printed word. A short time interval between S1 and S2 may lead to interference in the neural processing of these two patterns. Conversely, a very long SOA may lead to a situation where the brain activity caused by S1 may have faded, such that S2 has become an isolated event. Typical research questions concern the facilitation, deterioration, or biasing effects of the sequential stimulus presentation on a required later response. In a certain kind of studies on subliminal stimulation, called [...] "pattern masking", subliminality is achieved by masking the subliminal stimulus with a second stimulus composed of either random parts of letters or numbers, or containing different kinds of figural properties. Here, the critical parameter is the time interval (the SOA) between the onset of the subliminal stimulus and the onset of the masking stimulus. In psycholinguistics the stimuli are typically a prime and a target, in which case the stimulus-onset asynchrony is measured {{from the beginning of the}} prime (S1) until the beginning of the target (S2). This time can be manipulated experimentally to determine its effects on other <b>dependent</b> <b>measures</b> such as reaction time or brain activity.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} {{integrates}} {{many of the}} previous change deafness manipulations and contributes meaningfully to {{a small but growing}} number of voices suggesting that change deafness is a distinct perceptual phenomenon represented by a particular pattern of performance, namely low hits and low false alarms. However, despite similar nomenclature, the temptation to draw links between change deafness and its visual counterpart (change blindness) should be avoided. There are methodological and physiological differences between vision and audition {{that would have to be}} ignored to make direct comparisons between the two effects tenable. For example, the AX paradigm and accuracy measures that are standard in the change deafness literature are essentially a single ‘flicker’ and thus are only roughly analogous to single flicker or ‘one-shot’ change discrimination paradigms in vision (e.g., Mitroff et al., 2004). In standard flicker paradigms, multiple flickers can occur, and the primary <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> is reaction time to identify the change. When the change is found, the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> of accuracy is almost always asymptotic. In contrast, the majority of change deafness studies are based on only one ‘flicker’ and thus the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> is restricted to accuracy following a restricted exposure window that limits the effective time to encode scene elements. The two methods are fundamentally different, and thus difficult to compare. One possible solution is to provide analogous situations by designing auditory flicker paradigms where the goal is instead to identify the auditory change, and the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> is response time to identify the change (e.g., Hall et al., 2015).|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} five {{experiments}} examined how {{the evaluation of}} a scientific finding was influenced by information {{about the number of}} studies that had successfully replicated the initial finding. The experiments also tested the impact of frame (negative, positive) and numeric format (percentage, natural frequency) on the evaluation of scientific findings. In Experiments 1 through 4, an attitude difference score served as the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure,</b> while a measure of choice served as the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> in Experiment 5. Results from a diverse sample of 188 non-institutionalized U. S. adults (Experiment 2) and 730 undergraduate college students (Experiments 1, 3, and 4) indicated that attitudes became more positive as the replication rate increased and attitudes were more positive when the replication information was framed positively. The results also indicate that the manner in which replication rate was framed had a greater impact on attitude than the replication rate itself. The large effect for frame was attenuated somewhat when information about replication was presented in the form of natural frequencies rather than percentages. A fifth study employing 662 undergraduate college students in a task in which choice served as the <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> confirmed the framing effect and replicated the replication rate effect in the positive frame condition, but provided no evidence that the use of natural frequencies diminished the effect...|$|R

5000|$|The {{economic}} {{relations between the}} city of Porto and the Upper Douro River have been documented since the Middle Ages. However, they were greatly deepened in the modern ages. [...] Indeed, sumach, dry fruits and nuts and the Douro olive oils sustained prosperous exchanges between the region and Porto. From the riverside quays at the river mouth, these products were exported to other markets of the Old and New World. But the greatest lever to interregional trade relations resulted from the commercial dynamics of the Port wine (Vinho do Porto) agro industry. [...] It decidedly bolstered the complementary relationship between the large coastal urban centre, endowed with open doors to the sea, and a region with significant agricultural potential, {{especially in terms of}} the production of extremely high quality fortified wines, known by the world-famous label Port. The development of Porto was also closely connected with the left margin of River Douro in Vila Nova de Gaia, where is located the amphitheatre-shaped slope with the Port wine cellars.In a study concerning competitiveness of the 18 Portuguese district capitals, Porto was the worst-ranked. The study was made by Minho University economics researchers and was published in Público newspaper on 30 September 2006. The best-ranked cities in the study were Évora, Lisbon and Coimbra. Nevertheless, the validity of this study was questioned by some Porto's notable figures (such as local politicians and businesspersons) who argued that the city proper does not function independently but in conurbation with other municipalities. A new ranking, published in the newspaper Expresso (Portuguese Newspaper) in 2007 which can be translated to [...] "The Best Cities to Live in Portugal" [...] ranked Porto in third place (tied with Évora) below Guimarães and Lisbon. The two studies are not directly comparable as they use different <b>dependent</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{categorisation}} tasks, such as lexical decision, {{the standard}} <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> in cognitive psychology is mean reaction time (RT).

To address this, some researchers have begun using reaching trajectories as their <b>dependent</b> <b>measure.</b> The promise of this continuous measure is that it can reveal effects while stimulus processing is still unfolding. In this talk I will discuss a series of experiments in which we use reaching trajectories to investigate the effects of spatial and temporal attention in two different categorisation tasks: lexical decision and face (male/female) categorisation. Replicating earlier work, our results indicate strong modulatory effects of attention on stimulus categorisation.

40|$|Greater {{continuity}} in cognition between {{children and adults}} may exist than is usually appreciated.

The delay to the preferred food item adjusted depending upon the pigeon's choices. The <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> was the amount of delay added to corn to produce indifference at 70 % and 950 / 0 of body weight.

40|$|Object {{images are}} {{identified}} more efficiently after prior exposure. Here, the authors investigated shape representations supporting object priming. The <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> in all experiments was the minimum exposure duration required to correctly identify an object image in a rapid serial visual presentation stream.

Experiment 1 demonstrated that this <b>dependent</b> <b>measure</b> yielded an estimate of predominantly visual priming (i. e., free of name and concept priming). Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that although priming was sensitive to orientation, visual priming was relatively invariant with image inversion (i. e., an image visually primed its inverted counterpart approximately as much as it primed itself). Experiment 4 demonstrated a similar dissociation with images rotated 90 ° off the upright. In all experiments, the difference in the magnitude of priming for identical or rotated–inverted priming conditions was marginal or nonexistent. These results suggest that visual representations that support priming can be relatively insensitive to picture-plane manipulations, although these manipula-tions have a substantial effect on object identification...|$|R
