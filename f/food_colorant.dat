2500|$|Due to the {{importance}} of flavoproteins, it is unsurprising that approximately 60% of human flavoproteins cause human disease when mutated. [...] In some cases, this is due to a decreased affinity for FAD or FMN and so excess riboflavin intake may lessen disease symptoms, such as for multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. [...] In addition, riboflavin deficiency itself (and the resulting lack of FAD and FMN) can cause health issues. For example, in ALS patients, there are decreased levels of FAD synthesis. [...] Both of these paths can result in a variety of symptoms, including developmental or gastrointestinal abnormalities, faulty fat break-down, anemia, neurological problems, cancer or heart disease, migraine, worsened vision and skin lesions. [...] The pharmaceutical industry therefore produces riboflavin to supplement diet in certain cases. [...] In 2008, the global need for riboflavin was 6,000 tons per year, with production capacity of 10,000 tons. This $150 to 500 million market is not only for medical applications, but is also used as a supplement to animal food in the agricultural industry and as a <b>food</b> <b>colorant.</b>|$|E

This study was conducted to analyze the relationship between the knowledge, attitude, and practice on <b>food</b> <b>colorants</b> among mothers and the incidence of headache and diarrhea as signs of food poisoning in their elementary school children in Penggaron Lor Village. This study was an cross sectional observational analytic study with involving 70 mothers whose children are IV, V and VI grade students. Data on knowledge, attitude, and practice on food collorants and the incident of headache or diarrhea were collected using a questionnaire on January–May 2014.

Therefore, large quantities and /or long periods of colorants administration should not be used as additive in man's diet or as a drink.
