40|$|The paper {{presents}} a supervisory framework {{that addresses the}} vulnerabilities of partially dollarized banking systems. The tendency to underprice systemic liquidity risk and currency-induced credit risk creates vulnerabilities that need supervisory responses. The framework seeks to induce agents to better internalize risks by implementing a risk based approach to supervision, following the risk management guidelines of the Basel Committee, and by establishing buffers to cover higher liquidity and solvency risks. The paper also shows that most dollarized countries have addressed their liquidity vulnerabilities, but few have addressed those arising from currency-induced credit risks.

A bank will choose a workout option if its expected value is greater than the outcome under a no-workout plan. For the borrower, if the reputational penalty due to a default is less than the opportunity cost of the best new alternative, the borrower will have an incentive to default. If the reverse holds then the borrower will be better-off with a loan workout.

40|$|Abstract. Business Continuity Management (BCM) is {{a process}} to manage risks, emergencies, and {{recovery}} plans of an organization during a crisis. It results in a document called Business Continuity Plans (BCP) that specifies the methodology and procedures required to backup and recover the functional unit of a disrupted business. Traditionally, the BCP assessment is based only on the continuity of IS infrastructures and does not consider possible relations with the business objectives and business processes. This traditional approach assumes {{that the risk of}} business continuity is resulted from the disruption of the IS infrastructures. However, we believe there are situations where the risk emerges even the infrastructures up and running. Moreover, the lack of modeling framework and the aided-tool make the process even harder. In this paper, we propose a framework to support modeling and analysis of BCP from the organization perspective, where risks and treatments are modeled and analyzed along strategic objectives and their realizations. An automated reasoner based on cost-benefit analysis techniques is proposed to elicit and then adopt the most cost-efficient plan. The approach is developed using the Tropos Goal-Risk Framework and the Time Dependency and Recovery Model as underlain <b>frameworks.</b> A <b>Loan</b> Originating Process case study is used as a running example to illustrate the proposal. ...|$|R

Most often, the answers were multifold. Indeed, different layers of normativity were at stake: apart from learned legal treatises and commentaries, also customary law and moral theological literature contributed to the debate. It were, however, turbulent times.

Within this framework, we establish that the bank lending channel may amplify but also attenuate {{the impact of}} monetary policy shocks on output and prices as compared to the traditional interest rate channel. The variations in the interest rate spread between the loan rate and the central bank’s intervention rate are a good indicator when distinguishing between amplification and attenuation effects of monetary policy shocks provided that there is a positive relationship between both rates and that the loan interest rate is a market clearing variable. Second, we apply a regime switching <b>framework</b> to the <b>loan</b> market. The results suggest that disequilibrium is a permanent characteristic of the Polish loan market since 1994.

40|$|Essay 1 {{provides}} an analytical model for risk segmentation in the perfectly competitive consumer loan market by incorporating {{the fact that}} a parental durable good seller with market power to some degree in its product market can earn rents. In this context, there is a gain to granting credit for the purchase of the product and thus the establishment of captive finance company for expanding the sales by offering loans to consumers who need financing for purchase of durable good. The model presents that each captive finance company will set a more lenient credit standard than that of a bank, leading to the prediction that the likelihood of repayment of a captive automobile loan is lower than that of a bank automobile loan, other things being equal. ^ The theoretical predictions in Essay 1 are tested using a unique dataset, TrenData™, drawn from a major credit bureau in the U. S, Trans Union. The analysis of credit bureau data shows that a captive automobile loan is less likely to be repaid than a bank automobile loan, which supports the theoretical prediction. ^ Given the economic feature of a captive finance company examined in Essay 1, Essay 2 examines risk segmentation of consumer loan market by banks and captive finance companies under asymmetric information on a borrower 2 ̆ 7 s ability of loan repayment and the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s self-selection of the types of loan contract and lending institution. We construct a lending model with adverse selection in consumer loan market on <b>loan</b> rate-approval rate <b>framework.</b> Captive pooling <b>loan</b> contract needs to be subsidized by profits from selling side to sustain. A low-risk borrower is indifferent between separating bank low-risk loan contract and captive pooling loan contract while a high-risk borrower strictly prefers captive pooling loan contract to bank separating high-risk loan contract. The model successfully explains the prevailing wisdom in lending practices that captive finance companies serve on average more high-risk borrowers offering more lenient loan approvals and higher loan rate than banks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of banking system within {{the financial system}} requires a special attention {{in order to secure}} its stability. Thus, with the occurrence of the financial crisis, in the context of integration of the financial system and creation of unique financial market, became more stringent the need for the existence of specific tools to prevent financial crises and to guarantee the continuity of normal economic activity. In this category are the macro-prudential supervision tools whose role is to reduce the ability of banks to damage the economy by taking on excess risk. Among them is registered the dynamic provisions intended to be used for enhancing bank soundness and to help mitigate part of the pro-cyclicality of the banking system. The current study addresses the methodology for establishing specific provisions for credit risk {{at the level of the}} Romanian banking system, highlighting the direct implications over the credit institutions, and indirect implications over the economy as a whole. The study presents as well the possible course of actions in order to remedy the weaknesses in the recognition of loan losses. Thus, while listing the specialty literature, study presents the regulatory <b>framework</b> applicable to <b>loan</b> loss provisioning, underlining the weaknesses of the static provisioning model and the need to look forward to the dynamic model along with the accounting methodology. In this regard it was considered the worsening of a loan portfolio in macroeconomic context and a hypothetical comparative study between the static and dynamic model has been realized. The results of the study revealed that the current provisioning model has a procycle character without considering the influence of macroeconomic factors over the future worsening of the loan portfolio without allowing recognition of future loan losses due to failure to identify future risks generating events and their credible assessment. Therefore it is required the need to establish reserves during the economic growth periods to cover losses from loans in order to prevent disruption of the banking activity and to limit the risk of insolvency. To achieve this goal it is necessary that all the parties involved, namely the banks, the regulatory authority and accounting organizations, to realize the {{importance of}} loan loss provisioning and act accordingly...|$|R
50|$|The Mexican {{government}} could {{not count on}} revenues from silver mining to fund its operations. The exit of Spanish merchants involved in the transatlantic trade was also {{a blow to the}} Mexican economy. The division of the former viceroyalty into separate states of a federal system, all needed a source of revenue to function meant that internal tariffs impeded trade. For the weak federal government, a large source of revenue was the customs revenue on imports and exports. The Mexican government floated loans to foreign firms in the form of bonds. In 1824 the Mexican government floated a bond taken up by a London bank, B.A. Goldschmidt and Company; in 1825 Barclay, Herring, Richardson and Company of London not only loaned more money to the Mexican government, but opened a permanent office. The establishment of a permanent branch of Barclay, Herring, Richardson and Co. in Mexico in 1825 and then establishment of the Banco de Londres y Sud América in Mexico set the <b>framework</b> for foreign <b>loans</b> and investment in Mexico. The Banco de Londres issued paper money for private not public debt. Paper money was a first for Mexico which had long used silver coinage. After an extended civil war and foreign invasions, the late nineteenth century saw the more systematic growth of banking and foreign investment during the Porfiriato (1876-1911).Faced with political disruptions, civil wars, unstable currency, and the constant threat of banditry in the countryside, most wealthy Mexicans invested their assets the only stable productive enterprises that remained viable: large agricultural estates with access to credit from the Catholic Church. These entrepreneurs were later accused of preferring the symbolic wealth of tangible, secure, and unproductive property to the riskier and more difficult but innovative and potentially more profitable work of investing in industry, {{but the fact is that}} agriculture was the only marginally safe investment in times of such uncertainty. Furthermore, with low per capita income and a stagnant, shallow market, agriculture was not very profitable. The Church could have loaned money for industrial enterprises, the costs and risks of starting one in the circumstances of bad transportation and lack of consumer spending power or demand meant that agriculture was a more prudent investment.|$|R
40|$|Early in 2003, the Forum Group on Mortgage Credit {{set up by}} the European Commission met for {{the first}} time in order to take on the ambitious tasks of {{identifying}} and assessing the impact existing obstacles to the functioning of an Internal Market for mortgage credit and coming forward with concrete political recommendations on the necessary steps to aid its formation. The group’s work, which ended with the publication of its final report in late 2004, was followed up by a Commission Green Paper on mortgage credit in the EU, a related public hearing, the creation of the Government Expert Group on Mortgage Credit (GECMC), the Mortgage Industry and Consumer Dialogue Expert Group (MICEG), the Mortgage Funding Expert Group (MFEG) and the Expert Group on Credit Histories (EGCH), the publication of the respective reports, a White Paper on the integration of mortgage markets and a public hearing on responsible lending and borrowing. Several studies – on costs and benefits of integration of EU mortgage markets; the role and regulation of non-credit institutions in EU mortgage markets; credit intermediaries in the internal market; equity release schemes; consumer testing of possible new format and content for the European Standardised Information Sheet on home loans; and the costs and benefits of different policy options for mortgage credit (undisclosed) – complemented the Commission’s initiatives. It was, however, the financial crisis that had the greatest impact on the awareness of the interdependence of mortgage markets and of the need for a common EU-wide legal <b>framework</b> for home <b>loans.</b> While mortgage lending moved into the worldwide spotlight with the subprime lending disaster in the US, developments in several European markets served as a gentle reminder that loans for house purchases are not (yet) covered by EU-wide legislation – despite accounting for the lion’s share of the indebtedness of European households. The turmoil has provoked the European Commission to now – after years of consultation – come forward with a proposal for a Directive on credit agreements relating to residential property in March 2011. The Commission simultaneously published the 2008 - 09 study on the costs and benefits of different policy options for mortgage credit and its own impact assessment on the proposed Directive. The EU executive thereby confronts critics from both camps: banks and mortgage lenders, which oppose tougher rules and insist on waiting for the impact of the new Consumer Credit Directive (CCD); and consumer representatives, who fear the proposal will fall short of sufficiently enhancing consumer protection. In May 2010, CEPS and ECRI formed a Task Force in a joint effort to contribute to the debate on how the EU could most efficiently respond to the challenges posed and the deficiencies revealed by the financial crisis in the area of retail credit. Composed of a diverse group of bankers, industry and consumer representatives, independent experts and academics, the group met four times over a period of nine months. The members’ work, and this report resulting from it, closed in February 2011. This report therefore does not contain a full analysis of the proposal for a Directive, which was unknown at the time. However, as per May 2011, it has been updated by the rapporteurs to make cursory references to the Directive. The report starts with an Executive Summary, which comprises observations and general recommendations. It is subdivided in three chapters. Chapters 1 and 2, comparing mortgage credit markets in the EU and the US, and in the EU member states, serve as a background for the discussion in chapter 3 discussing the policy response. The first two chapters are authored by Achim Dübel, chapter 3 by Marc Rothemund in cooperation with Dübel...|$|R
