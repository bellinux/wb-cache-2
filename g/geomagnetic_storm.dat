Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night.

5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storm,</b> {{due to a}} coronal mass {{ejection}} from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E

The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.|$|E
25|$|A {{solar flare}} is a {{phenomenon}} where the sun suddenly releases {{a great amount of}} solar radiation, much more than normal.

500|$|One of {{the major}} {{difficulties}} early in the deployment to Namibia was poor radio communications.

HF radio communications were frequently impossible in the early month {{or two of the}} deployment. The primary factor was the March 1989 <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storm,</b> exacerbated by skip zone, and ground plane effects resulting from the sandy environment and the high water table. [...] Detachments were often out of radio contact for extended periods, with no satisfactory alternate means of communication except couriers.

40|$|A {{further study}} {{is made of}} the {{validity}} of a technique developed by the authors to identify historical occurrences of intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms,</b> which is based on finding approximately coincident observations of sunspots and aurorae recorded in East Asian histories. Previously, the validity of this technique was corroborated using scientific observations of aurorae in Japan during the interval 1957 – 2004 and contemporaneous white-light images of the Sun obtained by the Royal Greenwich Observatory, the Big Bear Solar Observatory, the Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft. The present investigation utilises a list of major <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms</b> in the interval 1868 – 2008, which is based on the magnitude of the AA* magnetic index, and reconstructed solar images based on the sunspot observations acquired by the Royal Greenwich Observatory during the shorter interval 1874 – 1976. It is found that a sunspot large enough to be seen with the unaided eye by an "experienced" observer was located reasonably close to the central solar meridian for almost 90 % of these major <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms.</b> Even an "average" observer would easily achieve a corresponding success rate of 70 % and this success rate increases to about 80 % if a minority of ambiguous situations are interpreted favourably. The use of information on major <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms,</b> rather than modern auroral observations from Japan, provides a less direct corroboration of the technique for identifying historical occurrences of intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms,</b> if only because major <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms</b> do not necessarily produce auroral displays over East Asia. Nevertheless, the present study provides further corroboration {{of the validity of}} the original technique for identifying intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms.</b> This additional corroboration of the original technique is important because early unaided-eye observations of sunspots and aurorae provide the only possible means of identifying individual <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storms</b> during the greater part of the past two millennia...|$|R

2500|$|Annie Scott Dill Maunder was {{a pioneer}} in astronomical photography, {{especially}} of sunspots. A mathematics graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, she was first hired (in 1890) to be an assistant to Edward Walter Maunder, discoverer of the Maunder Minimum, {{the head of the}} solar department at Greenwich Observatory. They worked together to observe sunspots and to refine the techniques of solar photography. They married in 1895. Annie's mathematical skills made it possible to analyse the years of sunspot data that Maunder had been collecting at Greenwich. She also designed a small, portable wide-angle camera with a [...] lens. In 1898, the Maunders traveled to India, where Annie took the first photographs of the sun's corona during a solar eclipse. By analysing the Cambridge records for both sunspots and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storm,</b> they were able to show that specific regions of the sun's surface were the source of geomagnetic storms and that the sun did not radiate its energy uniformly into space, as William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin had declared.|$|E
2500|$|Geomagnetic {{disturbance}} from {{an enhanced}} solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) {{during which the}} interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to {{a higher rate of}} interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("magnetic reconnection"); some blobs ("plasmoids") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storm</b> resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the [...] "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.|$|E
2500|$|The auroras that {{resulted}} from the [...] "great geomagnetic storm" [...] on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, {{are thought to be}} the most spectacular in recent recorded history.

[...] The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 {{as a result of the}} exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by The New York Times that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was [...] "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light". One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory was recording the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>storm,</b> which was then one hour old, at its full intensity.
