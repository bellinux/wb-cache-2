50|$|Harnett painted musical instruments, hanging game, and tankards, {{but also}} painted the {{unconventional}} Golden Horseshoe (1886), a single rusted horseshoe shown nailed to a board. He painted a casual jumble of second-hand books set {{on top of}} a crate, Job Lot, Cheap (1878), as well as firearms and even paper currency. His works sold well, but {{they were more likely to}} be found hanging in a tavern or a business office than in a museum, as they did not conform to contemporary notions of high art. Harnett spent the years 1880 - 1886 in Europe, staying in Munich from 1881 until early 1885. Harnett's best-known paintings, the four versions of After The Hunt, were painted between 1883 and 1885. Each is an imposing composition of hunting equipment and dead game, hanging on a door with ornate hinges at the right and <b>keyhole</b> <b>plate</b> at the left. These paintings, like the horseshoe or currency depictions mentioned earlier, are especially effective as trompe-l'Å“il because the objects occupy a shallow space, meaning that the illusion is not spoiled by parallax shift if the viewer moves.|$|E
