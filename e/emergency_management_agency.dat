The next day, state and federal community relations teams were deployed into Alabama’s disaster-declared counties, to assist residents who suffered from Dennis. The Alabama <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (AEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (FEMA) had 20federal community relations specialists and their state counterparts working in the disaster areas.

This allocated {{federal funding}} for assistance to individual families and public aid to repair public facilities. Federal <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> ultimately provided $63million in aid to the territory. Puerto Ricans living in the United States raised money and collected donations for the residents on the island.|$|E

Memorial Church was also damaged but was repaired more quickly via private donations.|$|E

5|$|According to the Federal <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (FEMA), 1,464 residences {{throughout}} Texas {{were affected}} by Hurricane Humberto. Of these, 25 were destroyed, 96 sustained major damage and 240 sustained minor damage. The cost of individual assistance for those impacted by Humberto would cost $4,776,334; the cost of debris removal and other public assistance amounted to $6,682,074. In terms of per capita income, Jefferson County sustained the most impact, decreasing by $22.38.|$|E
5|$|Although {{impact was}} mostly minor, President George W.

In the city of Meridian, over 300people sought shelter. More than 885people took shelter in Jackson County, and 1,000people were in shelters in neighboring Harrison County. On July 15, three additional counties became eligible for federal assistance, bringing the number of declared disaster areas to 41.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to federal aid, the Federal <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (FEMA) opened five disaster recovery centers, with one in Citrus County, one in Dixie County, one in Leon County, {{and two in}} Levy County. These disaster centers were staffed by representatives of FEMA, the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the Small Business Administration, and other state agencies. FEMA agents also went door-to-door in Tallahassee to ask residents about damage to their property.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the disaster, President George W. Bush {{declared}} 28counties in Texas as disaster areas. The declarations allowed affected citizens to receive aid for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, and other serious disaster-related expenses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a {{baseline}} of information available on state <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> Web sites. State <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> are chosen as the unit of analysis because these state agencies are the managers of multi-level government responses to disasters (Schneider, 1995). Web sites are selected because they are one of the first places the public goes to obtain information about the government (Horrigan, 2004). Through a content analysis of all 50 state <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> Web sites, the paper examines four variables identified in the literature as important markers of effective electronic government communication: democratic outreach, information content, outreach to special needs populations, and intergovernmental relations. The results from this study provide a baseline for future research on state <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> communication and provide insights into how state <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> can improve their Web sites...|$|R

Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{declared}} a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27, and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal <b>Emergency</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.|$|E
