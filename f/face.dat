5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip <b>face</b> point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind <b>face,</b> which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip <b>face,</b> where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip <b>face</b> exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E

40|$|Memory for in-group <b>faces</b> {{tends to}} be better than memory for out-group <b>faces.</b> Ackerman et al. (Psychological Science 17 : 836 – 840, 2006) found that this effect reverses when male <b>faces</b> display anger, {{supposedly}} due to their functional value in signaling intergroup threat. We explored the generalizability of this reverse effect. White participants viewed Black and White male or female <b>faces</b> displaying angry, fearful, or neutral expressions. Recognition accuracy for White male <b>faces</b> was better than for Black male <b>faces</b> when <b>faces</b> were neutral, but this reversed when the <b>faces</b> displayed anger or fear. For female targets, Black <b>faces</b> were generally better recognized than White <b>faces,</b> and female <b>faces</b> were better remembered when they displayed anger rather than fear, whereas male <b>faces</b> were better remembered when they displayed fear rather than anger. These findings are difficult to reconcile with a functional account and suggest (a) that the processing of male out-group <b>faces</b> is influenced by negative emotional expressions in general; and (b) that gender role expectations lead to differential remembering of male and female <b>faces</b> as a function of emotional expressio...|$|R

Viewing <b>faces</b> of one sex with increased eye-spacing and <b>faces</b> of the other sex with decreased eye-spacing simultaneously induced opposite after-effects {{for male and female}} <b>faces</b> (assessed by normality judgments). Viewing <b>faces</b> transformed in identity or masculinity increased preferences for novel <b>faces</b> with characteristics similar to those viewed only when the sex of the <b>faces</b> presented in the adaptation phase and in post-adaptation preference tests were congruent.

Although both doll and human <b>faces</b> were associated with an increased N 170 /VPP from 175 - 200 ms following stimulus onset, only human <b>faces</b> were associated with a sustained positivity beyond 400 ms.
