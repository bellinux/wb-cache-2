Each device and technology used <b>for</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensing</b> (e. g., RFIDs, Bluetooth, low-power radio or infrared communication, etc.) comes with specific biases on the close-range relations it records. Hence it is important to assess which statistical features of the empirical proximity networks are robust across different measurement techniques, and which modeling frameworks generalize well across empirical data. Here we compare time-resolved proximity networks recorded in different experimental settings and show that some important statistical features are robust across all settings considered. The observed universality calls for a simplified modeling approach.

40|$|Abstract. NearMe is a server, algorithms, and {{application}} programming interfaces (APIs) for clients equipped with 802. 11 wireless networking (Wi-Fi) to compute lists {{of people and}} things that are physically nearby. NearMe compares clients ’ lists of Wi-Fi access points and signal strengths to compute the proximity of devices to one another. Traditional location sensing systems compute and compare absolute locations, which requires extensive a priori calibration and configuration. Because we base NearMe entirely on proximity information, NearMe works “out of the box ” with no calibration and minimal setup. Many “location-aware ” applications only require proximity information, and not absolute location: examples include discovering nearby resources, sending an email to other persons who are nearby, or detecting synchronous user operations between mobile devices. As more people use the system, NearMe grows in both the number of places {{that can be found}} (e. g. printers and conference rooms) and in the physical range over which other people and places can be found.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} use of {{electrostatic}} capacitive probes for detections and evaluations of dielectric material properties and flaws. Interest in using both inductive and capacitive arrays <b>for</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensing,</b> surface feature characterization, material properties evaluation, and flaw detecting has increased steadily since the mid- 1980 ’s [1 – 7]. Two other papers [6, 7] in this proceedings also discuss {{the present state of}} the art, particularly with regard to the measurement of lossy dielectrics (complex permittivity). In traditional dielectrometry measurements (as well as in eddy-current measurements of material properties evaluation) varying the probe frequency has long been used as a tool for extracting information about dispersion and loss mechanisms. Use of a spatially periodic array probe interrogates the material, or flaw, with a field that penetrates into the sample to a degree determined by the periodicity. This controllable penetration phenomenon (artificial-skin effect or zoom effect) has been successfully exploited by Melcher, Zaretsky [5], and Goldfine [6] in what they call imposed w-k magnetometry and dielectrometry, using interdigital probes of different periodicities. Details are given in these proceedings. Gammell’s paper [7] gives a progress report on complex permittivity measurements using probes of more conventional type...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} different methods do measure velocity of pistons in pneumatic cylinders at Bosch Rexroth Teknik AB. Through information of velocity the adjustment of a cylinders damping can be done easier. A future transducer will be used by salesmen, service personnel and customers. This requires a sensor that is easy to apply and use. It is also desirable that the sensor is cheap. A number of possible methods to measure velocity have been presented. In general, the requirements above {{have been difficult to}} fulfill. In almost all pneumatic cylinders, magnets are mounted on the piston. Magnetic sensors are then used <b>for</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensing</b> to detect its extreme positions. A similar way can be used for velocity sensing. Assume that two magnetic sensors are placed on a fixed distance between each other, along the pistons direction of motion. The time to travel between the sensors is an expression for the velocity of the piston. One way to solve the problem has been chosen and the accuracy of this method has been verified. This has been done under the assumption that the errors due to mounting is neglected and that the direction of sensitivity is idealistic...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{soft and}} sensory skin-like {{electronic}} structure is developed. A capacitance-type pressure sensor is developed {{that is not}} only flexible but also stretchable, has a wide sensing regime (up to 10 kPa), and high sensitivity (0. 34 kPa- 1). Micropillar sensor arrays inspired by cilia structures found in nature are fabricated using a soft nanolithography technique and electroded with sputtered gold. The arrays are configured for capacitance type pressure sensing in the tactile – touch regime. Several designs are proposed, fabricated, and evaluated to optimize sensitivity and detectability in the low pressure range. Techniques for fabricating asymmetric easy to buckle pillar structures and a multi-level hierarchical design platform are developed. Here, we present the highest reported sensitivity [0. 34 kPa- 1] of a passive capacitance type sensor that is both flexible and stretchable. There is experimental evidence to suggest that the sensor can be configured to detect very low pressures, and or used <b>for</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensing.</b> The influence of pillar design parameters on sensor performance is explored using experimental and computational simulation techniques. The relationship between different pillar deformation modes and sensor characteristics is established and quantified. Computational simulations are carried out in COMSOL to investigate how large conformational changes of the pillars during deformation influence the capacitance readings for the different sensor designs. The simulations are an important tool in solving coupled multiphysics problems and for visualizing complex nonuniform three dimensional electrostatic fields. The simulation results show identical trends to the experiments and excellent correlation is achieved for the full device model. Finally, the microstructured sensor array naturally lends itself to the development of pixel-type pressure sensors and biomedical monitoring devices – the potential for both applications are demonstrated here...|$|E
40|$|Electricity {{has become}} {{prevalent}} in modern day lives. Almost all the comforts people enjoy today, like home heating and cooling, {{indoor and outdoor}} lighting, computers, home and office appliances, depend on electricity. Moreover, the demand for electricity is increasing across the globe. The increasing demand for electricity and the increased awareness about carbon footprints have raised interest {{in the implementation of}} energy efficiency measures. A feasible remedy to conserve energy is to provide energy consumption feedback. This approach has suggested the possibility of considerable reduction in the energy consumption, which is in the range of 3. 8 % to 12 %. Currently, research is on-going to monitor energy consumption of individual appliances. However, various approaches studied so far are limited to group-level feedback. The limitation of this approach is that the occupant of a house/building is unaware of his/her energy consumption pattern and has no information regarding how his/her energy-related behavior is affecting the overall energy consumption of a house/building. Energy consumption of a house/building largely depends on the energy-related behavior of individual occupants. Therefore, {{research in the area of}} individualized energy-usage feedback is essential. The OSEM (Occupant-Specific Energy Monitoring) system presented in this work is capable of monitoring individualized energy usage. OSEM system uses the electromagnetic field (EMF) radiated by appliances as a signature for appliance identification. An EMF sensor was designed and fabricated to collect the EMF radiated by appliances. OSEM uses proximity sensing to confirm the energy-related activity. Once confirmed, this activity is attributed to the occupant who initiated it. Bluetooth Low Energy technology was used <b>for</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensing.</b> This OSEM system would provide a detailed energy consumption report of individual occupants, which would help the occupants understand their energy consumption patterns and in turn encourage them to undertake energy conservation measures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} a magnetic anomaly guidance system that, {{with support from}} the Office of Naval Research, is being developed for fully autonomous detection, localization and classification of ferrous mines in Very Shallow Water/Surf Zone (VSW/SZ) environments. The magnetic guidance system’s hardware configurations and magnetic target signature processing methods specifically have been developed for autonomous guidance of small, maneuverable sensing platforms, such as Underwater Bottom Vehicles, (UBVs), to magnetic targets. The prototype magnetic anomaly guidance is a three-axis magnetometer-gradiometer comprised by an array of triaxial fluxgate magnetometers and triaxial accelerometers. This design allows development of magnetic gradient tensor contraction scalars that provide the basis for a unique method for magnetic guidance of UBVs to underwater and buried mines. The triaxial accelerometer array can be used for mitigation of the target-detection-range-reducing effects of large changes in sensor platform orientation. Field test results indicate that a simple magnetic guidance algorithm based on comparison of the magnitudes of contractions of gradient tensor subsets measured by “primary guidance axes ” of the sensor array will provide a robust and practical method for fully autonomous guidance of high- mobility UBVs to magnetic targets. Target detection range can be enhanced by using rotationally invariant tensor contractions <b>for</b> robust <b>proximity</b> <b>sensing</b> and “pseudo-robust ” scalar total field quantities for “homing in on ” magnetic targets. Sensor system stability and DLC performance also would be improved by the use of better, temperature-compensated magnetometers.

40|$|The {{light sensors}} market is growing, driven largely by {{increased}} use of proximity detection and ambient light sensing (ALS) in consumer electronics. There is high demand for reduced cost and physical size of light sensors, however the spectral filter technology used on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips has not advanced significantly. Plasmonic filters have been proposed as a superior alternative offering reduced cost and thickness, among other advantages. In this work plasmonic filters are investigated in the near infrared (NIR) range <b>for</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensing</b> applications, and the visible range for ALS applications using CMOS compatible materials and fabrication processes. The plasmonic filters are thin metallic films nanostructured {{with an array of}} subwavelength holes that facilitate coupling with surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and localised surface plasmons (LSP). They exhibit extraordinary optical transmission with peak transmission wavelengths controlled by the geometry and size of the hole array. Filters were designed on glass substrate by electromagnetic simulations using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, created using micro and nano-fabrication techniques, and then measured by microspectrophotometry to evaluate their spectral response. Following characterisation, the NIR filter was fabricated directly onto a CMOS chip and the spectral response was assessed by chip measurement for a proof-of-concept demonstration of an integrated device. The NIR plasmonic filter exhibited poor suitability on CMOS due to high order plasmonic resonances in the visible range that were enhanced by Fabry-Pérot resonances supported by the CMOS stack. The most common plasmonic filter, a circular-shaped hole nanostructure, is sensitive to angle of incidence (AOI) making it unsuitable for ALS applications. Preliminary designs for plasmonic ALS filters with low sensitivity to AOI were demonstrated, by characterisation on glass, using a cross-shaped hole nanostructure. Design dimensions that produced this quality were decreased array period and decreased ratio of the cross arm-length to arm-width, due to increased separation between the SPP and LSP resonances generated by the plasmonic hole array filter...|$|E

Ultrasound is a {{well known}} method for {{non-destructive}} testing of materials; however, this age-old method has been stifled by direct or indirect transducer contact with the test media, generally by liquids. As a consequence, {{a substantial number of}} materials cannot be analyzed using ultrasound. While Non-Contact Ultrasound (NCU) would be highly desired, its realization calls for overcoming the natural barrier of massive acoustic impedance in air as well as Zmismatch between STP coupling air and solids.
