5000|$|Haffner Glacier (...) {{is a small}} <b>glacier</b> {{discharging}} into <b>Berg</b> Bay {{along the}} north coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was first charted by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1898-1900, under Carsten. E. Borchgrevink, who named it for Colonel Haffner, Director of the Government Survey of Norway. This glacier lies situated on the Pennell Coast, a portion of Antarctica lying between Cape Williams and Cape Adare.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of {{seasonal}} and interannual ice velocity changes at Polar Record Glacier, East Antarctica, using ERS- 1 / 2, Envisat and PALSAR data with D-InSAR and intensity tracking. Ice flow showed seasonal variations {{at the front of}} the glacier tongue. Velocities in winter were 19 % less than velocities during summer. No significant interannual changes were detected. Ice velocities in the grounding zone and grounded glacier did not show clear seasonal or interannual changes. The distributio of the seasonal variations suggests that the cause for the changes should be localized. Possible causes are seasonal sea-ice changes and iceberg blocking. Satellite images show that the sea ice surrounding Polar Record Glacier undergoes seasonal changes. Frozen sea ice in winter slowed the huge iceberg, and provided increased resistance to the glacier flow. The interaction between the <b>glacier</b> tongue, ice <b>berg</b> and sea ice significantly influences their flow pattern...|$|R
50|$|The {{north face}} {{can be seen}} from Berg Lake, reached by a 19 km hike. The lake is {{approximately}} two km long and lies at 1646 m elevation. There are backcountry campgrounds {{at each end of the}} lake and a log shelter on its banks, named Hargreaves Shelter in honor of the Hargreaves family who operated the Mount Robson Ranch across the Fraser River from the mountain and who outfitted most of the early trips into Berg Lake. The <b>Berg</b> <b>glacier</b> calves directly into the lake. The Robson Glacier, which fills the cirque and valley between Mount Robson and Mount Resplendent, in the early 1900s fed directly into both Berg lake and Adolphus lake, straddling the Continental Divide and draining thus to both the Arctic and Pacific oceans via the Smoky and Robson Rivers, respectively. It since has receded more than 2 kilometres and is the source of the Robson River only.|$|R
