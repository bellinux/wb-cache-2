5|$|Finding Sylvester {{difficult}} to work with, and frustrated by his lack of commercial success, the <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> left Sylvester in late 1974, after which Krasnow canceled his recording contract. At the same time, Sylvester's relationship with Lyons ended, with Lyons himself moving to Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Sylvester was {{considered}} to be a prima donna by members of the <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> and could be temperamental and difficult with those whom he worked with. He found it difficult saving the money that he earned, instead spending it as soon as he obtained it, both on himself and on his lovers, friends, and family.|$|E
5|$|Born in Watts, Los Angeles, to {{a middle-class}} African-American family, Sylvester {{developed}} {{a love of}} singing through the gospel choir of his Pentecostal church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship {{among a group of}} black cross-dressers and transgender women who called themselves The Disquotays. Moving to San Francisco in 1970 at the age of 22, Sylvester embraced the counterculture and joined the avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, producing solo segments of their shows which were heavily influenced by female blues and jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. During the Cockettes' critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere. He came to front Sylvester and his <b>Hot</b> <b>Band,</b> a rock act that released two commercially unsuccessful albums on Blue Thumb Records in 1973 before disbanding.|$|E

5|$|Now {{without the}} <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> or a {{recording}} contract, Sylvester set himself {{up with a}} new band, The Four As, and a new set of backing singers, two black drag queens named Jerry Kirby and Lady Bianca. With this new entourage, he continued to perform at a number of local venues including Jewel's Catch One, a predominantly black gay dance club on West Pico Avenue in Los Angeles, but reviewers were unimpressed with the new line-up, most of whom abandoned Sylvester in December 1974. After a brief sojourn in England, Sylvester returned to San Francisco and assembled three young drag queens to be backing singers: Arnold Elzie, Leroy Davis, and Gerry Kirby. Nevertheless, although he performed at such events as the 1975 Castro Street Fair, success continued to elude him, and he eventually fired Elzie, Davis, and Kirby.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{harmonic}} approximation, the normal modes of a molecule are not coupled, and all vibrational quantum levels are equally spaced, so <b>hot</b> <b>bands</b> {{would not be}} distinguishable from so-called [...] "fundamental" [...] transitions arising from the overall vibrational ground state. However, vibrations of real molecules always have some anharmonicity, which causes coupling between different vibrational modes that in turn shifts the observed frequencies of <b>hot</b> <b>bands</b> in vibrational spectra. Because anharmonicity decreases the spacing between adjacent vibrational levels, <b>hot</b> <b>bands</b> exhibit red shifts (appear at lower frequencies than the corresponding fundamental transitions). The magnitude of the observed shift is correlated {{to the degree of}} anharmonicity in the corresponding normal modes.|$|R
500|$|Sylvester and his <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> {{toured the}} United States, {{receiving}} {{threats of violence}} in several Southern states, where widespread conservative and racist attitudes led to antagonism between the band and locals. In late 1973, the band recorded their second album, Bazaar, which included both cover songs and original compositions by bassist Kerry Hatch. Hatch later commented that the <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> found the album more satisfactory than its predecessor, but nevertheless it again sold poorly. The music journalist Peter Shapiro believed that on these Blue Thumb albums, Sylvester's [...] "cottony falsetto was an uncomfortable match with guitars" [...] and that they both had [...] "an unpleasantly astringent quality".|$|E
500|$|In early 1973, Sylvester and The <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> {{were signed}} by Bob Krasnow to Blue Thumb. On this label, they {{produced}} their first album, {{in which they}} switched their sound from blues to the more commercially viable rock, while the Pointer Sisters were employed as backing singers. Sylvester named this first album Scratch My Flower due to a gardenia-shaped scratch-and-sniff sticker adhered to the cover, although it was instead released under the title of Sylvester and his <b>Hot</b> <b>Band.</b> The album consisted primarily of covers of songs by artists such as James Taylor, Ray Charles, Neil Young, and Leiber and Stoller. Described by one of Sylvester's biographers as lacking in [...] "the fire and focus of the live shows", it sold poorly on release.|$|E
500|$|Returning to San Francisco, Sylvester {{was offered}} the {{opportunity}} to record a demo album by Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner. Financed by A Records, the album featured a cover of Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell's song [...] "Superstar," [...] which had been a recent hit single for The Carpenters; nevertheless, A felt that the work was not commercially viable and declined to release the album. For the album, Sylvester and his manager Dennis Lopez had assembled a group of heterosexual white males—Bobby Blood on trumpet, Chris Mostert on saxophone, James Q. Smith on guitar, Travis Fullerton on drums, and Kerry Hatch on bass—whom he named The <b>Hot</b> <b>Band.</b> After A's initial rejection, the band provided two songs for Lights Out San Francisco, an album compiled by San Francisco's KSAN radio and released on the Blue Thumb label. Gaining a number of local gigs, they were eventually asked to open for English glam rock star David Bowie at the Winterland Ballroom; the gig did not sell particularly well, and Bowie later commented that San Francisco did not need him, because [...] "They've got Sylvester," [...] referring to their shared preference for androgyny.|$|E

2500|$|Executives of Warner Bros. Records (Reprise Records's parent company) told Harris {{they would}} agree to record her if she would [...] "get a hot band". Harris did so, enlisting guitarist James Burton and pianist Glen Hardin, both of whom had played with Elvis Presley as well as Parsons. Burton was a renowned guitarist, {{starting}} in Ricky Nelson's band in the 1950s, and Hardin {{had been a member}} of the Crickets. Other <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> members were drummer John Ware, pedal steel guitarist Hank DeVito, and bassist Emory Gordy, Jr., with whom Harris had worked while performing with Parsons. Singer-songwriter Crowell was enlisted as a rhythm guitarist and duet partner. Harris's first tour schedule originally dovetailed around Presley's, owing to Burton and Hardin's continuing commitments to Presley's band. The <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> lived up to its name, with most of the members moving on with fresh talent replacing them as they continued on to solo careers of their own.|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{left the}} <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> in 1976, {{choosing}} {{to remain with}} Elvis Presley's band, {{and was replaced by}} English guitarist Albert Lee. Harris's commercial apex was Luxury Liner, released in 1977, which remains one of her definitive records. On Luxury Liner, Harris's mix of songs from Chuck Berry ("(You Never Can Tell) C'est la Vie"), Gram Parsons (the title track and [...] "She"), the Carter Family ("Hello Stranger") and Kitty Wells ("Making Believe") illustrate a continuity and artistic merit to country music often overlooked at the time. Even so, many fans expected more original tunes, so she became known as a cover artist. Despite Top Ten singles with [...] "C'est la Vie" [...] and [...] "Making Believe", the album's best-known track is the first recorded cover of Townes Van Zandt's classic [...] "Pancho & Lefty", which would be a No.1 hit for Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard in 1983. At the end of 1977, Crowell left the <b>Hot</b> <b>Band</b> to pursue a solo career; his replacement was bluegrass multi-instrumentalist and singer Ricky Skaggs.|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{moved to}} Nashville in 1982.
