High-technology entrepreneurship for new ventures in emerging economies has taken a critical role in the creation and growth of economies. There is a strong demand for a fresh approach to the study of entrepreneurship in high-technology industry due to the unique nature of its research and development for innovative products. This thesis proposes a different approach, where a model of entrepreneurship with <b>entrepreneurial</b> leadership <b>capacity</b> (EELC) for high-technology ventures is used to enhance the pursuit of modes of entrepreneurial exploitation within good business models and enterprise performance. By including <b>entrepreneurial</b> leadership <b>capacity</b> (ELC) in the entrepreneurial process, it is proposed {{that there would be a}} higher chance for successful ventures. In the EELC model, the independent variables include entrepreneurial type (PA, EI, SS and RM), market orientation, business climate, environmental uncertainty, competitive advantage, and organisational strategy, while the dependent variables comprise presence of opportunity, opportunity recognition, decision for opportunity exploitation, resource acquisition, process management, business models and enterprise performance. It is proposed that independent variables will act on dependent variables only indirectly via an intervening variable that has <b>entrepreneurial</b> leadership <b>capacity</b> (ELC) as the mediator. The EELC model was applied to the high-technology industry, in this case the biotechnology industry, to validate its findings. The survey data was analysed statistically by using Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM) for Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). It was found that entrepreneurial type and market orientation were the two important drivers affecting the <b>entrepreneurial</b> leadership <b>capacity</b> and the vi entrepreneurial process. The role of ELC as the mediator is confirmed to be critical to enhancing the pursuit of modes of entrepreneurial exploitation in the presence of opportunity.

This article suggests how recurrent dualisms may be fruitfully surpassed within a conceptual framework that accommodates the ontological intuitions of both theorizing tendencies. Guarding against the temptation to deny the existence of either unexercised powers or unexploited opportunities not only allows us to resist the seduction of dualisms, but also allows for the emergence of an expanded worldview that enables a more dynamic conceptualization of the entrepreneurship phenomenon.
