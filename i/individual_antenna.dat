The <b>individual</b> <b>antenna</b> elements are connected to a single receiver or transmitter by feedlines that feed the power to the elements in a specific phase relationship. The radio waves radiated by each <b>individual</b> <b>antenna</b> combine and superpose, adding together (interfering constructively) to enhance the power radiated in desired directions, and cancelling (interfering destructively) to reduce the power radiated in other directions. Similarly, when used for receiving, the separate radio frequency currents from the individual antennas combine in the receiver with the correct phase relationship to enhance signals received from the desired directions and cancel signals from undesired directions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the design}} method of a quadruple-band {{rejection}} ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with three co-directional complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs) is proposed.

The shape of the final antenna achieves both the impedance matching of ultra-wideband and the respective resonances at four rejection bands.

50|$|An {{antenna array}} can achieve higher gain (directivity), {{that is a}} {{narrower}} beam of radio waves, than could be achieved by a single antenna. In general, the larger the number of <b>individual</b> <b>antenna</b> elements used, the higher the gain and the narrower the beam. Some antenna arrays (such as military phased array radars) are composed of thousands of individual antennas. Arrays {{can be used to}} achieve higher gain, to give path diversity (also called MIMO) which increases communication reliability, to cancel interference from specific directions, to steer the radio beam electronically to point in different directions, and for radio direction finding (RDF).|$|E
50|$|An {{array antenna}} {{is a set}} of {{multiple}} identical antennas which work together as a single antenna. The <b>individual</b> <b>antenna</b> elements are connected to a single receiver or transmitter by feedlines that feed the power to the elements in a specific phase relationship. The radio waves from the individual antennas combine and superpose, enhancing radiation in certain directions while suppressing radiation in other directions. The purpose of using multiple antennas in this way is to produce a radiation pattern that could not be achieved by a single antenna. Usually the goal is higher gain (directivity), more of the power radiated in a specific direction.|$|E
50|$|In {{broadcast}} engineering, phased arrays {{are used}} by many AM broadcast radio stations to enhance signal strength and therefore coverage {{in the city of}} license, while minimizing interference to other areas. Due to the differences between daytime and nighttime ionospheric propagation at mediumwave frequencies, it is common for AM broadcast stations to change between day (groundwave) and night (skywave) radiation patterns by switching the phase and power levels supplied to the <b>individual</b> <b>antenna</b> elements (mast radiators) daily at sunrise and sunset. For shortwave broadcasts many stations use arrays of horizontal dipoles. A common arrangement uses 16 dipoles in a 4×4 array. Usually this is in front of a wire grid reflector. The phasing is often switchable to allow Beam steering in azimuth and sometimes elevation.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} design of a novel two-element {{horn-reflector}} antenna, which has been used on an interferometer built for studying the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background at an angular scale of ≈ 2 ° and a frequency of 33 GHz. The design consists of a pair of closely packed parabolic mirrors fed by two rectangular corrugated horns, each at an offset angle of 75 ° to the axis of its mirror. The offset angle and the horn-reflector dimensions were chosen so that the antenna has elliptical primary beams producing a synthesized beam with circular lobes.

50|$|The VOR encodes azimuth (direction {{from the}} station) as the phase {{relationship}} between a reference signal and a variable signal. The omnidirectional signal contains a modulated continuous wave (MCW) 7 wpm Morse code station identifier, and usually contains an amplitude modulated (AM) voice channel. The conventional 30 Hz reference signal is frequency modulated (FM) on a 9,960 Hz subcarrier. The variable amplitude modulated (AM) signal is conventionally derived from the lighthouse-like rotation of a directional antenna array 30 times per second. Although older antennas were mechanically rotated, current installations scan electronically to achieve an equivalent result with no moving parts. This is achieved by a circular array of typically 60 directional antennas, the signal to each one being amplitude modulated by the 30 Hz reference signal delayed in phase to match the azimuthal position of each <b>individual</b> <b>antenna.</b> When the composite signal is received in the aircraft, the AM and FM 30 Hz components are detected and then compared to determine the phase angle between them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} {{computing}} pairwise correlation {{as a function}} of frequency can be solved bytwo mathematically equivalent but distinct ways.

The second approach [...] "FX" [...] takes advantage of the factthat convolution is equivalent to multiplication in Fourier domain. It first computes the spectrum for each <b>individual</b> <b>antenna</b> (the F operation), and then multiplies pairwise all antennas for each spectral channel (the X operation). A FX correlator has an advantage over a XF correlators in that the computational complexity is O(N2). Therefore, FX correlators are more efficient for larger arrays.|$|E

50|$|A second {{technique}} {{is to use}} multiple antennas which are fed from the same transmitter or receiver; this is called an array antenna, or antenna array. If the currents are fed to the antennas with the proper phase, due to the phenomenon of interference the spherical waves from the <b>individual</b> <b>antennas</b> combine (superpose) {{in front of the}} array to create plane waves, a beam of radio waves traveling in a specific direction. In directions in which the waves from the <b>individual</b> <b>antennas</b> arrive in phase, the waves add together (constructive interference) to enhance the power radiated. In directions in which the individual waves arrive out of phase, with the peak of one wave coinciding with the valley of another, the waves cancel (destructive interference) reducing the power radiated in that direction. Similarly, when receiving, the currents from radio waves received from desired directions are in phase and when combined in the receiver reinforce each other, while currents from radio waves received from other directions are out of phase and when combined in the receiver cancel each other.|$|R
