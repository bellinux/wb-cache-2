25|$|Poe {{writes about}} five periods in media history: {{the age of}} speech, the age of manuscripts, the age of print, the age of {{audiovisual}} media {{and the age of}} the Internet. He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence and searchability. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such <b>face-to-face</b> <b>communication</b> and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and egalitarian, but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.|$|E

Language learners can significantly improve their communicative competence by developing their ability to use communication strategies (CSs) or strategies for coping with <b>face-to-face</b> oral <b>communication</b> problems. The present study,which is exploratory in nature, primarily aimed at investigating how university students majoring in English for International Communication (EIC) cope with their <b>face-to-face</b> oral <b>communication</b> problems. The participants were 48 students studying at three different Rajamangala Universities of Technology in Thailand. A semi-structured interview was used for data collection. The obtained data were transcribed unfocusedly verbatim and translated from Thai into English. The translated data were then validated and analysed. Based on the role of the language learners when engaged in a conversation,i. e. as the message sender and as the message receiver, the results show two main categories of strategies for coping with <b>face-to-face</b> oral <b>communication</b> problems. The two groups of strategies employed for conveying a message to the interlocutor as the message sender: continuous interaction and discontinuous interaction subcategories and one group of strategies for understanding the message as the message receiver were reported...|$|R

500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in The Guardian, Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, gave his perspective on the Kaycee Nicole case. Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: [...] "Given the mutability of identity, how are we to negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of <b>face-to-face</b> <b>communication,</b> were fixed by recognition of identity?" [...] Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 Social Science Computer Review article that deception on the Internet is a paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in Network and Netplay, in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: [...] "the type of play on the Internet is usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals". More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.|$|E

40|$|As many {{organizations}} {{have begun to}} scale back on flexible work arrangements {{out of concern for}} their potential negative impact on team coordination and innovation, there remains very limited scholarly research that tests the assumptions behind these decisions. The purpose of this research is to investigate the team dynamics associated with team flexibility in an effort to understand whether such concerns may be merited. Using data collected from 99 teams in a U. S. -based Fortune 500 company, I develop and test a model that examines the effects of team location flexibility on multiple forms of team communication and their subsequent impact on idea generation and innovation. Specifically, I investigate whether informal “water cooler” communication is a uniquely important predictor of idea generation and, critically, whether teams in which members work more flexibly are at a greater risk of missing out on these types of interactions. Based on a series of team-level regression analyses supplemented by relative weights analyses, I find that teams with greater location flexibility reported engaging less frequently in two forms of face-to-face informal communication: <b>face-to-face</b> spontaneous work-related <b>communication,</b> and to a lesser extent, <b>face-to-face</b> non-work-related <b>communication.</b> However, teams did not engage less frequently in <b>face-to-face</b> formal <b>communication.</b> Moreover, I find that the type of communication most affected by team location flexibility—face-to-face spontaneous work-related communication—is also the type that has the greatest impact on team idea generation and, consequently, team innovation. Finally, I find evidence that teams were unable to effectively compensate for the loss of <b>face-to-face</b> informal <b>communication</b> by using electronic media, such as email, instant message, or audio/visual communication tools. Taken together, I find that an important type of innovation-related communication is reduced when teams work more flexibly. Future research that builds on these findings is needed, as managers and organizations weigh the potential trade-offs between the benefits of flexible work arrangements for individual employees with the drawbacks of flexibility for teams—particularly on their ability to innovate in unexpected and unplanned ways at the office. 2019 - 06 - 0...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{research}} has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces <b>face-to-face</b> <b>communication,</b> impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers.

However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens, who find it easier to interact socially online. The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities. However, the Internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics.|$|E

As such, this study sheds insights into existing literature through the inspection of the KM factors in one single KM-KS-Collaboration research model that provides an influential theoretical contribution for research in related fields because it suggests that faculty members’ KS is positively related to openness in <b>communication</b> and <b>face-to-face</b> interactive <b>communication.</b> A self-administered questionnaire using a quota-sampling method with 421 usable responses from 94 professors, 154 associate professors, and 173 senior lecturers were gathered.
