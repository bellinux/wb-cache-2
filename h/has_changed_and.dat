5|$|Although {{the metric}} system <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, {{it consisted of}} a basic set of units of measurement, now known as base units. Derived units were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|E
5|$|English Heritage, a {{government}} body {{in charge of}} conservation of historic sites, roughly locates the battlefield in an area 800 to 1600metres (0.5 to 1.0 mile) north {{of the town of}} Barnet. Over the centuries, much of the terrain <b>has</b> <b>changed,</b> <b>and</b> records of the town's boundaries and geography are not detailed enough for English Heritage or historians to conclude the exact location of the battle. Geographical features corresponding to contemporary descriptions allow approximations of where the fighting took place.|$|E

She convinces Cloud to join the group to keep a closer eye on him after noticing his personality <b>has</b> <b>changed,</b> <b>and</b> she follows him in pursuit of the game's antagonist, Sephiroth. Unable to keep him from being manipulated by Sephiroth, she helps him recover after his mind becomes fractured, and they realise their mutual feelings for one another, working together to defeat Sephiroth.|$|E

5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E
5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as {{the flavor of the}} cake changing, and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality <b>has</b> <b>changed,</b> <b>and</b> his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} for the High Line was held, {{followed by the}} opening of the third section of the High Line Park on September 21, and a procession down the High Line. The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts. The first part, costing US$75 million, which opened on September 21, is {{from the end of the}} existing Phase 2 of the High Line to the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue. The second part, the spur, was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> will provide more room to install ambitious artworks curated by the public art program. It will also be integrated with 10 Hudson Yards, which has already been built over the High Line Spur. The spur will include a plinth when it opens in 2018.|$|E

5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E
5|$|The Turtle was {{the first}} {{submersible}} vessel used for combat {{and led to the}} development of what we know today as the modern submarine, forever changing underwater warfare and the face of naval warfare. As such, the Turtle has been replicated many times to show new audience the roots of submarine technology, how much it <b>has</b> <b>changed,</b> <b>and</b> the influence it has had on modern submarines. By the 1950s, historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited the Turtle as “the greatest of the wartime inventions.” The Turtle remains a source of national as well as regional pride, which led to the construction of several replicas, a number of which exist in Bushnell’s home state of Connecticut. As Benjamin Gale noted in 1775, the vessel was “constructed with great simplicity,” and it has thus inspired at least four replicas. Many of these followed the designs set down by Bushnell, with “precise and comprehensive descriptions of his submarine,” which aided the replication process.|$|E
5|$|When Nick returns after {{a seven-year}} absence, he tells Dot he <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> {{is now a}} plumber, {{introducing}} her to his six-year-old daughter Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin). However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds {{various members of the}} community hostage, resulting in an explosion in Kathy's café. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, Sandy (Caroline Pegg), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, Dot is sorry to see Dotty go.|$|E

In their major-label, self-titled, debut album, the band's sound <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> removed their saxophone musician and remained as a 4-piece rock band, using a post-grunge and nu metal sound. The band's sound matured in their third album The Reason and became more melodic. Hoobastank cite Mike Patton as an influence.|$|E

25|$|The Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid uses a {{parallel}} hybrid system HDU {{made by the}} American company Eaton. It comprises inter alia with a 6-speed Eaton automatic gearbox and one electric motor with maximum power of 44kW (60hp). In normal traffic movement the power is on about 28kW (38hp). It operates with a Cummins ISB6.7EV 225B diesel engine, meeting {{the requirements of the}} EEV standard, with a maximum power of 165kW (225hp) and the volume of 6.7 dm. The Eaton gearbox transmits power to the rear axle. All batteries are lithium-ion (Li-Ion) made by the Japanese company Hitachi which have been placed under the platforms inside the vehicle. By this the appearance of the bus <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> the look is different when compared with the traditional diesel engine powered buses. The cost of this system is about 70 thousand Euros.|$|E
25|$|The one ban coin {{was rarely}} seen {{and not in}} demand by either banks or many retailers; the 'situation' <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>and</b> the coin is not uncommonly found (as of 2015). Supermarkets {{continue}} habitually to advertise prices such as 9.99 (lei), and frequently price goods to the precise ban such as 9,47; indeed, as of 2014, {{very few of the}} prices displayed at the Carrefour online site (for example) display prices to the nearest 5 or 10 bani. In practice, manyretailers round totals to the nearest 5 or 10 bani for cash payments, or even whole Leu, although (inter)national supermarket chains generally give exact change. For card payments the exact amount (not rounded) is always charged. The reversion to single ban pricing (and change giving) is perhaps due to the (effective) government drive for shops/businesses to give a receipt, an accurate bon fiscal (to avoid tax evasion) for every transaction. Official notices must be prominently displayed in all shops/restaurants that an accurate receipt must be given.|$|E
