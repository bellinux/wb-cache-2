25|$|In other words, {{according}} to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise {{because of any}} conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. <b>If</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|E
25|$|Astrobiology is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates considering what life requires, what, <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>is</b> special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E

However, Ellie objects and dedicates herself to help Volkoff restore his identity, to which Chuck agrees. Casey grudgingly and reluctantly supports them, before sealing the will in a secret safe deep in the Castle.|$|E

500|$|Never Say Never Again was broadly welcomed {{and praised}} by the critics: Ian Christie, {{writing in the}} Daily Express, said that Never Say Never Again was [...] "one of the better Bonds", finding the film [...] "superbly witty and entertaining,... the {{dialogue}} is crisp and the fight scenes imaginative." [...] Christie also thought that [...] "Connery has lost none of his charm and, <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>is</b> more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero." [...] David Robinson, writing in The Times also concentrated on Connery, saying that: [...] "Connery... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way". For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo [...] "very nearly make it all worthwhile." [...] The reviewer for Time Out summed up Never Say Never Again saying [...] "The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher {{is the fact that}} Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Platonism" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} {{scholars}} {{to refer to the}} intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the Republic, Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real <b>if</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is,</b> Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the Theaetetus, he says such people are eu amousoi (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, [...] "happily without the muses" [...] (Theaetetus 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, and people like him, access to higher insights about reality.|$|E
2500|$|The Court did {{not find}} {{the timing of the}} {{regulation}} to be fatal. [...] "either antiquity nor contemporaneity with the statute is a condition of validity." [...] It was [...] "irrelevant" [...] that it was issued in advance of a case to be heard by the Supreme Court. He also found the regulation to be rational. [...] "It seems to us perfectly possible to draw a line, as the regulation does, between [...] and ... all other payments." [...] Nor did he find the prior documents in which representatives of the Comptroller's office had said that they did not consider late fees could be considered as interest payments adequately controlling since they did not fully represent an official agency position. [...] "What these statements show, <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>is</b> that there was good reason for the Comptroller to promulgate the new regulation, in order to eliminate uncertainty and confusion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Istrati scandal touches another {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} Stelist policies: their Iron Guard-inherited antisemitism. Stelescu sent {{the message in}} November 1934, when he criticized ethnic minorities for monopolizing the job market: [...] "Factory positions for Romanian workers, our own kind first and <b>if</b> <b>anything</b> <b>is</b> left we would gladly share it with the foreigner, if he is indeed in need of." [...] According to Veiga, Istrati [...] "toned down the antisemitism of Stelescu and his followers, but the [...] Movement {{continued to be a}} far-right one." [...] Also, [...] "the disillusionment he felt toward Soviet communism did not manage to make Istrati into a fascist; quite the contrary, he was the one to influence Stelescu, making him renounce, for instance, his antisemitism." [...] Among the Crusade men, Prince Karadja witnessed first-hand the application of antisemitic terror in 1930s Germany, and was already taking measures to protect the Jewish Romanian expatriates.|$|E
2500|$|Modern Singapore {{was founded}} on 6 February 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles, {{an officer of the}} British East India Company and Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, in an attempt to counter Dutch {{domination}} of trade in the East. Permission for the East India Company to set up a [...] "factory" [...] on the island was obtained from the Sultan of Johor and Temenggung of Johor on that date, and outright cession of Singapore took place in 1824. It has been suggested that prior to British acquisition of the island, the Malay chief in charge of Singapore was the Temenggung of Johor. The Johor Sultanate was the successor of the Malacca Sultanate, both of which had their own codes of law. It is also possible that adat law, often inadequately translated as [...] "customary law", governed the inhabitants of the island prior to its acquisition by the British. However, little, <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>is</b> known about the laws that were actually applicable. The British have always assumed that no law prevailed on the island of Singapore when it was acquired.|$|E
