The load-extension behavior and forming limit strains are measured to quantify the formability. The influence of friction stir welding parameters on the height of <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> was also studied. The base materials used for welding trials are AA 6061 T 6 and AA 5052 H 32 alloy sheets of 2. 1 -mm thickness.

But the presence of <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> has changed the limiting minor strain, more toward plane-strain condition, indicating the change in strain-path toward plane-strain.

It consists indirect electrical heating of {{the ends of the}} work pieces to be welded and forging them together. While heating, a thermal distribution characterized by a steep temperature gradient is established along the axial length of the pieces. <b>Flash</b> butt <b>welding</b> is widely used for steel band welding m wheel industry. Major advantages are economical in operation, suitable for mass production and high in joint strength. Loadstar (pvt) Ltd has six flash butt machines in different production lines for rim and band manufacturing. The major problem is considerably high amount of scrap percentage due to welding cracks. This problem severely affects the lines which have severe forming or stretching operations in latter stages. For this investigation the line 05 was selected which has high scrap percentage. The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the <b>flash</b> butt <b>welding</b> cracks in rim manufacturing and to find out the main reasons for the defects. The analysis of <b>flash</b> butt <b>welding</b> cracks in nm manufacturing is done m five stages. In the first stage, attention is paid to literature survey, in which the present stage of the researches carried out in the industry regarding the <b>flash</b> butt <b>welding</b> is discussed. Only few literature sources are available although there are many wheel manufacturing companies- [...] in the world. Certainly there might be a lot of researches carried out under this topic in the history,' but due to high competitiveness among the companies the research outcomes might be kept as company secrets.

Vickers microindentation hardness measurements were performed at different distances from the weld interface. The results show a small decrease in hardness near the 6013 alloy weld interface. On the other hand, there is an important hardness drop near the 6061 weld interface. This drop can be explained by a lack of fine structural precipitation during the aging treatment in the 6061 weld interface zone. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

50|$|Upset welding (UW)/resistance {{butt welding}} is a welding {{technique}} that produces coalescence simultaneously {{over the entire}} area of abutting surfaces or progressively along a joint, by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current through the area where those surfaces are in contact..Pressure is applied before heating is started and is maintained throughout the heating period. The equipment used for upset welding {{is very similar to}} that used for <b>flash</b> <b>welding.</b> It can be used only if the parts to be welded are equal in cross-sectional area. The abutting surfaces must be very carefully prepared to provide for proper heating.The difference from <b>flash</b> <b>welding</b> is that the parts are clamped in the welding machine and force is applied bringing them tightly together. High-amperage current is then passed through the joint, which heats the abutting surfaces. When they have been heated to a suitable forging temperature an upsetting force is applied and the current is stopped. The high temperature of the work at the abutting surfaces plus the high pressure causes coalescence to take place. After cooling, the force is released and the weld is completed.|$|E

Once the pieces of metal reach the proper temperature, they are pressed together, effectively forge welding them together.|$|E

50|$|Modern forge-welding {{is often}} automated, using computers, machines, and {{sophisticated}} hydraulic-presses {{to produce a}} variety of products {{from a number of}} various alloys. For example, steel pipe is often forge-welded during the manufacturing process. Flat stock is heated and fed through specially-shaped rollers that both form the steel into a tube and simultaneously provide the pressure to weld the edges into a continuous seam. Diffusion bonding is a common method for forge welding titanium alloys in the aerospace industry. In this process the metal is heated while in a press or die. Beyond a specific critical-temperature, which varies depending on the alloy, the impurities burn out and the surfaces are forced together. Other methods include <b>flash</b> <b>welding</b> and percussion welding. These are resistance forge-welding techniques where the press or die is electrified, passing high current through the alloy to create the heat for the weld. Shielded active-gas forge-welding is a process of forge welding in an oxygen-reactive environment, to burn out oxides, using hydrogen gas and induction heating.|$|E

40|$|Railway rails {{are today}} often {{continuously}} welded. This type of joint generally requires less maintenance than {{is needed for}} the bolted joints. It has also reduced wheel damage and made the ride more comfortable. However, these joints are subject to damage.

The thesis deals with the finite element simulation of two manufacturing processes, <b>flash</b> butt <b>welding</b> of rails and laser cladding of railheads, and the subsequent service life of the welds under operating conditions. Welding of rails, elasto-plastic material modelling, in particular for material subject to cooling from a melted state, fatigue and general issues in computational welding mechanics are discussed. Experimental data and materials characteristics were collected from full-scale measurements of production welds, at the welding site, and from materials testing of smaller specimens. The microstructure and the material characteristics of both the base and welded materials, in the interval - 40 °C to + 600 °C, for the rail steel R 260 (900 A) were investigated.

Titanium industrial powders, type PT 5 - 1 were used as original substance. Forming of blanks, whose chemical composition corresponded to BT 1 - 0 alloy, was carried out using the powder metallurgy method.

During welding the microstructure of basic metal consisting of grains of an a-phase, with sizes 40 [...] . 70 mkm, is transformed for the seam weld and HAZ into the lamellar structure of an a-phase.

40|$|Generally about 80 {{percent of}} railway tracks are welded by flash-butt welding that {{consists}} of electrical heating and hydraulic forging. The service performance of such welds is affected by their ability to support the service loads without fatigue damage or fracture. Horizontal split-web fractures, which may involve splitting of rail head, are of main concern because of potential risk of a catastrophic derailment. In this paper, failure analysis of three broken <b>flash</b> <b>welded</b> rails is presented. The investigation included chemical analysis, hardness measurement, SEM fractography, and microstructural characterization. The crack path consisted of two regions where after initial propagation parallel to the rail surface it tended to propagate on a slant surface. Fractographic analysis showed that high cycle fatigue was the main failure mechanism. Crack initiation sites were located at welded zones and were associated with large inclusions that were not properly removed during chiseling of upset material. Fatigue crack propagation was confined to planes parallel to the rail surface. Crack branching occurred after considerable unstable fast fracture.
