5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E

50|$|Angle parking, {{known as}} echelon parking in Britain, {{is similar to}} {{perpendicular}} parking for these vehicles, except that cars are arranged {{at an angle to}} the aisle (an acute angle with the direction of approach). The gentler turn allows easier and quicker parking, narrower aisles, and thus higher density than perpendicular parking. While in theory the aisles are one-way, in practice they are typically wide enough to allow two cars to pass slowly when drivers go <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisles <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> way.|$|R
25|$|For {{the second}} time in the Seven Days, however, Jackson was late. A guide from the 4th Virginia Cavalry, Pvt. John Henry Timberlake, had {{misunderstood}} Jackson's intent and led him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> road. After they counter-marched, losing about an hour, Jackson's troops found the road to Old Cold Harbor obstructed by trees felled by the retreating Union army and were harassed by sharpshooters, delaying their arrival. The first of Jackson's command to reach the battlefield was the division of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, who was met by Lee's aide, Walter Taylor, and instructed to move into action immediately. Lee was concerned that Porter would counterattack the weakened troops of A.P. Hill, so he ordered Longstreet to conduct a diversionary attack to stabilize the lines until Jackson's full command could arrive and attack from the north. In Longstreet's attack, Brig. Gen. George E. Pickett's brigade attempted a frontal assault and was beaten back under severe fire with heavy losses. Pickett himself took a bullet to the shoulder, putting him out of action for the next few months; Col. Eppa Hunton of the 8th Virginia assumed command of the brigade. Confederate President Jefferson Davis was among the party witnessing Pickett's failed attempt.|$|E
25|$|The second non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 14 January 1969. It involved a BUA mainline BAC One-Eleven 201AC (registration: G-ASJJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Milan's Linate Airport to London Gatwick. This {{was the same}} aircraft BUA had used to operate the One-Eleven's inaugural revenue service. On {{the day of the}} accident, the aircraft had been diverted to Linate on the outbound flight because of fog at Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo Airport. A normal take-off run was followed by a bang immediately after the aircraft had become airborne. The captain in the jumpseat who was supervising the co-pilot at the time thought that there was a problem with the no. 1 engine. He advised the pilot in command to close the throttle a short while later. The pilot in command followed this advice and lowered the nose pitch from 12 to six degrees. The engine shutdown was accompanied by an decrease in airspeed from 140 knots (161mph/ 259km/h to 115 kn (132mph / 212km/h). Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing on snow-covered sand about two miles from the end of runway 18, there were no fatalities among the 33 occupants (seven crew and 26 passengers) though there were two serious injuries. The accident investigators concluded that this crash was caused by the crew failing to recognise their mistake, which had resulted in shutting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> engine (no. 1) in error following a compressor bang/surge in the no. 2 engine. In addition, the crew did not notice that an inadvertent movement of the relevant throttle lever had partially reduced the no. 2 engine's thrust.|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} was {{nominated}} for five Teen Choice Awards and won four of them, including [...] "Choice Drama/Action Adventure Show" [...] and [...] "Choice Actor: Drama/Action Adventure", which Adam Brody won {{for the third consecutive}} year.

IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories", and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens". In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise.

500|$|That spring, Union Maj. Gen. [...] George B. McClellan, {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, launched the Peninsula Campaign intending to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. In his memoirs, Longstreet would claim that he wrote to Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson proposing that he march to Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley and combine forces. No evidence has emerged for this claim. Longstreet executed well as a rear guard commander following the Siege of Yorktown at Williamsburg on May 5. There, he launched a counterattack against Joseph Hooker's division with the brigades of Cadmus M. Wilcox, A. P. Hill, George Pickett and two other regiments. The assault drove Hooker's troops back, securing the passage of Confederate supply wagons and delaying the advance of Union McClellan's army toward Richmond. During the Battle of Seven Pines he marched his men {{in the wrong direction}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> road, causing congestion and confusion with other Confederate units, diluting the effect of the massive Confederate counterattack against McClellan.

2500|$|Despite his qualities as a batsman, he {{was known}} to {{struggle}} against spin bowling. He has been dismissed (out) in the past by several spin bowlers, including the former Pakistan and Indian spinners, Mushtaq Ahmed and Anil Kumble. After achieving a successful first year in the international cricket, he encountered Mushtaq Ahmed when Pakistan visited Australia in the 1995‚Äì96 season. He was unable to pick which way Mushtaq's deliveries were turning and was continuously dismissed in the tournament by being declared Leg before wicket or being bowled, either playing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> line or not offering shot to a googly that turned into his stumps. He was subsequently replaced by Ricky Ponting, but in 1996 he regained his batting position after Ponting himself had fallen upon hard times. Blewett then performed well with the bat, until the 1998 tour to India, where he struggled against Kumble and he was dropped in favour of Justin Langer. However, upon the retirement of [...] captain Mark Taylor in 1999, Blewett was selected to become an opening batsman, until he was dropped from the Australian team in favour of [...] Matthew Hayden in early 2000 after a period of poor performances, which ended his international career.
