40|$|International audienceGeneric {{technologies}} {{enable to}} create benefits across {{wide range of}} industrial applications. Though providing important insights on <b>generic</b> <b>technologies</b> commercialization, less {{attention was paid to}} <b>generic</b> <b>technologies</b> creation. Then, is it possible to design directly <b>generic</b> <b>technologies?</b> Can the intention to build genericity be expressed ex ante? The proposed study indicates that formal design theories provide powerful mechanism of genericity construction when the environments are initially fixed and partially unknown. It is demonstrated that starting point to design generic technology is a generic concept. In addition to a concept definition proposed by C-K theory, the descriptors associated to the domain of existence were added. The generic concept targets the existence domains that are not reduced to one solution but several of them both known or partially unknown. Moreover, it is highlighted that different descriptors of existence domain can lead to various genericity levels. The economic reasoning behind the genericity building provides insights on the dynamics of engineering systems...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFollowing {{the open}} {{innovation}} paradigm, many technological firms organize idea contests to surface bright ideas for new products, services or business models. This {{article focuses on}} {{a new form of}} innovation contest: the <b>generic</b> <b>technology</b> idea contest, which aims to design technological platforms that can enable emerging applications in various business domains to be economically addressed. Based on the analysis of a series of innovation contests conducted by STMicroelectronics, this research points out main elements of the <b>generic</b> <b>technology</b> ideas contest: challenge initiation, idea generation and collection, genericity identification, enrichment and its reward system. The findings indicate that such innovation contests do not fundamentally establish commercial relations between seekers and solvers as usually described in the literature. Rather, this type of contests aims to build design communities who are able to collectively explore the potential of technological platforms. Managerial recommendations, key mechanisms for enhancing the genericity of ideas and probing questions are formulated to facilitate the organization of <b>generic</b> <b>technology</b> innovation contests by high-tech firms...|$|R

Double unknown refers toa {{situation in which}} the level of uncertainty is high and both technology and markets are as-yet-unknown. This situation can be an opportunityfor new discoveries, creation of new performance solutions and giving direction to portfolio structuring. The literature highlights that the double unknown situation is a prerequisite to designinggeneric technologies that are able to address many existing and emerging markets and create value across a broad range of applications. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigatethe initial phases of generic technology governance and associated portfolio structuring in multi-project firms. We studiedthree empirical contexts of portfolio structuring at the European Semiconductor provider STMicroelectronics. The results demonstrate that 1) portfolio management for <b>generic</b> <b>technologies</b> is highly transversal and comprises creating both modules to address market complementarities and the core element of a technological system – the platform and 2) the design of <b>generic</b> <b>technologies</b> requires "cross-application" managers who are able to supervise the interactions among innovative concepts developed in different business and research groups and who are responsible for structuring and managing technological and marketing exploration portfolios within the organizational structures of a company...|$|E

40|$|The basic {{competitive}} {{model with}} freely available technology is suited for static industries but misleading {{as applied to}} major innovative economies for which development of new technologies equals in magnitude around 10 % of gross domestic investment. We distinguish free <b>generic</b> <b>technology</b> from proprietary technologies resulting from risky investment with uncertain outcome. The totality of possible outcomes drives the national innovation system and the returns to a particular successful technology cannot be compared to its own direct investment costs. Eureka moments are hardly ever self-enabling and incentives are required to motivate investment attempting {{to turn them into}} an innovation. The alternative to a valuable proprietary innovation is not the same innovation freely available but the unchanged <b>generic</b> <b>technology.</b> Growth is concentrated in any country at any time in a few firms in a few industries that are achieving metamorphic technological progress as a result of breakthrough innovations. So long as the entry and exit of firms using the <b>generic</b> <b>technology</b> sets the price in an industry, one or more price-taking firms can coexist with proprietary technologies yielding more or less substantial quasi-rents to the sunk development costs. Consumer welfare is increased if an innovator creates a proprietary technology such that the market equilibrium price is reduced and output increased. If the technological breakthrough is sufficiently large for the innovator to drive all generic producers out of the industry and increase output as a wealth-maximizing monopolist, consumer welfare is surely increased. After some time, the innovative technology will diffuse into an imitative <b>generic</b> <b>technology.</b> The best innovators develop a stream of innovations so that technological leaders can maintain their status as dominant firm or monopolist for extended periods of time despite lagged diffusion, and consumers benefit from this stream as well. The economics of an innovative nation are {{different from those of the}} no-growth stationary state which we teach and fall back on. We propose an ambitious agenda to integrate major research streams treating innovation as an object of economic analysis into our standard models. ...|$|R
