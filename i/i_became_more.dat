2500|$|Although {{raised in}} a {{strongly}} religious Protestant household, de Forest later became an agnostic. In his autobiography, he wrote that {{in the summer of}} 1894 there was an important shift in his beliefs: [...] "Through that Freshman vacation at Yale <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> of a philosopher than I have ever since. And thus, one by one, were my childhood's firm religious beliefs altered or reluctantly discarded." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other superstar {{recording}} artists, including Cyndi Lauper, followed. Lauper and Madonna {{were seen}} as trailblazers of women's sexual liberation. Lauper's debut album She's So Unusual (1983) generated a large following of fans responding to the [...] "gay-friendly camp and lesbian-friendly womyn power epitomized in [...] femme anthem 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun'." [...] Lauper explained that growing up during the 1960s influenced her dedication to fair and equal treatment of all people, noting that {{the music of the}} 1960s [...] "helped to open the world's point of view to change." [...] According to Lauper [...] "It wasn't until my sister came out in the early [...] that <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> aware of the bigoted slurs and the violence against a community of people...who were gay." [...] Lauper has since become an active gay rights activist, often encouraging LGBT people and their allies to vote for equal rights. Political activism for LGBT rights was the theme of Lauper's annual True Colors Tour.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{have often}} been {{compared}} to Sonic Youth, and they were once described as [...] "The Sonic Youth of the Southern Hemisphere", with Trouser Press describing their early sound as [...] "hard, droning, unforgiving guitar music with occasional lapses into verse/chorus regularity". By Tanker their sound had become more conventional. With their relocation to New York, their sound also shifted, with the band's next releases described as [...] "an unholy collision between The Beatles harmonies and The Velvet Underground dissonance", with Parker stating {{at the time that}} the band were getting into [...] "the harmonic value of distortion; we started to be very particular about where we set the instruments up and the angles the sounds were bouncing at. From these harmonic experiments <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> interested in the actual melodic content of the music". Pitchfork Media described them in 1999 as [...] "a huge mess of sound that's simultaneously beautiful, jagged, atonal, and supremely melodic", while another review in the same year described their sound as [...] "one part Superchunk, one part Pixies, and one part Dinosaur Jr." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} NAD-dependent state 4 {{and state}} 3 respiration, NADH oxidation and Complex I specific activity in liver mitochondria from 4 - and 30 -month-old rats. All the activities examined were significantly decreased with aging. In {{both groups of}} animals, the flux control coefficients measured by rotenone titration indicated that Complex I is largely rate controlling upon NADH aerobic oxidation while, in state 3 respiration, it shares the control with other steps in the pathway. Moreover, we observed a trend wherein flux control coefficients of Complex <b>I</b> <b>became</b> higher with age. This indication was strengthened by examining the rotenone inhibition thresholds showing that Complex <b>I</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> rate controlling, over all the examined activities, during aging. Our results point out that age-related alterations of the mitochondrial functions are also present in tissues considered less prone to accumulate mitochondrial DNA mutations...|$|R
