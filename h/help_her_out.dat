500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez {{said she}} liked the pairing of Poehler and Theroux, but found [...] "Leslie's House" [...] slower than {{previous}} episodes, and felt the comedic talents of Ansari and Offerman were underused.

Club favorably compared [...] "Leslie's House" [...] to [...] "Dinner Party", an episode of The Office, the other comedy series created by Parks co-creator Greg Daniels.

Heisler said the fact that the characters liked each other so much in Parks and Recreation differentiated itself from the other series in a positive way.|$|E
