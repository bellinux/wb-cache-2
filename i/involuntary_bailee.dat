6000|$|Lord Tennyson is {{probably}} the most extensive <b>Involuntary</b> <b>Bailee</b> at present living. The term [...] "Involuntary Bailee" [...] {{may or may not be}} a correct piece of legal terminology; at all events, it sounds very imposing, and can be easily explained.|$|E
60|$|An <b>Involuntary</b> <b>Bailee</b> is {{a person}} to whom people (generally unknown to him) send things which he {{does not wish to}} receive, but which they are anxious to have returned. Most of us in our humble way are or have been Involuntary Bailees. When some one you meet at dinner {{recommends}} to your notice a book (generally of verse), and kindly insists on sending it to you next day by post as a loan, you are an <b>Involuntary</b> <b>Bailee.</b> You have the wretched book in your possession; no inducement would make you read it, and to pack it up and send it back again requires a piece of string, energy, brown paper, and stamps enough to defray the postage. Now, surely no casual acquaintance or neighbour for an hour at a dinner-party has any right thus to make demands on a man's energy, money, time, brown paper, string, and other capital and commodities.|$|E
60|$|In no way can the {{recipient}} avoid making {{enemies of the}} authors of all these communications if he is at all an honest, irascible man. Mr. Dickens used to reply to total strangers, and to poets like Miss Ada Menken, with a dignified and sympathetic politeness which disarmed wrath. But he probably thereby did but invite fresh trouble of the same kind. Mr. Thackeray (if a recently-published answer was a fair specimen) used to answer more briefly and brusquely. One thing is certain. No criticism not entirety laudatory, which the <b>Involuntary</b> <b>Bailee</b> may make of his correspondent's MS., will be accepted without remonstrance. Doubtless Lord Tennyson has at last chosen the only path of safety by declining to answer his unknown correspondents, or to return their rubbish, any more.|$|E
6000|$|All day Maitland had {{scarcely}} tasted {{anything that}} might reasonably be called food. [...] "He had eaten; he had not dined," [...] to adopt the distinction of Brillat-Savarin. He had been dependent on the gritty and flaccid hospitalities of refreshment-rooms, on the sandwich and the bun. Now he felt faint as well as weary; but, rummaging amidst his cupboards, he could find no provisions more tempting and nutritious than a box of potted shrimps, from the college stores, {{and a bottle of}} some Hungarian vintage sent by an advertising firm to the <b>involuntary</b> <b>bailees</b> of St. Gatien's. Maitland did not feel equal to tackling these delicacies.|$|R
5000|$|Voluntary vs. In{{voluntary}}. In {{a voluntary}} bailment, the bailee agrees {{to accept responsibility}} for possession of the goods. In an <b>involuntary</b> bailment, the <b>bailee</b> has possession of the goods without intent to do so. A common situation that creates voluntary bailment is when a person leaves goods with someone for service (e.g., dry cleaning, pet grooming, car tune-up). The bailee must hold the goods safe for the bailor to reclaim within a reasonable time. An involuntary (or constructive) bailment occurs when a person comes into possession of property accidentally or mistakenly, as where a lost purse or car keys are found and need to be protected until properly redelivered - a bailment is implied by law.|$|R
60|$|If {{the book}} be sent as a present, {{the crime is}} less black, though still very culpable. You need take no notice of the present, whereby you {{probably}} offend the author for life, and thus {{get rid of him}} anyhow. Commonly, he is a minor poet, and sends you his tragedy on John Huss; or he is a writer on mythological subjects, and is anxious to weary you with a theory that Jack the Giant Killer was Julius Caesar. At the worst, you can toss his gift into the waste-paper basket, or sell it for fourpence three-farthings, or set it on your bookshelf so as to keep the damp away from books of which you are not the <b>Involuntary</b> <b>Bailee,</b> but the unhappy purchaser. The case becomes truly black, as we have said, when the uncalled-for tribute has to be returned. Then it is sure to be lost, when the lender writes to say he wishes to recover it. In future he will go about telling people that the recipient stole his best ideas from the manuscript (if it was a manuscript) which he pretends to have lost.|$|E
50|$|An {{exception}} {{to all the}} above {{is the case of}} an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bailee,</b> one who by not intentional acts is made a bailee. For example, if one is given a stock certificate but {{it turns out to be}} the wrong certificate (intended for someone else), he is an unintentional bailee, he has made no intentional act to become a bailee. He is therefore entitled to divest himself of the certificate regardless of a duty of care, so long as he does no malicious or intentional harm to another.|$|E
