The south coast filled with holiday-goers during the summer months, increasing the demand for medical treatment. NLA was at the time funded through donations and needed {{to find new ways to}} promote itself. They found a suitable natural helipad at the former director mansion of Arendal Smelteverk, situated on the island of Bu√∏ya in the then municipality of Moland. NLA lacked sufficient funding for the project, so they made an agreement where the employees could bring themselves and their families for a free vacation at the mansion in exchange for <b>duty</b> <b>time.</b> NLA continued to operate a summer base in Arendal every summer.|$|E

25|$|Flight day 4 saw Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken get all {{the tools}} they need ready for their spacewalk on flight day 5. While Patrick and Behnken were getting the tools ready, {{commander}} George Zamka and ISS flight engineer Soichi Noguchi swapped out the Hard Upper Torso (HUT) on Bob Behnken's suit, since the original HUT had developed {{a problem with a}} wire harness and was not powering the Wireless Video System (WVS) or the heaters in his gloves and boots. Once the swap was complete, Zamka and Noguchi tested the suit successfully. The crew also performed a number of transfer related activities during the morning of their work day. After a joint meal together, the crew of STS-130 and ISS commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer T.J. Creamer conducted a PAO event with T.V. stations in Sacramento, California, Mobile, Alabama and a radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. Once the PAO event was finished, the joint crews had some off <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> {{for the rest of the}} day. Before the two crews went to bed they conducted a spacewalk procedures review, then got Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken into the Quest Airlock. Behnken and Patrick spent the night there at 10.2 psi instead of at the station's 14.6 psi, breathing pure oxygen for an hour before and after their sleep period in order to prevent decompression sickness.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Coast Guard {{personnel}} {{stationed in}} Vietnam were encouraged by their commands to donate off <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> {{to assist in}} various civic action programs supporting the Vietnamese people. Squadron One personnel participated as time permitted in an island adoption program {{that was designed to}} provide educational materials and medical treatment to inhabitants of the many coastal islands in their area of operation. This program was offered to counter Viet Cong propaganda and promote {{a better understanding of the}} South Vietnamese government and USAID rural development programs. Since medical personnel were normally not a part of the make-up of the Squadron One patrol boat crews, medical corpsmen were borrowed from Squadron Three cutters or nearby U.S. Navy units. Division 11 crews constructed a fresh water well and distribution system in addition to constructing voting booths on Hon Thom Island. Division 12 cutters helped evacuate refugees from the vicinity of Cape Batangan when military operations intensified during 1967. Division 13 personnel spent many hours of off <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> at the children's ward of the U.S. Army 36th Medevac Hospital and gave games, toys, clothing and candy to injured Vietnamese children. During the Christmas holidays, at local orphanages all squadron personnel distributed gifts of candy and toys as well as clothing, soap and toothpaste that had been donated by Coast Guard families in the United States and brought to Vietnam on the Commandant's airplane. Squadron One crews arranged for transportation of a small girl by an U.S. Air Force helicopter to [...] for eye surgery while the squadron commander personally delivered a cornea for transplant.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of the HOS was enacted in 1938, and four {{revisions}} have been made since. The more recent revisions have relied on research into the human circadian rhythm (the tendency for humans to follow a natural 24-hour cycle with 8hours of uninterrupted sleep). As of July 1, 2013, a driver is limited to 11hours of actual driving within a 14-hour period, and requires a 30-minute break during the first 8 hours of on <b>duty</b> <b>time.</b> After which he/she must rest for 10hours.

However, {{instead of}} a much-needed complete overhaul, she received only emergency repairs to get quickly back on duty. The preferred SUBSAFE program required increased submarine overhaul times, from 9 months in length to 36 months. Intensive vetting of submarine component quality, SUBSAFE, was required, coupled with various improvements and intensified structural inspections‚Äì particularly, hull-welding inspections using ultrasonic testing‚Äì and reduced availability of critical parts like seawater piping. Cold War pressures prompted US Submarine Force Atlantic (SUBLANT) officers to seek ways to cut corners.
