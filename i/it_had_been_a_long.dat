25|$|The British {{had responded}} to the French {{challenge}} in North America by striking {{at the heart of}} New France. Though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and costly series of campaigns, it proved {{to be one of the}} most successful of Pitt's policies. While a modest French presence remained in Illinois and Louisiana the fighting served to end any significant French military threats in North America for good.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey for Arizona to get {{to their}} first Super Bowl appearance. [...] After winning the NFL {{championship}} in 1947, it would take the team half a century (and moves to two different states) before they won another postseason game in the 1998 season.

2500|$|Established in 1918, the EUS {{has always}} placed a large {{emphasis}} on furthering traditions {{much like a}} fraternity. Unlike a fraternity the EUS membership was never gender specific. These traditions primarily involve socializing, drinking and ritual. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> held view that these behaviours were tolerated and encouraged by the Engineering Faculty and engineering profession as they imbue engineering students {{with a sense of}} identity as engineers and that this identity leads to a more cohesive professional body. [...] Many of these traditions were identified as being sexist [...] and {{in the last two decades}} have gradually been eliminated.|$|E
2500|$|Vergne {{believed}} he could have challenged Buemi for the race victory. He revealed he worked hard to conserve {{a large amount of}} electrical energy, waiting for his chance to attack Buemi: [...] "The car was so much better, I was faster than him in the second stint considering how little energy I was consuming and unfortunately a failure broke all those chances. A lot of hard work disappeared in an instant." [...] Frijns said he was delighted to finish in a points-scoring position but felt the event was [...] "one of the more bizarre races of my career" [...] and believed luck was beside him. He stated <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time since he had scored points and his sixth-place finish was [...] "significant" [...] for himself and his team. Dillmann said his maiden race was [...] "really good fun" [...] following his battle with di Grassi and Piquet, but that he had to learn everything when the day started though he stressed it passed without any major problems: [...] "I built up step by step. I only had a 50km test before, so that was quite tough to jump in against guys who have been racing here for three years." ...|$|E

60|$|The captain {{sank into}} his easy-chair a little wearily. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and rather trying vigil. His steward filled two cups with coffee {{and at a}} sign from his master withdrew.|$|E

60|$|We {{were now}} {{arriving}} at {{the last day of}} this new trial. Joan had come through the ordeal well. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and wearisome struggle for all concerned. All ways had been tried to convict the accused, and all had failed, thus far. The inquisitors were thoroughly vexed and dissatisfied.|$|E

6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time since}} Clemens {{had written to}} his old friend [...] Twichell, but the Rhone trip must have {{reminded}} him of those days [...] thirteen years earlier, when, comparatively young men, he and [...] Twichell were tramping through the Black Forest and scaling Gemmi [...] Pass.

6000|$|The Hawaiian {{episode in}} Mark Twain's life {{was one of}} those spots [...] that seemed to him always filled with sunlight.

60|$|So, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of Mr. Meeke and his fiddle, my mistress got though the weary time. The winter passed, the spring came, and no fresh tidings reached us of Mr. James Smith. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> hard winter that year, and the spring was backward and rainy. The first really fine day we had was the day that fell on the fourteenth of March.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not long}} after this happy event that another great joy came to Mrs. Aleshine. Her son {{returned}} from Japan.
