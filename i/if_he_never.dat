5|$|Toshiyuki Morikawa/George Newbern as Sephiroth. Morikawa was {{instructed}} to pronounce Sephiroth's lines {{in such a way}} that his words would convey his feelings of superiority. In tandem with this, the voice director and Morikawa agreed to make Sephiroth's voice sound always calm, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> fears the slightest possibility of defeat.|$|E
5|$|Mitt Romney {{wanted to}} pursue a {{business}} career, but his father advised him that a law degree would be valuable to his career even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> practiced law. As a result, he enrolled in the recently created four-year joint Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration program coordinated between Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. He readily adapted to the business school's pragmatic, data-driven case study method of teaching. Living in a Belmont, Massachusetts house with Ann and their two children, his social experience differed from most of his classmates'. He was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day. He graduated in 1975 cum laude from the law school, in the top third of that class, and was named a Baker Scholar for graduating {{in the top five}} percent of his business school class.|$|E
25|$|The live-action {{version of}} the Beast is quite civilized in {{personality}} and mannerisms, {{in contrast to the}} Beast in the animated film which was originally quite primal in behavior. Although the Beast {{does not seem to have}} become increasing feral the longer the enchantment runs, in contrast to his animated counterpart from 1991 (reflecting Don Hahn's original intent for the Beast eventually grow wild <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> met Belle), it is his transformed servants who are gradually losing their remaining humanity while the castle deteriorates.|$|E
60|$|One day the King {{went out}} walking with Minnikin, and Minnikin asked him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> had any other children.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how could}} he live on it, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't eat it?" [...] asked Peter, staring at Johnny Chuck as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> seen him before.|$|R
60|$|She {{put down}} 'arf a {{sovereign}} with the presents, and Joseph sat {{staring at it}} as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> 'ad <b>never</b> seen one afore.|$|R
25|$|Gleason (who {{had signed}} a deal in the 1950s that {{included}} a guaranteed $100,000 annual payment for 20 years, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> went on the air) wanted The Honeymooners {{to be just a}} portion of his format, but CBS wanted another season of only The Honeymooners. The network had cancelled a mainstay variety show hosted by Red Skelton and would cancel The Ed Sullivan Show in 1971 because they had become too expensive to produce and attracted, in the executives' opinion, too old an audience. Gleason simply stopped doing the show in 1970 and left CBS when his contract expired.|$|E
500|$|Turnbull {{commented on}} several points {{that he felt}} went unnoticed by the module's proofreader. The maps did not contain a scale, which he assumed was [...] per square. It is unclear what {{triggers}} one of the traps in the first module. In the second module, an exit from map level {{one does not have}} an entrance marked on the second level map. Ultimately he found the errors minor, and easily fixed. Turnbull's most major criticism was that the adventure was aimed at parties of too high a level. Summing up, he said [...] "No DM should be without them, for even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> gets a chance to run them, they are a source of much excellent design quality." ...|$|E
500|$|It was in Lucknow where Henderson met {{his future}} wife, Eleanor, {{at the age}} of 15 while he was working at a grocery store. They married in 1962 and, wanting to ensure he could provide for his wife, he {{considered}} giving up the game to become a history and physical education teacher. [...] His father convinced him to remain in hockey, warning him that he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> tried to make the National Hockey League (NHL). After considering his father's advice and talking with Eleanor, Henderson decided to play two additional years, and if he had not reached the NHL by 1964, he would quit the game and focus on his education.|$|E
5000|$|Pierce {{described}} Niles as [...] "what Frasier {{would be}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> gone to Boston and never {{been exposed to}} the people at Cheers." ...|$|R
6000|$|But in {{the midst}} of all his glad sympathy Felix could not help thinking: 'Better for you, perhaps, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> {{returned}} from darkness!' ...|$|R
60|$|Drakestail, who was {{no longer}} {{surprised}} at anything, received the acclamations of the people as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> done anything else all his life.|$|R
500|$|Homer {{is given}} entirely free {{rein in the}} design. At the {{unveiling}} of the new car, Herb is horrified {{to find that the}} car is a badly-designed and hideously styled monstrosity that costs US$82,000, leaving Powell Motors bankrupt and out of business, while Herb's mansion is foreclosed and he loses everything he ever worked for. As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he {{would have been better off}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> met him and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb. Before Homer can even answer what happened, Grampa remarks to Homer that he knew [...] "he'd blow it", and leaves in the cab he just arrived in, rather than getting in the car with the rest of the Simpson family.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) {{has bought}} tickets to a Lady Gaga concert, but his plans go south when Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) gets sick. This causes Mitchell {{to be torn}} on whether he should stay with Cameron {{or go to the}} concert. He {{eventually}} tries to be supporting and attempts to subtly persuade Cameron to let him go, as Claire has advised him to do. Mitchell tries to sneak away after noticing that Cameron has drunk most of a cough syrup that would [...] "put down a Grizzly", but he is caught when Cam wakes up. Mitchell then gives a speech about how selfish he has been to Cameron, before realizing Cameron has fallen asleep once more. He then sneaks off to the concert and comes back before Cameron wakes up again. When Cameron does wake up, Mitchell acts as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> went out, unaware that his glow stick is still visible underneath his shirt. As Cameron returns to bed, he pleasantly informs Mitchell that his glow-stick is still flashing, and switches off the light to reveal it.|$|E
500|$|Zavala {{pursued a}} conciliatory policy with the Paraguayan settlers, {{not wishing to}} {{aggravate}} the situation. [...] Reprimands were handed down, but few fines, and no arrests, exiles, or executions. [...] Members of the cabildo kept their posts. [...] Ill and emaciated, former governor Reyes was quietly freed {{from more than a}} year in conditions that approached solitary confinement, but told that to avoid trouble it would be best <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> showed himself in the province again. [...] Zavala left after only two months in Asunción, placing Martín de Barúa in charge as interim governor. [...] Barúa would serve as governor until 1730, as the first two replacement governors failed to arrive in Asunción; one was arrested after he beat his wife, and the other died in transit in the Atlantic Ocean. [...] Barúa proved sympathetic to the settlers and hostile to the Jesuits; he sent letters to the Jesuits threatening to investigate claimed abuses of the mission Indians, and also wrote the Viceroy with similar concerns about the Jesuit missions. [...] He assured the Viceroy that the Paraguayans were loyal servants of the Crown, and that the burden of defending Paraguay against hostile Indian raids would be lessened if the Jesuits were to share their mission Indians with the encomienda.|$|E
50|$|Although his tribal law states he {{must take}} his own life <b>if</b> defeated, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> does. Eventually <b>he</b> goes {{bankrupt}} and returns to his poor warrior ways.|$|R

60|$|But Dickory did {{not like}} it. He hated the big black pirate, and cared not <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should <b>never</b> see him again, so he stayed behind.|$|R
2500|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the rerouting was that the trains would serve more remote communities, but the concentration of ridings held by the Progressive Conservatives along the CN route attracted the charge that the move was chiefly political. [...] Harvie André, one of Alberta's federal cabinet ministers who represented Calgary, stated publicly {{that he did not}} care <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> saw a passenger train again in his life.|$|E
2500|$|On Jean Renoir, he said: [...] "I think Renoir is {{the only}} filmmaker who's {{practically}} infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. And I think <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity—human solutions. He's one film director who never pretended. He never tried to have a style, and if you know his work—which is very comprehensive, since he dealt {{with all sorts of}} subjects—when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, you can think of how Renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution".|$|E

6000|$|... "Did he? Well now, the rascal {{invariably}} looks quite blank when I mention Marizano's name, {{and shakes}} his head, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> heard of it before." ...|$|R
60|$|Pony {{said he was}} {{not sick}} at all; just tired; and that was true; he felt as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> wanted to get up again.|$|E

6000|$|... "He isn't over it yet, Sam. And {{it almost}} looks as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> would get over it, that is, altogether." [...] Dick's face showed his deep concern.|$|E
