40|$|The {{provision}} of public services and infrastructure {{has evolved over}} the years and currently, the ever-increasing demand for public services and the greater levels of required renewal and repair of infrastructure have created unsustainable strains on limited public sector resources, leading to a resurgence of private sector involvement in such projects, to a much larger degree than ever before. The key to the success of such privately financed projects is the structure of the financing package. This thesis traces the evolution of project financing, exploring the financial engineering of funding packages using debt and equity instruments by way of financial modelling. This research derives a generic health sector project for which a fmancial model is subsequently developed, based on actual project finance modelling practice and incorporating various financial instruments for funding and credit enhancement. Using this financial model, different permutations of financial structure are simulated and investigated; the use of bank loans versus fixed and <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues,</b> debt repayment profiles and blended equity structures, are some of the areas examined, as are gearing, credit enhancement, and the sensitivity of different financial structures to inflation. This thesis offers insightful knowledge on the process of financial engineering for project finance, and on the various instruments and mechanisms that can be employed for project profitability and financial robustness. The development and manipulation of a detailed financial model highlight the role and importance of optimisation of the financial package during modelling and overall, afford the reader {{a better understanding of the}} dynamic that exists between the components of a project's financial structure.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the essay was to {{evaluate}} whether investments in <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> were suitable investments for smaller investors on the international finance market. To determine whether the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> are good investments, the variables yield, cost and risk were {{used to measure the}} <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> against investments in stocks and funds. The reason for the interest in this subject is that investments in <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> have grown furiously the last few years. With the growth of the investments the criticism of <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> has also grown stronger. The critics’ main point is the cost of the product, and they imply that investors can create their own <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> and thereby avoid the bank fees. This study used a quantitative approach, because all the data of yield, cost and risk consist of numbers. The method used is the abductive method, which means that the examination has the starting point in the results which is linked to a theory. Data has been gathered concerning the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> from the four biggest banks in Sweden; Nordea, SEB, Handelsbanken and Swedbank. The variables used are yield and cost. The results have been compared with the results of funds and indices on a related market to measure the performance of the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds.</b> These results have been analysed to evaluate and to conclude whether the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> are good investments or not. The results from the examination showed that the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> gave a higher average yield than both stocks and funds. This is to some extent explained by the limited risk of loss the investor faces with <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds,</b> as an effect of the capital protection that the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> provides. On an upturning market however, the results show that stocks and funds in a majority of these cases gave higher yields than the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds.</b> The result of the cost comparison shows that there is not too much of a difference. The biggest difference is that the cost of the funds depend on how the funds develop. To build an own <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> is not as easy as the critics imply. It is expensive for a smaller investor to buy the different parts of the <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> and it requires knowledge about the specific markets...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{external financing}} of a corporation is satisfied through the <b>bond</b> market where <b>issues</b> of <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds,</b> which {{are discussed in}} this thesis, is one alternative. (Finnerty&Emery 2001) An index- linked bond is a debt instrument where the investor is guaranteed the principal and premium amount in real terms. As the bonds cash flows are indexed to the inflation this implies that the issuer of an <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> assumes an inflation risk. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe and examine corporate motives for choosing <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> as way of financing their business. Realization: Primary data was collected through interviews with corporate issuers of non-swapped <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds.</b> Results: From our research it has been acknowledged that {{both internal and external}} factors determine the decision to <b>issue</b> <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds.</b> The most important internal reason for the issuance was that this type of financing implies matching advantages, which helps lowering the companies’ risks. This is achieved by balancing the size and time of the cash inflows with the cash out- flows. Of the external factors we found that it is primary the financing cost that is of interest. The cost savings are primarily achieved because of the lower liquidity premium demanded when using <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> as a way of financing the business. We believe that this depends partly on the character of the investors and on market imperfections...|$|R

40|$|Estimates of {{the real}} term {{structure}} for the euro area implied by French <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> are obtained {{by means of a}} smoothing spline methodology. The real term structure allows computation of the constant-maturity inflation compensation, which is compared with the surveyed inflation expectations in order to obtain a rough measure of the inflation risk premium. The comparison between the inflation compensation and the inflation swap shows that the two variables are closely interlinked but differently affected by illiquidity during periods of stress. The methodology used in this paper is quite effective at capturing the general shape {{of the real}} term structure while smoothing through idiosyncratic variations in the yields of <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds.</b> Real interest rates tend to be quite stable at longer horizons and the average 10 -year real rate from 2002 to 2009 is close to 2 per cent. Furthermore, evidence is found that inflation compensation was held down in the period 2008 - 09 by an increase in the liquidity premium of <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds.</b> <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond,</b> real term structure, inflation compensation, inflation risk premium, smoothing spline...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} {{accounting}} identity developed by Campbell to decompose movements in bond prices into elements due {{to changes in}} real interest rates, expected term premia and expected inflation. This decomposition is applied to UK short and long-maturity nominal <b>bonds</b> and <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> using data between 1983 and 1993. The main findings are that changes in expected inflation {{are by far the}} most important determinant of bond price movements. So much so that even for <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> changes in expected inflation (which have an effect due to the eight month indexation lag) are a more important factor than changes in real interest rates (which contribute less than 3 % to the variance of <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> prices). The paper also finds that changes in expected term premia are an important determinant of changes in both nominal and <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> prices. However, the term premia appears to be a common factor which has little influence on the relative price of the two types of bond (ie break-even inflation rates). This suggests that changes in the relative price of the two type of bonds offer a reliable measure of changes in market expectations of inflation with about 95 % of the variance of relative yields being due to revisions to expected inflation. ...|$|R

Based on daily return data for French bonds with different maturity dates and different reference indices, our analysis reveals two empirical regularities. First, the relationship, in uncertainty, between nominal and <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> returns is strongly significant and is mostly due to the liquidity risk. Second, the co-persistence in volatility returns for the studied bonds is also confirmed.

Furthermore, we show how sensitive the Cleveland Fed approach is to different measures of the liquidity premium. In addition we propose an alternative approach to decompose the bias in inflation expectations derived from <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> using a state-space estimation.

First, ILBs linked to eurozone inflation are much less useful for diversification purposes than nationally indexed ILBs. This is hard to square with the intended use of these bonds. Second, ILBs linked to national price indices are imperfect hedges for national inflation. The latter finding is counterintuitive and arises because of monetary union.

40|$|Bond {{returns are}} known to exhibit mean reversion, {{autocorrelation}} and other dynamic properties that differentiate them from e. g. stock returns. <b>Index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> bring in further characteristics that complicate the modeling of returns over time. Such models are essential, however, in strategic portfolio analysis and quantitative risk management. This paper shows that the modeling of <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> portfolios {{can be reduced to}} statistical modeling of the portfolio’s yield to maturity and the underlying index. For these quantities, many well established models already exist.

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of CPI-linked bonds by several financial institutions is {{a milestone in}} the history of the U. S. financial system. It has potentially far-reaching effects on individual and institutional asset allocation decisions because these securities represent the only true long-run hedge against inflation risk. CPI-linked bonds make possible the creation of additional financial innovations that would use them as the asset base. One such innovation that seems likely is inflation-protected retirement annuities. The {{introduction of}} <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> eliminates one of the main obstacles to the indexation of benefits in private pension plans.

This paper estimates the reactions using high-frequency data on nominal and <b>index-linked</b> <b>bond</b> yields, allowing {{the effects of}} news announcements on real rates and inflation compensation to be parsed far more precisely than is possible using daily data. Long-term nominal yields and forward rates {{are very sensitive to}} macroeconomic news announcements. Inflation compensation is sensitive to announcements about price indices and monetary policy. However, for news announcements about real economic activity, such as nonfarm payrolls, {{the vast majority of the}} sensitivity is concentrated in real rates. Accordingly, most of the sizeable impact of news about real economic activity on the nominal term structure of interest rates represents changes in expected future real short-term interest rates and/or real risk premia rather than changes in expected future inflation and/or inflation risk premia. Such sensitivity of real rates to macroeconomics news is hard to rationalize within the framework of existing macroeconomic models.

40|$|Within a New Keynesian {{business}} cycle model, we study variables that are normally unobservable but {{are very important}} for the conduct of monetary policy, namely expected inflation and inflation risk premia. We solve the model using a third-order approximation that allows us to study time-varying risk premia. Our model is consistent with rejection of the expectations hypothesis and the business-cycle behaviour of nominal interest rates in US data. We find that inflation risk premia are very small and display little volatility. Hence, monetary policy authorities can use the difference between nominal and real interest rates from <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> as a proxy for inflation expectations. Moreover, for short maturities current inflation is a good predictor of inflation risk premia. We also find that short-term real interest rates and expected inflation are significantly negatively correlated and that short-term real interest rates display greater volatility than expected inflation. These results are consistent with empirical studies that use survey data and <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> to obtain measures of expected inflation and real interest rates. Finally, we show that our economy is consistent with the Mundell-Tobin effect: increases in inflation are associated with higher nominal interest rates, but lower real interest rates. term structure of interest rates; monetary policy; expected inflation; inflation risk premia; Mundell-Tobin effect...|$|R

The results indicate that the market for US inflation-indexed government bonds offers the possibility to obtain excess returns. These results are fairly consistent regardless of market frictions introduced in the return calculation. ...|$|R

40|$|Long-horizon {{interest}} rates in the major international bond markets fell sharply during 2004 and 2005, {{at the same time}} as US policy rates were rising; a phenomenon famously described as a 'conundrum' by Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve Chairman. But it was arguably the decline in international long real rates over this period which was more unusual and, by the end of 2007, long real rates in the United Kingdom remained at recent historical lows. In this paper, we try to shed light on the recent behaviour of long real rates, by estimating several empirical models of the term structure of real {{interest rates}}, derived from UK <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds.</b> We adopt a standard 'finance' approach to modelling the real term structure, using an essentially affine framework. While being empirically tractable, these models impose the important theoretical restriction of no arbitrage, which enables us to decompose forward real rates into expectations of future short (ie risk-free) real rates and forward real term premia. One general finding that emerges across all the models estimated is that time-varying term premia appear to be extremely important in explaining movements in long real forward rates. Although there is some evidence that long-horizon expected short real rates declined over the conundrum period, our results suggest lower term premia played the dominant role in accounting for the fall in long real rates. This evidence could be consistent with the so-called 'search for yield' and excess liquidity explanations for the conundrum, but it might also partly reflect strong demand for <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds</b> by institutional investors and foreign central banks.

50|$|As {{with all}} <b>index-linked</b> <b>bonds,</b> there are time lags between the {{collection}} of prices data, {{the publication of the}} inflation index and the indexation of the bond. From their introduction in 1981, index-linked gilts had an eight-month indexation lag (between the month of collection of prices data and the month of indexation of the bond). This was so that the amount of the next coupon was known at the start of each six-month interest accrual period. However, in 2005 the UK Debt Management Office announced that all new issues of index-linked gilts would use a three-month indexation lag, first used in the Canadian Real Return Bond market, and the majority of index-linked gilts now in issue are structured on that basis.|$|R
