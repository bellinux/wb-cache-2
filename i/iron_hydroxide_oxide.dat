40|$|In the {{previous}} reporting period, modifications were completed for integrating a continuous wax filtration {{system for a}} 4 liter slurry bubble column reactor. During the current reporting period, a shakedown of the system was completed. Several problems were encountered with the progressive cavity pump used to circulate the wax/catalyst slurry though the cross-flow filter element and reactor. During the activation of the catalyst with elevated temperature (> 270 C) the elastomer pump stator released sulfur thereby totally deactivating the iron-based catalyst. Difficulties in maintaining an acceptable leak rate from the pump seal and stator housing were also encountered. Consequently, the system leak rate exceeded the expected production rate of wax; therefore, no online filtration could be accomplished. Work continued regarding the characterization of ultra-fine catalyst structures. The effect of carbidation on the morphology of <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxide</b> <b>oxide</b> particles {{was the focus of}} the study during this reporting period. Oxidation of Fe (II) sulfate results in predominantly {gamma}-FeOOH particles which have a rod-shaped (nano-needles) crystalline structure. Carbidation of the prepared {gamma}-FeOOH with CO at atmospheric pressure produced iron carbides with spherical layered structure. HRTEM and EDS analysis revealed that carbidation of {gamma}-FeOOH particles changes the initial nano-needles morphology and generates ultrafine carbide particles with irregular spherical shape...|$|E
30|$|All of the {{nanostructures}} of {{the present}} study have started from the identically prepared as-cast films. Since the precursor solution has been stirred in air for 5  h, {{it is likely that the}} Fe 3 + ions are condensed into <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles, probably sub-nanometer in size. Therefore, the as-cast films are mainly composed of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles and F 127. Most of the solvent ethanol would have been lost by evaporation before the as-cast films were placed in the aging chamber. However, there must be some ethanol left in the film, at least, for a while so that the film materials (<b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles and F 127) can move around to attain a self-assembly structure. From the morphology of the FN(80  °C, 0  %) sample, which has not experienced the effect of water and thus is expected to maintain the structure of the as-cast film, we can infer that the self-assembly structure of the as-cast film is composed of rod-like micelles whose inside is filled with removable organics and outside is occupied by <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles. Therefore, in the as-cast film state, the hydrophobic PO blocks of F 127 are segregated into micelle rods and the hydrophilic EO blocks are associated with the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles forming hydrophilic domains.|$|R

About 91 % of the dithiol was converted to short soluble oligomers and 9 % to insoluble larger oligomers that were isolated with the mineral phase.

30|$|Hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) {{thin films}} with various {{nanostructures}} were synthesized through self-assembly between <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles, generated by hydrolysis and condensation of Fe(NO 3) 3 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O, and a Pluronic triblock copolymer (F 127, (EO) 106 (PO) 70 (EO) 106, EO[*]=[*]ethylene oxide, PO[*]=[*]propylene oxide), followed by calcination. The self-assembly structure can be tuned by introducing {{water in a}} controlled manner through the control of the humidity level in the surrounding of the as-cast films during aging stage. For the given Fe(NO 3) 3 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O:F 127 ratio, there appear to be three different thermodynamically stable self-assembly structures depending on the water content in the film material, which correspond to mesoporous, spherical micellar, and rod-like micellar structures after removal of F 127. Coupled with the thermodynamic driving forces, the kinetics of the irreversible reactions of coalescence of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles into larger ones induce diverse nanostructures of the resultant films. The length scale of so-obtained nanostructures ranges from 6  nm to a few hundred nanometers. In addition to water content, the effects of other experimental parameters such as aging temperature, spin rate during spin coating, type of substrate, and type of iron reagent were investigated.|$|R
30|$|Depending on the {{humidity}} {{level in the}} aging environment, different amounts of water molecules are introduced to the film material. The water content in the film material affects the final morphology in two ways. Thermodynamically, water content directs the most stable self-assembly structure through the change of the volume ratio between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. Kinetically, when water content is sufficient, water molecules can function as a mobilization medium of the film materials so that thermodynamically stable structures can be attained. Conversely, when the water content is lower than a mobilization threshold, the most stable self-assembly structure cannot be reached and the final structure {{is a result of}} kinetic trapping. Water content also influences the rate of condensation between small <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles into larger particles. If the water content is high, the condensation reaction is suppressed and the mobility within the film material may remain high enough to allow the thermodynamic structure to be formed. On the contrary, if the water content is low, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles are given more chances to condense into larger particles, the film material will become progressively rigid, and the final morphology will reflect the time progression of the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics.|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} Fe/Mn-oxidizing bacteria {{have long}} been recognized for their potential to form extracellular <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxide</b> or manganese <b>oxide</b> structures in aquatic environments. Bacterial species belonging to the genus Gallionella, one type of such bacteria, oxidize iron and produce uniquely twisted extracellular stalks consisting of iron oxide-encrusted inorganic/organic fibers. This paper describes the ultrastructure of Gallionella cells and stalks and the visualized structural and spatial localization of constitutive elements within the stalks. Electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed the export site of the stalk fibers from the cell and the uniform distribution of iron, silicon, and phosphorous in the stalks. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy revealed that the stalk fibers had a central carbon core of bacterial exopolymers and that aquatic iron interacted with oxygen at {{the surface of the}} carbon core, resulting in deposition of iron oxides at the surface. This new knowledge of the structural and spatial associations of iron with oxygen and carbon provides deeper insights into the unique inorganic/organic hybrid structure of the stalks...|$|R
40|$|Dissimilatory iron-reduction in hyperthermophilic (Topt 3 ̆e 80 °C) Archaea {{appears to}} be a ubiquitous, conserved, and {{possibly}} ancient metabolism that remains largely unknown. This investigation sought to understand the physiological and ecological context for iron respiration by the hyperthermophilic Pyrobaculum which are commonly found in terrestrial hydrothermal environments. Iron respiration in Pyrobaculum is differentiated from Bacteria by the lack of polyheme c-type cytochromes common for the mesophiles Geobacter and Shewanella, representing a novel model system for studying iron-reducing microorganisms. The overall change in protein pattern and abundance coupled with specific activities of respiratory enzymes such as the nitrate reductase and ferric reductase support the notion that iron respiration in Pyrobaculum is a regulated process. In Pyrobaculum, the mechanism for electron transfer to insoluble iron oxides seems to vary as P. aerophilum and P. arsenaticum could reduce <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> when sequestered by semi-permeable dialysis membrane tubing while P. islandicum and P. calidifontis required direct contact with <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Iron-grown membrane fractions of P. aerophilum only were capable of enzymatic oxidation of the reduced soluble quinone analog 2, 6 -anthrahydroquinone disulfonate (AHDS), while iron-grown membranes from P. islandicum did not show this activity. This suggests that although the ability to reduce <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxides</b> to generate energy is highly conserved within Pyrobaculum, the strategies may not be. Pyrobaculum species are metabolically diverse microorganisms capable of iron, sulfur, thiosulfate, nitrate, and microaerophilic respiration. To understand how anaerobic respiration and the environment may interact, a range of Eh and pH values were investigated to determine their effect on growth rates in Pyrobaculum. Growth rates on sulfur compounds were highest at slightly acid pHs and highly reduced (3 ̆c - 420 mV) conditions while growth rates on nitrate and iron were highest at neutral to slightly basic pHs and more oxidized (3 ̆e - 210 mV) conditions. Almost all known hyperthermophiles in pure culture to date have been isolated with an electron acceptor other than Fe(III). Therefore, it seems likely that a better understanding towards the diversity, physiology, and biogeochemistry of these hydrothermal microbial communities is likely to be gained by directly isolating hyperthermophiles using Fe(III). Two novel microbes were isolated, purified, and characterized {{during the course of this}} study from differing hydrothermal sediments. The first organism originated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent from the northeast Pacific Ocean and is an obligate iron-reducing autotroph named Geogemma pacifica. The second organism investigated was named Pyrobaculum strain SP 4 and was isolated from the Caribbean island, St. Lucia. These isolates support the notion that dissimilatory iron reduction is common in these environments and further expands the known locations where Pyrobaculum species have been isolated thus far. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ferromagnetic}} {{properties of}} magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) {{were influenced by}} the nanoparticle size, hence importance {{were given to the}} synthesis method. This paper clearly shows that magnetite nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by employing one step controlled precipitation method using a single salt (Iron(II) sulfate) iron precursor. The acquired titration curve from this method provides vital information on the possible reaction mechanism leading to the magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) nanoparticles formation. Goethite (α-FeOOH) was obtained at pH 4, while the continuous addition of hydroxyl ions (OH−) forms <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides</b> (Fe(OH) 2). This subsequently reacts with the goethite, producing magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) at pH 10. Spectroscopy studies validate the magnetite phase existence while structural and morphology analysis illustrates cubic shaped magnetite with an average size of 35 nm was obtained. The synthesized magnetite might be superparamagnetic though lower saturation magnetization (67. 5 emu/g) measured at room temperature as compared to bulk magnetite. However the nanoparticles surface anisotropy leads to higher remanence (12 emu/g) and coercivity (117. 7 G) making the synthesized magnetite an excellent candidate to be utilized in recording devices. The understanding of the magnetite synthesis mechanism can not only be used to achieve even smaller magnetite nanoparticles but also to prepare different types of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>hydroxides</b> using different <b>iron</b> precursor source...|$|R

The results (ESI Additional file 1 : Figure S 9) are completely different from that of FN(80  °C, 75  %). The reaction with Fe(acac) 3 produced an inhomogeneous film. Fe(acac) 3 has a strong metal-ligand binding, mainly due to the chelate effect of the bidentate ligand acac, and does not allow the generation of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> species, an indispensible component for the self-assembly structures. The reaction with FeCl 3 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O also produced an inhomogeneous flower-like nanostructure with ~ 300 -nm needles. Cl− ions are well known to participate in the crystallization of β-FeOOH. Therefore, the use of FeCl 3 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O strongly facilitates the growth of needle-like β-FeOOH crystals that are too large {{to take part in the}} self-assembly structures [43].|$|R

30|$|The two {{additional}} morphologies obtained {{by using a}} lower spinning rate can be explained with this scheme. When the solution is drop-cast, the film material is much thicker than in the spin coating cases. Evaporation of ethanol is not complete and ethanol {{is included in the}} self-assembly structure. Because ethanol is relatively hydrophobic, {{it is likely to be}} associated with the PO block. If the self-assembly structure is micelle, the shell thickness is increased because of the increased volume of the PO part by the inclusion of ethanol. This will reduce the curvature of the micelle, increasing the micelle size. The <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>hydroxide</b> particles are not well condensed because the major solvent is ethanol. But ethanol is replaced by water during the aging, and the micelle will be collapsed because of the incomplete condensation. As the water content increases, nanowires will grow on the surface of existing collapsed micelles resulting in the straw bundle-like morphology. As the spin rate is increased to 500  rpm, the evaporation of ethanol is increased but the as-cast film still contains a large amount of ethanol. The reduced ethanol content makes the micelle size smaller than in the drop-casting case. The remaining mechanism is similar as in the drop-casting case, the net result of which is the straw bundle-like morphology with reduced sizes in the short dimension but increased sizes in the longer dimension.|$|R

X-ray diffractions and arsenic sorption as a function of pH were conducted to investigate the effect of temperature on final <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (<b>hydroxide)</b> and their arsenic removal capabilities. Results revealed that when curing at 60 Â°C, the procedure successfully created HFO in the pores of GAC, whereas at temperatures of 80 and 90 Â°C, the impregnated iron oxide manifested a more crystalline form. In the column tests using synthetic water, the HFO-loaded GAC prepared at 60 Â°C also showed higher sorption capacities than media cured at higher temperatures. These results indicated that the adsorption capacity for arsenic was closely related to the form of iron (hydr) oxide for a given iron content. For the column test using a natural groundwater, HFO-loaded GAC (Fe, 11. 7) showed an arsenic sorption capacity of 26 mg As/g when the influent contained 300 /Î¼g/L As.
