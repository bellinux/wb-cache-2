The album spent five weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at #19. The album cover depicts a tree festooned with seashells, snails, birds, and insects. It was illustrated by James Marsh, who <b>did</b> <b>Talk</b> Talk's artwork throughout its recording career. The booklet provides reproductions of Hollis' handwritten lyrics. The album was digitally remastered by Phill Brown and Denis Blackham in 1997.|$|E
25|$|During {{everyday}} {{interactions with}} other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, and when she <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than she was actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.|$|E

25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs <b>did</b> <b>talk,</b> they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|Griffin divulged in her standup {{that she}} is now banned from The View after talking about the gig on her {{televised}} comedy special, Kathy Griffin: Straight to Hell. While declining to discuss the ban on Access Hollywood, during the filming of an episode for My Life on the D-List with former View co-host/moderator Rosie O'Donnell, Griffin <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> about the ban, specifically targeting View executive producer Bill Geddie. Griffin had also been mentioned as a possible replacement for Walters when she departed the show. As of August 2009, Griffin had been un-banned from The View and was a guest on September 18, 2009, and June 15, 2010. However, {{in an interview on}} The Talk, Griffin has stated she has been re-banned from The View, due to an argument with View co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Griffin has since been unbanned once again and has appeared several times on the show, including as a guest co-host.|$|E

Who gave the order to keep that child, we're talking about a child in the youth centre, segregated that length of time? Who gave the order 'don't intervene' if she's still breathing?" [...] The four guards saw the charges against them dropped and were reinstated to their positions; they declined to talk to The Fifth Estate. The Corrections Service of Canada viewed the case as closed, and while the current minister <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> to Hana Gartner, CSC refused any interviews with the reporter, while a lawsuit was pending.|$|E

He was sacked from his columnist's job in The Sun, which announced the dismissal in an article on the front page with the headline [...] "Sun Sacks Boycott the Brute", although The Sun gave Boycott an undertaking in writing that they would continue to employ him regardless of the result of the court case, as <b>did</b> <b>Talk</b> Sport.

500|$|Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a human-terminator hybrid experiment. Worthington {{compared}} Marcus to Dorothy Gale and Alice due {{to being}} [...] "this person {{waking up in}} another world [...] tries to find himself". Terminator creator James Cameron personally recommended Worthington (whom he directed in Avatar) to McG. Russell Crowe also recommended him to McG. The director decided Worthington looked tougher than the [...] "great many of today's [...] young male actors". Worthington recalled Cameron told him [...] "the Terminator to make is {{the one with the}} war". Worthington tore his intercostal muscles during the first weeks of filming but nevertheless insisted on performing his own stunts. McG once expressed interest in casting Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis or Josh Brolin in the part. Brolin <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> to Bale and read a draft of the screenplay, which he found [...] "interesting and dark; ultimately, though, I didn't think it felt right".|$|E

500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
500|$|Shero's introverted, enigmatic {{personality}} had {{an effect}} on the way in which he coached players. Shero often communicated with his players by way of notes left in their lockers. When he <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> to them, he was known for never yelling. He believed that when coaches yell they do it for their own sake. He always defended his player whether it was in the press or even against management. He always tried to make sure his players were focused during the game. He often asked them how much time was left in the period to force them to pay attention. He had a unique take on practice as well. If the team was winning then he worked the team hard. If they were losing then there would be a low key practice. He believed that he could get more out of players when they were winning. He often had drills designed to let the players have fun, stating that [...] "Hockey is a child's game played by men. Since it's a child's game it ought to be fun". To have fun the Flyers occasionally had 12-on-12 games with the winning team earning a small monetary reward. He sometimes had the players perform drills that lacked purpose which the team performed until a player questioned the validity of the drill. At that point Shero stopped the drill and praised the player for being alert. Shero was notoriously bad with names. On one occasion it led to him trading for the wrong player. While GM of the Rangers Shero traded for Cam Connor believing it was Colin Campbell. Upon his arrival Conner had to explain that he was a winger and not a defenceman.|$|E

The title became tantamount to superstar, to signify a supermodel's fame having risen simply from [...] "personality." [...] Supermodels <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> shows, were cited in gossip columns, partied at the trendiest nightspots, landed movie roles, inspired franchises, dated or married film stars, and earned themselves millions.

They are implacable in wanting to put down all who {{do not agree with}} them. So their Islam is a perverted version, which the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Singapore do not subscribe to". He added that [...] "Singapore Muslim leaders were rational and that the ultimate solution to extremist terrorism was to give moderate Muslims the courage to stand up and speak out against radicals who hijacked Islam to recruit volunteers for their violent ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Richardson's early years beyond the few things that Richardson was willing to share. Although he was not {{forthcoming}} with specific events and incidents, he <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the origins of}} his writing ability; Richardson would tell stories to his friends and spent his youth constantly writing letters. One such letter, written when Richardson was almost 11, was directed to a woman in her 50s who was in the habit of constantly criticizing others. [...] "Assuming the style and address of a person in years", Richardson cautioned her about her actions. However, his handwriting was used to determine that it was his work, and the woman complained to his mother. The result was, as he explains, that [...] "my mother chid me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her years" [...] but also [...] "commended my principles, though she censured the liberty taken".|$|E

I'm just not used to being told that. I went home that night and I just thought to myself 'you have to pull yourself together, he's worked with so many incredible artists you {{have to step up}} the plate.' I <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> myself round and I went in there the next day on a mission. It's good to be pushed sometimes – and I proved him wrong!" [...] Jenkins decided to change the [...] guitar-led and percussive original version and instead, [...] "make it more orchestral with the percussion coming from the strings." [...] Alfred Hickling of The Guardian gave a mixed review of Jenkins' cover, calling it [...] "histrionic." [...] However, a writer of BBC Online chose her version of the song as a highlight on the album. On October 23, 2009, the song was available for digital download as the second single from Believe. On November 23, 2011, Jenkins sang the song live at the Leicester Square station in London.|$|E
