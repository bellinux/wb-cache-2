5|$|Police cars lack GPS {{navigation}} {{devices and}} mobile data terminal. Instead, all communication must be radioed to the <b>dispatcher</b> at the joint operations center, and officers {{must rely on}} printed road atlases for navigation. In contrast, GPS navigation and terminal equipment was finished installed in ambulances and fire trucks in 2003. The Norwegian Public Safety Radio is scheduled for completion in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The WAMCATS {{telegraph}} line was relocated to parallel the trail after a fire. McCarty Station was {{established at the}} line's crossing of the Tanana in 1907 to maintain the telegraph. Several log cabins housed the telegraph office, a <b>dispatcher,</b> two repairmen and their supplies.|$|E
50|$|ATDA {{operates}} {{mostly as}} a craft union representing railroad <b>dispatchers.</b> Specialized forms of <b>dispatchers</b> including trick train <b>dispatchers,</b> night chief <b>dispatchers</b> and assistant chief <b>dispatchers</b> are also {{members of the}} union.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, many <b>dispatchers</b> are Certified Fire <b>Dispatchers</b> or Certified Police <b>Dispatchers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Public safety dispatchers" [...] (also {{known as}} {{emergency}} <b>dispatchers,</b> Telecommunications Officers, Telecommunicators or 9-1-1 <b>dispatchers)</b> receive calls from individuals who need assistance from Firefighters, Police Officers, and Emergency Medical Services. Once information is {{obtained from the}} caller, these <b>dispatchers</b> activate the services necessary {{to respond to the}} nature of the call for help. <b>Dispatchers</b> are an integral part of the organization's success. According to the U.S. Labor Statistics, about 10% of all <b>dispatchers</b> employed in the United States in 2004 were public safety <b>dispatchers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{can be traced to}} an article in the Toronto Sun on June 23, 2007, by {{columnist}} Joe Warmington, in which he interviewed Northumberland photographer Pete Fisher. Fisher, along with Bob Jenkins, an emergency <b>dispatcher,</b> were responsible for organizing the first bridge salutes following the loss of four soldiers on April 18, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Omaha Police {{arrived at}} Westroads Mall about six minutes after {{receiving}} the first 911 call. During the entire 70 seconds of that first call, all the <b>dispatcher</b> heard was gunshots. Audio tapes and transcripts of the 911 calls, along with images captured by mall security surveillance cameras, were released by the police on December 7, 2007. In one 911 call, gunshots can be heard.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{grew up in}} Massillon, Ohio, {{where he}} moved with his family from Norwalk when he was nine years of age. His father, Lester, was a <b>dispatcher</b> for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad. Massillon was a {{shipping}} and steel town obsessed with its high school and professional football teams, both called the Tigers. Massillon's main rival at both levels was nearby Canton, {{at the time a}} bigger and richer town. When the professional teams folded in the 1920s, the rivalry between the high school teams took center stage.|$|E
50|$|The American Train <b>Dispatchers</b> Association or Train <b>Dispatchers</b> is an American {{trade union}} {{representing}} railroad workers. The Train <b>Dispatchers</b> {{belong to the}} AFL-CIO {{as one of the}} organization's smallest members.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} other {{organizations}} use <b>dispatchers</b> to respond to service calls, coordinate transportation schedules, and to organize the delivery of materials. Truck <b>dispatchers</b> are employed by trucking companies to monitor the delivery of freight over long distances and coordinate delivery pickup and drop-off schedules. Bus <b>dispatchers</b> monitor the schedules of their bus fleet and address any problems that arise during their operations. Tow-truck <b>dispatchers</b> respond to calls for emergency roadside assistance. Gas and water service <b>dispatchers</b> monitor their respective utilities and receive calls for emergency assistance that involve gas lines and water mains. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 26% of all <b>dispatchers</b> employed in the United States in 2004 worked for transportation and warehousing industries.|$|R
50|$|Dispatcher: Some rangers work as park {{protection}} <b>dispatchers,</b> answering emergency {{calls and}} dispatching law enforcement rangers, park fire fighters or Park EMS crews by radio to emergency calls for service. Park <b>Dispatchers</b> provide pre-arrival instructions to callers {{to help them}} stay alive until responding units arrive. <b>Dispatchers</b> coordinate multi-agency responses to emergencies within the park boundaries and utilize computer systems to check for criminal histories of subjects stopped by park law enforcement rangers. Park <b>Dispatchers</b> typically perform other duties such as taking lost-and-found reports, monitoring CCTV surveillance cameras and fire alarms. <b>Dispatchers</b> are assigned to the Park Protection Division.|$|R
5|$|Bågenholm's colleagues made {{an attempt}} to free her but failed. At 18:27 local time (CET), seven minutes after she {{had fallen into the}} water, they called for help on a mobile phone. Police {{lieutenant}} Bård Mikalsen received the call and put together two rescue teams; one {{at the top of the}} mountain and one at the bottom. Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King helicopter, but they told him that the helicopter had left to transport a sick child. Mikalsen was persistent and convinced the <b>dispatcher</b> to turn the helicopter around.|$|E
5|$|Edward Felt dialed 9-1-1 {{from his}} cell phone from the rear {{lavatory}} of the aircraft seeking information at 09:58. His call was answered by <b>dispatcher</b> John Shaw, and Felt was able {{to tell him about}} the hijacking before the call was disconnected. Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The opening segment {{had many}} parodies and {{references}} to films. When the segment opens, the Simpson family is {{dressed up for}} Halloween. Here Maggie pops out of Bart's astronaut suit, dressed as a baby alien, which is {{a reference to the}} 1979 film Alien. Homer is dressed as Doctor Manhattan from the 2009 superhero film Watchmen. During the middle, there is a spoof of the 1960 film Psycho, as the same music and similar scenes are used (E.G: Reverend Lovejoy eyeing Homer in his car. In the end of the segment, it turns into a spoof of the 2010 film 127 Hours, in which Ralston loses his arm after being trapped under a rock. Ralston voiced the 911 <b>dispatcher</b> Homer calls when he is trapped.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to certifications, specialized training is also required or appropriated to public safety <b>dispatchers.</b> As public safety <b>dispatchers</b> {{are the first}} contact made {{between the public and}} emergency services, public safety <b>dispatchers</b> {{need to be able to}} extract a vast array of information out of the caller. Such specialized training for 911 <b>dispatchers</b> can include: suicide intervention, hostage negotiation, bomb threats, tactical dispatching (for SWAT teams), domestic violence and domestic and foreign terrorism countermeasures. Many are also trained as Emergency Medical <b>Dispatchers,</b> able to give first aid instructions to victims or families prior to EMS arrival.|$|R
25|$|<b>Dispatchers</b> {{answer to}} {{emergency}} calls and choose the nearest and best-indicated emergency care mobile resource; medical training for <b>dispatchers</b> {{is in some}} region provided.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dispatchers</b> are {{responsible}} for monitoring all of the communications within a specific geographic area. Public safety <b>dispatchers</b> {{are responsible}} for all emergency communications that occur within the jurisdiction of their department. These workers receive and document incoming calls, transmit messages to appropriate personnel, and keep logs of the daily activities of their personnel. Public safety <b>dispatchers</b> usually work in a police station, a fire station, or a hospital. [...] Other <b>dispatchers</b> work in centralized communication centers associated with their specific company or service.|$|R
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the <b>dispatcher,</b> but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
5|$|The band of robbers, now at home, {{are about}} to start {{splitting}} their stolen goods equally, when the police barge in. While three of the robbers are subdued after a fight, one manages to make his escape via a window and ends up on the roof. The two policeman chase the criminal, who eludes them by jumping from rooftop to rooftop. After the robber jumps down to the street, he runs toward the railroad station and boards a departing train. The police officers arrive but are too late, as the robber has left. The officers tell the train <b>dispatcher</b> to send a telegram to the next station, informing them of the fugitive and asking them to catch {{him as soon as}} possible. When the train reaches the next station, the burglar exits the train and unknowingly runs right into the path of policemen. With all four of the robbers caught, they are sentenced to forty years in jail. While doing work in the jail's quarry, the group review their failure, with each robber pinning the blame on another.|$|E
5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, <b>dispatcher</b> centers, and direct communication. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E
30|$|Insufficient of {{situation}} awareness, {{referring to the}} situation where <b>dispatchers</b> fail to have a comprehensive acquisition of system information in time, or <b>dispatchers</b> fail to have a correct understanding of system state.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dispatchers</b> at the 9-1-1 call center, who {{coordinate}} EMS {{response and}} assign units, were overwhelmed with incoming calls, {{as well as}} communications over the radio system. <b>Dispatchers</b> were unable to process {{and make sense of}} all the incoming information, including information from people trapped in the towers, about conditions on the upper floors. Overwhelmed <b>dispatchers</b> were unable to effectively give instructions and manage the situation.|$|R
50|$|All {{types of}} <b>dispatchers</b> work with telephones, radios, ACARS, and {{computers}} {{on a routine}} basis. They also monitor traffic patterns or other outside activity via video surveillance. As a result of sitting for long periods and using such equipment, <b>dispatchers</b> can develop eye strain and back problems. Many <b>dispatchers</b> must also work irregular hours to provide 24-hour service, which includes night, weekend, and holiday hours.|$|R
25|$|While some fire {{departments}} are {{large enough to}} utilize their own telecommunication <b>dispatcher,</b> most rural and small areas rely on a central <b>dispatcher</b> to provide handling of fire, rescue and police services.|$|E
25|$|Footage of a <b>{{dispatch}}er</b> {{used during}} the show {{appears to have been}} filmed at the LACoFD Keith E. Klinger dispatch center in East Los Angeles. The screen he looked at to see the street maps is a rear projection from a Kodak Carousel projector built into the console. The man was actual LACoFD <b>dispatcher</b> Sam Lanier, who also lent his voice as the <b>dispatcher</b> for the show's entire run.|$|E
25|$|Several {{of their}} fellow {{officers}} were recurring characters; the most frequent were Jerry Woods (Fred Stromsoe), Ed Wells (Gary Crosby), Detective Sgt Jerry Miller (Jack Hogan), and Officer Brinkman (Claude Johnson). Shaaron Claridge, a real-life LAPD <b>dispatcher,</b> was the <b>dispatcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|Joint Communications {{is located}} at 1854 East Liberty Street in Vandiver Village, and serves a {{coverage}} area of 697 sq mi {{with a population of}} nearly 26,000 people. Staff includes 7 full-time <b>Dispatchers,</b> 2 part-time <b>Dispatchers,</b> 3 full-time Shift Supervisors, the Assistant 911 Director, and the 911 Director. There is a minimum of two <b>Dispatchers</b> on duty at all times to answer incoming and outgoing communications.|$|R
50|$|On April 23, 1991, the community, {{and other}} areas of Galveston County, {{received}} an enhanced 9-1-1 system which routes calls to proper <b>dispatchers</b> and allows <b>dispatchers</b> to automatically view {{the address of the}} caller.|$|R
50|$|The Spotswood Police Department is a 24/7 law {{enforcement}} agency that serves the entire town. It currently has 22 officers, 3 full time <b>dispatchers,</b> and 4 part time <b>dispatchers</b> led by Chief Michael Zarro.|$|R
25|$|This {{information}} is {{printed on the}} fire ticket and can be read by the <b>dispatcher</b> if requested. This {{information is}} also read automatically when a signal 10–75 (working fire) or higher signal is given or when the supervising <b>dispatcher</b> deems {{it is important for}} the units to have it before arrival at an incident.|$|E
25|$|Once a call via {{the local}} {{emergency}} number is placed, a <b>dispatcher</b> will answer {{and ask the}} caller {{about the nature of}} the emergency. Due to dual training in joint dispatch centers, the <b>dispatcher</b> is able to answer calls concerning both the fire department and EMS. While the caller is being interviewed about call specifics, the <b>dispatcher</b> is already working on the computer, which will provide prompt questions, provide advice, and suggest response resources for this emergency. This computer system, while operating in German, is extremely similar to the AMPDS algorithm used by Emergency Medical Dispatchers in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Candidates for {{employment}} as public safety <b>dispatchers</b> {{may be required}} to pass written, oral, or performance tests and are governed by state or local regulations. Public safety <b>dispatchers</b> may also have to obtain certifications and attend additional training before or after they are employed by state or local governments to dispatch for police, fire, or emergency medical services. The level of training required for these <b>dispatchers</b> is typically the most extensive in comparison to other dispatch positions.|$|R
40|$|Train <b>dispatchers</b> faces lots of {{challenges}} due to conflicts which causes delays of trains {{as a result}} of solving possible dispatching problems the network faces. The major challenge is for the train <b>dispatchers</b> to make the right decision and have reliable, cost effective and much more faster approaches needed to solve dispatching problems. This thesis work provides detail information on the implementation of different heuristic algorithms for train <b>dispatchers</b> in solving train dispatching problems. The library data files used are in xml file format and deals with both single and double tracks between main stations. The main objective of this work is to build different heuristic algorithms to solve unexpected delays faced by train <b>dispatchers</b> and to help in making right decisions on steps to take to have reliable and cost effective solution to the problems. These heuristics algorithms proposed were able to help <b>dispatchers</b> in making right decisions when solving train dispatching problems...|$|R
