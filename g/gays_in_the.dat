25|$|The Democratic Party is {{supportive}} of LGBT rights. Most support for same-sex {{marriage in the}} United States has come from Democrats, although some favor civil unions instead or oppose same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased {{in the past decade}} according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%, while a June 2008 Newsweek poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support civil unions or domestic partnership laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all. A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending hate crime statutes, legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce, and repealing Don't ask, don't tell. A 2006 Pew Research Center poll of Democrats found that 55% supported gays adopting children with 40% opposed while 70% support <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military with only 23% opposed. Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82% of Democrats support open enlistment.|$|E

500|$|In early 2010, {{a primary}} {{challenge}} from {{radio talk show}} host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan [...] "The Consistent Conservative", McCain said – despite his own past use of the term {{on a number of occasions}} – [...] "I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." [...] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Comics' {{incorporation}} of LGBT themes has been unfavorably {{compared with that}} of DC; its use of gay characters has been described as [...] "less prolific but more deliberate". Marvel reportedly had a [...] "No <b>Gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marvel Universe" [...] policy during Jim Shooter's 1980s tenure, and Marvel's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an [...] "Adults Only" [...] label, in response to conservative protests. Yet in 2006 publisher Joe Quesada claimed that this policy is no longer in force. Although same-sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing, intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown, even in Marvel's [...] "Adult only" [...] imprint. The use of mutants and the discrimination they face in the X-Men comics has been seen {{as a metaphor for the}} real-world discrimination directed at minority groups including LGBT people.|$|E

500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began. [...] His [...] "presidential honeymoon" [...] period was thus extremely brief.|$|E
500|$|Censor issues {{required}} multiple {{changes to}} the episode. The line when Peter says, [...] "It's not like we're {{going to have a}} gay sex orgy in the living room," [...] was originally, [...] "Come on Lois, we're not going to drill glory holes in the living room." [...] The show received a broadcast standards request that the anti-gay video the priest shows Lois say [...] "Pat Robertson Industries," [...] so as not {{to make it look like}} Fox had an opinion about homosexuals. The writers had a problem with Lois being against gay marriage, as they felt they were not portraying her in a way that is consistent with other episodes as she expressed a more liberal viewpoint on many past issues on the show and even expressed a generally more accepting view of <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode Brian Sings and Swings. The DVD version has a deleted scene during the backyard wedding ending where Ricardo (who doesn't speak English) asks Stewie what's going on and Stewie (who speaks Tagalog) tells Ricardo that he'll find out on his wedding night.|$|E

Marvel reportedly had a [...] "No <b>Gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marvel Universe" [...] policy during Jim Shooter's 1980s tenure, and Marvel's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an [...] "Adults Only" [...] label, in response to conservative protests. However, these policies did not stop creators from slipping in gay characters and themes; J.M. DeMatteis introduced Arnie Roth, a childhood friend of Steve Rogers, who comes to Cap seeking help in rescuing his [...] "roommate" [...] Michael. Later, Arnie himself is captured by Baron Zemo and forced to dress in flamboyant clothes and stage make-up and give a speech about how his love for Michael is false and unnatural. Cap rescues Arnie and reassures him that his love for Michael is as genuine as Cap's own love for his girlfriend, Sharon. The story appears to have gone under the radar purely because DeMatteis did not use the word [...] "gay". Subsequent official character biographies have confirmed Arnie Roth as gay. As of 2006, these policies are no longer enforced and LGBT characters appear regularly in Marvel comics. Although same-sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing, intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown, even in Marvel's [...] "Adult only" [...] imprint.
