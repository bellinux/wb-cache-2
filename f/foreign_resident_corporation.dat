50|$|Corporations can be {{classified}} into domestic, foreign and partnership. A <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> is either <b>resident</b> <b>foreign</b> or non-resident <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation.</b> A <b>resident</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> is a foreign corporation engaged in trade or business in the country. A non-resident foreign corporation is a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business within the country but deriving income from sources in the country. A partnership is a business structure where ownership and management responsibility of a company is split between two or more individuals. A partnership is not a legal entity that is separate from the owners and therefore the partnership itself does not pay taxes.|$|R
50|$|Some states tax <b>resident</b> <b>corporations</b> on nonbusiness income {{regardless}} of apportionment. Generally, a <b>resident</b> <b>corporation</b> is one incorporated in that state.
