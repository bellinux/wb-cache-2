25|$|Many aphid {{species are}} {{monophagous}} (that is, they feed {{on only one}} plant species). Others, like the <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> feed on hundreds of plant species across many families.|$|E
25|$|Insects that {{commonly}} transmit potato diseases {{or damage}} the plants include the Colorado potato beetle, the potato tuber moth, the <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> (Myzus persicae), the potato aphid, beet leafhoppers, thrips, and mites. The {{potato cyst nematode}} is a microscopic worm that thrives on the roots, thus causing the potato plants to wilt. Since its eggs can survive in the soil for several years, crop rotation is recommended.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> are {{difficult}} to control since they reproduce quickly (one adult female can deposit up to four nymphs per day) {{because they tend to}} reside under the leaves and in leaf axils ("leaf armpits"), where they may not be wetted by a soap spray. Manufacturers indeed state that their insecticidal soaps are only suitable for controlling <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> if used in combination with another insecticide, whereas the same soaps can control other aphids on their own. Among <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> that are in contact with a 2% soap solution, around 95% of the adults and 98% of nymphs die within 48 hours. At 0.75% concentration, the mortality rates are reduced to 75% and 90%, respectively.|$|R

50|$|Adult <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> {{appear in}} the summer, and are 1.8 to 2.1 mm long; the head and thorax are black, and the abdomen yellow-green with a dark patch on the back. The nymphs are at first greenish, then {{yellowish}} in colour; those that become winged females may be pinkish. Wingless adults resemble nymphs and are 1.7 to 2.0 mm long.|$|R
25|$|Plants exhibiting aphid damage {{can have}} a variety of symptoms, such as {{decreased}} growth rates, mottled leaves, yellowing, stunted growth, curled leaves, browning, wilting, low yields and death. The removal of sap creates a lack of vigour in the plant, and aphid saliva is toxic to plants. Aphids frequently transmit disease-causing organisms like plant viruses to their hosts. The <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid,</b> Myzus persicae, is a vector for more than 110 plant viruses. Cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) often infect sugarcane, papaya and peanuts with viruses. Aphids contributed to the spread of late blight (Phytophthora infestans) among potatoes in the Irish potato famine of the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland {{ecoregion}} are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), {{daddy longlegs}} (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> (Myzus persicae), spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), damselfly (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca).|$|E

50|$|The vectors are insects of {{the order}} Hemiptera, family Aphididae; <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> (Myzus persicae) and at least 14 other species are known to play that role. AMV can also be {{transmitted}} by seed, pollen, through mechanical inoculation of plant sap and by the parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta). The combination of seed- infected plants and spreading by aphids results mostly in high levels of infection.|$|R
40|$|Investigation of the {{repellent}} and insecticidal {{effects of}} 8 kinds of herb extracts (chives, dokudami, eucalyptus, lavender, peppermint, cherry sage, sweet pepper and tansy) against wingless <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> {{were conducted in}} laboratory and field test. In laboratory repellent tests, 20 aphids were placed between a radish leaf and filter paper for 16 h and aphids on radish leaf were calculated. In laboratory insecticide tests, 20 aphids were placed on a radish leaf treated with herb extract, and live aphids were counted after 16 h. In field tests, the number of aphids that propagated on radish leaves treated with each herb extract was assessed every 3 days. In the laboratory, dokudami, tansy and sweet pepper extracts repelled aphids, while chives, sweet pepper and tansy extracts killed them. In particular, sweet pepper and tansy extracts {{proved to be a}} potent insecticide against aphids. In the field test, the results found that extracts from dokudami, cherry sage and lavender had repellent effect on aphids. In particular, dokudami extract was a highly effective repellent against aphids. These findings suggest that dokudami extract can be used to control wingless <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> in the field. </p...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in the 1999 / 2000 growing season to examine the population dynamics and field distribution of aphid species on winter and spring head lettuce crops. Seven, 0. 25 acre planting of head lettuce were established beginning in October with final harvest occurring in April. Plant samples {{were conducted}} weekly to estimate the numbers of both alate (winged) and apterous (wingless) <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids,</b> potato aphids, cowpea aphids and lettuce aphids. Lettuce aphids were more abundant this spring than anticipated, which may indicate that lettuce aphid may be a new pest for Yuma growers. However, based on a single years data, {{it is difficult to}} measure the threat that this aphid poses to the lettuce industry. Planting date and temperature likely has a strong influence on seasonal abundance of lettuce aphids. Similarly, the consistent appearance of cowpea aphids during the season was surprising, considering that it has seldom been observed on desert lettuce. Perhaps most surprising though was the low population abundance of <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> and potato <b>aphids</b> in out plots. Part of this unusual event {{may be due to the}} unseasonably warm, dry growing season that was experienced this year...|$|R

5000|$|This aphid {{is found}} on older leaves of {{brassica}} plants {{and also on}} the roots. It {{is one of several}} species of aphid to feed on brassicas; the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) feeds only on these plants, while the <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> is found on many different crops and plants including brassicas. The cabbage aphid can be distinguished by its waxy coating and its dense colonies on young growth, while the <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> is dispersed around the brassica plant, occurring mainly on the older leaves of its host.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{development}} of symptoms the disease is latent in peach trees for approximately 5-7 years. The symptoms of the disease include necrosis of buds, delayed shoot development, necrotic branches, premature ageing of trees, flower streaking, ripening deformations, enlarged rounded stones, circular discoloured areas on the fruit skin {{and in some cases}} mosaic, blotch, vein banding or calico appearance on infected leaves. Peach latent mosaic viroid is horizontally spread from plant to plant across a field by propagation of infected buds, pruning tools and <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids.</b> Vertical transmission of peach latent mosaic viroid through seeds can not occur.|$|R

Two rates of Admire, 10 and 20 oz/A appeared to be similar in performance for efficacy against aphids. Depth of placement of Admire in the soil below the seed appears to have some influence on the efficacy and consistency of performance. Much fewer aphids and greater consistency was observed when Admire was placed at 1 -inch depth below the seed compared to 3 - to 4 -inches below the seed...|$|R
40|$|Replicated {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to examine aphid distribution and insecticidal control in a commercial cauliflower seed crop in 2001, and in large plots at the Yuma Agricultural Center in 2003. Results were generally consistent in both studies. The primary aphid species found colonizing pre-blooming crops were cabbage aphids, turnip <b>aphids,</b> and <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids.</b> During the bloom period (March-April), the population was almost exclusively cabbage aphid feeding on seed pods and extensions. During the pre-bloom growth period, <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> tended to colonize plants slightly earlier and were found primarily on the older frame leaves low on the plant. In most cases, male and female plants were colonized to the same extent. Cabbage and turnip aphids {{did not appear to}} have a clear preference between older and younger leaves, and appeared to colonize males and females equally. Once the plant began to bloom and set seed, cabbage aphid was the primary species (> 90 %) found feeding on developing seed pods in both tests. These aphid populations were very susceptible to contact insecticides and quickly knocked down by both Capture and MSR. Of the selective, bee safe products, Pirimor provided the most consistent residual aphid control. Assail and Fulfill worked well against aphids on foliage, but did not provide comparable control on seed pods. Aphid densities were extremely high in the untreated check and resulted in almost complete loss of the crop in these plots. Seed yields were not taken due to heavy losses to Sclerotinia and bird damage...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} models predict an {{increase}} in the frequency and severity of extreme temperature events in temperate regions. I explored the effects of severe and fluctuating daily temperatures on aphid-parasitoid interactions, parasitoid life history, and community dynamics using both theoretical and experimental approaches. I first modelled the community level effects of daily maximum temperatures, the frequency of warmer-than-average days, and the autocorrelation of daily temperatures on a theoretical aphid-parasitoid community. Then I experimentally investigated influence of the frequency and amplitude of daily temperatures on trait-mediated indirect interactions between <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> and A. matricariae. Finally, I assessed how development under extreme fluctuating temperature regimes influenced the life history characteristics of A. matricariae.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} tests conducted in Nebraska showed DDT {{to be more}} effective than any other material yet tested against potato insect pests. Records were obtained on tuber flea beetles, Epitrix tuberis, potato psyllids, Paratrioza cockerelli, potato leafhoppers, Empoasca fabae, <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids,</b> Myzus persicae, Lygus elisus, Chlamydatus associatus, Aceratagallia uhleri and Macrosteles divisus. DDT remained effective against potato psyllids and potato leafhoppers under field conditions for a relatively long period of time. Populations of certain beneficial insects, such as Nabis spp., Orius spp. and lady beetles were found to be significantly reduced by DDT dust or spray. The adverse effect of DDT on predatory species seems to be minimized by the fact that this material also controls the major potato pests found in this state. DDT had no injurious effect on potato plants at the strengths used...|$|R

50|$|PLRV can be {{introduced}} to potatoes by planting infected seeds or by insect vectors. The <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> (Myzus persicae) is the primary vector of PLRV. Aphids acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants. The infected phloem is taken up through the aphid stylet into the digestive system. The virus then crosses the membrane of the gut and enters the hemocoel where it then can cross the membrane into the salivary glands.This process takes several hours, after which time the aphid will continue to transmit the virus for its remaining life. This process is known as persistent transmission. In temperate regions, the <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> is able to persist through the winter by laying eggs in woody species of the genus Prunus. Eggs hatch in early spring, and early instar aphids feed on tree phloem until summer, when they switch to more preferred herbacous hosts, including agricultural crops. During this time the <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> can transmit PLRV present in weeds of the family Solanaceae to potatoes and other crops. Potato plants infected with PLRV will produced infected tubers. If infected tubers are planted they will give rise to infected plants. Aphids can also spread PLRV to tubers in storage, especially after they sprout. Winged aphids can be carried several hundred kilometers by wind currents, allowing for widespread infection.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to control {{pathogens}} and insect pests affecting greenhouse tomatoes, we evaluated an electric field screen to create an airy greenhouse condition that successfully excluded insect vectors (whiteflies, <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids,</b> western flower thrips and shore flies) of pathogens and airborne conidia of tomato powdery mildew. The screen consisted of three parts: 1) insulated conductor wires (ICWs) arrayed in parallel at 5 -mm intervals, 2) two stainless-steel nets that were grounded and placed {{on both sides of}} the ICWs, and 3) a direct current (DC) voltage generator to negatively charge the ICWs. An electric field formed between the negative surface charge of the ICWs and the positive charge on the ICW-side surface of the grounded net.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of pirimicarb, imidacloprid, dimethoate, lambda-cyhalothrin, flonicamid and spinosad to the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, was evaluated {{in a laboratory}} study. Susceptibility of fourth instars and female adults was assessed by measuring toxicity via residual contact and ingestion through feeding on contaminated <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> (Myzus persicae). Flonicamid and spinosad had no lethal effects on larvae and female adults. Pirimicarb was harmless to the predator by ingestion exposure but showed some residual toxicity at high concentrations to both larval and adult stages. Imidacloprid was highly toxic to the larval stage by residual and ingestion exposure but caused very low adult mortality when ingested through contaminated prey. Dimethoate and lambda-cyhalothrin were highly toxic to both the larval and adult stages of the ladybird. Our findings indicate that pest management programs in agricultural crops using dimethoate, lambdacyhalothrin and, to a lesser degree, imidacloprid, are detrimental to A. bipunctata, whereas pirimicarb, flonicamid and spinosad are more compatible {{with the use of}} this predator...|$|R

50|$|Myzus persicae, {{known as}} the <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> or the peach-potato aphid, is a small green aphid. It is the most {{significant}} aphid pest of peach trees, causing decreased growth, shriveling of the leaves and the death of various tissues. It is also hazardous because it acts as a vector for the transport of plant viruses, such as potato virus Y and potato leafroll virus to members of the nightshade/potato family Solanaceae, and various mosaic viruses to many other food crops.|$|E
50|$|Seed {{certification}} programs allow only a {{very small}} level of PLRV in certified seed. In Idaho, for instance, during the second field inspection the allowable amount of PLRV is only 0.05% for G4 seed, 0.01% for G3 and G2 and none at all allowed in nuclear and G1. Very small percentages of PLRV in seed potatoes do not normally pose any risk for the commercial producer. However, even very small percentages of virus can be a problem if <b>green</b> <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> appear very early and in abundance. In years that are very favorable for insects, like the 1996 season was, the aphid population can become so large that even a very low percentage of PLRV infected seed could result in sufficient spread to cause a problem, because as the aphid population increases, so does the probability that they will encounter an infected plant. Control of aphids with insecticide application is the only means of managing this problem in production years that are highly favorable for aphids.|$|R
