5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E

5|$|Parasitic {{protozoa}} of {{the genus}} Sarcocystis <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the smooth muscles of adult American white ibis, and another species, Haemoproteus plataleae, has been recovered from the blood of adults and nestlings, and can hence be transmitted before the young leave the nest. The larvae of two species of mite of the family Hypoderidae, Phalacrodectes whartoni and Neoattialges eudocimae, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from under the skin. Two species of the louse suborder Mallophaga, Plegadiphilus eudocimus and Ardeicola robusta, also parasitise the bird.|$|E
5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a {{decline in the number of}} beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera Diplodocus and Barosaurus {{had very}} similar limb bones. In the past, many {{isolated}} limb bones were automatically attributed to Diplodocus, but may, in fact, {{have belonged to}} Barosaurus. Fossil remains of Diplodocus <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from stratigraphic zone 5 of the Morrison Formation.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{remains of}} Deinonychus <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming {{and in the}} roughly {{contemporary}} Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus.|$|E
5|$|P. l. fossilis, P. fossilis or P. spelaea fossilis, {{known as}} the Middle Pleistocene European cave lion, flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from Germany and Italy. It was larger than today's African lions, {{reaching}} sizes comparable to the American cave lion and slightly larger than the Upper Pleistocene European cave lion.|$|E

5|$|Several {{bird species}} prey on grey jays, {{including}} great grey owls (Strix nebulosa), northern hawk-owls (Surnia ulula), and Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida). Grey jay remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the lairs of fisher (Martes pennanti) and American marten (Martes americana). Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) eat grey jay eggs. Grey jays alert {{each other to}} threats by whistling alarm notes, screaming, chattering, or imitating and/or mobbing predators.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} {{discovery}} in 1884, fossils {{of more than}} 30 individuals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered,</b> providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of Albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology, which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The genus is {{classified}} in the subtribe Embothriinae of the Proteaceae, along with the tree waratahs (Alloxylon) from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and the South American genera Oreocallis and Embothrium. Almost all of these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely pre-dated the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. Propylipollis ambiguus (formerly Triporopollenites ambiguus) is the oldest identifiable member of the Embothriinae. It is known only from pollen deposits, and was originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of T.truncata, Alloxylon pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Fossil remains of Telopea truncata <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from early to middle Pleistocene strata at Regatta Point in western Tasmania. The leaves are small, and these beds housed a subalpine plant community {{in what is now}} lowland terrain. Leaves identical to (and classified as) Telopea truncata <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from early Oligocene deposits around Lake Cethana near Sheffield.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system {{and particularly the}} small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} of Majungasaurus <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the Maevarano Formation in the Mahajanga Province in northwestern Madagascar. Most of these, including {{all of the}} most complete material, came from the Anembalemba Member, although Majungasaurus teeth have also {{been found in the}} underlying Masorobe Member and the overlying Miadana Member. While these sediments have not been dated radiometrically, evidence from biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism suggest that they were deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, which lasted from 70 to 66 Ma (million years ago). Majungasaurus teeth are found up until {{the very end of the}} Maastrichtian, when all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} of Ocepeia {{come from the}} Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a phosphate basin. Research on Ocepeia {{has been carried out}} by French and Moroccan researchers led by Dr. Emmanuel Gheerbrant of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Ocepeia fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens. Some of the original material was collected on-site as early as 1997, while other material was obtained from fossil dealers.|$|E
