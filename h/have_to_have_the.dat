5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem is}} that unless we impose very strong {{mathematical}} restrictions, we cannot say that this Cobb-Douglas production function for sector i plus one for sector j (plus that for sector k, etc.) {{adds up to a}} Cobb-Douglas production function for {{the economy as a whole}} (with K and L being the sum of all of the different sectoral values). In short, for the sum of Cobb-Douglas production functions to equal a Cobb-Douglas, the production functions for all of the different sectors <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same values of A and a.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the theory}} of ideasthesia, a sentient system <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{capability}} <b>to</b> categorize and to create concepts. Empirical evidence suggests that sentience about stimuli is closely related to the process of extracting the meaning of the stimuli. How one understands the stimuli determines how one experiences them.|$|R

25|$|For a {{good deal}} of time, Ryang had to rely on Fanta to deal with evil affinities until they could be purified. This changed when Fanta's brother gave Ryang some strong magical {{abilities}} using his skateboard as a medium. So far, Ryang has used the skateboard to fly, and created a powerful energy blast by drawing on its power, even though it was nowhere near him. Five spirits can inhabit the skateboard, each representing one of the five elements (earth, fire, wood, water, and metal). Evidently, Ryang does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> skateboard with him to access magical power, and is extremely likely he can do much more.|$|E
25|$|Food {{availability}} {{relates to}} the supply of food through production, distribution, and exchange. Food production is determined {{by a variety of}} factors including land ownership and use; soil management; crop selection, breeding, and management; livestock breeding and management; and harvesting. Crop production can be affected by changes in rainfall and temperatures. The use of land, water, and energy to grow food often competes with other uses, which can affect food production. Land used for agriculture can be used for urbanization or lost to desertification, salinization, and soil erosion due to unsustainable agricultural practices. Crop production is not required for a country to achieve food security. Nations don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> natural resources required to produce crops in order to achieve food security, as seen in the examples of Japan and Singapore.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{telephone}} line network which the Meganet ran on {{has been criticized}} for its logistical issues in online gaming. [...] According to Electronic Gaming Monthly, [...] "Even though the TeleGenesis modem has been announced, it has yet to appear and the real usefulness of a device that is used only to play games with friends over the phone lines remains questionable (both <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> modem, the phone lines must be clear, the phone bills will be a problem if it’s a long-distance call, etc.)" [...] The same issues that plagued the Meganet over the use of phone lines for Internet connectivity would later resurface when Catapult Entertainment launched the XBAND service in 1994.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Druckmann tried to exclude [...] "fancy dialogue", keeping {{everything}} [...] "short and natural". Community strategist Eric Monacelli {{has stated that}} the narrative's overarching themes are [...] "love, loyalty and redemption", assuring their importance in the game, and fellow community strategist Arne Meyer said that the game's violence fit the narrative. Straley reiterated this, stating [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> dark to have the light". Game designer Anthony Newman stated that the game deals with how people would react under pressure in extreme situations, which is represented through the violence and combat.

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look as real as possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E
