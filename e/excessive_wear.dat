5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to <b>excessive</b> <b>wear.</b> Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations and <b>excessive</b> <b>wear,</b> heat damage, torch {{or electric}} arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E

His ticket, with his papers and gloves and other things, was, we will suppose, on the seat beside him. He was probably an American, and also probably a man of weak intellect. The <b>excessive</b> <b>wearing</b> of jewellery is an early symptom in some forms of mania.|$|R
25|$|Each {{carriage}} {{has four}} wheels {{on a fixed}} long-wheelbase, rather than the more usual arrangement of eight wheels attached to bogies. This arrangement has been criticised for causing loud noise and <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> to the wheels and track when going around tight curves in the track.|$|E
25|$|The Penny Black {{was printed}} from 11 plates, but as Plate 1 was {{completely}} overhauled due to <b>excessive</b> <b>wear,</b> {{it is generally}} considered to be two separate plates, 1a and 1b. Plate 11 was originally intended solely for the printing of new red stamps, but a small number were printed in black. These are scarce.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{combination}} of improper preparation and treatment of the dies, <b>excessive</b> <b>wear,</b> and overuse, die deterioration doubling has occurred on nearly every series issued by the US mint in recent times. Certain coins are more susceptible to it than others, due to various factors, but it does occur on most series of coins.|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{importance}} of the Power on Ethernet (PoE) technology has been increasing significantly. Specifically, the use of standard voltages of 12, 24 or 48 V and construction of the appropriate uninterruptable power supply unit to supply the PoE devices come to the fore. This paper describes construction of a simple but reliable and highly efficient UPS circuit which employs electronic battery connecting, defined battery charging and maintenance currents. The purpose of this construction is to find the means of protecting the battery from <b>excessive</b> <b>wearing</b> off...|$|R

25|$|Before Schumacher's appeal {{from his}} {{disqualification}} at the British Grand Prix, he was disqualified from the Belgian Grand Prix as his Benetton had <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> of the plank. The FIA allowed the plank to be ten millimetres deep, with an allowance of one millimetre {{meaning that the}} plank must be a minimum of nine millimetres to be deemed legal. A majority of the plank on Schumacher's car measured 7.4 millimetres, 1.6 under the legal tolerance. Benetton, along with Schumacher, claimed that the plank had <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> due to a spin by Schumacher during the race. Benetton launched an immediate appeal, with a World Motor Sport Council meeting set for September 5. The allegations of Benetton cheating throughout the summer of 1994 led to rumours of Schumacher quitting the team. The team released a statement denying the rumours, stating that Schumacher would complete the season.|$|E
25|$|A flexure is {{designed}} {{as part of}} the motor actuator, to improve safety and provide robust force control, energy efficiency, shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> on the transmission and other mechanical components. The resultant lower reflected inertia can improve safety when a robot is interacting with humans or during collisions. It has been used in various robots, particularly advanced manufacturing robots and walking humanoid robots.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{cleared the}} F4U for carrier {{operations}} {{well before the}} U.S. Navy and showed that the Corsair Mk II could be operated with reasonable success even from escort carriers. It was not without problems; one was <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> of the arrester wires, due both to {{the weight of the}} Corsair and the understandable tendency of the pilots to stay well above the stalling speed. A total of 2,012 Corsairs were supplied to the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave oven for 10â€“15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> to the microwave oven. Many office paper shredders {{are also designed to}} shred CDs.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent tool {{fracture}} and to minimize <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> and tear on the tool and associated machinery, the welding cycle is modified so that the forces acting on the tool are as low as possible, and abrupt changes are avoided. In order {{to find the best}} combination of welding parameters, it is likely that a compromise must be reached, since the conditions that favour low forces (e.g. high heat input, low travel speeds) may be undesirable {{from the point of view}} of productivity and weld properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
5000|$|Horses often gnaw on wood rails, fences or boards as if {{they were}} food. This has been linked with dietary deficiencies, and often can be {{remedied}} with a balanced diet or dietary supplementation [...] Lignophagia in horses can be a cause of colic due to the ingestion of wood splinters. and in severe cases, can cause <b>excessive</b> <b>wearing</b> and deterioration of the teeth. A related vice is cribbing, wherein the horse grabs a wood board and sucks in air; not all wood-chewing is cribbing and though cribbing may also result in chewing on the wood surface, the two vices are not identical. Horses displaying abnormal oral behaviours may be less desirable to potential buyers and may be devalued as a consequence.|$|R
40|$|Portable {{chainsaw}} {{is a basic}} {{operational instrument}} in forestry. To ensure long-lasting performance of a chainsaw, {{it is necessary to}} perform the necessary maintenance of its cutting system. The basis of this maintenance lies in the lubrication of the chain, which protects it from <b>excessive</b> <b>wearing</b> and deterioration. Various lubricating oils are used for lubricating the chain. Biodegradable oils are promoted nowadays, with their main advantage being shorter decomposition time in the environment, and the same lubricating properties as conventional lubricants. This paper is aimed to evaluate and compare the ability to lubricate and cool the cutting system of a portable chainsaw filled with biodegradable oil and oils commonly used for its operation. Conditions of measurements were specified to simulate the actual operating conditions. During the evaluation no major differences between these oils were observed...|$|R

25|$|Express {{was laid}} down on at Laird's Birkenhead {{shipyard}} on 1 December 1896 as Yard number 629, and was launched on 11 December 1897. Express {{was subject to}} an extensive series of trials over an 18-month period {{in an attempt to}} reach the contracted speed of 33 knots. Although Lairds managed to drive the ship's machinery to up to , well in excess of the rated , and experimented with different propellers, Express failed to reach the required speeds. It was eventually decided by the Admiralty to accept Express despite this failure in recognition of Laird's great efforts and expense in trying to reach the over-optimistic requirement, and the fact that forcing the ship's machinery further was likely to cause <b>excessive</b> <b>wear.</b> Express was delivered to Devonport for further trials in August 1902, and eventually commissioned later that year.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} surrounding {{certain aspects of}} the Kariandusi site, including its possible use as a [...] "factory" [...] site, and why the <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> on the edges of the handaxes there are not typical of those from surrounding sites.|$|E
2500|$|The Benetton team, {{along with}} Williams, McLaren, Lotus, Pacific, Simtek, Jordan, Footwork Arrows and Ligier debated {{the issue in}} the Williams {{motorhome}} to discuss the technical regulations. More changes came into force for the Canadian and German races, with the introductions of [...] "pump fuel" [...] (more closely related to commercially available fuel, slightly reducing horsepower and engine performance) and the [...] "plank" [...] (a piece of wood running along the underside of the chassis that is monitored for <b>excessive</b> <b>wear,</b> increasing ride height and thus decreasing grip).|$|E

5000|$|A better {{method is}} to {{downshift}} to a lower gear that would spin the engine within its RPM limit, and use the throttle to [...] "Rev match" [...] the engine to the road speed before releasing the clutch fully.

2500|$|Steam was {{replaced}} by Class 37s, working in pairs. [...] Other classes that appeared include Hymeks. The Hymeks allocated to Lickey banking duties were modified so that the lowest transmission ratio was inoperative, despite the requirement for high tractive effort. The reason for this modification was that the typical speed of a train ascending the bank was approximately that at which the transmission would change between first and second gear, and so it tended to [...] "hunt" [...] between the two. The repeated gear changes under full power caused <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> and damage, and {{the simplest way to}} avoid the problem was to lock first gear out of action, so the locomotives used only second gear and upwards.|$|E
2500|$|... 1994 {{also saw}} the {{reintroduction}} of refuelling during {{the race for the}} first time since [...] After Senna's fatal crash at Imola, several rule changes were introduced to slow the cars. In Spain, front wing endplates and rear diffusers were reduced in size. For the following race in Canada, the effectiveness of the airbox was reduced by means of holes cut into the engine cover, resulting in less power. From Germany onwards, a rule was introduced which is still in place as of : a 10mm wooden plank was affixed to the underside of every car to reduce ground effect advantages, whilst also forcing an increase in ride height. Wear was permitted on the plank up to 1mm by the end of the race. After winning in Belgium, Michael Schumacher would be disqualified after the plank on his Benetton was deemed to have <b>excessive</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Once Typhoons started {{operating}} from forward landing grounds in Normandy, {{it was found}} that the dust clouds stirred up by propeller wash consisted of over 80 percent of hard, abrasive material which was damaging the Sabre engines. The sleeve valves in particular were subject to <b>excessive</b> <b>wear</b> and it was calculated that engines would last for three take-offs. As a result, a [...] "dome deflector" [...] was designed and manufactured at great speed by Napier, and within a week most Typhoons had been fitted with it. In operational service these mushroom-shaped air filters, which became red hot, had a propensity for being blown off the air intake at high speed whenever a Sabre engine backfired. They were soon replaced by drum-shaped filters designed by the RAE and Vokes. These had [...] "cuckoo clock" [...] doors in front, which swung open with the pressure changes caused by engine backfires. This standardised filter became Typhoon Mod.420.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} used {{saturated steam}} and had flat [...] "D" [...] type slide valves, placed above the cylinders {{and operated by}} Stephenson Link valve gear through rocker shafts.

50|$|It was {{an embarrassment}} for Westinghouse, which had {{designed}} the locomotives far too lightly and rigidly.
