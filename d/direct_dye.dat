40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} manner by which the uptake of direct dyes on cellulosic fibres is promoted by {{a reduction in the}} liquor ratio used for dyeing. According to the model, which invokes the concept of interstitial water in dyeing, reducing the liquor ratio promotes dye aggregation which reduces the solubility of the dye in the bulk dyebath phase, so that the inherent preference of the dye to favour the aqueous phase shifts towards the fibre phase. It is suggested that the same mechanism accounts for the promotion of <b>direct</b> <b>dye</b> uptake imparted by the addition of inorganic electrolyte to <b>direct</b> <b>dye</b> dyebaths.

The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the coagulation features of polymeric aluminum coagulants in treatment of dye-polluted waters and the emphasis was placed on the roles of preformed Al species, particularly Al- 13. The performance of Al- 13 in coagulation of dyes was observed through jar tests by comparing traditional Al salt, polyaluminum chloride (PACI), and purified Al- 13. The results showed that under most cases All 3 had significantly higher efficiency in removal of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> than traditional Al salt and commercial PAC] with the exception of Direct Red 28 removal under high pH range. The coagulation of <b>direct</b> <b>dyes</b> could be greatly affected by pH. Reducing pH was favorable for preformed Al species in a broad pH range. For traditional Al coagulant, efficient dye removal only occurred in a relatively narrow pH range of near 6. 0. The outstanding coagulation behavior of Al- 13 Could be ascribed to its high charge neutralization ability, relative stability and potential self-assembly tendency. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
