5|$|A Hind in Richmond Park by William Henry Hudson, {{published}} in 1922 and re{{published in}} 2006, is an extended natural history essay. It includes {{an account of}} his visits to Richmond Park and a particular occasion when a young girl {{was struck by a}} red deer when she tried to <b>feed</b> <b>it</b> an acorn.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher is an omnivore. Its diet {{includes}} invertebrates such as beetles, moths, butterflies, arachnids, and snails. It also eats vegetable matter, {{and fruits}} from cacti, prickly pear, hackberries, and anacua, among other plants. The curve-billed {{has also been}} spotted eating dog food, and will <b>feed</b> <b>it</b> to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not <b>feed</b> <b>it</b> directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E

50|$|Bernier's teal {{typically}} {{spends much}} of its day actively <b>feeding.</b> <b>It</b> wades {{at the edge of}} shallow water, filtering mud and dabbling at the water's surface. <b>It</b> <b>feeds</b> on invertebrates, plant materials, and insects.|$|R
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen {{in one of two}} ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and <b>feed</b> <b>it</b> to the larvae.|$|E
5|$|Fox Sports Detroit HD is a 720p high {{definition}} simulcast feed of Fox Sports Detroit. It telecasts all Detroit Pistons, Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers games in HD, their respective pre-game and post-game shows and team magazine shows, {{as well as}} all college and high school games and programs. Wingspan became the first locally produced pre-recorded program to be broadcast in HD when it began in 2009. In 2010, Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and MHSAA games began airing in HD. Nationally televised FSN games and other programs are also broadcast in HD. Like the standard-definition <b>feed,</b> <b>it</b> is available nationwide via DirecTV and Dish Network, and on most cable providers in Michigan and some in Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as <b>feed</b> <b>it</b> and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E

5|$|The plant {{develops}} {{the ability to}} speak and demands that Seymour <b>feed</b> <b>it.</b> Now anemic and {{not knowing what to}} feed the plant, Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track. When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop to get some cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next day when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may {{go into a}} torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day and}} feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to <b>feed.</b> <b>It</b> also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic priests {{accompanying}} the expedition celebrated {{mass in the}} presence of Aj Kan Ek', the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols. Cortés accepted an invitation from Kan Ek' to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to <b>feed</b> <b>it</b> poultry, meat and flowers, but the animal soon died. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén.|$|E

25|$|The {{centreline}} and on-ballers form what {{is known}} as the midfield. In today's game, midfielders are generally separated into two categories: inside midfielders and outside midfielders.

According to a recent phylogenetic study, its closest relative is Vespa dybowski.|$|E
25|$|Associative {{learning}} in animal behaviour is any learning {{process in which}} a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus. The first studies of associative learning were made by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. Examples of associative {{learning in}}clude when a goldfish swims to the water surface when a human is going to <b>feed</b> <b>it,</b> or the excitement of a dog whenever it sees a leash as a prelude for a walk.|$|E
25|$|Lying {{outside in}} the farm {{courtyard}} is a large oval sandstone object with metal attachments on its central axis. This was used to crush whin or gorse in a shallow trough, the stone being dragged up and down by a horse, making the spiny and tough branches of the plant suitable for use as animal <b>feed.</b> <b>It</b> was normally only used when other sources of feed were lacking.|$|E

25|$|The {{longevity}} {{of the adult}} depends on temperature, but while females live for several weeks, males live fewer than three days in adult form. During this time, the male does not <b>feed.</b> <b>It</b> takes flight with its single pair of wings and seeks females. The female spends its longer lifetime feeding and producing eggs. Most {{other aspects of the}} life cycle depend on temperature, as well, including egg mortality, nymph mortality, rate of development, sex ratio, fecundity, and the length of the egg-laying period.|$|E
