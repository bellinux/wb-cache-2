5|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a <b>hallucination.</b> Macbeth {{had already seen}} a <b>hallucination</b> before murdering Duncan: a knife {{hovering}} in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what he claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night's Dream—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.|$|E
25|$|Hypnagogic <b>hallucinations</b> and {{hypnopompic}} <b>hallucinations</b> {{are considered}} normal phenomena. Hypnagogic <b>hallucinations</b> can occur as one is falling asleep and hypnopompic <b>hallucinations</b> occur {{when one is}} waking up. <b>Hallucinations</b> {{can be associated with}} drug use (particularly deliriants), sleep deprivation, psychosis, neurological disorders, and delirium tremens.|$|R
40|$|Whereas visual <b>hallucinations</b> {{are often}} found among {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease, {{the occurrence of}} auditory <b>hallucinations</b> has never been systematically documented. The occurrence, past and present, of auditory <b>hallucinations</b> has been studied in 121 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease attending a movement disorders clinic. The cognitive state was evaluated using the short mental test (SMT). <b>Hallucinations</b> were reported for 45 patients (37 %); 35 (29 %) had only visual <b>hallucinations</b> and 10 (8 %) both visual and auditory <b>hallucinations.</b> No patient reported auditory <b>hallucinations</b> unaccompanied by visual <b>hallucinations.</b> The auditory <b>hallucinations</b> occurred repeatedly, consisting of human voices. They were non-imperative (n= 9), non-paranoid (n= 9), and often incomprehensible (n= 5). They were not obviously influenced by the patients' age, duration of disease, or treatment with levodopa. Cognitive impairment was more common among hallucinating patients (64 %, 50 %, and 25 % among patients with visual <b>hallucinations,</b> auditory <b>hallucinations,</b> and non-hallucinating parkinsonian patients respectively). Depression necessitating antidepressants was present in five of 10 and other psychotic features in six patients with auditory <b>hallucinations.</b> It is concluded that auditory <b>hallucinations</b> occur in Parkinson's disease, particularly in patients who also have visual <b>hallucinations</b> and are cognitively impaired. ...|$|R
50|$|Increased neurophysiological {{activity}} in the fusiform face area may produce <b>hallucinations</b> of faces, whether realistic or cartoonesque, as seen in Charles Bonnet syndrome, hypnagogic <b>hallucinations,</b> peduncular <b>hallucinations,</b> or drug-induced <b>hallucinations.</b>|$|R
5|$|Rachel Dratch, {{longtime}} comedy {{partner and}} fellow Saturday Night Live alumna of Fey, was originally cast to portray Jenna. Dratch {{played the role}} in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement. Executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that while Dratch would not be playing a series regular, she would appear in various episodes in a different role. In this episode, she played a <b>hallucination</b> of Tracy's, which he called Blue Dude.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{centered}} {{on the character of}} Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), with flashbacks revealing his past, including his childhood and his trip to Australia looking for his missing father Christian Shephard. In present-day events, the plane crash survivors begin to struggle as they realize they are running out of fresh water. While Jack tries to solve the conflicts, he starts seeing Christian in the jungle, and chases the <b>hallucination</b> of his dead father.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{arrives at}} Means' home, but is confronted by other Group members and assaulted. Means is inside, {{experiencing}} a prolonged <b>hallucination.</b> She considers suicide, instead writing something and sealing {{it in an}} envelope. Black finds her home, accompanied by paramedics who take her away. She gives Black the envelope—containing a phial of vaccine—and he thanks her, unable to discover what happened to Watts.|$|E
50|$|Other visual <b>hallucinations</b> tend to {{stem from}} {{psychological}} disorders. Whereas {{a person with a}} psychological disorder thinks their <b>hallucinations</b> are real, people with peduncular hallucinosis normally know that the visual <b>hallucinations</b> they see are not real. Peduncular <b>hallucinations</b> are independent of seizures, unlike some other visual <b>hallucinations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>hallucinations</b> varies widely from rare to frequent, as does duration (seconds to minutes). Content of <b>hallucinations</b> varies as well. Complex (formed) visual <b>hallucinations</b> {{are more common}} than Simple (non-formed) visual <b>hallucinations.</b> In contrast to <b>hallucinations</b> experienced in organic conditions, <b>hallucinations</b> experienced as symptoms of psychoses {{tend to be more}} frightening. An example of this would be <b>hallucinations</b> that have imagery of bugs, dogs, snakes, distorted faces. Visual <b>hallucinations</b> may also be present in those with Parkinson’s, where visions of dead individuals can be present. In psychoses, this is relatively rare, although visions of God, angels, the devil, saints, and fairies are common. Individuals often report being surprised when <b>hallucinations</b> occur and are generally helpless to change or stop them. In general, individuals believe that visions are experienced only by themselves.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>hallucinations</b> is reviewed, including its occurrence in different psychiatric disorders, neurological disorders and normal persons. The diagnostic significance of <b>hallucinations</b> is also discussed. Reports of <b>hallucinations</b> in normal people are reviewed. The different modes {{of the management}} of <b>hallucinations</b> are briefly discussed...|$|R
5|$|After {{a poignant}} attempt at radio {{communication}} with a fisherman on Earth who speaks only Eskimo–Aleut, Stone resigns herself to being stranded and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As {{she begins to}} lose consciousness, Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing jets to propel the capsule toward Tiangong. Stone then realizes that Kowalski's reappearance was a <b>hallucination,</b> but has nonetheless given her the strength of will to continue. She restores the flow of oxygen and uses the landing jets to navigate toward Tiangong on momentum.|$|E
5|$|All clues lead F.E.A.R. {{to believe}} Fettel is being {{controlled}} by Alma, who {{was locked in}} the Origin facility when ATC closed down the project owing to the danger the woman posed; Fettel is searching for that same facility to free his mother. The player takes the Point Man to the abandoned structure, fighting back both the clone soldiers and ATC guards, who have received orders {{to cover up the}} whole affair. When the protagonist comes to finally face Fettel, he is drawn into a <b>hallucination</b> where the player learns how the Point Man is Alma's first son and is thereafter enabled to kill Fettel himself.|$|E
5|$|As a {{hurricane}} approaches Quahog, Rhode Island, the Griffin family prepares for its arrival. In his own attempt {{to pass the}} time, Brian decides to use magic mushrooms, to the curiosity of Stewie. As the mushrooms start to take effect on Brian, he begins having hallucinations and eventually cuts his own ear off. Stewie tries to help Brian by staying by his side {{and taking care of}} him, but Brian continues to perceive himself in an ugly world where he is continually attacked by various monsters resembling the Griffins and Quagmire. Brian eventually snaps out of the <b>hallucination</b> after Stewie helps him downstairs to drink some water.|$|E
50|$|There exist {{two types}} of Visual <b>Hallucinations.</b> These are - Simple, or non-formed visual <b>hallucinations,</b> and Complex, or formed visual <b>hallucinations.</b> Two neurotransmitters are {{particularly}} important in visual <b>hallucinations</b> - Serotonin, and Acetylcholine. They are concentrated in the visual thalamic nuclei and visual cortex.|$|R
40|$|Somatic <b>hallucinations</b> {{occur in}} {{schizophrenia}} and other psychotic disorders, although auditory <b>hallucinations</b> are more common. Although the neural correlates of auditory <b>hallucinations</b> {{have been described}} in several neuroimaging studies, little is known of the pathophysiology of somatic <b>hallucinations.</b> Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) {{was used to compare}} the distribution of brain activity during somatic and auditory verbal <b>hallucinations,</b> occurring at different times in a 36 year old man with schizophrenia. Somatic <b>hallucinations</b> were associated with activation in the primary somatosensory and posterior parietal cortex, areas that normally mediate tactile perception. Auditory <b>hallucinations</b> were associated with activation in the middle and superior temporal cortex, areas involved in processing external speech. <b>Hallucinations</b> in a given modality seem to involve areas that normally process sensory information in that modality. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Hallucinations</b> may be {{manifested}} {{in a variety}} of forms. Various forms of <b>hallucinations</b> affect different senses, sometimes occurring simultaneously, creating multiple sensory <b>hallucinations</b> for those experiencing them.|$|R
5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's <b>hallucination</b> of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to tell if she is from the prime universe: by {{confirming}} her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|Heather has {{had enough}} of Will's pot-and-alcohol-fueled apathy. Despite Will's protestations, she takes the baby and walks out ("Too Much, Too Soon"). Around the same time, lying in a bed in an army {{hospital}} ("Before the Lobotomy"), Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness he has seen during wartime and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ("Extraordinary Girl"). He quickly {{falls in love with}} her. His <b>hallucination</b> disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ("Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)").|$|E
5|$|In series 3, {{after the}} events of series 2 are {{revealed}} to be a <b>hallucination,</b> Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect find themselves again stuck on prehistoric Earth. After being rescued, they find themselves transported to Lord's Cricket Ground just before it is destroyed by 11 white robots. Slartibartfast teaches Dent how cricket {{is based on the}} history of the worst wars in the galaxy, and the pair travel to Krikkit in order to prevent another war. In the final part, Dent and Trillian meet the computer behind the Supernova Bomb and there is another attempt to find the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe and Everything.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hallucinations</b> are a psychopathological {{phenomenon}} with neuropsychological, neuroanatomical and pathophysiological correlates {{in specific}} brain areas. They can affect {{any of the}} senses, but auditory and visual <b>hallucinations</b> predominate. Verbal <b>hallucinations</b> reveal no gross organic lesions while visual <b>hallucinations</b> are connected to defined brain lesions. Functional neuroimaging shows impairments in modality specific sensory systems with the hyperactivity of the surrounding cerebral cortex. Disinhibition and expansion of the inner speech was noted with impaired internal monitoring in auditory verbal <b>hallucinations.</b> The subcortical areas and modal-specific associative cortex and cingulate cortex are essential for the occurrence of <b>hallucinations...</b>|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Yukio {{arrives and}} kills Dr. Green as Logan fights the Silver Samurai. The Silver Samurai severs Logan's adamantium claws {{and begins to}} extract Logan's healing abilities, {{revealing}} himself to be Ichirō, who had faked his death. Ichirō regains his youth, but Mariko intervenes and stabs Ichirō with Logan's severed claws. Logan regenerates his bone claws and kills Ichirō. Logan collapses and has one final <b>hallucination</b> of Jean, in which he decides to finally let go of her. Mariko becomes CEO of Yashida Industries and bids farewell to Logan {{as he prepares to}} leave Japan. Yukio vows to stay by Logan's side as his bodyguard, and they depart to places unknown.|$|E

The first segment begins with Linda leaving for work (at a local strip club) and then follows Oscar's nightly routine through strict point-of-view shots, including momentary blackouts that represent blinking, private internal thoughts, and extended sequences of a DMT-induced <b>hallucination.</b>|$|E
5|$|Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) {{is being}} sent on an {{interstellar}} journey {{to evaluate whether}} a decades old space station should continue to study the remote oceanic planet Solaris. He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father (Nikolai Grinko) and retired pilot Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky). They watch filmed testimony of Berton describing a four-meter-tall child on Solaris, only to have this sighting dismissed as a <b>hallucination</b> {{by a panel of}} scientists. After burning his personal mementos, Kelvin departs Earth to meet the Solaris scientists who have made reports that are equally confusing.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates {{that there may be}} phenomenological, symptom, and diagnostic associations between trauma and <b>hallucinations.</b> However, {{the nature of the relationship}} is poorly understood from a psychological perspective. We report a theoretically informed phenomenological study. From descriptions of reported traumas and <b>hallucinations,</b> we assessed the rates of four types of hypothesized association between traumas and <b>hallucinations</b> (direct, indirect, stress, and none) in 75 participants with nonaffective psychosis. In a subgroup who had experienced trauma (N = 40), 12. 5 % had <b>hallucinations</b> with similar themes and content to their traumas, 45 % had <b>hallucinations</b> in which the themes were the same but not the content, and 42. 5 % had no identifiable associations between their <b>hallucinations</b> and previously experienced trauma. Traumas rated as intrusive were significantly associated with <b>hallucinations</b> rated as intrusive, although intrusive <b>hallucinations</b> were not associated with traumas in general. The traumas most likely to be associated with <b>hallucinations</b> were sexual abuse and bullying...|$|R
25|$|Command <b>hallucinations</b> are <b>hallucinations</b> in {{the form}} of commands; they can be {{auditory}} or inside of the person's mind and/or consciousness. The contents of the <b>hallucinations</b> can range from the innocuous to commands to cause harm to the self or others. Command <b>hallucinations</b> are often associated with schizophrenia. People experiencing command <b>hallucinations</b> may or may not comply with the hallucinated commands, depending on the circumstances. Compliance is more common for non-violent commands.|$|R
5|$|Skinner is {{a former}} Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. In the war he once killed a boy at a very short distance, an {{experience}} which has scarred him for life. He is married to Sharon Skinner. He has been treated at a sleep disorder clinic, suffering from recurring dreams of an old woman, which may either be a <b>hallucination</b> arising from drug use during Vietnam or a succubus. Skinner's hobbies include jogging and boxing, the latter {{of which has been}} shown in his ability to outfight Fox Mulder and X and to defend himself reasonably well when he was attacked by Alex Krycek and his men.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, the mysterious discovery of two skeletons leads Mulder and Scully to investigate. What they discover is a giant fungal growth that causes the agents to have two separate hallucinogenic episodes, which eventually merge into one shared <b>hallucination.</b> The two are saved thanks to an FBI rescue team led by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi).|$|E
5|$|A {{worldwide}} backlash {{over the}} resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding {{at a safe}} house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig {{on the meaning of}} the apocalyptic future he saw in his <b>hallucination,</b> while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E
50|$|Visual <b>hallucinations.</b> About 30% of {{patients}} report visual <b>hallucinations</b> of the removed eye. Most of these <b>hallucinations</b> consist of basic perceptions (shapes, colors). In contrast, visual <b>hallucinations</b> caused by severe visual loss without {{removal of the}} eye itself (Charles Bonnet syndrome) are less frequent (prevalence 10%) and often consist of detailed images.|$|R
30|$|All {{participants}} in the VH+ group reported recurrent complex visual <b>hallucinations</b> within the last four weeks of testing. In addition, four also reported simple visual <b>hallucinations</b> such as spots, flashes, or geometric shapes. No members of the non-hallucination groups reported complex visual <b>hallucinations.</b> Of the HC participants, two reported simple visual <b>hallucinations</b> {{in the form of}} spots (“visual floaters”) from previous cataract surgery. Three VH– participants reported simple visual <b>hallucinations</b> (spots, flashes of light, shadows, geometric shapes).|$|R
50|$|Peduncular {{hallucinosis}} (PH), or Lhermitte's peduncular hallucinosis, {{is a rare}} {{neurological disorder}} that causes vivid visual <b>hallucinations</b> that typically occur in dark environments, and last for several minutes. Unlike some other kinds of <b>hallucinations,</b> the <b>hallucinations</b> that patients with PH experience are very realistic, and often involve people and environments that are familiar to the affected individuals. Because {{the content of the}} <b>hallucinations</b> is never exceptionally bizarre, patients can rarely distinguish between the <b>hallucinations</b> and reality.|$|R
