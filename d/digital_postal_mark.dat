When only hardware flow control is required in addition to two-way data, the RTS and CTS lines are added in a 5-wire version.|$|R

5000|$|Crashes {{of flights}} {{carrying}} airmail were a regular occurrence {{from the earliest}} days of mail transport by air. In many cases of aircraft crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces {{if there had been a}} fire, or water damage from flying boat crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a <b>postal</b> <b>marking</b> (cachet), label, or mimeograph that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an [...] "ambulance cover" [...] or [...] "body bag" [...] if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.|$|R

5000|$|A {{postmark}} is a <b>postal</b> <b>marking</b> {{made on a}} letter, package, postcard or {{the like}} indicating the date and time that the item was delivered into {{the care of the}} postal service. Modern postmarks are often applied simultaneously with the cancellation or killer that marks the postage stamp(s) as having been used (though in some circumstances there may be a postmark without a killer, and sometimes the postmark and killer form a continuous design), and the two terms are often used interchangeably, if incorrectly. Postmarks may be applied by hand or by machines, using methods such as rollers or inkjets, while digital postmarks are a recent innovation. The local post Hawai'i Post had a rubber-stamp postmark, parts of which were hand-painted. [...] At Hideaway Island, Vanuatu, the Underwater Post Office has an embossed postmark.|$|R

60|$|That old Nelson (or Nielsen), {{the note}} of whose {{personality}} was a profound, echoless irresponsiveness to everything around him, should wish to write, or find anything {{to write about}} to anybody, was in itself a cause for no small wonder. And to me, of all people! I waited with uneasy impatience for whatever disclosure could come from that naturally benighted intelligence, but my impatience had time to wear out before my eyes beheld old Nelson's trembling, painfully-formed handwriting, senile and childish at the same time, on an envelope bearing a penny stamp and the <b>postal</b> <b>mark</b> of the Notting Hill office. I delayed opening {{it in order to}} pay the tribute of astonishment due to the event by flinging my hands above my head. So he had come home to England, to be definitely Nelson; or else was on his way home to Denmark, where he would revert for ever to his original Nielsen!
