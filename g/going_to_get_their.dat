[...] Critical reception to the album was generally positive, with Allmusic reviewer Mark Deming stating that [...] "if I Blame You isn't going redefine the way we look at rock & roll, it confirms that the word on these guys wasn't wrong — the Obits are a very good band", but also noting that [...] "the Obits might just have the stuff to save rock & roll, or at least keep it off life support for a while, but as good as I Blame You may be, they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> songwriting chops in order before they can really finish the job." [...] Jason Crock of Pitchfork Media compared the album to Froberg's past bands, stating that [...] "while there's evidence of growth here, there's not enough change to alienate fans.

After the song ends, Curley slaps Moe {{on the back}} and makes him swallow is harmonica, briefly turning him into a musical instrument that Larry and Curley play a song with before Curley helps Moe spit the harmonica back out. Curly is chewing gum and sternly told by the judge to get rid of it. He throws it away, but accidentally hits Moe in the face. Larry then takes a napkin and removes the gum, twisting Moe's nose in pain. Larry then stomps on it and bellows out in a loud exaggerated Tarzan yell. Moe slaps him and tells him to get out of here. After everything is brought under control, Moe and Curly re-enact the actual murder (with Curly on the receiving end). Moe then looks at the parrot, who was at the murder scene, and sees a note tied to the parrot's foot. He opens the parrot cage, and the parrot flies out. The Stooges eventually capture the bird by shooting water at it through a fire hose.

In a 2010 survey conducted by the Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, 41 % of the respondents said they <b>get</b> most of <b>their</b> news online, 10 % more than those who said they got most of their news from a newspaper. A lot of socio-technical factors have contributed to this phenomenal rise in adoption of online news in recent years. One of the biggest reasons why people are increasingly reading news online is because it facilitates discussion with peers (Nguyen 2010), offering different viewpoints which aid in forming a rounded personal opinion about the news story. The Pew survey found that 37 % of online news users (and 51 % of 18 - 29 year olds) think that commenting on news stories is an important feature to have. A lot of people tend to shape their opinion by reading discussion comments, reflective articles, blogs and even tweets about the news. Hence, an increasing number of people rely on online sources of news – be it news websites or news aggregator services like Digg, Reddit, Google Reader, Flipboard, Pulse etc. The problem with these news websites and aggregators is that the only way people can gather public opinion is by actively searching through the endless stream of comments and feeds, filtering ou...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to help schools for {{vocational}} education determine teachers' continuing professional development needs associated with implementing competence-based education programs, so that these schools can develop better attuned HR policies. It investigates which elements from the cognitive apprenticeship model and from the acquisition and participation metaphors can be identified in the individual action theories of their teachers. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was conducted in one school for vocational education, where 12 teachers engaged in an innovation project around the development of a new competence-based education program for pupils. They participated in concept mapping, cued interviews (based on video recordings), semi-structured interviews, and a joint feedback session. These four sources were used for an in-depth content analysis of teachers' action theories. Findings - No distinctive, crystallized action theories about competence-based vocational education emerged at the individual teacher level; let alone individual teachers' action theories well in line with the two normative frameworks on competence-based education. The case study shows the struggle that individual teachers are <b>going</b> through <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> every-day teaching repertoire more in line with new ideas on competence-based education. Research limitations/implications - Only qualitative data are gathered, in one school, representing one school type, in one country only, limiting the statistical generalizability of the results. Not all respondents are able to participate in all four data sources. Practical implications - Schools should develop HR policies that offer teachers CPD activities in the crucial area of competence-based education; the frameworks presented in the study can be used to this end, by teacher educators as well as by HRD professionals interested in combining training programs with informal employee learning. Originality/value - The study draws on literature from various disciplines (especially educational psychology and HRD), which traditionally have remained mostly separate. It combines insights from four separate data sources...|$|R

5000|$|On 30 July 1682, Dahl {{was issued}} a {{passport}} {{to be able}} to travel throughout Europe {{for the sake of his}} studies. His first destination on this educational journey was London. He was brought there by an English merchant called [...] "Sowter", though his name may vary. It is probable that it was through this man that Dahl came in contact with the skilled engraver and painter Robert White. The earliest trace of Dahl's activity in England is a portrait of Samuel Clarke, which he copied from White's engraving the same year as it was made. White took Dahl under his wing in the world of painting in London. As a token of gratitude, Dahl aided White with valuable ideas when it came to engraving a portrait of the king of Sweden, Charles XI, employing his familiarity with the royal paintings Dahl had observed in the studio of Ehrenstrahl. White helped Dahl expand his network in London and he soon came in contact with the man who is probably responsible for the greatest impact on his development, Godfrey Kneller.Kneller showed Dahl what the public really wanted from artists, and how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> paid for <b>their</b> work. His studio was factory-like compared with David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl's, which Dahl's biographer Wilhelm Nisser terms [...] "Ehrenstrahl's monopoly of glorifying Swedish Royalty". In Kneller's studio, Dahl both studied and made a living and there he became acquainted with Henry Tilson. Tilson was from a highly respected family and had earlier studied under the Court portrait painter Sir Peter Lely. He was considered one of the most promising painters of Lely's pupils. Dahl and Tilson started to plan a journey around Europe to expand their studies. They were to go to Paris, Venice and Rome.|$|R

Here, he is shown as very unintelligent. First appearing in the episode [...] "The Alien Costume" [...] Pt. 1, he is hired by the Kingpin to steal a mineral from John Jameson's space shuttle after crash landing to Earth. Kingpin later sent Rhino to obtain another item where he fights Spider-Man in the black suit. Spider-Man fights the suit's urges to finish off Rhino. In the episode [...] "The Alien Costume" [...] Pt. 3, Spider-Man encounters Rhino on the rooftops and fights him where Rhino commented how he missed the black suit previously wore in their last encounter. Rhino was assisted in battle by Shocker managing to bury Spider-Man in rubble.

The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up.

3000|$|It is {{important}} that this narrative null result be reported so {{that it has a}} chance to be included in future meta-analyses. Speculatively, there may be several reasons why a narrative effect was not observed. First, people may be born “story makers.” That is, they may have simply induced their own narrative. Even though two of the embodied conditions did not know why they needed to stick balloons on a wall, or hit the dragon with lightning strikes, those participants were game to engage in those simulations without ever asking the experimenters “why” questions. Second, our storyline may not have been compelling to the college-age students, being in the role of an apprentice is somewhat low prestige. We would do well to heed advice from Marsh et al., that subtle character cues can have major effects on the research outcomes and in games, “characters are never socio-affect neutral” (Marsh et al., 2011). Third, and we hold to this one most strongly, narratives may be most effective when the content is delivered over several days because attention to learning may begin to flag only after the first novel exposure. This study is based on a single intervention exposure. If finishing lengthy, multi-session content is at the users’ discretion, then the power of the narrative might be observed. We have not seen published studies yet that compare learning gains on multi-day and user-controlled lessons with and without narrative wrappers. The Koenig studies cited earlier were one-shot lab experiments like this one. We know that entertainment videogames with rich storylines (and even very thin storylines like the Mario Bros. series) keep users returning. More research is needed on science education and the inclusion of narrative wrappers to understand if there is a true “value add” for the extra time and resources needed to create and comprehend quality narrative wrappers for multi-session content. In an experimental situation like this one, participants know they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> credit regardless of performance or “grit”. Participants were going to finish no matter how dull the task because credit was the carrot and an experimenter was in the room the entire time. A narrative wrapper may boost motivation/engagement only when certain conditions are present, e.g. multiple homework sessions, duller simulations. We recommend the narrative wrapper research be done in situations prone to attrition and state unequivocally that this one lab experiment should not be interpreted as a paean to never waste funds on great narrative wrappers.
