60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and waited}} a moment trying to compose himself.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{and held}} it. She had never looked more beautiful.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> kissed it, {{and pointed}} warningly {{toward the other}} sleepers.|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN (smiling at <b>her</b> as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand).</b> The {{pleasure}} is--mutual.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in his {{and held}} her out at arm's length from him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in his. She yielded them readily, {{but they}} were cold as ice.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{which was}} lying on the table, and pressed it gently.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> abruptly, and, stooping down, {{forced her}} to look into his eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{and looked}} up at her. She bent down and kissed him.|$|E
60|$|As {{she gave}} them to him once more, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and began to caress them.|$|R
50|$|The film {{ends with}} Joong-ho sitting silently in the {{hospital}} room alongside Eun-ji's bed. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in his own.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{and pulled}} <b>her</b> up. And all else left Gyp but {{the joy of}} being close to him, going to happiness.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and led {{her away}} over the short green turf of the common.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in both his, {{and looked}} down upon the lids of her eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{understood}} her. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in his {{and looked}} down into her upturned face.|$|E
60|$|But {{she would}} not let him go. She sought his mouth with <b>her</b> lips. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and tore them roughly apart and pushed her away.|$|R
6000|$|He {{considered}} her from under frowning eyes. [...] "Ruth," [...] he said, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> [...] "there is here something that I do not understand. What is't you mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|What had he done? What had {{happened}} in these five days to make her like this to him? <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and tried to kiss them; but she said quickly: ...|$|R
60|$|Her prompt {{and frank}} {{compliance}} with his wishes surprised and touched him. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in his. There was {{something}} soothing in {{the touch of}} his firm, cool fingers.|$|E
60|$|Her words {{failed to}} inspire him. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{and lifted her}} fingers {{deliberately}} to his lips.|$|E
6000|$|RICHARD (going to her). What! My wife. My adored one. (<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{and kisses}} {{it with a}} perverse, raffish gallantry.) How long do you allow a brokenhearted husband for leave-taking, Sergeant? ...|$|R
60|$|A shadow darkened {{his face}} for an instant, {{then it was}} gone, and his {{expression}} was as inscrutable as ever. Yet <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in his and looked down into her eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in {{his very}} tenderly and yet with {{something}} of reverence in his gesture. He {{looked into her}} eyes and he spoke very earnestly. Every word {{seemed to come from}} his heart.|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} {{she had won}} her pardon. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and made her sit by him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> mechanically, yet knowing {{whatever}} rage was in {{his heart}} he had not the strength to refuse it.|$|E
60|$|By way of {{an answer}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> always with that air of {{authority}} which she never thought to resent.|$|E
6000|$|... (She {{hands him}} the glass, he drinks the {{contents}} and sets the glass [...] on the table. Then <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and draws <b>her</b> to him and [...] kisses her. She submits almost passively.) ...|$|R
60|$|But {{he would}} not do {{anything}} {{he should have done}} that day. Instead <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in his, and would not let them go; and the reason and the will went out of her, leaving her helpless.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> {{and lifted}} <b>her</b> up: {{but she still}} kept looking down, round, upwards, like a hunted deer, and {{pleading}} in words which seemed sobbed out--as by some poor soul on the rack--between choking spasms of agony.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{and looked}} into her eyes and spoke, divided against himself, {{in a voice that}} was forced and insincere.|$|E
60|$|Some {{men might}} have still {{resisted}} her; but Amelius {{was not one}} of them. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and pressed it tenderly.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} he went {{a walk with}} Clara. They sat in the little wood where bluebells were standing. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her {{self-control}} suddenly gave way. She {{threw herself}} {{back in her}} chair. She began to laugh and stopped abruptly, the tears streaming from her eyes. The prince leaned forward. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in his, but she drew them away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I arrived--to where I am now--pretty dizzy," [...] he responded, with a {{smile that}} was both radiant and sorrowful. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and held them close. [...] "Lenore!... if I come home from the war--still with my arms and legs--whole--will you marry me?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{and held}} them tightly, but he {{answered}} only in a whisper. He wore a sombre black cloak and a broad-brimmed black hat. A muffler concealed {{the lower part of}} his face. She put her finger upon the electric light, but he stopped her.|$|R
