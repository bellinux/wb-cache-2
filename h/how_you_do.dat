5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

500|$|Glover's {{performance}} {{was met with}} praise from the show's judges and it was generally considered the best performance of the night. Rolling Stone wrote that Glover [...] "got judges on their feet" [...] with her [...] "impeccable" [...] performance. Mariah Carey was moved to tears by the performance and complimented Glover for doing the song justice. Nicki Minaj exlaimed {{at the end of}} the performance that [...] "And that is <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a Mariah Carey/Whitney Houston song". Likewise, Billboard called Glover's performance [...] "best single showing of the night" [...] and commented on the vocal delivery that [...] "she knows precisely when to hit the sweet spot of a song, building up to that point with masterful restraint". MTV News commented that Glover [...] "positively slay" [...] the song.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings [...] "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer turns {{her head to the}} side and looks into the distance, as the camera pans away.|$|E
500|$|Morello and Cornell {{initially}} disagreed {{over the}} particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: [...] "Tom and I did have communications {{about the fact that}} I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it." [...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren't as conjoined anymore." ...|$|E

She wore a red catsuit and long black trenchcoat for the performance. The Sun said [...] "Scherzinger stole the show last night" [...] with her display of [...] "live vocals". The judges gave the performance a standing ovation. On The Xtra Factor following the live performances, Louis Walsh and Simon Cowell praised Scherzinger's performance, respectively calling it [...] "one of the best live guest performances we've ever had" [...] and [...] "if you want an example of <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it right... its Nicole. It was focus, performance, vocals...". The Daily Mail followed suit, saying [...] "Scherzinger put on a spectacle for her first live performance, complete with pyrotechnic lighting, full-size cage and a stage full of scantily-clad dancers... The former guest judge brought the house down with her energetic routine". Elena Gorgan of Softpedia agreed to say that Scherzinger wowed the [...] "explosive" [...] performance, earning her a standing ovation from the judges and audience. The following day, she reprised the performance on ITV's breakfast show, Daybreak before heading to London's Westfield Shopping Centre where she appeared on live screens to promote sports brand Reebok.

Susan Ford (daughter of President Ford) {{attended}} the 1975 workshop. From 1975 to 2000, Eisert would go on to serve eighteen different years on the Missouri Photo Workshop faculty.

2500|$|Scherzinger's {{television}} and music video impact {{has also been}} acknowledged in pop culture where she is known for her music videos, which often incorporate raunchy outfits and dance breaks.

American recording artist Lady Gaga has been influenced by Scherzinger's role in the Pussycat Dolls saying, [...] "There's something that's very humbling {{about being able to}} work with a powerhouse group like that.

2500|$|The Other Guys {{received}} a 78% approval rating from 198 surveyed critics on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes; the site's critical consensus reads: [...] "While {{not the best}} collaboration between Will Ferrell and Adam Mckay, The Other Guys delivers bursts of comedy during a summer devoid of laughs." [...] It has been called [...] "a highly entertaining movie filled with witty dialogue and over-the-top action." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film, saying, [...] "Don't let anyone spoil the wildly hilarious surprises. Ferrell and Wahlberg will double your fun. Guaranteed." [...] Some critics praised The Other Guys as the best police film of the year, comparing the film to the critically panned Cop Out, with Richard Roeper stating, [...] "Note to Kevin Smith: THIS is <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a spoof of the buddy-cop genre," [...] and Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger said in his mixed review, [...] "Measured against this year's other police farce—remember Cop Out?—it looks absolutely heroic." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band went by {{the name}} [...] "Feedback" [...] for a few months, before {{changing}} to [...] "The Hype" [...] later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from [...] "The Hype" [...] to [...] "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, [...] "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it.'" [...] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher {{as a means to}} improve his songwriting.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E
