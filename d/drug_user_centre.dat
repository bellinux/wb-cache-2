40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on testing <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Specifically, this thesis is {{concerned}} with testing <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in low-threshold <b>centres.</b> These low-threshold <b>centres</b> for <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> operate {{in the area of}} secondary and tertiary prevention. Furthermore, it describes individual diseases such as HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis, their mode of transmission, clinical course, diagnosis, treatment and possible prevention, drug policy of the Czech Republic, the conditions for testing the abovementioned diseases in low-threshold centres and the legal framework for testing at these facilities. The practical part is divided into several research studies. The qualitative research is aimed at low-threshold centres. In this part, I am trying to determine the number of HIV, HBV and HCV tests performed in 2014. Next, the purpose of this section is also to define where the testing takes place and who is tested. The research data were obtained using a questionnaire distributed to the low-threshold centres in the CR. According to the Annual Report on Drug Epidemiology from 2014, there are 76 low-threshold centres in the Czech Rep. A total of 32 questionnaires were collected. The questionnaire consisted of 32 questions. Close-ended questions were used to detect the type of facility, whether the facility carries out tests for the chosen types of diseases, what type of test is used, who performs the testing and where the testing is carried out. Open-ended questions were used to determine the number of people tested. The qualitative research consists of 18 interviews with <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> from the Contact Centre Český Krumlov. Thanks to its field program, this centre operates in Český Krumlov, Větřní, Kaplice, Horní Planá, Loučovice, Frymburk, Vyšší Brod and in border regions such as Horní and Dolní Dvořiště or Studánky where the drug abuse is very problematic. The data were collected using a semistructured anonymous interview. The interview consisted of 4 areas:Data for identification purposes. Drug history. Testing. Awareness. 30 questionnaires received from the respondents at the Prevent Contact Centre in České Budějovice {{can be found in the}} Appendix. The data were collected using an anonymous questionnaire which consisted of three basic areas. The collected data included drug history and identification information, information about testing for infectious diseases and knowledge of health risks. The thesis states 6 goals. The first 3 goals deal with mapping of HBV, HCV and HIV testing among <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> at low-threshold <b>centres</b> in 2014. The purpose of the fourth goal is to determine how the testing is carried out in low-threshold centres. The fifth goal attempts to establish whether <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> are interested in HBV, HCV and HIV testing. Finally, the sixth goal determines whether <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were tested in 2014. After processing the results I established the following hypotheses which resulted from the research. H 1 : <b>Drug</b> <b>users</b> are interested in their health. H 2 :Drug users are aware of risks that result from these diseases. H 3 : The possibility of testing at low-threshold centres is not chosen very often by <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> The research showed that <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> have adequate information about the risks that are associated with drug injection and injecting equipment sharing, but the average amount of performed tests is relatively low. To sum up, <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> need to be constantly informed about the importance of regular testing. In order to increase the number of tested people, it would be advisable to adapt the testing to the users' needs and also to perform more tests within field programs. It would also be helpful to link health facilities to contact centres locally...|$|R

40|$|In Scotland in December 2009, an {{outbreak}} of anthrax was identified among injecting <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> (IDUs) <b>centred</b> in Glasgow. The initial Scottish cluster of infection in IDUs began in 2009 and resulted in 119 patients being classed as having anthrax, with 47 of these being confirmed. Fourteen of these cases died. In addition, there were three related cases in England. The responsible isolates had an indistinguishable genetic signature (Ba 4599 single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype). In investigating strain origin, it was subsequently determined that this clone was prevalent in Turkey. Initial UK police and Europol investigations suggested that hide bags used to transport raw opium from production areas in Afghanistan to processing plants (most likely in Turkey) were {{the source of the}} anthrax spores. After a lull, in summer 2012, a cluster of five anthrax bloodstream infection cases was identified in Germany, Denmark and France (this cluster was suspected as being caused by illegal importation of heroin from Scotland to Germany). This low-grade outbreak is continuing; to date (March 2013) 13 cases now identified since early June 2012. Seven cases have been affected in the UK – five in England (including four fatalities), one in Scotland and one in Wales. The causative strain of this cluster was again indistinguishable from that responsible for the Scottish cluster. To date, there have been no similar cases in Ireland.

40|$|This work {{examines}} hepatitis C among injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in the United States. Injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> {{are particularly}} vulnerable to hepatitis C infection because of the efficiency of viral transmission through blood-to-blood contact. I assert that syringe exchange programs, which have been an otherwise highly effective public health intervention, must do more to reduce the burden of hepatitis C on injection <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> While syringe exchange programs have been successful at reducing the transmission of HIV through encouraging injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> to abstain from sharing needles, hepatitis C continues to spread among injection <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Original research conducted at Prevention Point of Philadelphia, Philadelphia’s only syringe exchange program, attempted to determine routes of transmission driving the continuing epidemic of hepatitis C among injection <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> This research also demonstrated that hepatitis C knowledge in the injection drug using community is incomplete, indicating the need for syringe exchange programs to make education about hepatitis C more available to injection <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Through {{an examination of the}} relationship between hepatitis C, injection <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> and syringe exchange programs, this thesis argues that syringe exchange programs are uniquely poised to make a significant contribution to the eradication of hepatitis C and the protection of the health of injection <b>drug</b> <b>users...</b>|$|R

40|$|In general, {{little is}} known about the {{incidence}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) among <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> especially among non-injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Therefore, changes in incidence, risk factors, and circulating genotypes over time were determined among <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam over an 18 -year period (1985 - 2002). Sera of 1, 268 <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> both injecting and non-injecting, were screened for anti-HBc. HBV genotypes of the anti-HBc seroconverters were determined. Poisson regression was used to test for temporal trends in incidence and to identify risk factors for seroconversion. Of the 598 participants who were anti-HBc negative at entry, 83 seroconverted for anti-HBc. The incidence of HBV declined from 5. 9 / 100 Person Years up to 1993 to 0 / 100 Person Years in 2002. Of the <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> infected acutely, both injecting and non-injecting, 88 % were infected with the same genotype D, serotype ayw 3 strain. Multivariate analyses revealed current injecting, age, and calendar year of visit as independent risk factors. The decline in the incidence of HBV among <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam is probably caused by a decline in injecting behavior. Injecting and non-injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were infected with the same strain, indicating that <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> infect one another, regardless of their risk behavior.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study deter- mined human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) seroprevalence and factors associated with HIV infection among street-recruited injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and crack cocaine smokers. METHODS: An analysis was performed on HIV serologies and risk behaviors of 6402 injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and 3383 crack smokers in 16 US municipalities in 1992 and 1993. RESULTS: HIV seroprevalence was 12. 7 % among injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and 7. 5 % among crack smokers. Most high-seroprevalence municipalities (> 25 %) were located along the eastern seaboard of the United States. In high-seroprevalence municipalities, but not in others, HIV seroprevalence was higher for injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> than for crack smokers. Among injection <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> cocaine injection, use of speedballs (cocaine or amphetamines with heroin), and sexual risk behaviors were independently associated with HIV infection. Among crack smokers, sexual risk behaviors were associated with HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and crack smokers {{are at high risk}} for HIV infection...|$|R
40|$|Background: Injection {{drug use}} remains a {{major risk factor}} for HIV {{transmission}} in Georgia. The study aims to characterize the prevalence of HIV among injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Georgia. Methods: A cross-sectional, anonymous bio-behavioural survey to assess knowledge and behaviour in injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in combination with laboratory testing on HIV status was conducted in five Georgian cities (Tbilisi, Gori, Telavi, Zugdidi and Batumi) in 2009. A snowball sample of 1127 eligible injection <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> participants was investigated. Results: Odds of HIV exposure were increased for injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> of greater age, with greater duration of drug use and {{with a history of}} imprisonment or detainment (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: More research is required to analyze the determinants of HIV risk in Georgian injection <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> The imprisoned population and young injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> may be appropriate target groups for programmes aimed at preventing HIV transmission. Background Injection drug use is the primary route of HIV transmission in Eastern Europe [1]. An exceptionally high HI...|$|R
40|$|This Selected issue gives a broad {{overview}} {{on the extent}} of, and available responses to, the problems of pregnant <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and families that are affected by drug use. In {{the first part of}} the report, a description of the available data on the extent of drug use during pregnancy and associated risks is followed by a review of responses to drug use among pregnant women across Europe. The second part of the publication focuses on children living in the care of <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Here, a review of the risks related to drug use in the family sets the scene for European overviews of responses targeting drug-using parents and responses aimed at the children of <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> The policy and legal frameworks concerning the two situations are described, both for pregnant <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and drug-using parents and their children.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Illicit <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> {{have a high}} {{prevalence}} of HCV and represent the majority of newly infected persons in the U. S. Despite the availability of effective HCV treatment, few <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> have been evaluated or treated for HCV. Racial and ethnic minorities have a higher incidence and {{prevalence of}} HCV and higher HCV-related mortality. Factors contributing to poor engagement in care are incompletely understood. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Fourteen mixed-gender focus groups of either African American or Latino/a <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> (N = 95) discussed barriers to HCV testing and treatment. Themes were identified through content analysis of focus group discussions. 				 				 					 						Results 					Many <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were tested for HCV in settings where they were receiving care. Outside of these settings, most were unaware of voluntary test sites. After testing HCV positive, <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> reported not receiving clear messages regarding {{the meaning of a}} positive HCV test, the impact of HCV infection, or appropriate next steps including HCV clinical evaluations. Many <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> perceived treatment as unimportant because they lacked symptoms, healthcare providers minimized the severity of the diagnosis, or providers did not recommend treatment. Mistrust of the motivations of healthcare providers was cited as a barrier to pursuing treatment. Social networks or social interactions were a source of HCV-related information and were influential in shaping <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> perceptions of treatment and its utility. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					<b>Drug</b> <b>users</b> perceived a paucity of settings for self-initiated HCV testing and poor provider-patient communication at test sites and during medical encounters. Notably, <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> reported having an unclear understanding about the meaning of a positive HCV test, the health implications of HCV infection, the importance of clinical evaluations and monitoring, and of treatment options for HCV. Efforts to improve the delivery of clinical messages about HCV infection for <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> at test settings and clinical encounters are needed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) {{treatment has}} {{shown to be}} effective, uptake of treatment among active <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> is still low. The <b>Drug</b> <b>Users</b> Treatment for Chronic Hepatitis-C project aims to offer active <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam HCV testing and treatment using a multidisciplinary approach. METHODS: The study population comprises <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies and <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> referred to the <b>Drug</b> <b>Users</b> Treatment for Chronic Hepatitis-C unit. <b>Drug</b> <b>users</b> were offered HCV testing and, if chronically infected, medical and psychiatric screening and HCV treatment. Various specialists collaborated to provide optimal care. We assessed test-uptake and treatment-uptake and outcomes. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-seven Amsterdam Cohort Studies <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were offered HCV testing: 449 out of 497 (90 %) accepted. HCV antibodies were found in 267 out of 449 (60 %) : 183 out of 267 (69 %) were HCV-viremic and 49 out of 183 (27 %) were HIV-co-infected. Of the 134 HCV-monoinfected patients, 102 (76 %) initiated additional medical screening and 44 started treatment by 1 July 2009. Sixty-two <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> referred from methadone clinics were also HCV-monoinfected, of whom 14 started treatment by 1 July 2009. In total 58 persons were treated: 16 (27 %) with genotype 1 or 4, 42 (72 %) with genotype 2 or 3. Eighty-four percent used methadone, 97 % used drugs (heroin, cocaine or amphetamine) {{at least once in}} the 6 months before treatment, 19 % were active injectors. Sixty-two percent used alcohol, 41 % had psychiatric disease other than substance abuse. Of the 57 individuals with sufficient follow-up, 37 (65 %) achieved sustained virological response. CONCLUSION: In a multidisciplinary setting, HIV-negative <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> with chronic HCV infection can be treated successfully despite active drug or alcohol use and psychiatric diseases. Therefore, access to HCV therapy using an integrated approach should be increased for this population...|$|R
