40|$|In this paper, {{new method}} for {{structural}} synthesis of Euclidean platform robot manipulators with variable general constraints (EPRM) is presented. Three dimensional {{motion of the}} base moving platform is generated by the motion of dyads on the Euclidean planes. Each dyad {{is connected to the}} moving base platform by universal, spherical or spherical in torus (St) kinematic pairs. This allows solving the structural synthesis of Euclidean robot manipulators with various DoF and different platform motions. New structural formulations with variable general constraints for the platform motion and the mobility of robot manipulators are presented. The new structural classification of simple structural groups with variable general constraints including platforms, <b>hinges,</b> <b>legs</b> and branch loops from different subspaces and space is also introduced. Moreover, new method for structural synthesis of serial, parallel and serial-parallel EPRM is illustrated along with examples. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was {{designed}} by E. S. Samozhenkov and entered service in 1961 and weighs 7.5 kg. The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was earlier envisioned for the Nikitin-Sokoiov machine gun that was not adopted by the Soviet Union. All types of ammunition belt boxes are carried and mounted separately. The Rakov device is used for loading ammunition belts. The PK machine gun {{is attached to a}} cradle on the 6T2 Samozhenkov mount. The cradle is hinged to a plug-in swivel equipped with a rack-and-pinion traversing mechanism, and a rod-and-screw elevation mechanism. The traversing mechanism is fitted with stops to limit the field of fire. For anti-aircraft fire or fire against ground targets from a kneeling position the cradle mounts a collapsible pole with a pivoting bracket. The mount features non-digging-in spades — sliding spades affect the accuracy of fire less than a «jumping» tripod with dug-in spades. There is an extra folding spade on the front leg for slippery and moving ground. <b>Hinged</b> tripod <b>legs</b> allow a gunner to fire the machine gun from a prone, a sitting, or a kneeling position.|$|R

5000|$|The E.1 was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} with spruce frames and plywood covering. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with straight, thick section, constant chord wings of quite high aspect ratio (8.45). The lateral division was at about 65% chord, with the rear part joined {{to the front}} with conspicuous V-shaped faired underwing hinges. In normal flight the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts.The fuselage was rectangular in cross section, with a single place open cockpit at the wing trailing edge, baggage space behind and an inverted in-line [...] Train 4T in the nose. A straight edged tailplane was mounted on the upper fuselage longerons and carried elevators with a small cut-out for rudder movement.

40|$|A {{force-torque sensor}} capable of {{accurate}} {{measurement of the}} three components of externally applied forces and moments is required for force control in robotic applications involving assembly operations. The goal in {{this paper is to}} design a Stewart platform based force torque sensor at a near-singular configuration sensitive to externally applied moments. In such a configuration, we show an enhanced mechanical amplification of leg forces and thereby higher sensitivity for the applied external moments. In other directions, the sensitivity will be that of a normal load sensor determined by the sensitivity of the sensing element and the associated electronic amplification, and all the six components of the force and torque can be sensed. In a sensor application, the friction, backlash and other non-linearities at the passive spherical joints of the Stewart platform will affect the measurements in unpredictable ways. In this sensor, we use flexural <b>hinges</b> at the <b>leg</b> interfaces of the base and platform of the sensor. The design dimensions of the flexure joints in the sensor have been arrived at using FEA. The sensor has been fabricated, assembled and instrumented.

40|$|International audienceSaunders et al. (1953) {{stated that}} the {{introduction}} of six gait determinants (pelvic rotation, pelvic obliquity, stance knee flexion, foot and ankle mechanisms, and tibiofemoral angle) to a compass gait model (two rigid <b>legs</b> <b>hinged</b> at the hips) provides an accurate simulation of the actual trajectory of the whole body center of mass (CoM). Their respective actions could also explain {{the shape of the}} vertical ground reaction force (GRF) pattern. Saunders' approach is considered as a kinematic description of some features of gait and is subject to debate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to realize a rigorous mechanical evaluation of the gait determinants theory using an appropriated mathematical model in which specific experimental data of gait trials are introduced. We first simulate a compass-like CoM trajectory using the proposed 3 D mathematical model. Then, factorizing the model to introduce successively the kinematic data related to each gait determinant, we assess their respective contribution to both the CoM trajectory and the pattern of vertical GRF at different gait speeds. The results show that the stance knee flexion significatively decreases the estimated position of the CoM during midstance. Stance knee extension and pelvic obliquity contribute to the appearance of the pattern of vertical GRF during stance. The stance ankle dorsiflexion significatively contributes to CoM vertical excursion and the ankle plantarflexion contributes to the vertical GRF during terminal stance. The largest contribution towards the minimization of the CoM vertical amplitude during the complete gait step appears when considering the foot mechanisms and the pelvic obliquity in the proposed model...|$|R
