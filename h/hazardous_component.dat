Considering {{the lack of}} an explicit function expression in the study of reliability, a method based on a modified response surface method is proposed to quantify the reliability index and the failure probability, capitalizing on the linear- approximated iteration and the difference approach rather than the differential approach in solving nonlinear equations. The major failure path is determined through the analysis of the multiple failure probabilities. The main failure mode of lattice jib cranes is a failure in stability, not a failure in strength based on a comparison of the failure probabilities of both stability failures and strength failures. And the failure path is substantially a rearrangement of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>components</b> and the failure path of components with similar probabilities and close locations varies only in that these components break at distinct starting positions.

Concentrations of fumes, O 3, CO, Mn and total-Cr were found to exceed their corresponding occupational exposure limit (OEL) values, while the concentrations of NO and Cr(VI) were below those OEL levels.

Using an additive equation of OEL and exposure concentration of each <b>hazardous</b> <b>component,</b> health risk in welders with combined exposure to welding fumes and gases was assessed as 18. 6 to 46. 0 times of OEL, which exceeded the unity.

To date, much of the effort to reduce food waste to landfill focusses on post-­‐waste solutions such as composting. While these recycling efforts are important, they cannot fully address the economic waste and the embedded energy issues. This presentation reports on a novel collaboration between local government and a grassroots community organisation that adapted community development methodology to learnings from an earlier trial. The Waiheke Resources Trust was supported by Auckland Council and the Blackpool community in launching of Kai Conscious Waiheke, a grassroots food waste reduction project.
