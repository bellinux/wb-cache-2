5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> under cover of its fire. At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E
5|$|Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone's Gulley and The Nek. The New Zealanders {{waited until}} the Turks came close, then opened fire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness,</b> {{stopping}} their advance. Seriously outnumbered, they asked for reinforcements. Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the Turks managed to get behind them. So, taking the machine-guns with them, they withdrew off Russell's Top into Rest Gully. This left the defenders at Walker's Ridge isolated {{from the rest of}} the force.|$|E

Sailing under the cover of darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E

5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on the slopes of Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E

5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E
5|$|Dönitz {{contacted}} the British {{commander of the}} city of Flensburg, asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which was approved. That funeral, the last such of the Third Reich, was held on 16 May 1945 with Dönitz, Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, delivering the eulogy. In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the court martial, Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he had asked for the password three times without receiving a response from the person, whom he could not visually identify <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip. The chain of events was confirmed by the watch leader. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and cleared him of any fault.|$|E

The Carthaginians had thrown open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control, refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.|$|E

Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E

5|$|U-28s fifth war patrol {{took place}} from 11 August to 17 September 1940 {{and was one}} of Kuhnke's most productive. In August, she sank two ships for 5,500tons.

However, during the postwar analysis, he was only credited with sinking a 2,000ton Dutch freighter and damaging a 4,700ton British freighter; which, combined with his earlier sinkings, brought his total to four ships for 9,945tons. On his return to Lorient Kuhnke was awarded the Knight's Cross for his work.|$|E
