40|$|The present {{research}} incorporated {{the content of}} basic statistics into the Artificial Intelligence Physics Tutor (ARPHY), which {{was used as the}} expert system shell, and investigated the effects of the Artificial Intelligent Statistics Tutor (ARSTAT) as a supplement to learning statistics at the college level. Two classes of an introductory educational statistics course in the Department of Educational Foundations, University of North Texas, were used in the study. The <b>daytime</b> <b>class</b> was used as the experimental group and the evening class was used as the control group. The experimental group's lecture/discussion was supplemented with ARSTAT, and the control group received only lecture/discussion. A one-way analysis of covariance was used to compare students' test scores. No significant difference was found; however, the adjusted mean score of the experimental group was slightly higher than that of the control group. A two-way analysis of covariance showed no significant main effect or interaction between gender and study technique. A second two-way analysis of covariance showed no significant interaction between the students' attitude toward statistics and the study technique used. However, the students with a statistics-positive attitude scored significantly higher on the test than students who had a negative attitude toward statistics. This study concluded that the ARSTAT can be used effectively as a tutor for students taking an introductory course in educational statistics. The following recommendations for further study were made: incorporate more advanced topics of statistics into the ARPHY teaching model; incorporate the ARPHY learning theory and statistical content using another version of LISP language or another programming language such as PROLOG; and compare the ARSTAT tutor to some other kind of supplement to lecture/discussion...|$|E

At first, he developed his style by painting still lifes, self-portraits and portraits of his mother, engaged in household chores. Then, perhaps under the influence of Jean-François Millet, he decided to focus on painting the workers he knew so well from his youth. For many years, he remained reluctant to show his works in public or part with them. What little money he earned from working went mostly to painting supplies.

The purposes of the web interface design are to provide weather information for Mount Kent to assist remote observing, to implement live observing, and to include an image gallery. This project examines the software that provides web-ase access to remote robotic observing, and research planetary photography using webcam. Webcam is superior to CCD camera in nondeep sky imaging. With image stacking, planetary images captured by webcam can be processed further to generate rich image. The implementation of live webcam preview in web interface design can also be use in future live observing. Future work in implementing the weather station and cloud sensor output into the web interface design may need to be considered. The web interface design may need further development and maintenance...|$|R

5000|$|In 1900 Upshure {{lived with}} his mother Elizabeth and his sister Marselina in an {{district}} that had become known as [...] "Little Africa." [...] Their home was an apartment in the rear part of a crowded brick tenement at 11 Cornelia Street. Upshure's mother, then 43, and his sister, aged 16, worked as laundresses, while Upshure, 14, was a doorman. By 1910 he and his mother had moved to a neighboring and similar building at 15 Cornelia Street. She was still a laundress and he a porter in a retail store. Five years later Upshure and his mother were living across the street in a relatively small wood frame house at 16 Cornelia Street. They continued to live there until Elizabeth Upshure died in 1924. In 1915 he was working as a porter and she continued as a laundress. That year Upshure enrolled at Columbia College and tried to find a part-time evening job to help pay expenses while he was in <b>daytime</b> <b>classes.</b> In 1924 the building in which Upshure and his mother were living was sold. The following year he gave his address as 10 West 8th Street. That address was the location of the Whitney Studio Club, an attached pair of town houses that Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, with her assistant, Juliana Force had remodeled into a studio-gallery. Upshure's friend, the African American painter, Beauford Delaney lived in the building a few years later and served as its janitor. At another time Upshure, too, served as a resident janitor and it can be supposed that he acted in the same role while living at the Whitney Studio Club. By 1927 he had moved to 124 Waverly Place and by 1930 to another similar place down the block at 106 Waverly Place. It was in the latter location that he lived rent-free and served as janitor. The building had seven other occupants, two lodgers and a family of five. Upshure's last known address appears on his World War II draft registration card of 1942. It shows him to be living at 647 Broadway. Because that building was entirely devoted to commerce, where there were no residential quarters, he was either using this as an address of convenience or, more likely, was living there illicitly.|$|R

The focus of this paper is on the strategies used by Parents' Centre to found a successful organisation which could spread its message to parents, policy makers, the general public and professionals involved with young children. I argue that advocacy was a key factor in the organisation's success in spearheading change in the health and education services for young children and their parents...|$|R
