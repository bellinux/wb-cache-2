40|$|In this report, a {{framework}} for the <b>Policing</b> <b>function</b> in the Scalable Resource Reservation Protocol (SRP) is proposed. SRP {{is characterized by a}} high scalability, soft guarantees and no a priori specifications of the traffic profile. Resources are reserved for the whole set of elementary stream, the aggregate flow. The <b>policing</b> <b>function</b> monitors the aggregate flow and performs a conformance test to detect packets that belong to conformant or non-conformant flows. If the packets in the aggregate flow exceed the expected number, the <b>policing</b> <b>function</b> has to make a selection to discard some of them. We adopt a Statistical Pattern Recognition (SPR) for the packet classification. Aim of the <b>policing</b> <b>function</b> is to limit the impact of non-conformant traffic on conformant traffic, and also to reduce usefulness of the former. We first describe the approach, then we trace a theoretical analysis and, finally, we describe the simulation carried out and the experimental results...|$|R
