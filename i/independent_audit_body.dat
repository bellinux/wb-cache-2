40|$|Purpose: This paper investigates auditor {{choice in}} those Italian non-listed firms {{adopting}} the ‘traditional’ model of corporate governance. In Italy, non-listed firms can choose between {{two types of}} auditor: the Board of Statutory Auditors (BSA), that is, the statutory auditors, or an ‘external’ auditor. At the same time, a BSA conducts the administrative auditing for all companies with equity exceeding 120, 000 euros. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper estimates a logistic regression model of firm auditor choice between an external auditor and the BSA which incorporates variables proxying for both agency conflict and organizational complexity effects. Findings: Our results show that of the potential agency factors, only board independence drives auditor choice, whereas organizational complexity and risk factors including firm size, investment in inventories, subsidiary status and complexity drive auditor choice. These results may be explained in the administrative audit role of the BSA which both monitors day-by-day firm operations and the financial statements preparation ‘project’. Stakeholders as a result are reassured that in general their interests are protected. Finally, we find that legal form and voluntary IFRS compliance exert an impact on auditor choice. Originality/value: The paper provides support for an internal yet <b>independent</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>body</b> such as the Italian BSA as a wider model for corporate governance in European non-listed firms (OECD, 2004 and 2015). The BSA as an administrative and financial <b>auditing</b> <b>body</b> made up solely of independent highly qualified professionals can work within the firm on an operational basis, {{and in so doing}} can increase stakeholder protection...|$|R

The results may suggest that auditors price the monitoring effectiveness arising from long board tenure.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the reputation, tenure and cash compensation of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members {{and the likelihood of}} financial restatements. We examine these associations for 138 U. S. public firms that announced their restatements from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002 and a set of control firms matched on industry and size. We observe a negative association between financial restatements and (i) reputation of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members and (ii) the cash compensation paid to <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members. Our results suggest that <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members holding multiple directorships have incentives to enhance and protect their reputation by ensuring the financial statements are of high quality. Our findings on compensation suggest that monetary incentives motivate independent directors to be vigilant and challenge management in their oversight of the financial reporting process...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether high surplus free cash flow is related to earnings management. This study hypothesizes managers of high surplus free cash flow companies have incentive to engage in earnings management. However, earnings management occurs less frequently when the audit committee is more <b>independent.</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>audit</b> committees provide an effective monitoring over earnings management practices. This study expects that the positive relationship between surplus free cash flow and earnings management is moderated by <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee. Using a sample of 155 companies listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia in 2001, this study obtains empirical evidence consistent with the prediction in all hypotheses.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to investigate: (1) the {{relationship}} between audit commitee independence and earnings quality, and (2) the influence of CEO duality on this relationship. We posit that an <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee is more effective in monitoring the quality of financial statements, hence independence is related to higher earnings quality. We also conjecture that the dual role of CEO and chairman would reduce the effectiveness of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committees. Using a sample of 3, 017 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia from 2005 - 2010, we find that earnings quality is positively associated with audit committee independence, but {{the relationship}} is weakened by the existence of CEO duality. Our results imply that when a CEO has excessive control over {{the decisions of the}} board of directors by holding the position of chairman, the monitoring function of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committees to assure high quality of earnings in financial statements becomes ineffective...|$|R
