50|$|Shrimp farms of all types, from {{extensive}} to super-intensive, {{can cause}} severe ecological problems {{wherever they are}} located. For <b>extensive</b> <b>farms,</b> huge <b>areas</b> of mangroves were cleared, reducing biodiversity. During the 1980s and 1990s, about 35% of the world's mangrove forests had vanished. Shrimp farming was {{a major cause of}} this, accounting for over a third of it according to one study; other studies report between 5% and 10% globally, with enormous regional variability. Other causes of mangrove destruction are population pressure, logging, pollution from other industries, or conversion to other uses such as salt pans. Mangroves, through their roots, help stabilize a coastline and capture sediments; their removal has led to a marked increase of erosion and less protection against floods. Mangrove estuaries are also especially rich and productive ecosystems and provide the spawning grounds for many species of fish, including many commercially important ones. Many countries have protected their mangroves and forbidden the construction of new shrimp farms in tidal or mangrove areas. The enforcement of the respective laws is often problematic, though, and especially in the least developed countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, or Vietnam the conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms remains an issue for areas such as the Myanmar Coast mangroves.|$|R

This paper reports {{on the extent of}} purchases {{of agricultural}} land for diverse reasons within an intensive and <b>extensive</b> agricultural <b>farming</b> <b>area</b> in the Western Cape, gathered through a survey of land buyers between January 2005 and October 2007. Descriptive statistics provide demographical information of buyers, their reasons for purchasing farms and the importance of specific characteristics of agricultural properties considered in such purchases. Analyses of variance convey more information regarding the different characteristics of agricultural properties considered by agricultural and lifestyle buyers. Survey results indicated that farm purchases for alternative purposes were substantial: {{more than half of all}} transactions in both the intensive and extensive area were for lifestyle reasons. Lifestyle buyers mostly rely on income from outside the agricultural sector for their livelihoods and financing of purchased properties, therefore they could focus on characteristics of farms unrelated to commercial agricultural production in their decision to buy agricultural properties. Characteristics such as the recreational opportunities provided by the property and its aesthetic beauty, including natural scenery, beautiful views and locations within a valley and set against a mountain, appealed to these buyers.

Today cereal insects develop better, thanks to the climate warming, simplification of agricultural techniques and <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> in large <b>areas.</b> One of the most pervasive species is leaf miners from the Agromyzidae family, which larvae feed on inner side of the cereal leaves. In Poland {{there is more than}} a dozen species of leaf miners (Walczak, 1995). They may occur locally in large numbers, and cause substantial damage to the crops which reduce quality and quantity of the harvest. Larvae of the leaf miner feed on the parenchyma, causing damages (so-called mines). Effective methodology of fighting the insects with chemical means have not been developed yet. Studies of integrated methods of cereals protection carried out so far, have shown that a good practical method of chemical signaling is to control the number of adults trapped on yellow traps. Monitoring of cereal leaf miner flights in winter wheat was carried out in Słupia Wielka and Baborówko (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in the 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013 growing seasons. Yellow traps were placed above the tops of wheat during vegetation period. The number of damaged wheat stems was recorded.

For a given production target, Green et al. (2005) conclude in favor of land sparing if the relation between biodiversity and yield is decreasing and convex. Indeed, with a shift to <b>extensive</b> <b>farming,</b> biodiversity then increases little on already cultivated land, while it decreases strongly on newly cultivated land. According to these authors and to Phalan et al. (2011 a), available empirical data are in favor of a land sparing strategy. We extend the model of Green et al. (2005) by adding the reaction of supply and demand to prices. We show that <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is more interesting than intensive farming for biodiversity if the relation between biodiversity and yield does not have a very high degree of convexity, if demand reacts to prices and if the profitability of <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is lower. Therefore, we do not obtain the result of Green et al. (2005) when production results from market equilibrium. Besides, <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is detrimental to consumers when their surplus is evaluated in a restrictive way as increasing in quantities consumed and decreasing in prices. Its effect on agricultural producers is indeterminate. Distinguishing food demand in vegetal and animal products, we show that <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> reduces mostly the size of the animal product market, which demand is more price elastic. Integrating demand for animal products increases the advantage of <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> towards biodiversity by increasing the price elasticity of demand. The opposite result is obtained when we consider the introduction of policies for the mandatory incorporation of biofuels in fuel. Indeed, the demand for biofuels varies little with prices, to the detriment of <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> as far as biodiversity conservation is concerned. We discuss the implications of this model on the social pressure on protected areas, on the relations between different outlets and on welfare and food security.

We also show that the primary effect of the higher prices associated with <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is a reduction of animal feed production, which has a higher price elasticity of demand, whereas less of an effect is observed on plant-based food production and almost no effect is observed on biofuel production if there are mandatory blending policies...|$|R

Managing these intensive systems will require designing robust farming systems and better allocations of limited and increasingly more expensive inputs, in highly variable climates and markets. The development of simulation models that consider {{the influence of the}} climate on forage production can facilitate the planning and administration of forage production on the farm. Moreover, simulation models are commonly used to estimate expected changes in climate on the productivity of agricultural systems. Agro-climatic models are, in general, simple to use, require wide available inputs, and can be useful tools for these purposes. When applied in such a specific environment, they can often give more accurate simulations than more complicated and data intensive mechanistic models. In addition, agro-climatic models are often much easier to develop and calibrate than mechanistic models (Teh, 2006).
