The ESTC lists between more than 13,000 and almost 23,000 titles for the individual decades. The <b>Term</b> <b>Catalogue</b> numbers range at 20%-30% of that.

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose {{statistical}} models to model the indexing of textual documents by human indexers in a hypertext environment. Previous research revealed that hypertext links connecting text indexed with the same subject <b>index</b> <b>term</b> assigned by a human indexer offer users {{an effective way to}} access information due to the structure, focus, and imbedded intelligence of a manually assigned subject index. We propose that for a document collection with an existing well developed subject index, the contingent relationship between subject <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> and words in the text can be used by a Bayesian inference rule in predicting which subject <b>index</b> <b>term</b> is relevant given the words occurring in a document. It was hypothesized that the indexing models (1) will be able to predict what <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> a human indexer will use, (2) serve as decision aids, and (3) will help users in information retrieval tasks. This problem area is approached by (1) direct comparison between the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> assigned by the indexing models and those assigned by a human indexer The overlap between the two sets of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> was measured by the proportion of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> in the intersection for each set. (2) expert ratings on the relevance of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> assigned by different means. The ratings as well as the quality of an <b>index</b> <b>term</b> (determined by the magnitude of the rating) were statistically analyzed. Potential errors made by the human indexer and the indexing models were estimated. (3) a controlled laboratory experiment in which users 2 ̆ 7 performance in information retrieval tasks using different indices was evaluated. Results obtained revealed that (1) a significant overlap exists between the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> assigned by the indexing models and those by a human indexer, (2) <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> suggested by the indexing models received significantly higher ratings than <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> randomly selected and the estimated number of errors made by the indexing models and the human indexer were similar, and (3) users performed better or equally well in information retrieval tasks using the subject index assigned by the indexing models than when using the index prepared by the human indexer. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the problems and}} the methods of finding relevant information in large collections of documents. The contribution of this thesis to this problem is to develop better content analysis methods {{which can be used}} to describe document content with <b>index</b> <b>terms.</b> <b>Index</b> <b>terms</b> can be used as meta-information that describes documents, and that is used for seeking information. The main point of this thesis is to illustrate the process of developing an automatic indexer which analyses the content of documents by combining evidence from word frequencies and evidence from linguistic analysis provided by a syntactic parser. The indexer weights the expressions of a text according to their estimated importance for describing the content of a given document {{on the basis of the}} content analysis. The typical linguistic features of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> were explored using a linguistically analysed text collection where the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> are manually marked up. This text collection is referred to as an <b>index</b> <b>term</b> corpus. Specific features of the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> provided the basis for a linguistic term-weighting scheme, which was then combined with a frequency-based term-weighting scheme. The use of an <b>index</b> <b>term</b> corpus like this as training material is a new method of developing an automatic indexer. The results of the experiments were promising...|$|R

The method comprises the following steps: a. carrying out structuring processing to inquiry and obtaining a structuring inquiry result, wherein the structuring processing comprises one or a plurality of following steps: splitting words, carrying out part-of-speech tagging to splitted works, carrying out shallow parsing to inquiry or carrying out parsing to inquiry; b. determining an <b>index</b> <b>term</b> according to the structuring inquiry result and then determining an inquiry-context property set of the <b>index</b> <b>term</b> according to the structuring inquiry result which is adjacent to the <b>index</b> <b>term</b> and positioned in a word list; c. computing the weighing value of each property in the inquiry-context property set; d. combining the weighing values of all properties into property values of the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> through a first composite function; and f. combining the property values of the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> by a second composite function and obtaining the <b>index</b> <b>term</b> weighing. The method can compute the weighing accurately no matter whether the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> exist in the word list or not. 本发明是有关于一种中文信息检索中基于结构约束的特征权重计算方法，包括以下步骤：a. 对查询进行结构化处理，得到结构化查询结果；结构化处理包括：分词、对切分出的词进行词性标注、对查询进行浅层句法分析或对查询进行句法分析中一个或几个；b. 根据述结构化查询结果确定索引词，然后根据与所述索引词相邻并位于词列表中的结构化查询的结果，确定所述索引词的查询—上下文属性集；c. 计算查询—上下文属性集中每个属性的权重值；d. 通过第一组合函数将各个属性的权重值组合成所述索引词的属性值；e. 使用第二组合函数对所述索引词的属性值组合，得到所述索引词权重。无论索引词是否在词列表中，本发明的方法都能准确计算出其权重。Department of ComputingInventor name used in this publication: 陆永邦, Lu YongbangTitle in Traditional Chinese: 中文信息檢索中基於結構約束的索引詞權重計算方法Chin...|$|R

40|$|Most {{information}} retrieval systems use stopword lists and stemming algorithms.
