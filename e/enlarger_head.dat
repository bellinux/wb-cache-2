40|$|International audienceMacrozoospermia is {{characterized}} by a high proportion of abnormal spermatozoa with <b>enlarged</b> <b>heads.</b> So far, it has been associated with mutations only in the Aurora Kinase C gene (AURKC) in some cases. Although many publications have reported failure to conceive in couples with macrozoospermia, a few others have described successful pregnancies, thus raising questions as to whether ICSI and AURKC genetic screening should be recommended in all patients with macrozoospermia. First, we report on two monozygotic twins presenting macrozoospermia for whom the genetic status was explored (Aurora Kinase C sequencing) and whole semen and gradient-selected spermatozoa were analyzed, using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH), Electron Microscopy and flow cytometry. Additionally, FISH analysis was performed on individually selected uniflagellate spermatozoa with normal sized heads. Second, we also provide an updated review of patients with macrozoospermia gathering the percentage of <b>enlarged</b> <b>head</b> spermatozoa, the genetic status and pregnancy outcomes. Both twins carried a homozygous mutation of AURKC. Spermocytograms showed means of 86 % and 83. 5 % of <b>enlarged</b> <b>head</b> forms. FISH analyses showed that normal head size, uniflagellate spermatozoa had an aneuploid or polyploid nucleus despite a high level of selection. SEM analysis also showed special intranuclear inclusions in <b>enlarged</b> <b>head</b> spermatozoa. Our data together with cases reported in the literature allowed us to recommend that the AURKC gene should be sequenced when the sperm contains 30 % or more of <b>enlarged</b> <b>head</b> spermatozoa, and when a mutation is found, ART should not be performed. Our analyses provide information that could greatly help practitioners in their decision-making with regard to optimal care of patients with macrozoospermia...|$|R

40|$|Infants {{with the}} triad (neurologic dysfunction, {{subdural}} hematoma [SDH], and retinal hemorrhage) are often diagnosed {{as victims of}} shaken baby syndrome. Medical conditions/predisposing factors to developing the triad are often dismissed: short falls, birth-related SDH that enlarges, macrocephaly, sinus/cortical vein thrombosis, and others. Six infants with the triad are described in which child abuse was diagnosed, but parents denied wrongdoing. All 6 had either macrocephaly or <b>enlarging</b> <b>head</b> circumference, which suggested medical explanations. Three infants incurred short falls, 1 had a difficult delivery {{in which there was}} likely a rebleed of a birth-related SDH, 1 had a spontaneous SDH associated with increased extra-axial fluid spaces, and 1 had a sinus thrombosis. Following legal proceedings, all 6 infants were returned to their parents, and there has been no child maltreatment in follow-up, suggesting child abuse never happened. The results indicate that alternative medical explanations for causing the triad should be considered and that macrocephaly or an <b>enlarging</b> <b>head</b> circumference raises the possibility of a medical explanation...|$|R

The seatstays and chainstays were ovalized to reduce flex. Unlike steel frames, there were no lugs: the aluminum tubes were mitered, hand welded, and then heat treated.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of {{the most}} common (and most serious) form of Canavan disease {{typically}} appear in early infancy usually between the first three to six months of age. Canavan disease then progresses rapidly from that stage, with typical cases involving intellectual disability, loss of previously acquired motor skills, feeding difficulties, abnormal muscle tone (i.e., floppiness or stiffness; hypotonia), poor head control, and megalocephaly (abnormally <b>enlarged</b> <b>head).</b> Paralysis, blindness, or seizures may also occur.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the ongoing}} {{challenges}} in neuroradiology is to differentiate hydrocephalus from ventricular enlargement associated with brain atrophy (ventriculomegaly ex-vacuo) especially in children, as the sizes of the ventricles and subarachnoid spaces have variable size over the first 2 [*]years of life. Imaging findings should be interpreted {{in the context of}} clinical data in order to reach a firm diagnosis of active hydrocephalus. Knowledge of the infantâ€™s head size is essential; a large head or too rapidly <b>enlarging</b> <b>head</b> suggests hydrocephalus, whereas a small or diminishing head circumference is more compatible with atrophy [6].|$|R
