40|$|We discuss {{three aspects}} {{by which the}} Weyl {{geometric}} generaliza-tion of Riemannian geometry and Einstein gravity can shed light on present questions of physics and the philosophy of physics. The gener-alization of geometry goes back to Weyl’s proposal of 1918; its guiding idea is the invariance of geometry and physical fields under “local”, i. e. point dependent scale transformations. The generalization of gravity we start from was proposed by Omote, Utiyama, Dirac {{and others in the}} 1970 s. Recently it has been taken up in work exploring a bridge between the Higgs field of electroweak theory and cosmology/gravity and has thus gained new momentum. This paper introduces the ba-sics of the theory and discusses how it relates to Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We then discuss the link between gravity and the electroweak sector of elementary particle physics as it looks from the Weyl geomet-ric perspective. Interestingly Weyl’s hypothesis of a preferred scale <b>gauge</b> (<b>setting</b> Weyl scalar curvature to a constant) gets new support from the interplay of the gravitational scalar field and the electroweak (Higgs) one.

40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} (CF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular recommender system technologies, and utilizes the known preferences of a group of users to predict the unknown preference of a new user. However, the existing CF techniques has the drawback that it requires the entire existing data be maintained and analyzed repeatedly whenever new user ratings are added. To avoid such a problem, Eigentaste, a CF approach based on the principal component analysis (PCA), has been proposed. However, Eigentaste requires that each user rate every item in the so called <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> for executing PCA, which may not be always feasible in practice. Developed in this article is an iterative PCA approach in which no <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is required, and singular value decomposition is employed for estimating missing ratings and dimensionality reduction. Principal component values for users in reduced dimension are used for clustering users. Then, the proposed approach is compared to Eigentaste in terms of the mean absolute error of prediction using the Jester, MovieLens, and EachMovie data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, even without a <b>gauge</b> <b>set,</b> performs slightly better than Eigentaste regardless of the data set and clustering method employed, implying that it can be used as a useful alternative when defining a <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is neither possible nor practical...|$|R

It is our aim in this paper to study the gauge properties that the space Riem(M) of all metrics over M possesses, specially {{as they relate to}} the constraints of geometrodynamics. For instance, the Hamiltonian constraint does not generate a group, and it is thus hard to view its action in Riem(M) in a <b>gauge</b> <b>setting.</b> However, in view of the recent results representing GR as a dual theory, invariant under foliation preserving 3 [...] diffeomorphisms and 3 D conformal transformations, but not under refoliations, we are justified in considering the gauge structure pertaining only to the groups D of diffeomorphisms of M, and C, of conformal diffeomorphisms on M. For these infinite-dimensional symmetry groups, Riem(M) has a natural principal fiber bundle (PFB) structure, which renders the gravitational field amenable to the full range of gauge-theoretic treatment. We discuss some of these structures and construct explicit formulae for supermetric-induced gauge connections. To apply the formalism, we compute general properties for a specific connection bearing strong resemblance to the one naturally induced by the deWitt supermetric, showing it has desirable relationalist properties. Finally, we find that the group of conformal diffeomorphisms solves the pathologies inherent in the group and also brings it closer to Horava gravity and the dual conformal theory called Shape Dynamics.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{an application of}} remote sensing technology for monitoring and evaluation of watershed management, which was conducted is Solo Watershed, Central and East Java. The research objectives were 1) to investigate the capability of photomorphic analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Themmatic Mapper (ETM +) imagery as the basic for analyzes of landforms, landuse, and morphometry of the land surface; 2) to calculate the overland flow – peak discharge and erosion – sediment yield as indicators of land degradation of the area; 3) to use the indicators as set of instrument for monitoring and evaluation of watershed management. In this study, visual interpretation by means of on-screen digilization of the digital imagery {{was carried out in}} order to identify and to delineate land parameters using photomorphic approach. Based on the photomorphic analysis, several image – based parameters such as relief topography, physical soil characteristic, litho – stratigraphy, and vegetation cover were integrated with other themati maps in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. Estimation of overland flow (C) based on Cook methods (1942) and calculation of peak disccharge (Qmax) based on rational method (Qmax = C. I. A) were applied. Meanwhile, estimation of surface erosion was carried out using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE, A = R. K. L. S. CP). The sediment yield (Sy) was estimated using seddiment delivery ratio (SDR) based on the following formula: Sy = [A + (25 % x A) ] x SDR. Both pairs of C – Qmax and A – Sy, were utilized as the basis for monitoring and evaluation of the watershed. The combination of C – Qmax and A – Sy were also used as the basis for selection of stream <b>gauge</b> <b>setting</b> / AWLR within particular sub – catchment. It was found that the photomorphic analysis is only color/tone, slope aspects, pattern, and texture, unit boundaries between volcanic – origin landscape (Wilis volcanic complex) and folded – hills landforms (Kendeng ridges) can be delineated. Within the volcanic features, coarse – textured units indicating pyroclastic materials with high drainage density (western part of Lawu volcano). In terms of calculated overland flow and peak discharge of 100 sub – catchment within the Solo Watershed, it was found that there are four sub – catchment with relatively high values (> 0. 60 and > 1200 m 3 s 1 for overland flow and peak discharge repectively), namely Samin (Karanganyar), Keduang (Wonogiri), Dengkeng (Klaten), and Sungkur (Ponorogo). Five sub-catchment might be categorized as having moderate peak discharge (Qmax ranges from 1000 – 1200 m 3 s 1), namely Ketonggo (Ngawi), Keyang (Ponorogo), Gandong – Semawur (Magetan), Pepe (Boyolali), and Soko (Bojonegoro), while the remaining 91 sub-catchments are categorized as having low peak discharge. Based on the calculation of erosion and sediment yield, there was no sub-catchment with moderate category (60 – 180 ton ha 1 yr 1), i. e. Samin (Karanganyar), Gonggong (Magetan), Ngisip and Kedung Cilik (Tuban), and Pepe (Boyolali). The other 95 sub-catchment might be categorized as gentle to good.

40|$|Measurement of {{the volume}} of {{precipitate}} d water on the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface is an important division of the science of hydroclimatology. Rainfall measurements provide fundamental knowledge needed in establishing the bio-climatic type of a region, and rainfall data are essential in many forms of land management, either for agriculture, municipal development, production of hydroelectric power, or flood control. Rainfall cannot be measured directly, like the flow of a river, but must be estimated from samples taken at various locations on the watershed. For a satisfactory estimate, the individual samples must be as accurate as possible and closely representative of the areas to which they are applied. The technique of precipitation measurement in populated areas, which are usually of minor relief, has presented but little difficulty. On the other hand, precise determinations of rainfall in mountainous regions present many difficulties. Sampling techniques and instrumentation require modification as measurements are extended into the high country, to provide basic hydrologic information for use in water supply problems, stream regulation, and flood control. In this report are presented the results of detailed research of this process and how much precipitation is delivered to mountain watersheds. In 1955, in the Kujiu, central part of the Kyushu, the author started a program of hydrologic research. The area was selected for the investigations included Waita conical mountain situated in the Kujiu mountain within the national park. The research program required an accurate determination of the rainfall on mountain water sheds. In effect, in the high mountains the measure o f total precipitation is in error if one multiplies the horizontal projectional area of the watershed by the total depth of water as given by the conventional vertically placed rain gauge. Storm rainfall must be considered as a vector and the true rainfall sample can be computed by the elementary theory of vectors on the condition that the magnitude and direction of the storm vector in space are known respectively. In steep mountain regions as Waita the conventional rain gauge will not give a true sample of the rainfall. The sample is in error because in mountainous regions storms are usually accompanied by strong winds. The rainfall characteristics study is dealt with the behavior of rainfall in relation to wind. Rainfall rate, wind direction, and wind velocity were recorded synchronously. The vectorical components of rainfall were measured by a directional rain gauge, or special vectopluviometer. It consisted of a horizontal (H) and a vertical funnel (E. S. W. N.) mounted, and rain caught by the funnels was directed into separate compartments of the receiver tank, one compartment for each quadrant of the compass for each funnel. The angle of inclination of the rainfall (i) from any quadrant was calculated by the formula, tan i =V /H where V is the catch of the funnel with its rim in a vertical plane, and H is catch of the funnel with its rim in a horizontal plane. The average inclination of the storm could be determinded by summing the catch of the vertical and horizontal funnels separately, and then applying the formula (Table 14, Fig. 60). Correction of rainfall estimated from these vertical rain <b>gauge</b> <b>setting</b> on steep terrain was made possible through the use of vector equation, provided slope and aspect of the terrain are known and storm direction and angle of inclination of the rainfall can be determined. And then author 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of measurements of rainfall made during 1955 - 1961. in Kujiu drainage basin on the windward and leeward slope of the Waita mountain shows that the rainfall at each gage correlates according to a geometric progression with distance of the gauge from the summit (Figs. 28 - 41). And then the detailed observations made during the microhydro-climatological survey of soil and plant of this Waita mountain district which was undertaken between 1955 to 1961 with aid of agricultural-meteorology. A few of the items are given here. (I) Insolation, air temperature, soil temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and wind difference owing to topographies (Figs. 68 - 80). (II) Soil and plant variation by topography in the around Waita mountain (Figs. 82 - 89). 涌蓋山の植物群落を調査して気候との関係を調査した. その結果,海抜 1, 000 m付近までが山麓植物群落, 1, 000 ～ 1, 300 mが山地森林植物群落(喬木帯), 1, 300 ～ 1, 400 mに高山性草木灌木性植物群落が発達していることがわかつた. そして植物群落は南東から北西を通る線によつて 2 分され,北東側の半分が南西側よりよく発達していることがわかつた. これは北東側が日射,風が弱くて蒸発散が少ないためと思われる. これに反し南西側は雨期には強雨が多く,細土および腐植土の流亡があり瘠薄になること,また気候的には日射が強く高温,乾燥が相伴い,また風も強く気候変化がはげしいために,植物のその後の生育が悪く植生の発達も悪くなつたと推論した...|$|E
