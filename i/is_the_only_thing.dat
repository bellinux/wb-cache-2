He stated: Money <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that keeps them playing...If they earned the same money as I did when I was playing they'd have retired at 34 as I did, and Australian cricket would be the better for it.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens in}} medias res with Fox Mulder {{in a field}} {{hospital}} in the Arctic.

Suddenly, Mulder's heart monitor flatlines.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist's {{mission is}} made clear when {{they realize that}} a sacred vessel called the Ark of the Heavens <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that can {{penetrate}} Nelgel's defenses. The protagonist then travels 500 years into the past, where the Ark of the Heavens was last used in recorded history. After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark of the Heavens. Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful. During the end credits, the protagonist is greeted by the sage from before, who informs them that despite Nelgel's defeat, the seal he had on the central continent was still active.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} {{solstice}} meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis {{to take action against}} the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow not dead, and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he can relax, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes that he must be a son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E

25|$|Having {{claimed that}} people do, in fact, desire happiness, Mill {{now has to}} show that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> they desire. Mill anticipates the {{objection}} that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a means to happiness, eventually, it becomes part of someone's happiness and is then desired as an end in itself.|$|E

In addition, the method computes a slowly changing amplitude to satisfy other constraints of the equations or of the physical system, such as for conservation of energy in the wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{second act}} takes place {{a few days}} later. Alice has invited Tony, his father, and his mother over for dinner the next evening, and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> on the entire family's mind. Alice runs around the house telling her family to try to act as normal as possible. Penny has brought actress Gay Wellington over to read over Penny's latest play, but Gay becomes very drunk, and passes out onto the living room couch after looking at the snakes.|$|E
25|$|For Metzinger, {{along with}} {{to some extent}} both Gleizes and Malevich, the {{classical}} vision had been an incomplete representation of real things, based on an incomplete set of laws, postulates and theorems. It represented, quite simply, the belief that space <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that separates two points. It was {{the belief in the}} geocentric reality of the observable world, unchanging and immobile. The Cubists had been delighted to discover that the world was in reality dynamic, changing in time, it appeared different depending on {{the point of view of}} the observer. And yet each one of these viewpoints were equally valid, there was no preferred reference frame, all reference frames were equal. This underlying symmetry inherent in nature, in fact, is the essence of Einstein's relativity.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
25|$|Daniel sells one of {{the houses}} from the estate, and Paul gives him a job as a salesman. Imogen voices her {{concerns}} about Daniel's changing behaviour, after he convinces Nate to buy a house knowing that certain amenities will not be built. Imogen tells Nate the truth and she and Daniel break up. Daniel also falls out with Paul when he admits to leaking Paul's files to the media. Daniel sees Paul receiving a loan from Dimato for Paul's new business venture. Paul tells Daniel to leave town, which he does without revealing what he knows. He returns with a new hair cut and wants to work at Lassiter's again. Julie Quill agrees to employ him. Daniel and Imogen eventually get back together, but when he works extra hours, she becomes dissatisfied and develops feelings for Tyler. She admits this to Daniel, who decides they {{take a break and be}} free to date other people, despite Imogen insisting she would never have acted on her attraction to Tyler. Josh tries to convince Daniel to reconsider the break-up, but Daniel responds by criticising him for his failures as a father, before the hotel boiler explodes, trapping them both under a column. Despite knowing the column <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> keeping him from haemorrhaging to death, Josh asks Karl to lift it to save Daniel. Imogen later tells Daniel that Josh died to save him, and they reunite. Daniel is discharged after undergoing surgery. Imogen receives a job offer in Los Angeles and she accepts. Daniel offers to quit his job and go with her. When Imogen mentions spouses can apply for a visa, Daniel proposes and she accepts. Daniel's younger sister Madison (Sarah Ellen) arrives to check up on him on behalf of their parents. A judge grants Daniel and Imogen an expedited marriage license and they decide to marry in secret. However, Imogen's parents interrupt the ceremony and convince Daniel and Imogen to get married at their home in front of their family and friends. After the wedding, Daniel and Imogen leave Erinsborough for Brisbane to see Daniel's parents, before going to Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|On 24 August 2010, Forster joined Celtic, {{originally}} on a season-long {{loan from}} Newcastle. Celtic manager Neil Lennon described Forster by saying, [...] "He's a big boy, he's come highly recommended, his age <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> going against him because otherwise he's all the qualities you look for." [...] He made his Celtic debut on 29 August 2010 away at Motherwell and kept a clean sheet as Celtic won 1–0.

500|$|Engels {{felt that}} the three largest {{influences}} on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series The Wild Wild West, Mayberry R.F.D. and The Fugitive—the inclusion of a one-armed character in Twin Peaks was a direct homage to the latter of these. Engels has {{also noted that the}} series would make use of normal, conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a [...] "familiar" [...] framework, allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop—he particularly cites this episode's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example, as it offers {{nothing out of the ordinary}} other than the single domino which Jennings is playing with at all times, drawing attention to the item as it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> which seems out of place.|$|E
500|$|Five {{days after}} the explosion, a gunner's mate who worked in Iowas Turret One called Charles Thompson {{and told him that}} Milligan was {{conducting}} a dishonest investigation. [...] "The news media <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that can keep the Navy honest" [...] said the caller. [...] Thompson, a producer for 60 Minutes, was a former US Navy officer and naval gunfire spotter who had served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War. After leaving the military and becoming a journalist, Thompson had produced numerous news stories about military subjects. Thompson discussed the phone call with his colleague and journalist Mike Wallace, also a former naval officer, who asked him to begin following news stories about the explosion and the Navy's investigation into its cause more closely.|$|E
