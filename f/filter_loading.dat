This study: (i) developed a new methodology for simulating <b>filter</b> <b>loading</b> in-situ; (ii) observed the impact of <b>filter</b> <b>loading</b> on AC performance in-situ; and (iii) provided a greater understanding of when a filter is “dirty” and should be replaced. Six central AC systems in the Atlanta metro-region were evaluated. <b>Filter</b> <b>loading</b> was simulated by installing the TrueFlow® airflow metering device and partially taping off the face at 3 different increments. This resulted in measurements at 5 discrete static pressures (no filter, TrueFlow, TrueFlow Taped one, TrueFlow Taped two, and TrueFlow Taped three). The pilot study found that as filter pressure drop increased, airflow rates generally decreased, resulting in higher differences in temperature across the evaporator coil (∆T). There was no observed correlation between absolute humidity across the evaporator coil and either filter pressure drop or system airflow. Overall, as airflow decreased so did sensible, latent, and total capacity. This research can inform decisions about filter replacement and be used to evaluate computer simulation models of HVAC performance. M. S...|$|E

Results indicate that the intake filter efficiency and recirculation filter were the two most influential factors on cab penetration.

40|$|Asemi-analyticalmodel of {{gas flow}} in pleated fibrous filters is {{developed}} for large filtration velocities. This case presents two main new and distinguishing features {{compared to the}} low filtration velocity situations studied in previous works: the velocity profiles are not parabolic within the pleat channels and the filtration velocity is not uniform along the pleatedfilter element and this has {{a great impact on}} the <b>filter</b> <b>loading.</b> The model relies on similarity solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations in the channels formed by pleating the filter medium. After validation by comparison with direct CFD simulations and experimental data, the model is used to determine the optimal pleat density, i. e. the pleat density minimizing the overall pressure drop across the filter for given flow rate, pleat length and given filter medium properties. As illustrated in the paper, this model greatly facilitates the study of flow within the pleatedfilter compared to a standard CFD approach. It represents an excellent basis for the more involved problem of <b>filter</b> <b>loading</b> computation. In particular, no remeshing across the width of the pleatedfilter entrance channels is needed when a filtration cake forms at the channel walls...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{was developed to}} examine the role of physical and chemical factors in the control of bicarbonate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule. Included in the model were axial and radial variations in the concentrations of HCO 3 -, CO 2 and related chemical species in the tubule lumen and epithelial cells. Relations between these concentrations and the solute fluxes across the brush border and basolateral membranes were also included, as were reaction rate and equilibrium expressions to describe the various buffering processes in the lumen and cells. The two most critical membrane parameters, the rate constant for H+ secretion at the brush border and the effective permeability of HCO 3 - at the basolateral membrane, were evaluated by comparing model predictions with available free-flow micropuncture data in the rat. It {{was found that the}} experimental observations could be explained only by decreasing one or both of these membrane parameters with axial position, suggesting a progressive decrease in HCO 3 - reabsorptive capacity along the tubule. For single nephron <b>filtered</b> <b>loads</b> of HCO 3 - up to about 1, 400 pmol/min, absolute bicarbonate reabsorption was predicted to increase nearly in proportion to <b>filtered</b> <b>load,</b> whereas it was calculated to be relatively constant at higher <b>filtered</b> <b>loads,</b> irrespective of how <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> was assumed to be varied. These predictions are in excellent agreement with most of the available micropuncture data in rats, as is the prediction that HCO 3 - reabsorption should change in parallel with CO 2 partial pressure in the filtrate, at a given <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> of HCO 3 -. Certain discrepancies between the model predictions and experimental observations are evident at very high <b>filtered</b> <b>loads,</b> and the implications of these are discussed in terms of possible adaptive responses of the tubule...|$|R

Urinary magnesium excretion fell from a control of 15 to 3 % of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> after magnesium restriction. The loop of Henle, presumably the thick ascending limb, was the major modulator for renal magnesium homeostasis. The transport capacity for magnesium, however, was less in deficient rats than control animals. Absolute magnesium reabsorption increased with acute infusions of magnesium chloride but was always less in magnesium-deficient rats than control rats for any given <b>filtered</b> <b>load,</b> which suggests either a defect of a resetting of the reabsorption mechanism. Recollection micropuncture demonstrated {{that this was a}} characteristic of the loop of Henle. Proximal magnesium reabsorption remained unchanged at 15 % of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> and was unaffected by magnesium deficiency or acute magnesium repletion. Distal tubular magnesium reabsorption was limited during depletion and increased to a similar extent in control and deficient rats with enhanced magnesium delivery. Calcium reabsorption was not altered in magnesium deficiency; however, elevations of extracellular magnesium resulted in a specific inhibition of calcium reabsorption within the loop of Henle. These data suggest that overall control of renal magnesium reabsorption occurs within the loop of Henle and that the proximal tubule reabsorbs a constant fraction of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> despite variations in body magnesium status...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} by several recent studies that the regulation of sodium excretion involves factors other than the total <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> of sodium and the renal tubular effects of mineralocorticoids. Contrary to earlier suggestions that {{an increase in the}} <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> of sodium may be sufficient to account for the natriuresis of saline loading in the dog, de Wardener, Mills, Chapman, and Hayter (1) reported that the administration of saline to dogs receiving an exogenous mineralocorticoid results in an increased excretion of sodium that is not necessarily accompanied by an increased glomerular filtration rate. On the basis of this and other considerations, these authors suggested that natriuresis resulting from saline loading may be due largely to some unidentified circulating factor that affects tubular reabsorption. Similar observations that saline loading may result in natriuresis without a spontaneous increase in the <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> of sodium have been made in this laboratory (2).

The possible role of increased <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> of phosphate was eliminated in experiments in which the <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> of phosphate was reduced by acute reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. Despite considerable reductions in filtered phosphate, ECF volume expansion resulted in a consistent increase in phosphate excretion.

In these experiments saline infusion failed to increase sodium or phosphate excretion. Cessation of saline infusion and release of caval constriction resulted in a prompt natriuresis and increased phosphate excretion. It is concluded from these studies that extracellular fluid volume expansion results in an increased phosphate excretion in the parathyroidectomized dog.

PM 2. 5 filter samples were collected at three urban US locations and one India urban location and were analyzed for Elemental Carbon (EC) and Organic Carbon (OC) concentrations using thermo-optical analysis (TO) following the IMPROVE protocol for US samples and NIOSH protocol for India samples. Site and season-specific calibrations of an inexpensive photo-reference (PR) method were created with TO EC measurements of the US filter samples whereas method-specific calibration was prepared using India filter samples. Piece-wise calibration based on <b>filter</b> <b>loading</b> was also explored. Calibrations were applied across different sites, seasons and methods to determine Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and average absolute error in each calibration by comparing with reference EC measurements. This paper investigates various calibrations of PR method to improve the agreement between PR method and TO EC measurements. Difference in BC estimated error remained within ± 10 % among three urban US site-specific calibrations, which suggests that site-specific calibrations are not necessary. Season based calibrations were found to perform best (least RMSE/Mean EC), when applied to same season test samples but resulted in large errors of up to 60 % RMSE/Mean EC when applied to different seasons, thus warranting the use of season-specific calibrations of the PR method.

40|$|In {{the normal}} adult, the renal {{excretion}} of phos-phate may be varied {{over a wide}} range depending on the level of phosphate intake. When the diet contains the usual amounts of phosphate (about 1 g of phosphate per day), {{only a small fraction of}} the filtered phosphate is excreted in the urine. This fraction is decreased when the dietary phos-phorus is low and increased when it is high. Ho-meostasis is thus maintained with only slight fluctuations of the plasma phosphate concentration (2 - 6). In the course of advancing renal failure in man, normal plasma phosphate concentrations typically prevail until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 25 to 30 ml per minute (7). This oc-curs by virtue of the fact that, as GFR decreases, the fraction of the filtered phosphate excreted in-creases proportionately; as a result, phosphate bal-ance may be maintained in the presence of a de-crease in the <b>filtered</b> <b>load.</b> However, when the GFR decreases below 25 ml per minute, the fil-tered load of phosphate is decreased to such an ex-tent that even the excretion of a large fraction of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> fails to maintain phosphate ho-meostasis, and hyperphosphatemia supervenes.

40|$|Urea is {{the chief}} end product of {{nitrogen}} metabolism in mammals. Most of the urea produced is excreted by the kidneys. Excretion of a large fraction of the urea filtered by the glomerulus is required {{to keep pace with}} the rate of hepatic urea production. Consequently, the maintenance of nitrogen balance depends on a sustained high rate of renal urea excretion. One factor that might challenge the ability of the kidney to maintain a high rate of urea excretion is the need to limit water excretion. Theoretically, an increase in water absorption along the nephron would be expected to increase luminal urea concentration and consequently increase the driving force for passive urea reabsorption. Indeed, as demonstrated originally by Shannon [1] and confirmed in many subsequent studies, the rate of urea excretion decreases when water excretion decreases. However, the decline in urea excretion is relatively modest, even when the rate of water excretion is very low. In Shannon's studies in dogs [1], when water diuresis was established (water excretion 5 – 10 percent of <b>filtered</b> <b>load),</b> urea excretion was about 60 percent of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load.</b> During antidiuresis, when water excretion was reduced by 95 % or more (to less than 0. 5 percent of the glomerular filtration rate), urea excretion fell only by 25 to 30 % (to 40 to 45 percent of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{studies on}} dogs under hydrated conditions, utilizing {{the rate of}} free water formation (CH 2 O) as an index of the rate of distal tubular sodium transport. Since CH 2 O could be progressively increased with {{no evidence of a}} maximal rate during loading with hypotonic (2. 5 %) mannitol, it was concluded that there is no limit on distal tubular sodium transport during mannitol loading. In contrast, during hypotonic (0. 45 %) saline loading CH 2 O rose initially, but as urine flow (V) exceeded 25 % of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load</b> CH 2 O attained maximal levels (up to 20 % of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load)</b> and remained stable as V increased to 50 % of the <b>filtered</b> <b>load.</b> It was concluded that saline loading progressively inhibits proximal sodium reabsorption. Initially, the distal tubule absorbes a large fraction of the proximal rejectate and sodium excretion rises slightly. Eventually, an alteration in distal sodium transport appears which culminates in a maximal rate or transport limit. This distal transport limit provoked by saline loading could not be characterized by a classical Tm as seen with glucose and {{does not seem to be}} consequent to high rates of flow through the distal tubule. Regardless of the precise nature of this limit, the major increment in sodium excretion develops during saline loading only after saline alters the capacity of the distal tubule to transport sodium...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the increased renal clearance of uric acid in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) are not fully clarified. Studies using either pyrazinamide or probenecid, or both drugs but at an interval of several days, could not undoubtedly distinguish the 'hypersecretory theory' from the one favoring a defect in either post- or presecretory reabsorption. We decided to do a combined pyrazinamide and probenecid test in 5 patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH in order to evaluate more clearly the respective importance of these different pathways. Our results allow {{the conclusion of a}} diminished presecretory and mainly postsecretory reabsorption (80 +/- 4. 6 and 14 +/- 3 % of <b>filtered</b> <b>load,</b> respectively). As far as the secretion of uric acid is concerned (17 +/- 10 % of <b>filtered</b> <b>load),</b> we may say that this pathway is adapted to the amount of hypouricemia.
