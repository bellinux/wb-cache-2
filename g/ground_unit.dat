5|$|The {{species of}} StarCraft have been popular enough to inspire the {{creation}} of several collectable statues and toys based on in-game units. The first series of action figures was released by ToyCom in 2003 and included the Terran heavy infantry firebat with markings similar to some original StarCraft concept art for the firebat and a hydralisk, the Zerg medium assault warrior strain. A series of toys were also made available in 1998, featuring two colour variations of the Terran marine, another hydralisk and a Protoss zealot, the basic Protoss infantry <b>ground</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, 1/30 scale model kits for the marine and hydralisk were released in 1999 by Academy Hobby Model Kits.s Terran Marine and Zerg Hydralisk| publisher=Starship Modeler| accessdate=2008-04-04}} A second series of collectable statues, which included one based on the Terran ghost, a Terran espionage agent with psychic powers, was in development but {{appears to have been}} cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, Dean's division was the closest US <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> to the Korean Peninsula. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered Walker to deploy the division to South Korea as quickly as possible to resist the advancing forces of North Korea. Dean was ordered to send an advance battalion from his division by air to South Korea with a mission to advance and resist leading elements of the North Korean People's Army in an effort to delay them as much as possible while the remainder of the division followed by sea. Dean was given command of all US forces in Korea, and his division numbered 15,965 men and 4,773 vehicles at the time. On July 1, Dean organized the 406-man Task Force Smith from components of the US 21st Infantry Regiment and ordered it into Korea, as the advance force. As Task Force Smith advanced, Dean himself landed in Taejon on July 3 and set up his command post with Brigadier General John H. Church, the Assistant Division Commander, and Brigadier General George B. Barth, the Division Artillery commander, as his deputies. Dean ordered Barth forward to act as his forward commander for Task Force Smith, which began digging in at Osan to resist North Korean troops advancing after the capture of Seoul. Task Force Smith was subsequently defeated by North Koreans at the Battle of Osan the next day, and pushed back.|$|E

50|$|Aerial {{units are}} often tasked {{to assist in}} vehicle pursuits. Air support allows <b>ground</b> <b>units</b> to {{disengage}} and follow from a discreet distance, hopefully making the pursuit less dangerous while still allowing <b>ground</b> <b>units</b> {{to be able to}} close in quickly as directed to apprehend suspects. Aerial surveillance also allows the police to anticipate the direction of the pursuit, and position <b>ground</b> <b>units</b> ahead of the suspect to block roads or deploy spike strips. Aerial units {{can also be used to}} efficiently locate missing persons.|$|R

Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons 469 and 303 conducted day and night deck-landing qualifications in preparation for an airborne raid. The Independence LCS' features of high speed, a large flight deck, and reconfigurable mission bay can support air and small-boat employment and delivery of Marine ground and air tactical units; a small Marine <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> can be carried even with an embarked mission module.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division saw a {{great deal}} of action in the Philippines as a <b>ground</b> <b>unit.</b> The 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment made the division's first jump near Tagaytay Ridge on 3 February 1945, meeting no {{resistance}} at the drop zone. Elements of the division also jumped to liberate 2,000 Allied civilians interned at Los Ba√±os, 23 February 1945. The final operation of the division was conducted on 23 June 1945, in conjunction with an advance by U.S. ground forces in northern Luzon. A task force from the 11th was formed and jumped on Camalaniugan Airfield, south of Aparri.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, a tug <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> {{properly}} {{equipped with}} snow chains {{was used to}} push the aircraft back from the gate. After leaving the gate, the aircraft waited in a taxi line with many other aircraft for 49 minutes before reaching the takeoff runway. The pilot apparently decided not {{to return to the}} gate for reapplication of deicing, fearing that the flight's departure would be even further delayed. More snow and ice accumulated on the wings during that period, and the crew was aware of that fact when they decided to make the takeoff. Heavy snow was falling during their takeoff roll at 3:59p.m. EST.|$|E
25|$|As Thompson was {{speaking}} to Calley, Calley's subordinate, Sergeant David Mitchell, fired into the irrigation ditch, killing any civilians still moving. Thompson and his crew, in disbelief and shock, returned to their helicopter and began searching for civilians they could save. They spotted a group of women, children, and old men in {{the northeast corner of}} the village fleeing from advancing soldiers from the 2nd Platoon, Company C. Immediately realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese civilians, Thompson landed his helicopter between the advancing <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> and the villagers. He turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them he would shoot the men in the 2nd Platoon if they attempted to kill any of the fleeing civilians. While Colburn and Andreotta focused their guns on the 2nd Platoon, Thompson located as many civilians as he could, persuaded them to follow him to safer location, and ensured their evacuation with the help of two UH-1 Huey pilots he was friends with.|$|E
25|$|Bereft {{of further}} combat {{replacements}} for his hard-pressed Marauder battalions, Stilwell {{felt he had}} no choice but to continue offensive operations with his existing forces, using the Marauders as 'the point of the spear' until they had either achieved all their objectives, or were wiped out. He was also concerned that pulling out the Marauders, the only U.S. <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> in the campaign, resulted in charges of favoritism, forcing him to evacuate the exhausted Chinese and British Chindit forces as well. When General William Slim, commander of British and Commonwealth forces in Burma, informed Stilwell that his men were exhausted and should be withdrawn, Stilwell rejected the idea, insisting that his subordinate commanders simply did not understand enlisted men and their tendency to magnify physical challenges. Having made his own 'long march' out of Burma under his own power using jungle trails, Stilwell found it difficult to sympathize with those who had been in combat in the jungle for months on end without relief. In retrospect, his statements at the time revealed a lack of understanding of the limitations of lightly equipped unconventional forces when used in conventional roles. Myitkyina and the dispute over evacuation policy precipitated a hurried Army Inspector General investigation, followed by U.S. congressional committee hearings, though no disciplinary measures were taken against General Stilwell for his decisions as overall commander.|$|E

500|$|... 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines was {{reactivated}} on 1 October 1975 at MCB Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, {{and assigned}} to the 3rd Marine Division. Elements of the battalion deployed to the Western Pacific at various times during the 1970s and 1980s. [...] In June 1979, Mike Company was deactivated and Weapons Company was stood up. In February 1980, following the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the battalion was deployed to the Persian Gulf on board the USS Okinawa and was also the back-up force during Operation Eagle Claw. This deployment made 3rd Battalion the first American <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> to enter the region since World War II.|$|E
500|$|Symbolism: The {{simulated}} parachute and stylized wings {{refer to}} the airborne mission of the Brigade. The unsheathed sword, point to base (implying from sky to ground) and the hilt against the red section of the parachute canopy, alludes to the combat assault jump made by the Brigade in February 1967, the first such jump made by any unit in Vietnam indicated by the [...] "V" [...] formed by the two lightning flashes on the V-shaped silver edged blue area. The single sword also alludes to other Brigade [...] "firsts" [...] such as first American <b>ground</b> <b>unit</b> in Vietnam, first in War Zones C and D and first in the Iron Triangle. The lightning flashes are also symbolic of the Brigade's striking power and surprise and rapidity of movement. The numerical designation of the Brigade can be readily simulated by various combinations of the design elements, i.e., the sword indicating one (1), {{the sum of the}} wings, the two lightning flashes and the three sections of the parachute canopy being Seven (7) and the latter by itself also being used for three (3).|$|E
