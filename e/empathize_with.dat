The game's animated sequences were produced by Studio Ghibli, while the original score was co-composed by Joe Hisaishi. The art style was also inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development of Oliver {{was a large}} focus of the game, intending to make children <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> the character and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers used {{the power of the}} PlayStation 3 to its full potential to render the world with great detail not possible in Dominion of the Dark Djinn.|$|E

5|$|In {{creating}} the game, Rohrer {{was influenced by}} his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, and his own political views regarding gun rights and home invasions. During development and beta testing, the game went through several changes that increased its difficulty. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard to <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> the game's intended message.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Tanich {{wrote the}} lyrics to every song the group {{performed}} until his death on April 17, 2008. In writing {{the lyrics to}} the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years he spent in a Soviet labor camp, during which time he came to <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> criminals {{from all walks of}} life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical melodies and performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a guitar, drums, accordions, and are often performed with strong vocals.|$|E

5|$|The {{animated}} sequences for Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch {{were produced}} by Studio Ghibli, {{and the original}} score was composed by Joe Hisaishi and Rei Kondoh. The artwork was also greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development—particularly that of Oliver and his friends—was a large focus of development, and was intended to make children <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> the characters and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers chose to initially develop for the Nintendo DS due to its suitability for gameplay, and later used {{the power of the}} PlayStation 3 to its full potential to render the world with great detail.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} done by Senri Kita, an artist {{new to the}} series. In contrast to previous Fire Emblem games, where the protagonist was of royal blood, the main character Ike {{was intended to be}} of lower social rank, a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it. Ike was born from the many ideas for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game, with many people wanting the protagonist everyone could <b>empathize</b> <b>with.</b> His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait by male staff. A character that returned from previous games was Jeigan, who was this time designed as a female character. Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge. This also resulted in higher-quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages. The full-motion videos were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier. Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team. The game's subtitle does not refer to a specific object or place, but instead acts {{as a metaphor for the}} journeys of Ike and other characters.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player {{had to be able to}} <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E

These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and may be a bit neurotic. Oftentimes, the {{inability to}} relate to others stems from a traumatic event.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} the play takes place {{over the course of}} 12 years (1624 to 1636), {{represented}} in 12 scenes. Some give a sense of Courage's career, but do not provide time for viewers to develop sentimental feelings and <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> any of the characters. Meanwhile, Mother Courage is not depicted as a noble character. The Brechtian epic theatre distinguished itself from the ancient Greek tragedies, in which the heroes are far above the average. Neither does Brecht's ending of his play inspire any desire to imitate the main character, Mother Courage.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of friendship in children {{tends to be}} more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations. These friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation. Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to <b>empathize</b> <b>with</b> their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.|$|E

Several relevant individual differences were measured. Rational and ridiculing arguments were effective in reducing CT, whereas <b>empathizing</b> <b>with</b> the targets of CTs had no effect. Individual differences played no role in CT reduction, but the perceived intelligence and competence of the individual who conveyed the CT belief-reduction information contributed {{to the success of the}} CT belief reduction.
