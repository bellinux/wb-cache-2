I might {{have thought it was}} a kind of pony <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> but I don't remember being disappointed." [...] Four years later, Autumn made her musical debut as a solo violinist performing with an orchestra, and won a competition. At the age of nine or ten, she left regular school with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist. On her time at the school, she remarked, [...] "I hated it anyway, what with the status as 'weird,' 'antisocial,' and the physical threats, there seemed to be no reason to go anymore, so I just didn't." [...] She practiced eight or nine hours a day, had lessons, read a wide range of literature, participated in orchestra practice, and was home-schooled. Growing up, she owned a large CD collection of [...] "violin concertos, symphonies, chamber music, opera, and a little jazz". She began writing her own music and poetry at age thirteen or fourteen, though she never planned to sing any of her songs. She studied under various teachers and attended Indiana University in Bloomington, but left after two years there, because she disagreed with the prevailing views on individuality and classical music. She believed that neither the audience nor the original composer would be insulted by the clothing and appearance of the performer.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I can see why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E

[...] <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> Searle may only be {{behaving}} as if [...] he were thinking deeply about these matters. [...] But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; that's about it," [...] {{replied the}} tar. [...] "Soldiers as has {{committed}} murder--or suthin' o' that sort--an' got twenty {{year or more}} <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knows.</b> The other fellers further on there, in chains, is short-term men. Bin an' done suthin' or other not quite so bad, I suppose." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{speaking}} about the show in 2010, Bain reflected: [...] "We had some very good science fiction people as advisors who {{knew what they were}} talking about. For instance, they knew that sound up there wouldn't travel, and it would just be quiet up there. But then we wouldn't have a series, so we couldn't do that. There were various considerations that had to be made, but they were based on what is, or what was, known at the time. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> now it's out of date. I don't really know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1978 {{edition of}} a book that {{traditionally}} promoted an unfavourable view on Harrison's work, , authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described Thirty Three & ⅓ as Harrison's [...] "best effort – by far" [...] since All Things Must Pass. Carr and Tyler concluded: [...] "It must be the production. For no individual track really presents itself as typifying a New Harrison Approach – and yet the impression left by the album {{as a whole is}} definitely of a more balanced, poised and devil-may-care Hari..." [...] Robert Christgau, another critic with a low regard for Harrison's music, gave Thirty Three & ⅓ the highest rating of all the ex-Beatle's solo albums thus far, with a [...] "B–". Christgau wrote, [...] "This isn't as worldly as George wants you to think – or as he thinks himself, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> – but it ain't fulla shit either", and he highlighted [...] "Crackerbox Palace" [...] as Harrison's best song since [...] "Here Comes the Sun".|$|E

60|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I greatly feared that I had made matters worse; for here was I, a guest in the house, {{actually}} offering to purchase clothing--ready-made or to to order--from my host, who, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> {{might be one}} of the aristocracy of the country. My fears, however, proved quite groundless.|$|R
60|$|When I {{stepped on}} shore at Rotterdam, my first {{proceeding}} {{was to ask}} {{my way to the}} English Consulate. I had but a small sum of money with me; and, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, it might be well, before I did anything else, to take the necessary measures for replenishing my purse.|$|R
6000|$|Rather did [...] "I waken to the voiceless dark," [...] {{and listen}} to the {{creaking}} of the bulkheads and the rippling of the sea alongside as the Snark logged steadily her six knots an hour. I went over my calculations again and again, striving to find some mistake, until my brain was in such fever that it discovered dozens of mistakes. Suppose, instead of being sixty miles off Futuna, that my navigation was all wrong and that I was only six miles off? In which case my course would be wrong, too, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the Snark might be running straight at Futuna. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the Snark might strike Futuna the next moment. I almost sprang from the bunk at that thought; and, though I restrained myself, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> lay for a moment, nervous and tense, waiting for the shock.|$|R

60|$|Now, if the {{position}} is considered, {{it will be}} easily understood {{that this was a}} greater demand upon my confidence than was justified by my knowledge of Ayesha's character. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she might be in the very act of consigning me to a horrible doom.

60|$|I had no notion whether Therese {{could hear}} me.

Suddenly without the slightest preliminary sound light fell into the room and Therese stood in the open door with a candlestick in her hand.|$|R
60|$|My {{own face}} startled me, it looked so haggard and so wild.
