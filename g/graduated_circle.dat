25|$|Armillary spheres were {{developed}} by the Hellenistic Greeks and were used as teaching tools already in the 3rd century BC. In larger and more precise forms they were also used as observational instruments. However, the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century AD, during the Roman Empire. Eratosthenes most probably used a solstitial armilla for measuring the obliquity of the ecliptic. Hipparchus probably used an armillary sphere of four rings. The Greco-Roman geographer and astronomer Ptolemy (c. 100-170 AD) describes his instrument, the astrolabon, in his Almagest. It consisted {{of at least three}} rings, with a <b>graduated</b> <b>circle</b> inside of which another could slide, carrying two small tubes positioned opposite each other and supported by a vertical plumb-line.|$|E
6000|$|... 1183. It is, perhaps, {{unnecessary}} {{to refer}} to the graduation of the instrument, further than to explain how the observations were made. On a circle or ring of paper {{on the outside of the}} glass cylinder, fixed so as to cover the internal lower ring of tinfoil, were marked four points corresponding to angles of 90°; four other points exactly corresponding to these points being marked on the upper ring of tinfoil within. By these and the adjusting screws on which the whole instrument stands, the glass torsion thread could be brought accurately into the centre of the instrument and of the graduations on it. From one of the four points on the exterior of the cylinder a graduation of 90° was set off, and a corresponding graduation was placed upon the upper tinfoil on the opposite side of the cylinder within; and a dot being marked on that point of the surface of the repelled ball nearest to the side of the electrometer, it was easy, by observing the line which this dot made with the lines of the two graduations just referred to, to ascertain accurately the position of the ball. The upper end of the glass thread was attached, as in Coulomb's original electrometer, to an index, which had its appropriate <b>graduated</b> <b>circle,</b> upon which the degree of torsion was ultimately to be read off.|$|E
6000|$|... 1184. After the {{levelling}} of {{the instrument}} and adjustment of the glass thread, the blocks which determine {{the place of the}} carrier ball are to be regulated (1181.) so that, when the carrier arrangement is placed against them, the centre of the ball may be in the radius {{of the instrument}} corresponding to 0° on the lower graduation or that {{on the side of the}} electrometer, and at the same level and distance from the centre as the repelled ball on the suspended torsion lever. Then the torsion index is to be turned until the ball connected with it (the repelled ball) is accurately at 30°, and finally the graduated arc belonging to the torsion index is to be adjusted so as to bring 0° upon it to the index. This state of the instrument was adopted as that which gave the most direct expression of the experimental results, and in the form having fewest variable errors; the angular distance of 30° being always retained as the standard distance to which the balls were in every case to be brought, and the whole of the torsion being read off at once on the <b>graduated</b> <b>circle</b> above. Under these circumstances the distance of the balls from each other was not merely the same in degree, but their position in the instrument, and in relation to every part of it, was actually the same every time that a measurement was made; so that all irregularities arising from slight difference of form and action in the instrument and the bodies around were avoided. The only difference which could occur in the position of anything within, consisted in the deflexion of the torsion thread from a vertical position, more or less, according to the force of repulsion of the balls; but this was so slight as to cause no interfering difference in the symmetry of form within the instrument, and gave no error in the amount of torsion force indicated on the graduation above.|$|E

Introduction: By methods {{which need}} not be given here it has been satisfactorily proven that light {{is a form of}} energy {{resulting}} from the rapid vibration of the molecules composing the luminous object. It can also be shown that light is propagated in straight lines by means of transverse waves in the ether which pervades everything. The change in direction of propagation of the waves of light when passed into a more dense medium depends on their less velocity in the denser than in the rarer medium. White light consists of all wave length within a considerable range and when it is passed through a prism, we find that the waves which give rise to the sensation of the color red are not changed in direction so much as are those which produce the sensation of violet color. It follows that the waves producing the red color move less slowly in glass than do those producing the violet and that, since the velocity varies directly as the wave length, violet light consists of waves of less length than does red light. A spectrometer is an instrument fitted for observing a spectrum, having in addition a <b>graduated</b> <b>circle</b> and vernier by means of which the deviation of the emergent light is measured. It consists of a circular table with a <b>graduated</b> <b>circle</b> and vernier which may be leveled by three leveling screws.

40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} {{of research on the}} perception of information presented as graduated or proportional circles on static maps, such experiments have been rare for animated map displays. However, such experimental results might be beneficial for selecting optimal methods for depicting temporal change on <b>graduated</b> <b>circle</b> maps. In the present experiment, participants judged whether a greater number of circles in an n x n array increased or decreased during a 1500 -millisecond (ms) observation interval. The variable n represented values of 6, 8, and 10, and all circles changed size (some larger, some smaller) from a common starting size either in a discrete shift (static condition) {{in the middle of the}} observation interval, or in a smooth, apparently continuous shift (animated condition) over the same interval. In addition, the size changes were relatively small, moderate, or large. The proportion of 2 ̆ 2 more bigger 2 ̆ 2 judgments, plotted against the actual proportions of enlarged circles, produced an ogive function (a cumulative normal) with similar slopes in all conditions. However, the bias towards 2 ̆ 2 bigger 2 ̆ 2 judgments increased with the size discrepancies between the initial and final circle diameters, and the bias towards 2 ̆ 2 bigger 2 ̆ 2 judgments was greater for animated than for static circle diameter changes. The results are interpreted in terms of attentional precedence for larger items and also for those that appear to be continuously increasing in size (looming). These results have implications for the presentation of information on static and animated <b>graduated</b> <b>circle</b> maps...|$|E

Using <b>graduated</b> <b>circle</b> maps, this study compares the spatial distributions of alarm calls and burglary incidents across Charlotte, NC, during 1990. Specific comparisons are made regarding the spatial distributions and repeataddress natures of all burglar alarms, all burglaries, burglaries without alarms, and places producing both alarm calls and burglaries. Comparisons of tables indicate that burglaries are more of a single-address phenomenon than alarm calls. Map comparisons imply that the spatial distributions of alarms, and burglaries without alarms are different Inferences are made suggesting that premises with alarms might be responsible for displacing burglars to locations without alarms and that the sheer number of false alarms might subtract from any gains made by targeting places for repeat-burglary victimization...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cognitive map-design {{research}} has {{the goal of}} understanding human cognition {{in order to improve}} the design and use of maps. As a systematic sub-discipline of cartography, cognitive mapdesign research is a phenomenon of the twentieth century, specifically the latter half. Robinson’s The Look of Maps, published in 1952, played a seminal role in the genesis of cognitive map-design research in several countries, but it had interesting precursors. Empirical work that followed from The Look of Maps included psychophysical studies of <b>graduated</b> <b>circles</b> and studies of eye movements during map reading. Theoretical work that followed included a variety of cognitive theories but especially the development of the communication model as a comprehensive framework for scientific cartography. I chart the changing fortunes of cognitive map-design research after The Look of Maps and offer explanations for these changes. I also consider the legacy of cognitive map-design research—ways in which it has or has not mattered. I conclude with a list of questions suggested, but not decisively answered, by this exploratory essay...|$|R
