40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} between May 2013 and August 2014 in three provinces of Vietnam to investigate financial impacts of swine diseases in pig holdings in 2010 – 2013. The aim {{of the study was}} to quantify the costs of swine diseases at producer level in order to understand swine disease priority for monitoring at local level. Financial impacts of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), foot and mouth disease (FMD), and epidemic diarrhoea were assessed for 162 pig holders in two Red River Delta provinces and in one Mekong River Delta province, using data on pig production and swine disease outbreaks at farms. Losses incurred by swine diseases were estimated, including direct losses due to mortality (100 % market value of pig before disease onset) and morbidity (abortion, delay of finishing stage), and indirect losses due to control costs (treatment, improving biosecurity and emergency vaccination) and revenue foregone (lower price in case of emergency selling). Financial impacts of swine diseases were expressed as percentage of gross margin of pig holding. The gross margin varied between pig farming groups (P < 0. 0001) in the following order: large farm (USD 18 846), <b>fattening</b> <b>farm</b> (USD 7014) and smallholder (USD 2350). The losses per pig holding due to PRRS were the highest: 41 % of gross margin for large farm, 38 % for <b>fattening</b> <b>farm</b> and 63 % for smallholder. Cost incurred by FMD was lower with 19 %, 25 % and 32 % of gross margin of pig holding in large farm, <b>fattening</b> <b>farm</b> and smallholder, respectively. The cost of epidemic diarrhoea was the lowest compared to losses due to PRRS and FMD and accounted for around 10 % of gross margin of pig holding in the three pig farming groups. These estimates provided critical elements on swine disease priorities to better inform surveillance and control at both national and local level. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{demonstrates}} the economic value of using an early-warning tool to detect respiratory diseases {{on a commercial}} pig <b>fattening</b> <b>farm.</b> The early-warning tool used is the SOMO® respiratory distress monitor developed by SoundTalks NV, which automatically and continuously calculates a respiratory distress index and raises an alarm when respiratory problems occur in a pig building. During the experiments on a pig <b>fattening</b> <b>farm</b> in the Netherlands, SOMO devices were installed in 4 identical compartments, each containing 72 pigs, and recordings were made {{for the duration of}} the fattening round. The study was blinded, in that output of SOMO system were analysed retrospectively by the authors, i. e. the farmer was not given access to the warnings during the trial. The management decisions taken by the farmer were done the normal way, and treatment decisions were made in consultation with his veterinarian. During the study 2 compartments of pigs contracted respiratory illness, resulting in antibiotic treatment by the veterinarian. Results showed that the SOMO respiratory distress monitor gave a warning 14 days before the farmer noticed the problem in one compartment and 4 days in the other. The subsequent economic analysis showed that early detection using the SOMO system has the potential to increase the margin of income over feed cost by 10. 7 € per pig place per year in the batch affected by respiratory problems. Compensating for the fact that not all batches are affected by respiratory problems, on average for this farm, early detection can increase the margin of income over feed cost by 6. 5 € per pig place per year. status: accepte...|$|E

A total of 13 sows had antibodies and a positive correlation existed between their titre and the maternal antibody titre of their litters at 2 weeks of age. The maternal antibodies were detectable until 4 - 10 weeks of age. On two farms, no infection occurred {{during the time of the}} experiment as no seroconversion was observed in the eight litters. On the two other farms, infection was observed in eight of the nine litters between 4 and 12 weeks of age while one litter became infected during the fattening period. In some litters, a few pigs seroconverted between 6 and 8 weeks, others between 8 and 10 weeks and still others between 10 and 12 weeks.

After fattening the pigs were slaughtered in two groups. The first group was slaughtered in the usual way, but with the second group extra care was taken with the individual singeing of the carcasses and the careful removal of the intestines. Tests on the carcasses showed that 46 % of the pigs in the first group were contaminated with salmonellas as against only 7 % in the second.

40|$|The {{current status}} of tuna fiseries, <b>fattening</b> and <b>farming</b> practices, as well as {{advances}} in closed-cycle tuna aquaculture, are summarized. The emergence and expansion of tuna <b>fattening</b> and <b>farming</b> activities during {{the last four decades}} have led to a shift from traditional fisheries toward aquaculture. This change is entirely reshaping the tuna fishery industry and the management of their stocks worldwide. Tuna <b>fattening</b> and <b>farming</b> operations still rely primarily on wild-caught juveniles that are fattened using small pelagic fish, blurring the line between fisheries and aquaculture and merging these activities {{to the point that it}} is no longer possible to analyze them separately. Progress in fattening operations has been limited to improved management and decreased mortalities during the capture, towing, transferring, and feeding stages of the tuna in cages. However, tuna aquaculture is now rapidly changing due to remarkable progress in closed-cycle tuna aquaculture production through advancements in broodstock maturation, spawning, larval rearing, and juvenile production technologies. Indeed, following the pioneering achievement of closing the life cycle of the Pacific bluefin tuna (PBFT) in Japan, researchers the world over are now making significant progress in hatchery technology. Closing their life cycle and the development of ecologically and economically efficient feeds that meet the specific nutritional requirements of tuna are required to ensure the future of tuna production and the conservation of tuna species.

30|$|Although the {{background}} of the horses is not completely known, it can be assumed that the animals came from different areas of Germany. Since no <b>fattening</b> <b>farms</b> exist in Germany (Gudehus 2006), the origin of slaughtered horses largely differ. In particular, age and field of use (e.g. sports or leisure riding, reproduction) of the horses vary (Gudehus 2006). The horses chosen for the present investigation might therefore represent the situation regarding the origin of meat producing horses in Germany. However, the observed individual variations in the element concentrations in the equine liver and kidneys indicate differences in the exposure of the horses to environmental contaminants and dietary mineral supply. With regard to the use of equine by-products in the food chain, variations in the uptake of specific environmental contaminants and trace elements by the ingestion of equine organs can be assumed and should be considered for risk assessment in human and animal nutrition.|$|R

The reference unit was the batch (i. e. a group of stock calves homogenous for origin, finishing period and <b>fattening</b> <b>farm).</b> We considered 73 Charolais young bulls batches (4882 heads), born in France (Massif Central), sold to northern Italy beef herds at 405 ± 13 kg BW after a 1. 16 ± 0. 13 kg/d weight gain and slaughtered at 729 ± 23 kg BW, after a 1. 52 ± 0. 09 kg/d weight gain during fattening. Mean carbon footprint of overall beef production system averaged 13. 0 ± 0. 6 CO 2 -eq/ kg BW, and the French suckler cow-calf phase accounted for 65 % of global emissions. Conversely, the French suckler cow-calf phase was more efficient than the Italian beef finishing phase in terms of food supply for the human consumption, as the HeFCR averaged 2. 9 ± 0. 4 and 4. 6 ± 0. 8 MJ/MJ in the French and Italian phases, respectively.

Past cases of transmission of other subtypes (H 5 N 1, H 7 N 9) of avian viruses from birds to humans have almost exclusively been attributable to direct contact with infected live birds. There is no evidence to date for the possibility of humans contracting the virus through raw eggs or raw sausage products made from poultry meat of infected animals. When handling and preparing raw poultry meat and poultry meat products, the rules of hygiene should always be applied. The BfR already published more extensive information on avian {{influenza virus}}es in 2007. The Internet pages of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (www. fli. bund. de), the Robert Koch Institute (www. rki. de) and the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (www. bmel. bund. de) contain more details on the subject of avian influenza. The topical section of the website of the Ministry for Agriculture, Environment and Consumer Protection of the Federal State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern provides information on the latest developments of the poultry plague at www. lu. regierung-mv. de/gefluegelpest (in German) ...|$|E
40|$|BMSナンバーは，脂肪交雑の面積割合，脂肪交雑粒子の大きさや形状などについて総合的に評価された数値と考えられる．これら各要因について画像解析手法を用いて数値化し，遺伝的パラメータを推定することを本研究の目的とした．供試材料は， 2000 年 4 月から 2002 年 3 月にかけて，北海道内の枝肉市場に上場された黒毛和種 2, 998 頭である．第 6 ～ 7 肋骨間を切開した枝肉左半丸の横断面画像について画像解析を行い，脂肪交雑のロース芯に占める面積割合（脂肪面積比），脂肪交雑粒子の全体の粒子のあらさ，最大粒子のあらさ，ロース芯の短径・長径比およびロース芯形状の複雑さの 5 形質を画像解析形質として求めた．また，枝肉形質として枝肉重量，ロース芯面積，ばらの厚さ，皮下脂肪厚，歩留基準値，BMSナンバーおよびBCSナンバーの 7 形質をそれぞれ取り上げた．母数効果として年度ごとの季節，出荷月齢および性別を，変量効果として肥育農家を考慮し，遺伝率，遺伝ならびに表型相関係数が推定された．画像解析形質の遺伝率は，脂肪面積比（ 0. 57 ），全体の粒子のあらさ（ 0. 34 ）および短径・長径比（ 0. 32 ）において中程度から高い値が推定された．BMSナンバーと脂肪面積比（ 0. 97 ）および全体の粒子のあらさ（ 0. 68 ）の遺伝相関係数が正の高い値であった． Marbling scores {{assigned}} by graders are comprehensively evaluated with {{consideration of the}} ratio of marbling area to ribeye area (FATPER) ，coarseness of marbling，etc. The {{purposes of this study}} were to calculate FATPER，overall coarseness of marbling (O_COARSE) ，coarseness of the largest marbling particle in rib eye (M_COARSE) ，ratio of minor and major axis of rib eye (MM_RATIO) ，and the complexity of rib eye shape (COMP) numerically by image analysis and to estimate genetic parameters for meat quality traits， including these image analysis traits. Digital images around the ribeye area at the 6 th and 7 th rib of 2 ， 998 Japanese Black cattle were taken by the photographing equipment for beef cross sections during April， 2000 to March， 2002 at a meat processing plant in Hokkaido. Genetic parameters and breeding values for carcass　traits and image analysis traits were estimated with an animal model using AIREMLF 90 and BLUPF 90 　programs， respectively. The fixed effects of season by year，slaughter age and sex，and the random effects of <b>fattening</b> <b>farm</b> and additive genetic animal were included in the model. Heritability estimates of image analysis traits were 0. 57 (FATPER) ， 0. 34 (O_COARSE) ， 0. 09 (M_COARSE) ， 0. 32 (MM_RATIO) and 0. 18 (COMP). Genetic correlations between BMS and FATPER，O _COARSE and M_COARSE were 0. 97 ， 0. 68 and 0. 14 ，respectively. Sires with high breeding values of BMS and O_COARSE were recognized. This result indicates that the utilization of these sires lead to undesirably rough marbling...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to compare the prevalence of Salmonella spp, Campylobacter coli/jejuni and Yersinia spp in pigs and in pork from traditional housing systems to new animal friendly systems. On {{a representative sample of}} 50 traditional and 50 animal-friendly farms, faecal samples are collected. Faecal culture is performed for all three micro-organisms; isolated strains are further characterised. From a batch of pigs of each farm, meat samples are collected at the slaughterhouse and presence of anti-Salmonella spp antibodies is tested by meat juice analysis. Additionally, fresh pork cuts from animal friendly and conventional production are collected from 300 retailers. Analysis results from farm, slaughterhouse and retail level are compared. The influence of the production systems is assessed using regression analysis, correcting for other possible risk factors. The outcome of this study will be used as a basis for the development of new control strategies for zoonotic pathogens on Swiss <b>fattening</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} set up to get more {{insights}} in the severity and relevance of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) infections in Dutch <b>fattening</b> <b>farms</b> in an endemic PCV 2 -situation with no clinical signs of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In part A of the study, in total 29 commercial <b>fattening</b> <b>farms</b> with varying percentages of pneumonia and pleurisy at slaughter were examined. Blood samples were collected at random by cross-sectional sampling; 10 in the age of 10 - 12 weeks, 10 at the age of 16 weeks and 10 blood samples {{at the end of the}} finishing period (20 - 22 weeks of age). Serum samples were examined for the presence of PCV 2 IgM and IgG antibodies and for antibodies against other porcine lung pathogens. In part B, 8 "high"- and 8 "low" herds were selected. The 8 "high" herds were defined as herds having high percentages of lung lesions (pneumonia) at slaughter, and the 8 "low" herds had low percentages of pneumonia at slaughter. For both the "high" and "low" herds, 3 pigs showing signs of respiratory distress were selected for necropsy (n= 48). Lung tissue samples were examined post-mortem for macroscopic and histopathological lesions, and for the presence of bacteria and viruses. The results of part A showed that, pigs at 16 weeks of age with IgM antibodies against PCV 2 had a lower probability of having pleuritis at slaughter (OR 0. 34, P 10 PCV 2 DNA copies/mg) were found in lungs of 14 (58 %) "high", and in 7 (29 %) of the "low' pigs (P= 0. 13). In 11 of the 19 affected lungs from "high" pigs, high PCV 2 DNA loads were found in combination with one or more other lung pathogens, while this was found only in 5 of the 17 affected lungs from "low" pigs (P= 0. 02). This study confirms the hypothesis that PCV 2 plays a role in pneumonia and pleurisy in 10 - 24 weeks old fattening pigs, not only in herds with a high prevalence of PMWS, but also in herds with no clinical signs of PMWS...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} heritability of beef quality traits in Piemontese cattle. A total of 804 young bulls, progeny of 109 AI sires, were sampled from 124 <b>fattening</b> <b>farms</b> (FF) and slaughtered in different days at the same commercial abattoir. At slaughter, bulls were 523 ± 73 d old and average carcasses weight (CW) was 417 ± 45 kg. Carcasses were scored for fleshiness (EUS) and fatness. An individual beef sample was collected from Longissimus Thoracis 24 h after slaughter and held refrigerated at 4 °C for 8 d. Measured traits were pH at ageing (pH 8 d), beef colour (L*, a*, b*, Hue and Chroma), shear force (SF), drip (DL) and cooking loss (CL). A REML linear animal model including the fixed effects of FF, slaughter age and CW class and the random effect of the bull was used. The estimated heritability for EUS, SF, DL, Hue, L* and a* was of intermediate magnitude (from 0. 22 to 0. 49) whereas heritabilities for all other traits were low (from 0. 04 to 0. 16) ...|$|R
