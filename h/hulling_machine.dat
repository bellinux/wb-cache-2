5000|$|Charles E. Lipe, {{mechanical}} engineer and Syracuse entrepreneur, was the patentee and Engelberg Huller Company was the assignee on two <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> patents granted in 1894. These {{were identified as}} [...] "hulling and cleaning machine." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Giling Basah {{process can}} create a [...] "goat's foot," [...] a split on one end, in green coffee beans. Sometimes the <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> {{partially}} crushes a soft bean, giving the bean a shape resembling a cloven hoof.|$|E
50|$|Flame thrower was {{installed}} in place of <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun.|$|R
50|$|Flame thrower was {{installed}} {{instead of the}} <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun.|$|R
50|$|Centaur II: Mark I with wider {{tracks and}} no <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun. Experimental only.|$|R
50|$|The dried {{cherries}} {{are stored}} in bulk in special silos until they are sent to the mill where hulling, sorting, grading and bagging take place. All the outer layers of the dried cherry are removed in one step by the <b>hulling</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{working in}} the C. E. Lipe Machine Shop, located on Geddes Street and {{considered}} an early business incubator in Syracuse, Montague began producing a <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> invented by the Brazilian, mechanical engineer, Evaristo Conrado Engelberg in 1885. The machine could remove the husks and shells from rice and coffee beans.|$|E
5000|$|Lipe {{was granted}} U.S. Patent 512,304 on January 9, 1894, for a <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> {{described}} as [...] "improvements to patent 424,602 from Engelberg Huller Company. Patent 525,813 was granted on September 11, 1894, for a hulling and cleaning machine which was [...] "intended for hulling, cleaning and separating coffee berries." ...|$|E
5000|$|This variant had {{a crew of}} 5, commander, loader, gunner, driver, and <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gunner.|$|R
50|$|OT-34-85: {{created from}} the T-34-85, had an {{internally}} mounted flamethrower ATO-42 replacing the <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun.|$|R
50|$|Original {{production}} version. The auxiliary turret {{was often}} removed in the field, eliminating the <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gunner position.|$|R
50|$|Winnowing, used to {{separate}} the rice from hulls, {{is to put the}} whole rice into a pan and throw it into the air while the wind blows. The light hulls are blown away while the heavy rice fall back into the pan. Later pestles and a simple machine called a rice pounder were developed to remove hulls. In 1885 the modern rice <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> was invented in Brazil. During the milling processes, the hulls are removed from the raw grain to reveal whole brown rice, which may then sometimes be milled further to remove the bran layer, resulting in white rice.|$|E
50|$|In another chapter, The Preparation of Grains, he also {{provided}} illustrations for rolling rice grains {{with a wooden}} ox-drawn roller, a crank-operated rotary-fan winnowing machine that separated husks, a hand-operated wooden hulling mill, a hand-operated earthen <b>hulling</b> <b>machine,</b> a process of sieving to separate husk-free grains, two types of foot-operated trip hammers, a hydraulic-powered trip hammer powered by a waterwheel that rotated an axle of overhead cams, a horse-drawn hulling mill, an oxen-drawn grinding mill, a grinding mill operated by a vertical waterwheel, and a rolling mill operated by a horizontal waterwheel, the waterwheel placed in a rushing current found under a wooden deck that rotated the axle of the stone roller above within {{the interior of a}} building.|$|E
5000|$|John R. Montague, {{while working}} in the C. E. Lipe Machine Shop, began {{producing}} a machine created by the Brazilian inventor, Evaristo Conrado Engelberg, a <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> to remove the shells from rice and coffee beans. From this venture, the Engelberg Huller Company was formed and manufactured the machines in the building from 1888 to 1897. By then, the company, whose trade largely consisted of exports, required larger quarters {{and moved to a}} new plant at West Fayette and Ontario streets. During March 1904, a model called the Halstead Attrition Mill was advertised as the [...] "most perfect and efficient for grinding all kinds of cereals." [...] The mill was especially adapted for grinding corn on the cob or shelled, corn and wheat mixed and rye. In 1939, the company was still in business and shipped orders all over the world including; South America, Asia, Africa and Central America.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experiment}} was performed an evaluation of yield production of the selected spectrum of naked and hulled oat varieties. There were compared time-tested varieties to new varieties registered {{in the list of}} recommended varieties in 2013. At the same time were compared methods of yield production of hulled oat and naked oat. After evaluation of real yield was informatively compared the amount of raw food materials obtained from naked oat with the oat rice obtained from hulled oat by <b>hulling</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate different pistachio hullers and determine the proper harvest time of pistachio nuts for hulling. Three pistachio hulling machines (Helical drum, Helical- blade drum, Rubber drum) at three harvest times and 15 days interval were evaluated. The hulling efficiency, percentage of damaged nuts, faulty hulled nuts and unhulled nuts were measured at each time interval. A factorial experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Data were compared using analyses of variance and employing Duncan's multiple range test. The results showed that the interaction effect of <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> type and harvesting time on the hulling efficiency and nut damage in the outlet of hull and nut was significant at the five percent level (...|$|E
40|$|The wild {{pistachio}} (Pistacia Atlantica Mutika) {{exists in}} 2. 4 million hectares of Iranian forest. In spite of high nutritional and medical {{value of this}} fruit, its use and processing are still performed manually. The objectives of this research are to design, to construct and to evaluate {{the performance of a}} pistachio <b>hulling</b> <b>machine.</b> The pistachio of Kerman province was chosen as the case of study. The mechanism of shelling was chosen based on the applied pressure force of two cylinders, driving and driven. The effects of input variables including revolution of driving cylinder (three levels), the gap between two cylinders (four levels) and moisture content (four levels) on the performance of machine (shelling efficiency, percentage of intact kernel, percentage of imperfective broken nut, percentage of dust, and percentage of unshelled nut) were analyzed. The results showed that the shelling efficiency decreases with increasing the gap of two cylinders and moisture content of wild pistachio. The maximum intact kernel was obtained at moisture content of 6. 61 wb %. The best performance was observed with the following conditions: the cylinders’ gap of 0. 48 mm, rotational speed of the driving cylinder of 25. 84 rpm and moisture content of 4. 31 % w. b...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the design of hullers and describes the significance of the morphological features of seeds {{in the development of a}} concept of the way of seed hulling, as well as the role of the physical properties of seeds in the design of the working elements of <b>hulling</b> <b>machines.</b> It has been found that in rational design of <b>hulling</b> <b>machines</b> their parameters should be chosen on the basis of simulation studies performed by means of mathematical models. A mathematical model should combine into relationships the design and operational parameters of the huller designed, as well as the physical properties of the seeds to be hulled...|$|R
50|$|One of the world's first coffee <b>hulling</b> <b>machines</b> was {{manufactured}} in the building by Engelberg Huller Company, {{as well as many}} other innovations were invented there such as electrical supplies, building materials, tire chains and a time clock manufactured by Bundy Recording Company.|$|R
5000|$|Model 1939 - First {{production}} models, these {{tanks were}} prone to frequent breakdowns, but were highly resistant to anti-tank weapons during the Winter War. Armed with the 76 mm L-11 tank gun, recognizable {{due to a}} recuperator above a barrel. Most tanks were lacking the <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun. 141 were built.|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} primary {{processing}} of coffee {{is a vital}} determinant of quality and price. Wet processing method produces higher quality beans but is very labourious. This work outlines {{the design of a}} small scale cost-effective ergonomic and easily maintained and operated coffee <b>hulling</b> <b>machine</b> that can improve quality and productivity of green coffee beans. The machine can be constructed from locally available materials at a relatively low cost of about NGN 140000. 00 with cheap running cost. The beaters are made from rubber strip which can deflect when in contact with any obstruction causing little or no stresses on drum members and reducing the risk of damage to both the beans and machine. The machine is portable and detachable which make it fit to be owned by a group of farmers who can move it from one farm to the other making affordability and running cost easier. The easily affordable and relatively low running cost may be further reduced {{by the fact that the}} machine is powered by 3. 0 Hp petrol engine which is suitable for other purposes among the rural dwellers. The eventual construction of the machine will encourage more farmers to go into wet processing of coffee and reduce the foreign exchange hitherto lost to this purpose...|$|E
50|$|The Engelberg Huller Company was {{established}} in 1888 in Syracuse, New York, by John R. Montague, to manufacture and distribute the Engelberg <b>Huller</b> <b>machine</b> which was invented by Brazilian mechanical engineer and inventor, Evaristo Conrado Engelberg, and Willard Halstead to remove the husks and shells from rice and coffee during the milling process.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the more}} notable Churchill variants, the Crocodile was a Churchill VII in which the <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun was {{replaced}} with a flamethrower. The fuel was in an armoured wheeled trailer towed behind. It could fire several one second bursts over 150 yards. The Crocodile was one of [...] "Hobart's Funnies".|$|R
50|$|Minor adjustments, such as {{adjustable}} {{seats for}} the driver and firmer footing for the commander/gunner and loader, were provided in German service. A total of 2,550 rounds were carried for the bow and turret machine guns. The driver could also fire the <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun with a trigger fitted on the left tiller bar.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{with this}} size increase, stowage {{for the larger}} {{ammunition}} rounds was severely limited. The <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gunner's position was removed to provide additional stowage space for ammunition, but the vehicle still carried only 25 rounds. Some conventional High Explosive (HE) shells were carried, but the primary ammunition was Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot projectiles (APDS) ...|$|R
50|$|The Type 95 was a 7.4-tonne {{vehicle with}} a {{complement}} of 3 crewmen: a commander, a <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gunner, and a driver. Only the commander {{was seated in}} the turret, hence {{he was responsible for}} observation, loading, aiming, firing the main gun, as well as decision-making and commanding the crew. The hand-operated turret was small and extremely cramped.|$|R
5000|$|KV-85 (Object 239) - A KV-1S {{with the}} 85 mm D-5T cannon {{in a new}} turret, with the ball mounted <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun removed and the hole welded shut, 148 of these tanks were {{produced}} {{in the second half}} of 1943 until the spring of 1944; they were a stopgap until the IS tank series entered production.|$|R
50|$|The turret {{mounted the}} Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun {{required}} in the Tank Board specification. The <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun was removed to provide stowage space for the long 17 pounder cartridges. The War Office expected that this larger ammunition, together with its stowage forward, would require two loaders. This raised the turret crew to four - Commander, Gunner, Loader 1 & Loader 2.|$|R
50|$|The {{tank was}} {{equipped}} with a full PAZ/FVU chemical filtration system. The coaxial 7.62 mm SGMT machine gun {{was replaced by a}} 7.62 mm PKT <b>machine</b> gun. The <b>hull</b> was lengthened from 6.04 m to 6.2 m. The <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gun was removed, making space for six more main gun rounds. These changes increased the weight of the vehicle to 38 tonnes.|$|R

50|$|The Lynx had a low slung {{body with}} well sloped, but thin, armour. The 140 hp Scania-Vabis petrol engine {{was in the}} middle on the left side. The crew {{consisted}} of six troops; a forward driver and <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gunner, two similar positions in the rear hull, and two crew in the revolving turret which mounted a 20mm Madsen cannon and a coaxial light machine gun.|$|R
50|$|In Early 1951, the U.S. {{initiated}} {{the design of}} the M48 Patton, designated the T-48 with a 90 mm cannon. The T48 featured a new turret, new redesigned hull and an improved suspension. The <b>hull</b> <b>machine</b> gunner position was removed, reducing the crew to 4. On 2 April 1953, the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM), standardized the last of the Patton series tanks as the M48 Patton.|$|R
