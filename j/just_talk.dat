500|$|The duo created [...] "Spice Invaders" [...] {{by placing}} four {{microphones}} {{and telling the}} group to <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> about anything they wanted, the conversation was recorded and as Wilson described it, a [...] "hideous bubblegum" [...] backing track was added behind the voices. After the group left, Watkins and the mix engineer finished the track during the night.|$|E
500|$|Chancellor {{stated in}} May 2007 that the band would {{probably}} continue their tour until early 2008 and then [...] "take some time off". He {{added that the}} band had already written some new material and would surely release another album at some point. He speculated {{about the possibility of}} a [...] "band movie", something the band has considered for a long time. Ideas ranged from [...] "a narrative story in a surreal fashion with as much money and special effects as possible" [...] to [...] "pockets of all of that or something that's live or the band playing". Although Carey stated that the necessary know-how was at hand due to the band's connections to artists working in the movie business, Jones dismissed the idea, saying [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> right now." ...|$|E

500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> about the things that I like'. So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous," [...] she added.|$|E

2500|$|Tell Me Where it Hurts {{started from}} a small [...] {{newspaper}} article {{about a group of}} women in Queens who got together to <b>just</b> <b>talk.</b> The [...] film starred Maureen Stapleton and won two Emmys. The following year, she wrote and co-produced Hustling based on Gail Sheehy's non-fiction book. The film was about a prostitute recounting her life to a reporter, and starred Jill Clayburgh and Lee Remick, respectively. For weeks, Kanin interviewed working girls at [...] the Midtown North police station, and after the film aired, she received letters complimenting her on how fairly she had treated them.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Executive CY Leung {{said that}} protesters need to {{carefully}} consider {{what sort of}} democracy they are pursuing. He welcomed {{the end of the}} occupation, saying: [...] "Other than economic losses, I believe the greatest loss Hong Kong society has suffered is the damage {{to the rule of law}} by a small group of people... If we <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> about democracy without talking about the rule of law, it's not real democracy but a state of no government". Leung saw his popularity ratings slump to a new low following the occupation protests, down to 39.7 percent, with a net of minus 37%. This was attributed to public perception of Leung's unwillingness to heal the wounds, and his unwarranted shifting of the blame for the wrongs in society onto opponents. Leung also claimed negative effects on the economy without providing evidence, and his assertions were contradicted by official figures. On, 19 December 2014, the eve of the 15th anniversary of Macau's handover, authorities in Macau banned journalists covering the arrival of Chinese president Xi Jinping from holding umbrellas in the rain.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{features}} Ullman {{playing an}} array of real-life people aside from a hearty helping of original characters. Impersonations include Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, {{and members of the}} British Royal Family, Camilla Parker-Bowles and Carole Middleton. Ullman received considerable international attention for her portrayal of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [...] "I'm fascinated by Angela Merkel, so I wanted to be Angela Merkel. I think they're like Trojan horses, these impersonations. I can dress up like them and make them whatever I want them to be, like putting a personality within them. I didn't want to just do a straight impersonation. I wanted to try and show their lives. I always imagine that Angela Merkel is someone that has to be with men all the time, in these rooms having meetings... And I thought, 'I wonder what she's like when she's with her best friend and they <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> about hair and make-up?'" [...] BBC Director-General Tony Hall paid a visit to the set show and caught Ullman playing Merkel singing jazz and scatting about the state of European affairs. [...] "Tony Hall came down to the set the day I was singing as Merkel. He said: 'Would you please do this on Newsnight with me?'" [...] On 23 June 2017, BBC One's The One Show reached out to Angela Merkel's office for a statement regarding Ullman's impersonation of her: ...|$|E

2500|$|Singing {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vocables, though recordings and {{reports from the}} early 1900s and prior indicate there were {{a great deal more}} lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot people see the profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say so many words, why didn't they <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> (p.69). Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound like talking (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: [...] "It's a bad thing to be an old man", (Nettl, 1989, p.73, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, [...] "Yonder woman, you must take me. I am powerful. Yonder woman, you must take me, you must hear me. Where I sit is powerful." [...] (Nettl, 1989, p.73, Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indian singing, are the consonants h, y, w, and vowels. They avoid n, c (ts) and other consonants. i and e tend slightly to be higher in pitch, a, o, and u lower (p.71). (Nettl, 1989) ...|$|E
