5|$|Also {{aiding the}} B-1's {{survivability}} is its relatively low radar cross-section (RCS). Although not technically a stealth aircraft {{in a comprehensive}} sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 1/50th of the similar sized B-52's RCS; this <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 26ft² or 2.4m², roughly equivalent to the RCS of a small fighter aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of these emissions {{are thought to be}} produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce {{back and forth between the}} poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 0.1GW.|$|E
