40|$|The histone {{regulatory}} (<b>HIR)</b> and histone promoter control (HPC) repressor proteins regulate {{three of}} the four histone gene loci during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. Here, we demonstrate that <b>Hir</b> 1, <b>Hir</b> 2, <b>Hir</b> 3, and Hpc 2 proteins form a stable <b>HIR</b> repressor complex. The <b>HIR</b> complex promotes histone deposition onto DNA in vitro and constitutes a novel nucleosome assembly complex. The <b>HIR</b> complex stably binds to DNA and nucleosomes. Furthermore, <b>HIR</b> complex binding to nucleosomes forms a distinct protein/DNA complex resistant to remodeling by SWI/SNF. Thus, the <b>HIR</b> complex is a novel nucleosome assembly complex which functions with SWI/SNF to regulate transcription...|$|R
40|$|The <b>HIR</b> 1 {{gene product}} is {{required}} to repress transcription {{of three of the}} four histone gene loci in Saccharomyces cerivisiae, and like its counterpart, the <b>HIR</b> 2 protein, it functions as a transcriptional corepressor. Although <b>Hir</b> 1 p and <b>Hir</b> 2 p are physically associated in yeast, <b>Hir</b> 1 p is able to function independently of <b>Hir</b> 2 p when it is artificially recruited to the histone HTA 1 promoter. A deletion analysis of <b>HIR</b> 1 has revealed two separate repression domains: one in its N terminus, where seven copies of the beta-transducin or WD 40 motif reside, and the second in the remaining C-terminal amino acids. Overexpression of the WD repeats in a <b>hir</b> 1 delta strain complemented its Hir- phenotype, while overexpression of the C terminus in a wild-type strain caused both Hir- and Spt- phenotypes. The <b>Hir</b> 1 p C terminus physically interacted in vivo with <b>Hir</b> 2 p, and both <b>Hir</b> 1 p repression domains interacted with full-length <b>Hir</b> 1 p. It was additionally found that the <b>Hir</b> 1 p WD repeats functionally interacted with the SPT 4, SPT 5, and SPT 6 gene products, suggesting that these repeats may direct <b>Hir</b> 1 p to different protein complexes...|$|R
40|$|The HIR/HPC (histone regulation/histone {{periodic}} control) negative regulators play {{important roles}} in the transcription of six of the eight core histone genes during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. The phenotypes of <b>hir</b> 1 and <b>hir</b> 2 mutants suggested that the wild-type <b>HIR</b> 1 and <b>HIR</b> 2 genes encode transcriptional repressors that function {{in the absence of}} direct DNA binding. When <b>Hir</b> 1 p and <b>Hir</b> 2 p were artificially tethered to yeast promoters, each protein repressed transcription, suggesting that they represent a new class of transcriptional corepressors. The two proteins might function as a complex in vivo: <b>Hir</b> 2 p required both <b>Hir</b> 1 p and another <b>Hir</b> protein, <b>Hir</b> 3 p, to repress transcription when it was tethered to an HTA 1 -lacZ reporter gene, and <b>Hir</b> 1 p and <b>Hir</b> 2 p could be coimmunoprecipitated from yeast cell extracts. Tethered <b>Hir</b> 1 p also directed the periodic transcription of the HTA 1 gene and repressed HTA 1 transcription in response to two cell cycle regulatory signals.

40|$|SummaryThe orderly {{deposition}} of histones onto DNA is mediated by conserved assembly complexes, including chromatin assembly factor- 1 (CAF- 1) and the <b>Hir</b> proteins [1 – 4]. CAF- 1 and the <b>Hir</b> proteins operate in distinct but functionally overlapping histone deposition pathways in vivo [5, 6]. The <b>Hir</b> proteins and CAF- 1 {{share a common}} partner, the highly conserved histone H 3 /H 4 binding protein Asf 1, which binds the middle subunit of CAF- 1 {{as well as to}} <b>Hir</b> proteins [7 – 11]. Asf 1 binds to newly synthesized histones H 3 /H 4 [12], and this complex stimulates histone deposition by CAF- 1 [7, 11, 12]. In yeast, Asf 1 is required for the contribution of the <b>Hir</b> proteins to gene silencing [7, 13]. Here, we demonstrate that <b>Hir</b> 1, <b>Hir</b> 2, <b>Hir</b> 3, and Hpc 2 comprise the <b>HIR</b> complex, which copurifies with the histone deposition protein Asf 1.

40|$|Serine {{residues}} of {{the human}} insulin receptor (<b>HIR)</b> may be phosphorylated and negatively regulate the insulin signal. We studied the impact of 16 serine residues in <b>HIR</b> by mutation to alanine and co-overexpression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells together with the docking proteins insulin receptor substrate (IRS) - 1, IRS- 2, or (SHC) Src homologous and collagen-like. As a control, IRS- 1 was also cotransfected with an <b>HIR</b> with a juxtamembrane deletion (<b>HIR</b> delta JM) and therefore not containing the domain required for interaction with IRS- 1. Coexpression of <b>HIR</b> with IRS- 1, IRS- 2, and SHC strongly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. A similar increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in cells overexpressing IRS- 1, IRS- 2, or SHC together with all <b>HIR</b> mutants except <b>HIR</b> delta JM and a mutant carrying exchanges of serines 1177, 1178, and 1182 to alanine (<b>HIR</b> 1177 / 78 / 82), although this mutant showed normal autophosphorylation. Analysis of total cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed {{that in addition to}} the overexpressed substrates, other cellular proteins displayed reduced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. To study consequences for phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) activation, we established stable NIH 3 T 3 fibroblast cell lines overexpressing wild-type <b>HIR,</b> <b>HIR</b> 1177 / 78 / 82, and other <b>HIR</b> mutants as the control.

Finally, we performed a separation of the phosphopeptides by high-performance liquid chromatography and could not detect any differences in the profiles of <b>HIR</b> and <b>HIR</b> 1177 / 78 / 82.

6000|$|But {{the whole}} of this passage {{exhibits}} {{the influence of the}} French Physiocrats by whom Adam Smith was inspired, at their worst; that is to say, when they most completely forsook the ground of experience for a priori speculation. The confident reference to [...] "that original state of things" [...] is quite in the manner of the Essai sur l'Inegalie. Now, the state of men before the [...] "appropriation of land" [...] and the [...] "accumulation of stock" [...] must surely have been that of purely savage hunters. As, by the supposition, nobody would have possessed land, certainly no man could have had a landlord; and, if there was no accumulation of stock in a transferable form, as surely there could be no master, in the sense of <b>hirer.</b> But <b>hirer</b> and hire (that is, wages) are correlative terms, like mother and child. As [...] "child" [...] implies [...] "mother," [...] so does [...] "hire" [...] or [...] "wages" [...] imply a [181] [...] "hirer" [...] or [...] "wage-giver." [...] Therefore, when a man in [...] "the original state of things" [...] gathered fruit or killed game for his own sustenance, the fruit or the game could be called his [...] "wages" [...] only in a figurative sense; as one sees if the term [...] "hire," [...] which has a more limited connotation, is substituted for [...] "wage." [...] If not, it must be assumed that the savage hired himself to get his own dinner; whereby we are led to the tolerably absurd conclusion that, as in the [...] "state of nature" [...] he was his own employer, the [...] "master" [...] and the labourer, in that model age, appropriated the produce in equal shares! And if this should be not enough, it has already been seen that, in the hunting state, man is not even an accessory of production of vital capital; he merely consumes what nature produces.|$|E
60|$|By {{the just}} procedure, the whole {{price of the}} first piece of work goes {{into the hands of the}} man who does it. No surplus being left in the employer's hands, he cannot hire another man for another piece of labour. But by {{precisely}} so much as his power is diminished, the hired workman's power is increased; that is to say, by the additional half of the price he has received; which additional half he has the power of using to employ another man in his service. I will suppose, for the moment, the least favourable, though quite probable, case--that, though justly treated himself, he yet will act unjustly to his subordinate; and hire at half-price, if he can. The final result will then be, that one man works for the employer, at just price; one for the workman, at half-price; and two, as in the first case, are still out of employ. These two, as I said before, are out of employ in both cases. The difference between the just and unjust procedure does not lie in the number of men hired, but in the price paid to them, and the persons by whom it is paid. The essential difference, that which I want the reader to see clearly, is, that in the unjust case, two men work for one, the first <b>hirer.</b> In the just case, one man works for the first <b>hirer,</b> one for the person hired, and so on, down or up through the various grades of service; the influence being carried forward by justice, and arrested by injustice. The universal and constant action of justice in this matter is therefore to diminish the power of wealth, in the hands of one individual, over masses of men, and to distribute it through a chain of men. The actual power exerted by the wealth is the same in both cases; but by injustice it is put all into one man's hands, so that he directs at once and with equal force the labour of a circle of men about him; by the just procedure, he is permitted to touch the nearest only, through whom, with diminished force, modified by new minds, the energy of the wealth passes on to others, and so till it exhausts itself.|$|E

60|$|I am {{inclined}} to think--but here I speak beyond {{the text of}} contemporary Socialist literature--that in certain directions Socialism, while destroying property, will introduce a compensatory element by creating rights. For example, Socialism will certainly destroy all private property in land and in natural material and accumulated industrial resources; {{it will be the}} universal landlord and the universal capitalist, {{but that does not mean}} that we shall all be the State's tenants-at-will. There can be little doubt that the Socialist State will recognize the rights of the improving occupier and the beneficial <b>hirer.</b> It is manifestly in accordance both with justice and public policy that a man who takes a piece of land and creates a value on it--by making a vineyard, let us say--is entitled to security of tenure, is to be dispossessed only in exceptional circumstances and with ample atonement. If a man who takes an agricultural or horticultural holding comes to feel that there he will toil and there later he will rest upon his labours, I do not think a rational Socialism will war against this passion for the vine and fig-tree. If it absolutely refuses the idea of freehold, it will certainly not repudiate leasehold. I think the State may prove a far more generous and sentimental landlord in many things than any private person.|$|E
60|$|The {{staple of}} their {{business}} was, however, the letting of bicycles on hire. It was a singular trade, obeying no known commercial or economic principles--indeed, no principles. There was a stock of ladies' and gentlemen's bicycles {{in a state of}} disrepair that passes description, and these, the hiring stock, were let to unexacting and reckless people, inexpert in the things of this world, at a nominal rate of one shilling for the first hour and sixpence per hour afterwards. But really there were no fixed prices, and insistent boys could get bicycles and the thrill of danger for an hour for so low a sum as threepence, provided they could convince Grubb that that was all they had. The saddle and handle-bar were then sketchily adjusted by Grubb, a deposit exacted, except in the case of familiar boys, the machine lubricated, and the adventurer started upon his career. Usually he or she came back, but at times, when the accident was serious, Bert or Grubb had to go out and fetch the machine home. Hire was always charged up to the hour of return to the shop and deducted from the deposit. It was rare that a bicycle started out from their hands in a state of pedantic efficiency. Romantic possibilities of accident lurked in the worn thread of the screw that adjusted the saddle, in the precarious pedals, in the loose-knit chain, in the handle-bars, above all in the brakes and tyres. Tappings and clankings and strange rhythmic creakings awoke as the intrepid <b>hirer</b> pedalled out into the country. Then perhaps the bell would jam or a brake fail to act on a hill; or the seat-pillar would get loose, and the saddle drop three or four inches with a disconcerting bump; or the loose and rattling chain would jump the cogs of the chain-wheel as the machine ran downhill, and so bring the mechanism to an abrupt and disastrous stop without at the same time arresting the forward momentum of the rider; or a tyre would bang, or sigh quietly, and give up the struggle for efficiency.|$|E
