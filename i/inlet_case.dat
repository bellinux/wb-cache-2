40|$|To provide {{essential}} {{design information}} of microchannel evaporators, an experimental {{study was conducted}} on the effects of geometry, operating conditions and fluid properties on the distribution of refrigerant and pressure drop in horizontal heat exchanger manifolds. An experimental facility with a visualization section for mimicking a real heat exchanger manifold geometry was developed. Under realistic operating conditions, measurements of refrigerant distribution were conducted by measuring mass flow rates and vapor quality of all branch tube groups (individual adjacent heat exchanger tubes were grouped in groups) for a total of 60 test cases. The flow direction within the heat exchangers is vertically upward. Stratified flow is observed for the end <b>inlet</b> <b>case</b> of the dividing manifold due to the gravitational effect. The liquid level increases along the dividing manifold because the liquid is traveling farther than the vapor due to inertia difference. Near the end of the manifold, the liquid level is almost constant. For the side <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> it is observed that the incoming refrigerant impinges on the inner side wall of the manifold, and is divided symmetrically near the inlet, and the interface between the vapor and the liquid has a V-shaped form near the inlet. Based on the measurements, it is observed that for the end <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> the profile of the branch tube inlet vapor quality is of a "stepwise" shape. There exist two almost constant value regions, one of about 100 % vapor quality near the inlet and the remainder of about 12 % vapor quality with a very short transition region. For the end <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> as the manifold inlet mass flow rate increases, the number of branch tube groups having almost 100 % tube inlet vapor quality increases also because the vapor-liquid interface is moving farther {{towards the end of the}} manifold due to the increased momentum. However, for the side <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> there is no such region having 100 % branch tube inlet vapor quality. For the side <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> the profile of the branch tube inlet vapor quality is symmetric. Near the inlet, the branch tube inlet vapor quality is about 60 ~ 70 %, and near the end of the manifold, the branch tube inlet vapor quality is about 20 %. In between two regions, the branch tube inlet vapor quality decreases monotonously along the manifold. The flow distribution is strongly affected by the manifold inlet location and/or manifold inlet geometry and manifold inlet vapor mass flux. Correlations are proposed using the T-junction concept in a modified form from Watanabe et al. 's method (1995). For R- 410 A and R- 134 a tests with both inlet cases, 90 % of measured vapor inlet quality data and 90 % of measured liquid fraction of taken off data are within predicted values ± 0. 1. To investigate the effect of refrigerant maldistribution on the performance of the tested heat exchangers, heat exchanger simulations were conducted. Based on the heat exchanger simulation results using test results for the refrigerant distribution, for the side <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> the capacity degradation based on the uniform distribution at the tested inlet manifold mass flow rates (at 30, 45 and 60 g/s) is 5 ~ 8 %. For the end <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> as the inlet manifold mass flow rate increases, the capacity degradation based on the uniform distribution ranges from 4 % to 15 % as a function of the manifold inlet mass flow rate. Therefore, the side inlet is preferred for a wide range of mass flow rates compared to the end inlet...|$|E

40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} predictions {{were conducted}} to study heat (mass) transfer characteristics in a two-pass trapezoidal channel simulating the cooling passage of a gas turbine blade. Three different rib configurations were tested for the air entering the smaller {{cross section of the}} trapezoidal channel as well as the larger cross section of the trapezoidal channel at four different Reynolds numbers of 9, 400, 16, 800, 31, 800, and 57, 200. (+) 60 ? ribs, (?) 60 ? ribs and 60 ? V-shaped ribs were attached on both the top and bottom walls in parallel sequence. A naphthalene sublimation technique was used, and the heat and mass transfer analogy was applied to convert the mass transfer coefficients to heat transfer coefficients. Numerical predictions of three-dimensional flow and heat transfer also were performed for the trapezoidal channel with and without 90 ? ribs tested by Lee et al. (2007). Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) in the FLUENT CFD code was used to calculate the heat transfer coefficients and flow fields at Re = 31, 800. The results showed that the combined effects of the rib angle, rib orientation, and the sharp 180 ? turn significantly affected the heat (mass) transfer distributions. The secondary flows induced by the sharp 180 ? turn and the angled or V-shaped ribs played a very prominent role in heat (mass) transfer enhancements. The heat (mass) transfer enhancements and the pressure drops across the turn for 60 ? V-shaped ribs had the highest values, then came the case of (+) 60 ? ribs, and the heat (mass) transfer enhancements and the friction factor ratios for (?) 60 ? ribs was the lowest. However, comparing (?) 60 ? ribs with the 90 ? ribs, (?) 60 ? ribs produced higher heat (mass) transfer enhancements than the 90 ? ribs, as results of the secondary flow induced by the (?) 60 ? ribs. The overall average heat (mass) transfer for the larger <b>inlet</b> <b>cases</b> was always higher than that for the smaller <b>inlet</b> <b>cases</b> in the ribbed trapezoidal channel.

40|$|The {{research}} effort {{presented in}} this dissertation consists of employing active trailing edge blowing control to reduce the unsteady stator-rotor interaction in a turbofan simulator. Two active flow control systems with different wake sensing approaches are successfully implemented on the engine simulator. The first flow control system utilizes Pitot probes as flow sensors. Use of Pitot probes as sensors is appropriate {{as a first step}} toward a more in depth investigation of active trailing edge blowing control. An upper performance limit in terms of wake-filling can be obtained and serves as the baseline in evaluating other control systems with indirect wake sensors. The ability of the system to achieve effective wake filling when subjected to a change in inlet flow conditions demonstrates the feasibility and advantage of active flow control. Significant tonal noise reductions in the far field are also obtained. The second control system involves using microphones as indirect wake sensors.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} a common practice to use surrogate models instead of finite element (FE) models {{in most of the}} structural optimization problems. The main advantage of these surrogate models is to reduce computation time as well as to make design optimization of complex structures possible. For surrogate modeling, firstly input-target pairs (training set) are required which are obtained by running the FE model for varying values of the design parameter set. Then the relationship between these pairs is de-fined via curve fitting where the created curve is named as a surrogate model. Once the surrogate model is found, it replaces the FE model in the optimization problem. Finally the optimization is performed using suitably chosen algorithm(s). Since solving an FE model may take very long time for certain ap-plications, gathering the training set is usually the most time consuming part in the overall optimization process. Therefore, in this research the merits of the Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) method are utilized to gather this set for structures including repetitive patterns (e. g. fan <b>inlet</b> <b>case).</b> The reduced FE model of only one repeating pattern is created using CMS and the obtained information is shared {{with the rest of the}} repeating patterns.

40|$|Fan {{noise is}} always an {{important}} topic in applications ranging from small cooling fans for computers, transport vehicles and machinery, and building ventilation fans, to large compressors and turbo-engine fans in aircraft. When air flow with higher pressure or larger flow rate is needed in some operating conditions, two fans in series or a contra-rotating fan is often adopted. The purpose of this project is to conduct the noise source analysis for two identical small axial-flow cooling fans and a newly designed small axial-flow contra-rotating fan (both about 120 mm in diameter), and to explore some passive methods to reduce the more complex radiated noise, compared with that encountered in a conventional single fan. For two fans in series, a technique of synchronous averaging with time-base stretching is used to decompose the raw sound signals into various noise source components. Acoustic directivity measurements are conducted for two operating conditions: free space and its usual working condition; each condition with two different configurations: free (unobstructed) inlet and distorted inlet by a flat plate covering part of inlet area. For both operating conditions, the rotary noise from the downstream fan dominates over that from the upstream fan for unobstructed inlet while the dominance by the downstream fan is reversed with distorted inlet. The total noise, total broadband noise and rotary noise radiated by the upstream fan all increase gradually with decreased plate-fan spacing. However, the rotary noise radiated by downstream fan is hardly affected by the obstacle plate, whatever the plate-fan spacing is. The flow straightener between the two fans contributes to considerable improvement of aerodynamic performance for free <b>inlet</b> <b>case,</b> while it has a limited role in remedying the severe inlet distortion when {{placed in front of}} the upstream fan. From the derived formula of acoustic spectrum from rotor blade forces resulting from the viscous and potential wakes of the upstream counter-rotating blade row impinging in the downstream one, two obvious mechanisms for interaction noise reduction can be easily found, which are either to increase the order of the Bessel function of the first kind, or to reduce the interaction fluctuating forces which can be realized by reducing the magnitude of the wake centerline velocity deficit or broaden the wake width. Several passive methods for reducing the aerodynamic interaction noise of a newly designed small axial-flow contra-rotating fan are explored. These methods include: (1) Perforated trailing edge for the upstream rotor and perforated leading edge for the downstream rotor; (2) Slitted trailing edge serration for the upstream rotor; (3) Chordwise perforated leading edge of the downstream rotor. Up to 5 – 7 dB overall noise reduction at all directions is achieved through the first two methods compared under the same aerodynamic output. Only 1. 3 dB of acoustic benefit is achieved by the third method, but it hardly causes any adverse impact on the aerodynamic performance. The findings are useful and helpful in designing a quiet coaxial fan (two/multiple-stage or contra-rotating) and adopting an appropriate approach for noise mitigation. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Engine Control Future {{aircraft}} turbine engines, both {{commercial and}} military, {{must be able}} to successfully accommodate expected increased levels of steady-state and dynamic engine-face distortion. Advanced tactical aircraft are likely to use thrust vectoring to enhance their maneuverability. As a result, the engines will see more extreme aircraft angles-of-attack and sideslip levels than are currently encountered with present-day aircraft. Also, the mixed-compression inlets needed for the High Speed Civil Transport will likely encounter disturbances similar to those seen by tactical aircraft, in addition to planar pulse, inlet buzz, and high distortion levels at low flight speed and off-design operation. The current approach of incorporating a sufficient component design stall margin to tolerate these increased levels of distortion would significantly reduce performance. The objective of the High Stability Engine Control (HISTEC) program is to design, develop, and flight demonstrate an advanced, high-stability, integrated engine-control system that uses measurement-based, real-time estimates of distortion to enhance engine stability. The resulting distortion-tolerant control reduces the required design stall margin, with a corresponding increase in performance and decrease in fuel burn. The HISTEC concept has been designed and developed, and the software implementing the concept has successfully accommodated time-varying distortion. The NASA Lewis Research Center is currently overseeing the development and validation of the hardware and software necessary to flight test the HISTEC concept. HISTEC is a contracted effort with Pratt & Whitney of West Palm Beach, Florida. The HISTEC approach includes two major systems: A Distortion Estimation System (DES) and Stability Management Control (SMC). DES is an aircraft-mounted, high-speed processor that estimates the amount and type of distortion present and its effect on the engine. It uses high-response pressure measurements at the engine face to calculate indicators of the type and extent of distortion in real time. From these indicators, DES determines the effects of distortion on the propulsion systems and the corresponding engine match point necessary to accommodate it. DES output consists of fan and compressor pressure ratio trim commands that are passed to the SMC. In addition, DES uses maneuver information, consisting of angle-of-attack and sideslip from the flight control, to anticipate high inlet distortion conditions. The SMC, which is contained in the engine-mounted, Improved Digital Electronic Engine Control (IDEEC), includes advanced control laws to directly control the fan and compressor transient operating line (pressure ratio). These advanced control laws, with a multivariable design, have the potential for higher bandwidth and the resulting more precise control of engine match. The ability to measure and assess the distortion effects in real time coupled with a high-response controller improves engine stability at high levels of distortion. The software algorithms implementing DES have been designed, developed, and demonstrated, and integration testing of the DES and SMC software has been completed. The results show that the HISTEC system will be able to sense inlet distortion, determine the effect on engine stability, and accommodate distortion by maintaining an adequate margin for engine surge. The Pratt &Whitney Comprehensive Engine Diagnostic Unit was chosen as the DES processor. An instrumented <b>inlet</b> <b>case</b> for sensing distortion was designed and fabricated.
