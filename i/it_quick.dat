In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one {{at the bottom of the}} formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically drilled in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.|$|E
