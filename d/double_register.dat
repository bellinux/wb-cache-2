DAFT is implemented in the LLVM compiler framework and evaluated using SPEC CPU 2000 and SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks on a commodity multicore system.

40|$|This article proposes an {{indirect}} method to validate existing estimates of immigrants’ stock from the Spanish municipal population register, which some believe might be over-counting immigrants who <b>double</b> <b>register</b> in different municipalities {{or fail to}} deregister when leaving the country. The proposed method uses two pieces of information: births to immigrants and their fertility rates. Data on births by parents’ origin come from the Spanish birth registry; fertility rates are estimated with data from the 2007 National Immigrant Survey. For female immigrants, the indirect estimate does not differ significantly from the count in the register, which can {{be taken as a}} validation of both sources. Among men, however, the population register counts 15 % more immigrants than the indirect estimate, and this difference is statistically significant. Western European men and women, and Romanian men are immigrant groups with substantial and statistically significant excess count in the population register compared to this article’s estimate. The opposite pattern, i. e. ratio of register-to-estimated number of immigrants lower than one, is found for Ecuadorian men and women and African men, suggesting that these groups might be under-counted in the population register, although the observed differentials are not statistically significantPeer reviewe...|$|E

What motivates artists {{to work on}} estates? Many times when working in ways that may be termed ‘socially engaged’ the artist has {{to work in a}} <b>double</b> <b>register,</b> making work that in meaningful ways benefits residents of the estate but also fulfils the demands of making, showing and producing ‘contemporary art’. How do artists negotiate this? Has ‘socially engaged practice’ managed to critique the art market or been co-opted by it? By working with these communities are artists just doing ‘social work on the cheap’? The panel will discuss the complexities of working in these ways in regard to their own work as practitioners and the wider territory of social engaged practitioners working in this area of arts production.

40|$|The {{features}} of High Temperature Air Combustion (HiTAC), i. e. high-efficiency combustion processes creating a uniform temperature distribution with low NOX and CO emissions, lend itself ideally for the combustion {{of all sorts}} of "difficult” fuels, ranging from low-calorific gases such as waste-gases, to heavy fuel-oils. However, to date most of the applications of HiTAC are for gaseous fuels and solid fuels, while little has been investigated on liquid fuel spray combustion in such combustion regimes. The objective of the research presented in this thesis is to identify and specify the important parameters for achieving good model performance and to understand how HiTAC conditions can be achieved for spray combustion. For this purpose numerical investigations have been performed on the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) methanol spray flame under a conventional condition, the DSHC (Delft Spray-in-Hot-Coflow) ethanol spray flames in both cold and hot co-flow conditions, and the heavy fuel oil spray combustion in a 9 MW boiler with flue gas recirculation using Stork <b>Double</b> <b>Register</b> Burner (DRB). The NIST methanol spray flame was numerically studied using an Eulerian- Lagrangian RANS model. With steady laminar flamelet model good agreements between experimental data and numerical results were observed. Then we extended the validated models and methods to the the simulation of DSHC flames, and also extended the limited co-flow conditions of experiment to a series of combinations of temperatures and O 2 concentrations for comparative study. The results showed that the low O 2 concentration {{plays a key role in}} the reduction of peak temperature and thus thermal NOX emissions. The flame profiles and SMD at various elevations showed good agreements with experimental data under the similar conditions. The analysis of spray trajectories has been discussed in order to perform proper model validation. Heavy fuel-oil combustion in a 9 MW boiler was numerically investigated with the Euler-Lagrange method as well. For Combustion, Eddy Dissipation model with a two-step global reaction mechanism was used instead. The results showed that a more uniform temperature distribution in the boiler can be achieved by diluting the primary and secondary air flow with flue gas recirculation. In this way the thermal NOX can be effectively reduced, while the remained fuel NOX formation is mainly dependent on the local combustion characteristics and the initial concentration of nitrogen-bound compounds. Besides, soot formation should be included in the simulation since it shows considerable influence on peak temperature and NOX formation. It is also concluded that the realization of HiTAC-like conditions in heavy fuel-oil combustion depends on the possibility to guarantee a sufficiently high level of flue gas recirculation flow into the evaporating spray jet...|$|E

40|$|Transient faults are {{emerging}} as a critical reliability concern for modern microproces-sors. Recently, microprocessors have been designed with lower voltage level,smaller and faster transistors enabled by improved fabrication technology. A combination of increased density of transistors on chip, reduced noise margin of each transistor, and voltage scaling are making hardware systems more susceptible to transient faults than ever. Both hardware or software solutions have been proposed for transient fault tolerance. The hardware approach typically adds redundant hardware modules to the system, thus requiring extra chip area as well as higher hardware design and verification cost. In ad-dition, the scope and mechanism of fault tolerance are hardwired at design time, which could be suboptimal with the change of deployment environment. Unlike hardware solu-tions, software-only techniques do not require any specialized hardware extensions and are more flexible with the scope of protection and the change of environment. However, even the best-performing software-only fault tolerance techniques incur significant performance cost.

What consequences have the double landuse had with regards of moose hunting on the two sides in the study? How does the two sides describe the actual problem of the current system and how could alternative system be formulated?   Historical state agendas in Sweden created a situation of two parties with claims to landuse on the same territory. This in turn created the double landuse in question of moose hunting above the cultivation limit in Västerbotten County.

This consultation presupposes for example some kind of connection and common ground between the two parts. This is an aspect that in many cases is not present or obvious. The question about the double nature of the problem has under a long time been subject to many legal proposals for change. Though in present time no new changes has been made.
