500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed to the whole world. He was completely cut off." [...] Jenner said [...] "I think every psychiatrist should be made to listen to those songs [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be part of the curriculum of every medical college along with those Van Gogh paintings like The Crows." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "I just don’t think a woman should be an umpire. There are certain things a woman shouldn’t be and an umpire is one of them. It’s a physical thing. God created women to be feminine. <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be competing with men.

[...] He also criticized the National Organization for Women, saying, [...] "They are a bunch of lesbians. Their focus has nothing to do with women's rights.

2500|$|In August 2010, scenes showing Phil and Rainie {{taking the}} drug crack cocaine {{prompted}} over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way – and at no point – glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent." [...] A former cocaine addict, Sarah Graham, agreed with the BBC, saying [...] "I think it's really important that a mainstream character like Phil Mitchell is doing this storyline. [...] I'm not surprised {{that there have been}} so many complaints about seeing this on one of our favourite soaps. The episode showed the brutal reality of addiction. [...] I can see that many people will be worried about children watching these scenes.

60|$|The {{forms of}} the table vary a little, {{according}} to the set one is in. In truly French houses, until quite lately, I believe, {{it was not the}} custom to change the knife,--the duty of which, by the way, is not great, the cookery requiring little more than the fork. In families that mingle more with strangers, both are changed, as with us. A great dinner is served very much as at home, so far as the mere courses are concerned, though I have seen the melons follow the soup. This I believe to be in good taste, though it is not common; and it struck me at first as being as much out of season as the old New England custom of eating the pudding before the meat. But the French give small dinners (small in name, though certainly very great in execution), in which the dishes are served singly or nearly so, the entertainment resembling those given by the Turks, and being liable to the same objection; for when there is but a single dish before one, and it is not known whether there is to be any more, it is an awkward thing to decline eating. Such dinners are generally of the best quality, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> never be given, except where there is sufficient intimacy to embolden the guest to say jam satis.|$|E
6000|$|I {{received}} from you {{a book by}} {{a man by the}} name of Anatole France. [...] Why should I disguise it? I have no use for Anatole. He writes very prettily, and then afterwards? Baron Marbot was a different pair of shoes. So likewise is the Baron de Vitrolles, whom I am now perusing with delight. His escape in 1814 is one of the best pages I remember anywhere to have read. But Marbot and Vitrolles are dead, and what has become of the living? It seems as if literature were coming to a stand. I am sure it is with me; and I am sure everybody will say so when they have the privilege of reading THE EBB TIDE. My dear man, the grimness of that story is not to be depicted in words. There are only four characters, to be sure, but they are such a troop of swine! And their behaviour is really so deeply beneath any possible standard, that on a retrospect I wonder I have been able to endure them myself until the yarn was finished. Well, there is always one thing; it will serve as a touchstone. If the admirers of Zola admire him for his pertinent ugliness and pessimism, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> admire this; but if, as I have long suspected, they neither admire nor understand the man's art, and only wallow in his rancidness like a hound in offal, then they will certainly be disappointed in THE EBB TIDE.

5000|$|Speaking of the controversy, Moore {{said that}} {{director}} Tom Ford {{expressed concern that}} the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed. However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, [...] "I don't think the movie's been de-gayed. I have to say {{that we live in a}} society that's pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can't have naked male buttocks. You can't have men kissing each other without it being considered adult content. So, in order to cut a trailer that can go into broad distribution in theaters, certain things had to be edited out. But it wasn't an intentional attempt to remove the gayness of the movie." [...] Conversely, Colin Firth said, [...] "marketing is deceptive. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> do that because there's nothing to sanitize. It's a beautiful story of love between two men and I see no point in hiding that. People should see it for what it is." [...] Harvey Weinstein would only say, when asked about marketing a gay romance, [...] "Brokeback Mountain did pretty well. Midnight Cowboy did pretty well. If you know how to market, you can market. There's an audience for it." [...] When pressed about the poster, Weinstein cut off the interview, saying, [...] "I'm good. You got enough. Thank you." [...] Peter Knegt of Indiewire suggested that The Weinstein Company [...] "de-gayed" [...] the trailer to better the film's chances of receiving Academy Award nominations.|$|R
6000|$|Some years ago, {{being in}} Scotland, I went {{with one of}} the most humane members of the humane medical profession, on a morning tour among some of the worst lodged {{inhabitants}} of the old town of Edinburgh. In the closes and wynds of that picturesque place--I am sorry to remind you what fast friends picturesqueness and typhus often are--we saw more poverty and sickness in an hour than many people would believe in a life. Our way lay from one to another of the most wretched dwellings, reeking with horrible odours; shut out from the sky, shut out from the air, mere pits and dens. In a room in one of these places, where there was an empty porridge-pot on the cold hearth, with a ragged woman and some ragged children crouching on the bare ground near it--where, I remember as I speak, that the very light, refracted from a high damp-stained and time- stained house-wall, came trembling in, as if the fever which had shaken everything else there had shaken even it--there lay, in an old egg-box which the mother had begged from a shop, a little feeble, wasted, wan, sick child. With his little wasted face, and his little hot, worn hands folded over his breast, and his little bright, attentive eyes, I can see him now, as I have seen him for several years, look in steadily at us. There he lay in his little frail box, which was not at all a bad emblem of the little body from which he was slowly parting--there he lay, quite quiet, quite patient, saying never a word. He seldom cried, the mother said; he seldom complained; [...] "he lay there, seemin' to woonder what it was a' aboot." [...] God knows, I thought, as I stood looking at him, he had his reasons for wondering--reasons for wondering how it could possibly come to be that he lay there, left alone, feeble and full of pain, when he ought to have been as bright and as brisk as the birds that never got near him--reasons for wondering how he came to be left there, a little decrepid old man pining to death, quite a thing of course, as if there were no crowds of healthy and happy children playing on the grass under the summer's sun within a stone's throw of him, as if there were no bright, moving sea on the other side of the great hill overhanging the city; as if there were no great clouds rushing over it; as if there were no life, and movement, and vigour anywhere in the world--nothing but stoppage and decay. There he lay looking at us, saying, in his silence, more pathetically than I have ever heard anything said by any orator in my life, [...] "Will you please to tell me what this means, strange man? and if you can give me any good reason why I should be so soon, so far advanced on my way to Him who said that children were to come into His presence and were not to be forbidden, but who scarcely meant, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> come by this hard road by which I am travelling; pray give that reason to me, for I seek it very earnestly and wonder about it very much;" [...] and to my mind he has been wondering about it ever since. Many a poor child, sick and neglected, I have seen since that time in this London; many a poor sick child I have seen most affectionately and kindly tended by poor people, in an unwholesome house and under untoward circumstances, wherein its recovery was quite impossible; but at all such times I have seen my poor little drooping friend in his egg-box, and he has always addressed his dumb speech to me, and I have always found him wondering what it meant, and why, in the name of a gracious God, such things should be! ...|$|R
