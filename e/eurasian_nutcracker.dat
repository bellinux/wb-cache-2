50|$|The spotted nutcracker, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>nutcracker,</b> or just nutcracker, (Nucifraga caryocatactes) is a {{passerine}} bird {{slightly larger}} than the Eurasian jay. It has a much larger bill and a slimmer looking head without any crest. The feathering over its body is predominantly a chocolate brown with distinct white spots and streaks. The wings and upper tail are virtually black with a greenish-blue gloss. It {{is one of three}} species of nutcracker. The large-spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga multipunctata), was formerly considered a subspecies of spotted. The other member of the genus, Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), occurs in western North America.|$|E

40|$|High {{latitude}} {{resident bird}} species provide an {{unique opportunity to}} investigate patterns of postglacial and barrier-mediated dispersal. In this study, multiple genetic markers were used to understand postglacial colonization by and contemporary barriers to gene flow in three corvids. Clark’s nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>nutcracker</b> (N. caryocatactes), and gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis) are year-round resident northern hemisphere passerines with ranges encompassing previously glaciated and unglaciated regions and potential barriers to dispersal (e. g. mountain ranges). Using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences, we found limited geographic genetic structure and one glacial refugium in nutcrackers, contrasting with seven distinct genetic groups and five refugia for gray jays. Nuclear microsatellite markers revealed additional and contrasting patterns of near-panmixia in nutcrackers and multiple hierarchical breaks in gray jays. Genetic patterns are explained by differences in natural history traits, specifically food preferences, for these species...|$|E
40|$|As an {{efficient}} seed-disperser, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>nutcrackers</b> (Nucifraga caryocatactes) generally consume and hoard mature, edible pine seeds for future use. In 2009, when the Arolla pine, Pinus. cembra, produced a mast-crop, we investigated cones discarded by nutcrackers. Most cones were only partly eaten and some mature seeds {{remained in the}} distal part. This was in contrast to years of lower seed production when nearly all seeds were harvested from the majority of cones. To determine whether nutcracker cone-discarding behaviour maximised intake rate, seed kernels and the aborted seeds rate were measured from the different cone parts. In 2009, seeds from cone-tops were on average 17...|$|R

50|$|There {{are a dozen}} couples of {{northern}} lapwing and eastern yellow wagtail, together with couples of meadow pipit, whinchat, red-backed shrike, bearded reedling, goshawk, spotted <b>nutcracker,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> wryneck, European honey buzzard, thrush nightingale, long-tailed tit, lesser spotted woodpecker, wood warbler, hawfinch, and Eurasian hobby. In the night time sedge warbler and reed warbler are regularly heard, while grasshopper warbler, river warbler, marsh warbler, and great reed warbler are reported now and then. Osprey are regularly seen fishing in the lake. Uncountable numbers of resting species are reported by the lake, including various swans, hawks, eagles, cormorants, and sparrows.|$|R
40|$|Open accessThe <b>Eurasian</b> or spotted <b>nutcracker</b> (Nucifraga caryocatactes) is a {{widespread}} resident corvid found throughout the Palearctic fromCentral Europe to Japan. Characterized by periodic bouts of irruptive dispersal in search of Pinus seed crops, this species has potential for high levels of gene flow across its range. Previous analysis of 11 individuals did not find significant range-wide population genetic structure. We investigated population structure using 924 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA control region sequence data from 62 individuals from 12 populations distributed throughout the nutcracker’s range. We complemented this analysis by incorporating additional genetic data frompreviously published sequences. High levels of genetic diversity and limited population genetic structure were detected suggesting that potential barriers to dispersal do not restrict gene flow in nutcrackers. Ye...|$|R
