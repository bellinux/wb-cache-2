40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} reconstruction of planar domains from their moments. Specifically, we consider domains with boundary which can be represented by a union of {{a finite number of}} pieces whose graphs are solutions of a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients. This includes domains with piecewise-algebraic and, in particular, piecewise-polynomial boundaries. Our approach is based on the one-dimensional reconstruction method of [5] and a kind of “separation of variables ” which reduces the planar problem to two one-dimensional problems, one of them parametric. Several explicit examples of reconstruction are given. Another main topic of the paper concerns “invisible sets ” for various types of <b>incomplete</b> <b>moment</b> measurements. We suggest a certain point of view which stresses remarkable similarity between several apparently unrelated problems. In particular, we discuss zero quadrature domains (invisible for harmonic polynomials), invisibility for powers of a given polynomial, and invisibility for complex moments (Wermer’s theorem and further developments). The common property we would like to stress is a “rigidity ” and symmetry of the invisible objects. 1...|$|E
