50|$|The {{design of}} GD250N {{focus on a}} rigid body frame, power-to-weight ratio and futuristic styling. To save weight, trellis frame design is {{used to make a}} rigid and {{lightweight}} structure. Fibre-reinforced plastic polymer and aluminum are mostly used to build this lightweight motorcycle. Fibre-reinforced plastic is mostly used in making the <b>frame</b> <b>cover</b> panel and the condom tank (Fibre-reinforced plastic fuel tank inside and covered by a plastic panel). The design is considered unique because the condom tank is made from a tough, lightweight, fibre-reinforced plastic material which ensure its safety equivalent with a heavy metal tank. The swing arm is also made from aluminum to save weight.|$|E
50|$|The {{impressive}} pigeon loft of 7 {{meters in}} diameter and about 10 meters high was built facing the castle and was the mark of Lordship. The pigeon loft had several functions: to provide meat and to produce fertilizer for the vineyard. The ground level was designed for poultry. The dovecote was situated on the first floor. Nest boxes were accessible with a ladder {{but we do not}} know the number because the interior has been modified over the years. The regulation of the number of nests was strict and could not be more than 5 acre per nest. The pigeon loft bears a stone above the front door, but we do not know its meaning. The <b>frame,</b> <b>cover</b> and upper frieze were completely restored in 2009.|$|E
50|$|For {{the mercury}} battery PX 13 (= PX 625 = MR 9) {{of the light}} meter, a place was found inside the camera housing. The film rewind knob of the {{engineering}} model was exchanged for a rewind crank, and a hot shoe was added for mounting an electronic flash at the base plate. Placing the hot shoe {{on top of the}} camera was not feasible because of the underlying exposure meter andtransmission gear. Mounting the hot shoe at the <b>frame</b> <b>cover</b> would likely cause damage when using one of the heavy flash lights of that time. Therefore, for a natural lighting shade, the camera had to be turned upside down, when using a flash, to get the light source above the lens. The projected name for the camera was at first to be the Rollei Privat, which even was the engraving on the final draft in March 1966. But in April 1966, when Peesel decided to designate all Rollei cameras according to the applied film format, the designation became Rollei 35.|$|E

40|$|A two phase program {{encompassing}} {{the redesign}} and fabrication of a solar collector which {{is low in}} cost and aesthetically appealing is described. Phase one work reviewed the current collector design and developed a low-cost design based on specific design/performance/cost requirements. Throughout this phase selected collector component materials were evaluated by testing and by considering cost, installation, maintainability and durability. The resultant collector design was composed of an absorber plate, insulation, <b>frame,</b> <b>cover,</b> desiccant and sealant. In Phase two, three collector prototypes were fabricated and evaluated for both nonthermal and thermal characteristics. Tests included static load tests of covers, burst pressure tests of absorber plates, and tests for optical characteristics of selective absorber plate coatings. The three prototype collectors were shipped to Marshall Space Flight Center for use in their solar heating and cooling test facility...|$|E

The Census Bureau is currently conducting evaluations to support the goal of using a MAF-based frame to replace the current multiple frames for the 2010 Demographic Survey Redesign. The current frames include a unit frame, a group quarters (GQ) frame, a permit frame, and an area frame. The unit frame and the GQ <b>frame</b> <b>cover</b> addresses of housing units and group quarters that existed {{during the time of}} Census 2000 in blocks that had a high percent complete addresses, i. e., addresses that had a house number, a street name, and a zip code, and had building permit coverage. The permit frame obtains addresses from building permit offices (BPOs) to capture new construction after Census 2000 in blocks that had building permit coverage. For the remaining universe that is primarily in rural areas, an area frame approach is used. The current area frame covers approximately 12 % of the addresses in the U. S. The field operations used to collect addresses for the permit frame and the area frame are expensive. The MAF is an inventory of addresses for all known living quarters in the United States and Puerto Rico and is maintained by the Census Bureau. The MAF is updated by operations related to decennial censuses, by the Delivery Sequence File (DSF) from the United States Postal Service every six months, and also b...|$|E
