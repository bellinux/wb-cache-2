5|$|Species of Oryzomys are {{medium-sized}} rats with long, coarse fur. The upperparts are gray to reddish and the underparts {{white to}} buff. The animals have broad feet with reduced or absent ungual tufts of <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> the claws and, {{in at least}} some species, with webbing between the toes. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is broad and the braincase is high. Both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have 56chromosomes, lack a gall bladder, and have a complex penis (as is characteristic of the Sigmodontinae) with some traits that are rare among oryzomyines; these characteristics are unknown in the other species of this genus.|$|E
5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> its ears and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E

5|$|This sturdily built {{antelope}} has {{a yellow}} to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse sebaceous glands {{present on the}} coat make the coat greasy {{and give it a}} strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While R. r. bohor appears yellowish gray, R. r. wardi is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed—such as a dark stripe on the front of each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. However, R. r. redunca lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round bare spot below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of inguinal glands and vestigial foot glands, and four nipples. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. The tracks of the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the southern reedbuck.|$|E
25|$|If left untended, {{the hair}} on a PWD will keep growing indefinitely. Problems {{associated}} with this include the <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> the eyes growing so long as to impede vision, and matting of the body hair, which can cause skin irritations. For these reasons, PWDs must be trimmed about every two months and the coat brushed every other day.|$|E

25|$|This hairless {{species of}} bats {{that belong to}} family Molossidae has {{remarking}} features that makes them unique compared to other bat species. One of the distinguishable feature is the tail size which is longer than their hind limb. Its remarking dark grey skin which is devoid of hair but may have some fine patches of <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> the throat and under hind foot. They scent mark their territories by secretion from pores known as secretory glands located {{at the tip of}} the neck. Sometimes these secretory glands have sub maxillary pouches located either inside the ears or beneath the neck region used for 'brooding ' and 'nursing' purposes. They are the only species of bats that uses all four limbs to accomplish full range of movement, it is done so by acquiring pouches with tiny folds located on either side of the body. Amongst other bat species, hairless bat possess a broad face, robust jaw, wide wings and protruding tail thus having an overall thick body structure. Their first toe bears nails rather than claws which is opposable against its hind toes. The dental formula is 1/1, 1/1, 1/2, 3/2 consisting of small incisors and a diastema forms between upper and lower incisors. They use echolocation to catch their preys and use alarm calls to their roosting members for any approach of danger.|$|E
25|$|Those early {{guardian}} {{dogs were}} not the distinct breed we know today. Rather, the Estrela developed {{over a period of}} hundreds of years. Shepherds would have chosen to breed the dogs that had the characteristics necessary to survive in their mountain environment and to do their job: large size, strength, endurance, agility, a deep chest, ability to tolerate a marginal diet, the set of the legs, a powerful mouth, a tuft of <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> the neck, an easy, jog-like gait, a warm coat, and a watchful, mistrustful, yet loyal temperament. Since the region was isolated, there was little breeding with non-native dogs, leading to the purity of the breed.Life changed little for the people and dogs of the region, even into the 20th century. The isolation of the region meant the breed was relatively unknown outside it until the early 1900s, and even then, they were mostly ignored in early dog shows. The Portuguese admired foreign breeds much more than their own. Shepherds often castrated their dogs to prevent them from leaving their flocks to mate. These factors had a negative effect on the Estrela. So from 1908 to 1919, special shows called concursos were held to promote and preserve the Estrela breed in the region. During this period there was some attempt at a registry (of which there is no surviving record). Special livestock guardian working trials were included in these shows. The trial consisted of an owner/shepherd bringing his dog into a large field with many flocks of sheep. The dog was observed by judges for its reactions coming into the field and as the shepherd was ordered to move the flock, which inevitably produced stragglers. The dog was expected to move from his spot of guarding to bring the stragglers back, and then assume a leadership position {{at the head of the}} flock.|$|E

500|$|Oryzomys couesi, {{also known}} as Coues' rice rat, is a semiaquatic rodent in the family Cricetidae {{occurring}} from southernmost Texas through Mexico and Central America into northwestern Colombia. It is usually found in wet habitats, such as marshes, but also lives in drier forests and shrublands. Weighing about , O.couesi is a medium-sized to large rat. The coarse fur is buff to reddish above and white to [...] below. The hindfeet show some specializations for life in the water, such as reduced ungual tufts of <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> the digits. It has 56chromosomes. There is much geographic variation in size, proportions, color, and skull features. Oryzomys couesi is active during the night and builds nests of vegetation that are suspended among reeds about [...] above the ground. It is an excellent swimmer and dives well, but can also climb in vegetation. An omnivore, it eats both plant and animal food, including seeds and insects. It breeds throughout the year; females give birth to about four young after a pregnancy of 21 to 28days. The species may be infected by several different parasites and by two hantaviruses.|$|E

500|$|Females {{have two}} pairs of mammary glands (four nipples), but only one pair is functional. [...] The {{anterior}} pair (closest to the head) {{are very close to}} the axillae (armpit). [...] Furless scent glands are present on both males and females. [...] Both sexes have small, dark antebrachial (forearm) glands measuring 1cm long and located on the inner surface of the forearm nearly [...] above the wrist joint. [...] (This trait is shared between the Lemur and Hapalemur genera.) The gland is soft and compressible, bears fine dermal ridges (like fingerprints), and is connected to the palm by a fine, 2mm–high, hairless strip. [...] However, only the male has a horny spur that overlays this scent gland. [...] The spur develops with age through the accumulation of secretions from an underlying gland that may connect through the skin through as many as a thousand minuscule [...] ducts. The males also have brachial (arm) glands on the axillary surface of their shoulders (near the armpit). The brachial gland is larger than the antebrachial gland, covered in short <b>hair</b> <b>around</b> the periphery, and has a naked crescent-shaped orifice near the center.
