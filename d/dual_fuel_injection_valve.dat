40|$|Free {{flight tests}} {{were carried out}} to show whether the {{longitudinal}} oscillations of a standard S. E. 5 A airplane are noticeably affected if its longitudinal moment of inertia is increased. These oscillations were taken {{by means of a}} self-recording instrument, the airplane having first its ordinary moment of inertia and then one increased by 14 percent. The period of oscillation was slightly longer after the increase of the moment of inertia, but the damping was not affected. Presented here are test results from an investigation to determine the relative performance of a single-cylinder, high-speed, compression-ignition engine when using <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> nozzles with different numbers, sizes, and directions of round orifices. A spring loaded, automatic <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> was used.

A series of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> nozzles with different arrangements of round orifices were tested, starting with orifices so small that impingement on the combustion chamber walls was impossible and increasing beyond the start of impingement. a :A table and curves are presented showing the performance of the engine with different nozzles.

The results show that pressure wave phenomena occur between the high-pressure reservoir and the discharge orifice, but that these pressure waves can be controlled so as to be advantageous to the <b>injection</b> of the <b>fuel.</b> The results also give data applicable to the design of such an injection system for a high-speed compression-ignition engine...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the advantages of hydrogen as a fuel for Otto Cycle engines due to high thermal efficiency and low exhaust pollutant levels. Characteristic of hydrogen engine operation using premixed intake charge formation {{is a problem of}} pre-ignition resulting in an intake manifold “backfire”. Additional problems include high NOx production when using certain equivalence ratios and power output degradation due to low fuel energy/volume density. Techniques for direct and port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> are discussed as means for overcoming these problems. Emphasis is placed on the need for total engine control, integrating control of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> ignition timing, intake air throttling, and vehicle subsystems within a central electronic unit.

40|$|International audienceUsually niobium {{is added}} in {{ferritic}} stainless steels to avoid chromium carbides precipitation {{and then to}} improve corrosion resistance and to avoid embrittlemet. This study shows that a low Nb stabilization makes recrystallization nucleation much faster and prevents incomplete recrystallization. A qualitative interpretation, based on interaction with precipitates, is proposed and explains the main features of the softening kinetics {{as well as the}} microstructures obtained. Above a specific magnetizing frequency, the deformed state led to smaller losses than the recrystallized state. These results are believed to be attributed to a grain size effect. This leads to soft magnetic properties that makes 17 %CrNb ferritic stainless steels a very interesting solution for the market of electromagnetic injection.

40|$|The {{object of}} this report is to present the results of tests {{performed}} by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics {{to determine the effect}} on engine performance of directing the flow of the inlet air to a 5 -inch by 7 -inch cylinder, solid injection, compression ignition engine, After a few preliminary tests, comparative runs were made at a speed of 1500 r. p. m. with and without directed air flow. It was found that directing the flow of the inlet air toward the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> gave steadier engine operation, and an appreciable increase in power, and decreased fuel consumption. The results indicate the possibility of improving the performance of a given type of combustion chamber without changing its shape and with no change in valve timing.

40|$|The use of {{electronic}} systems in automotive applications {{is characterized by}} special requirements concerning surrounding conditions, e. g. near the engine or breaks, and reliability demands. More and more piezoceramic sensors and actuators become common in such systems.

40|$|The world {{natural gas}} reserve is plentiful. Instead of using {{gasoline}} to power ground vehicles, usage of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) {{can improve the}} environment and reduce energy cost. However, most engines that runs on CNG are converted from gasoline based engine. Hence, the engines are not optimized for CNG. Other problems of converted engines are loss of power due to slower burn rate of CNG and gas displacement effect of CNG, hotter exhaust gas which degrade engine’s reliability, low mileage per tank and higher NOx. Since, converted engines are gasoline base engine, a <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> engine system can be developed to reduce the stated problems. Are activity controlled approach was incorporated where both gasoline and CNG are mixed before going into the combustion chamber. With this technique, when a blend of high reactive 35 % gasoline and 65 % CNG was used, the engine had its engine performance such torque, power and efﬁciency increasing by 10 %. Also, the engine emissions such as hydrocarbon was reduced by 50 % and carbon monoxide emission was reduced by 75 % and NOx emission was reduced by 50 % when compared with CNG baseline. Combustion of spark ignition engines converted to bi-fuel CNG is unstable and proper air and fuel mixing strategy is a concern here...|$|R

40|$|Generator {{capacities}} {{on fisheries}} training vessels are designed according to demand to utilize deck machinery for fishing training, such as trawling and tuna longlining. The designed generator capacity was reviewed and measures for retionalized combustion were tested on T/V Keiten-maru. Analysis of the actually demanded power recorded every one {{hour for the}} last ten years proved that the average diversity factor was 35 % and demand factor 66 %. The load on the generator engine did not exceed 70 % of the designed maximum even when all the deck facilities were run. While independent running of the generator engine during normal cruise, load did not exceed 60 % and most frequently appeared around 40 %. The load was much lower when anchored. The designed diversity and demand factors were both assessed to have been set exceedingly. The observed irregular abrasion on pistons, piston rings and cylinderliners, were attributed to such troubles as jam of combustion residue and converse flow of exhaust gas toward intake due to inappropriate combustion induced by low-load running. In order to reset the maximum capacity of the generator engine at 80 % to 90 % of the initially designed capacity the following measures were tested. (1) delayed timing of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> by adjustment of fuel cams, (2) reduced diameter of nozzle holes of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valves,</b> (3) replacement of the turbine nozzles of the turbo charger by low-load type on ones, and (4) reduced flow angle for blower blades of the turbo charger (the last two were tested simultaneously) The tested measures were concluded to be effective for improvement of low-load combustion. ...|$|R
