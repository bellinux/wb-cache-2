500|$|In {{some states}} joint {{physical}} custody creates a presumption of equal shared parenting, however in most states, {{joint physical custody}} creates an obligation to provide each of the parents with [...] "significant periods" [...] of physical custody so as to assure the child of [...] "frequent and continuing contact" [...] with both parents. For example, states such as Alabama, California, and Texas do not necessarily require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time, whereas states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Louisiana do require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time where feasible. Courts generally have not clearly defined what [...] "significant periods" [...] and [...] "frequent and continuous contact" [...] mean, which requires parents to litigate to <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> some states, however, courts have provided a clear definition, for instance, in Nevada, the Supreme Court has defined joint physical custody as an arrangement where each parent has at least 40% of the custodial time on a yearly basis.|$|E
500|$|Rachel, {{along with}} Kurt, {{plans to attend}} a {{performing}} arts school in New York City after graduation. School counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) suggests they consider The New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), a highly desirable school. The two attend an Ohio [...] "mixer" [...] for potential applicants, {{only to discover that}} their competition is very much like them, and quite talented. Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical, since she believes herself to be a shoo-in for the lead role, Maria, and she needs the experience for her NYADA application. However, Mercedes also auditions for Maria, and the directors, unable to decide {{between the two of them}} even after head-to-head callbacks, decide to double-cast the role, giving Rachel and Mercedes each a week of the two-week run. Mercedes, believing she did better in the callbacks, refuses to accept the double-casting and withdraws from the show, leaving Rachel to be Maria. She and Finn decide to have sex in the episode [...] "The First Time". In the episode [...] "Mash Off", Rachel abruptly withdraws from the race for senior class president in favor of Kurt after she realizes he might not get into NYADA with her if he doesn't win. She goes even further in the next episode, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", when she stuffs an election ballot box in Kurt's favor to keep him from losing. He loses anyway, and she confesses: she is suspended from school for a week and forbidden to compete in Sectionals with New Directions, though the glee club wins without her. At the end of the episode [...] "Yes/No", Finn asks her to marry him, and after hesitating for several days, she accepts. Their parents <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Heart", and hope to discourage the pair, but their plans backfire and the wedding date is moved up to May. Even that date seems too distant, so Rachel and Finn later decide to marry after Regionals in [...] "On My Way".|$|E

2500|$|The {{reference}} in both to Captains is very important. This was the English term for those families who enjoyed effectively total sovereignty within their territories, {{even if these}} might not be extensive. In describing the Gaelic Captains {{in the beginning of}} the first document, the officials report that [...] "... some callyth themselffes Kynges, some Kynges Peyres, in their langage, some Prynceis (Flatha), some Dukes, some Archedukes... and obeyeth to no other temperall person... and hath imperiall jurysdyction in his rome ..." [...] Gaelic Ireland is described as a patchwork of various overkingdoms, petty kingdoms, and other territories with limited to no national overlordship, although some might be practised at the provincial level, for example by the O'Neills in the case of Ulster. The Bissetts and these other [...] "English" [...] families were those who had become like the Gaelic Irish, adopting their concepts of sovereignty, manners and styles. This was sometimes referred to as becoming more Irish than the Irish themselves, although the extent of Gaelicization varied by family. Some families were later brought back, and others not. We never get to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the case of the Bissetts because they have apparently gone under by the time the Kingdom of Ireland is proclaimed and Henry begins receiving the submission of the princes.|$|E
2500|$|In 823, {{tensions}} {{had appeared}} in Harald's relations with his co-rulers. Louis was asked to mediate. The Royal Annals report [...] "Also Heriold came from Nordmannia, asking for help against the sons of Godofrid, who threatened to drive {{him out of his}} country. To explore this matter more thoroughly Counts Theothari and Hruodmund were sent to the sons of Godofrid. Traveling ahead of Heriold they carefully studied the dispute with the sons of Godofrid as well as the condition of the whole kingdom of the Norsemen and informed the emperor of all they could <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> these lands. They returned with archbishop Ebo of Rheims, who had gone to preach {{in the land of the}} Danes on the counsel of the emperor and with the approval of the Roman pontiff and had baptized many converts to the faith during the previous summer." [...] Coupland notes that the entry reveals two things. First that [...] "the political situation in Denmark remained extremely tense" [...] and second that Louis continued to interfere in Danish affairs. The motivation behind his interest in the country is not stated in primary sources. The book [...] "An Introduction to the Viking History of Western Europe, Viking Antiquities in Great Britain and Ireland" [...] (1940) by Haakon Shetelig, presented the theory that Louis was laying the groundwork for a [...] "military invasion and occupation of Denmark". While the theory has its merits, Coupland notes that it ignores its context. The [...] "neighbouring Slav lands" [...] of Francia were in the process of becoming dependent territories, their rulers subordinating themselves to Louis. The emperor may have envisioned Denmark as another protectorate of Francia.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
