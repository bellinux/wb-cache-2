40|$|Human {{influence}} on the environment differs in terms of distribution and intensity, thus producing a gradient of landscape modifications that translates into different landscape structures. Within this variety of landscapes, <b>fringe</b> <b>areas</b> represent complex spaces where dynamic processes and instable conditions can be observed. In this research Kernel Density Estimation, multivariate spatial analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined to model and characterise landscape gradients, and to analyse the structural features of <b>fringe</b> <b>areas.</b> This methodology was applied to a rural area of central Italy, using density indicators associated with urbanisation, agriculture, and natural elements considered to be key components for the identification of landscape gradients. The results highlight not only specific "pillar" landscapes, which are dominated by said components, but also transitional landscapes, where the most relevant forms of interaction between land uses were identified. Characterisation of landscape structures along the gradient illustrated different trends in patch density, shape complexity and landscape diversity, demonstrating greater variability in <b>fringe</b> <b>areas</b> than in pillar landscapes. PCA revealed a partial overlap between the main structural characteristics of the agro-forestry matrix and the medium intensity agricultural landscapes, whereas urban fringes and semi-natural fringes were clearly separated. The discovery of the continuous landscape gradients {{and an understanding of}} the gamut of landscape types nested along them is crucial in allowing for more effective land-use planning in which also <b>fringe</b> <b>areas</b> become a relevant part of the process...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{metropolitan}} {{cities of}} Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane {{plays an important}} role in the economy of the Gauteng province in South Africa. The region constitutes to 22. 4 percent of the total population of South Africa and has a strong presence and contributes in areas of manufacturing sector, financial and business services, retail and wholesale trade, etc. The rapid urban population, increase in the informal settlements and socio-economic opportunities has resulted to considerable urban sprawl in and around the urban <b>fringe</b> <b>areas</b> of these metropolitan cities. The urban <b>fringe</b> <b>areas</b> of these metros often come under the influence of rapid urbanization process and pressures. Coupled with the economical and potential land dynamics and lack of priority of spatial development guidelines, these areas attract rapid and haphazard development from communities and developers. Research Design/ Methodology: This research is based on a qualitative approach through a comprehensive literature review that included content analysis of key documents on housing sector such as Integrated Development Plans (IDPs), Municipal Annual Reports, Growth Development Strategies, and among other sectoral documents on housing sector. Some of the key priority issues considered in the housing sector included: eradication of housing backlogs, spatial restructuring of housing, provision of choice in terms of location, tenure and housing typology. Findings: The current paper discusses the approaches of metropolitan housing development processes in three metropolitan cities of South Africa from Gauteng region, namely: Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane. The paper discuss the existing housing sectoral scenario along with the <b>fringe</b> <b>areas</b> in three cities with focus on: formal and informal settlements, housing segregation and the backlogs, current institutional arrangements, role of public private participation, and scope for alternate mechanisms. The paper concludes in discussion on sustainable development options for housing development in urban <b>fringe</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
