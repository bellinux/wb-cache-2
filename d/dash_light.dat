50|$|In 1994, {{changes were}} {{introduced}} to the 200 Coupé range, most obviously with a chrome grille being added to bring in line {{with the rest of the}} 200 series. Cost saving changes were also seen, such as a reduction in the amount of leather used, ignition barrel light removed and <b>dash</b> <b>light</b> dimming deleted. The alarm system received several changes to keep up with current security requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Skip shift eliminators are {{produced}} for quick and simple DIY installation {{to circumvent the}} 'Computer-Aided Gear Selection' GM uses to implement the shift blocking feature. These are commercially available for about $20-40, or {{can be made with}} a little soldering for about $7. [...] Notably, neither workaround will eliminate the [...] "1-4 skip shift" [...] <b>dash</b> <b>light,</b> which will continue to operate regardless. ECU tuning is required to eliminate the dash lights function.|$|E
50|$|Optional extras were a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system. The {{upholstery}} was {{leather cloth}} with leather seating. The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype; this {{also has a}} smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures, but is not seen on any production 9’s. Instruments consisted of a speedometer, clock, oil gauge and ammeter. After 1931 a petrol gauge was added, prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply. Dash switches consisted of, a <b>dash</b> <b>light,</b> interior light, ignition, and a starter button, also choke and fast running control. External lights switching, battery charge rate, and ignition timing were all at {{the centre of the}} steering wheel.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dash</b> <b>Lights</b> - These are {{forward-facing}} lights, like grille lights, but {{mounted on}} the dashboard of the emergency vehicle. They are more often found on covert vehicles, but may be found on some marked vehicles which are trying to increase visibility. In order to avoid dazzling the driver, they are normally fitted with 'shields' around the light which stop the light reflecting into the cab.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1840s {{he began}} to paint {{historical}} subjects, initially inspired by the renewed interest in history painting prompted by the New Palace of Westminster cartoon competition for the designs of frescoes on the new building in 1843. In this he submitted a picture of Boadicea Harranguing the Iceni which won a premium of £200 in 1843. He was aided by the knowledge of mural technique he had acquired by working for a panorama painter. Despite the prize, the picture was criticised by one reviewer because the [...] "violence of the action and <b>dashing</b> <b>lights</b> carry us away like the speech of a mob orator." ...|$|R
50|$|Standard trim meant black {{front window}} frame, black wire wheels (color optional), black horn (chrome-plated optional), single tail light (2nd optional), painted <b>dash,</b> {{position}} <b>lights</b> integrated {{in the head}} lamps (Deluxe cowl lamps optional), and less expensive interiors.|$|R

50|$|The 2014 and 2015 models {{had a major}} revamp of {{interior}} comfort. The passenger seat is higher, the sound system has been upgraded, the rear bench seats are higher and the console is re-positioned for the person riding in the center. The manual transmission models were also upgraded to a six-speed transmission instead of the previous generation's five-speed transmission. Engines during these year models do have an issue with oil consumption, along with numerous other automotive manufactures at the time. Subaru has a lawsuit due to it; some experience over 1.5 quarts of oil consumed between change intervals with low-level <b>dash</b> <b>lights</b> coming on. Some speculation on this {{is the use of}} different style piston rings on the engine style change and synthetic oil.|$|R
50|$|The 1964 Imperials {{were the}} first {{designed}} entirely by Mr. Engel. Predictably, they bore a strong resemblance to the Lincoln Continental. The dashboards seemed more conventional because the squared-off steering wheel and electroluminescent <b>dash</b> <b>lighting</b> were gone. However, there remained the ribbon-style speedometer. A split grille returned after one year's absence, inspired by the 1955 model's appearance, and the faux spare tire bulge atop the trunk lid {{gave way to a}} squared-off protrusion at the rear, carrying downward to the rear bumper. A large boss in the center of it was actually the fuel filler door, covered with a large Imperial Eagle. Horizontal, spear shaped housings hold a taillight and back-up light. Heat and defrost, always a popular option, were now standard.|$|R
5000|$|... xB RS 4.0 only {{available}} in a Torched Penny called Maziora, a line of polarized paints made by Japan’s Nippon Paint Co. is a(polarized goldish-brown) with 2500 units produced. The Release Series 4.0 is painted in a 3-part Maziora Torched Penny paint, which is a color-shifting finish that changes depending on the viewing angle and/or how light plays off the car's surface. In this case, the colors morph into shades of brown, bronze, and gold. In addition to the deluxe paint, the RS 4.0 received a rear spoiler, Modellista grille, and rear bumper protector and everything is color-keyed. Inside, the floor mats are embroidered reading [...] "Release Series". It also got multicolor <b>dash</b> <b>lighting,</b> a new shift knob and a numbered plaque xxxx/2500.|$|R

The vertical axis on the [...] "utility" [...] graphs is utility units based on the application utility and weightings; on the [...] "time" [...] graphs it is seconds, and on the [...] "energy" [...] graphs it is once again in terms of power averaged over the desired runtime of 600 [*]seconds. The performance is sampled across average power limits at every two Watts from 5 to 25 [*]W.|$|R
50|$|One Saab innovation, {{inspired}} by the company's roots in aeronautics, was the 'Black Panel' feature (available on S or SE models only), which extinguished most instrument panel lights {{at the touch of}} a button on the SID, to eliminate distraction from <b>dash</b> <b>lights</b> during night driving. While active, this feature permitted darkened instruments to re-illuminate themselves when they required driver attention - if say, the engine speed increased alarmingly or if the fuel level should drop below 15 L. This feature was later renamed 'Night Panel' in Saab 9-3 and Saab 9-5 models. In the later Night Panel version, the speedometer is only illuminated up to the 87 mph/140 km/h mark. The remainder of the scale will only be illuminated if the speed of the car exceeds 84 mph/135 km/h.|$|R

50|$|Dashboard and {{interior}} were all Packard styled. Some former President features like the rear folding seat armrest and faired in door armrests were {{reserved for the}} Clippers, {{with the addition of}} door mounted ashtrays, thick pile carpeting, and exclusive Packard style cloth/vinyl fabrics. Other unique features included under <b>dash</b> courtesy <b>lights,</b> fully padded <b>dash</b> top (that unfortunately didn't like the sun), padded sun visors, and gold plated horn ring.|$|R
50|$|Debuted on {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Lexus LS, the next-generation Pre-Crash System (Pre-Collision in the U.S.) offers forward and rear protection. The Frontal Pre-Crash system will activate a warning buzzer and red <b>dash</b> <b>lights</b> to alert the driver if a potential hazard is detected in the vehicle's path. If the system detects a potential collision, the system will adjust steering and braking responsiveness. If a collision is determined to be unavoidable, the seatbelt pretensioners will activate, and the brakes will automatically engage to slow the vehicle. The Rear Pre-Crash system, the first active rear collision safety feature in an automobile, utilizes trunk-mounted obstacle detection and warning systems; if a rear collision is deemed unavoidable, sensor-equipped Pre-Crash Intelligent Headrests in the front seats will adjust position upwards up to 25 mm and forwards up to 60 mm to cradle the head during impact, reducing whiplash. The rear Pre-Crash system in the U.S. market waited for FCC regulatory approval. For 2010, the LS hybrid further incorporated an all-TFT instrument panel display, which featured {{the addition of a}} night vision capability with pedestrian detection.|$|R

[...] "Little wonder that we are smitten with the Sword of God when Rabbis shelter Christians because they chance to be of their house, and when warriors bear false witness concerning them because they chance to be fair. For my part I say that she is guilty, and has hidden the man away in some secret place. Otherwise why did she <b>dash</b> the <b>light</b> from the soldier's hand?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{light blue}} back {{lighting}} {{introduced in the}} third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC & SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8 Speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. version received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States. For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors {{as well as a}} rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats. The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus ski racks, under <b>dash</b> <b>lights,</b> headrest covers, a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth generation (1994-97) Honda Accord. It also shares many suspension components with the 5th generation Prelude's that are not equipped ATTS system.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{flashback}} to the Phantom Zone, the young Kara notices a computer console in her <b>dash</b> <b>lighting</b> {{up with the}} three dots of Brainaic, before her pod begins towing the prison ship. In present day, Alex entices Kara {{to return to the}} DEO, but Kara refuses because of Hank [...] "killing" [...] Astra. At CatCo, Cat calls everyone in for a conference call. Siobhan presents a package that Cat should see personally, but Cat wants it open for all to see. James opens it to find a letter and thumb drive. An unimpressed Cat tells Siobhan to microwave the drive. At the DEO, Alex and Hank spar and debate over whether Kara should know the truth; Alex's actions cause Hank to become J'onn, who feels that the DEO is better off without Kara. Back at CatCo, the monitors and other electronic devices start to go haywire; a hacker broadcasts onto the monitors, telling Cat that she ignored what was on the drive and warning that she will bring chaos to National City. This happens immediately as the hacker disrupts the traffic signals. Kara, as Supergirl, arrives to help, while Cat tells James to get all personnel on this latest cyber attack.|$|R

6000|$|Let it be {{admitted}} that [...] "In Memoriam" [...] has certain lapses {{in all that}} meed of melodious tears; that there are trivialities which might deserve (here is an example) [...] "to line a box," [...] or to curl some maiden's locks, that there are weaknesses of thought, that the poet now speaks {{of himself as a}} linnet, singing [...] "because it must," [...] now dares to approach questions insoluble, and again declines their solution. What is all this but the changeful mood of grief?

50|$|Because the Tundra's Vehicle Stability Control {{system is}} {{disabled}} when the vehicle's 4x4 system is engaged Consumer Reports has questioned the Tundra's Top Safety Pick award. Toyota's response is the Tundra does not feature a center differential which {{would become a}} weak point in the drivetrain. However the stability control system remains operational at times when the truck is in 4x2 mode though many drivers will select the 4x4 mode in slippery conditions. As of the 2010 model year this has been corrected. Electronic stability control functions in 4x4hi and is disengaged in 4x4lo. This is verified by the updated owners manual, visor instructions, and road tests in snow and ice in 4x4hi. When understeer or oversteer occurs in 4x4hi a beeping noise is emitted, and the <b>dash</b> indicator <b>lights</b> up yellow indicating that VSC is activated, braking individual wheels to match driver input at the steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the name changed to 402 [...] "City of Winnipeg" [...] Transport and Training Sqn. with the CC/CT-142 de Havilland Canada Dash 8 {{used to provide}} light {{transport}} and training for the Canadian Forces Air Navigation School (CFANS). In 2000, the two CC-142 <b>Dash</b> 8 <b>light</b> transport aircraft were retired and sold into {{the private sector in}} 2002, leaving 402 operating only the CT-142 Dash 8s, affectionately nicknamed [...] "Gonzo" [...] operating in the air navigation training role. By 2009, and the changing demands of air forces worldwide, the training was adapted to include AESOPs (Airborne Electronic Sensor Operators) as well as ACSOs (Air Combat Systems Officers). CFANs and 402 Sqn. continue the long tradition of training Commonwealth partners from England, Australia and New Zealand, as well as NATO allies from Germany and Norway. The program has further expanded to include, among others, Singapore and South Korea.|$|R
60|$|The {{two ships}} were now running rapidly on {{parallel}} lines, hurling {{at each other}} their instruments of destruction with furious industry, and with severe and certain loss to both, though with no manifest advantage in favor of either.

Beyond this lay the great plains. Breaking into a gallop, they speedily cleared the underwood, and just as the rosy smile of morning beamed in the eastern sky, they <b>dashed</b> away, with <b>light</b> hearts and loose reins, out upon the springy turf of the open prairie.|$|R
