Tri-helical gravure roll coating is a process which is used widely for depositing a thin liquid film onto a moving substrate. An analytic model of a simplified form of the process, that of rectangular grooves at 0 mesh angle, is presented together with supporting experimental results which confirm {{the validity of the}} model. Included also are interesting flow visualisations of the coating process, which for the first time shows the underlying physics of the process. Experimental Setup A schematic of the coating rig used to carry out the experiments is shown in figure 1. The apparatus utilises gravure coating rolls, of length 200 mm and diameter 100 mm, which can reach a maximum speed of URoll 100 m s; together with controls for web tension, velocity and wrap angle. The gravure rolls are comprised of an acrylic sleeve mounted with grub screws on a central steel core. This facilitates study of a range of groove geometries and aids the illumination of the <b>fluid</b> <b>bead</b> for flow visualisation purposes achieved by the injection of a small volume of coloured dye. Film thickness measurements were made by scraping fluid from the web over a known time interval. The residual fluid remaining after scraping was found to be negligible. The fluid used in the experiments is a Newtonian water-glycerol mixture with a small volume of surfactant to reduce surface tension. The viscosities used were in the range of µ 0 002 to 0 0075 Pas and with surface tensions of σ 0 033 to 0 065 N m...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional flow is {{considered}} in a <b>fluid</b> <b>bead</b> {{located in the}} gap between a pair of contra-rotating cylinders and bounded by two curved menisci. The stability of such bead flows with two inlet films, and hence no contact line, are analysed as the roll speed ratio S is increased. One of the inlet films {{can be regarded as}} an ‘input flux’ whilst the other is a ‘returning film’ whose thickness is specified as a fraction [zeta] of the outlet film on that roll. The flow is modelled via lubrication theory and for Ca [double less-than sign] 1, where Ca represents the capillary number, boundary conditions are formally developed that account for S [not equal] 1 and the non-constant gap. It is shown that there is a qualitative difference in the results between the single and double inlet film models unless small correction terms to the pressure drops at the interfaces are taken into account. Futhermore, it is shown that the inclusion of these small terms produces an O(1) effect on the prediction of the critical value of S at which bead break occurs. When the limits of the returning film fraction are examined it is found that as [zeta] [rightward arrow] 0 results are in good agreement with those for the single inlet film. Further it is shown for a fixed input flux that as [zeta] [rightward arrow] 1 a transition from bead break to upstream flooding of the nip can occur and multiple two-dimensionally stable solutions exist. For a varying input flux and fixed and ‘sufficiently large’ values of [zeta] there is a critical input flux &[lambda]macr;([zeta]) such that as S is increased from zero: (i) bead break occurs for [lambda] &[lambda]macr;; (iii) when [lambda] = &[lambda]macr; the flow becomes neutrally stable at a specific value of S beyond which there exist two steady solutions (two-dimensionally stable) leading to bead break and upstream flooding, respectively...|$|E
40|$|When a dilute polymer {{solution}} experiences capillary thinning, {{it forms}} an almost uniformly cylindrical thread, which we study experimentally. In the last stages of thinning, when polymers have become fully stretched, the filament becomes prone to instabilities, {{of which we}} describe two: A novel "breathing" instability, originating {{from the edge of}} the filament, and a sinusoidal instability in the interior, which ultimately gives rise to a "blistering" pattern of beads on the filament. We describe the linear instability with a spatial resolution of 80 nm in the disturbance amplitude. For sufficiently high polymer concentrations, the filament eventually separates out into a "solid" phase of entangled polymers, connected by <b>fluid</b> <b>beads.</b> A solid polymer fiber of about 100 nanometer thickness remains, which is essentially permanent.

40|$|Wettability is an {{important}} factor which controls the displacement of immiscible fluids in permeable media, with far reaching implications for storage of CO 2 in deep saline aquifers, fuel cells, oil recovery, and for the remediation of oil contaminated soils. Considering the paradigmatic case of random piles of spherical <b>beads,</b> <b>fluid</b> front morphologies emerging during slow immiscible displacement are investigated in real time by X-ray micro–tomography and quantitatively compared with model predictions. Controlled by the wettability of the bead matrix two distinct displacement patterns are found. A compact front morphology emerges if the invading <b>fluid</b> wets the <b>beads</b> while a fingered morphology is found for non–wetting invading fluids, causing the residual amount of defending fluid to differ by one order of magnitude. The corresponding crossover between these two regimes in terms of the advancing contact angle is governed by an interplay of wettability and pore geometry and can be predicted {{on the basis of a}} purely quasi–static consideration of local instabilities that control the progression of the invading interface...|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{creating}} the microfluidic devices used for hydrodynamic trapping {{is to create an}} SU-8 mold. From this mold, a device can be made from PDMS. A completed device consists of two layers, a control layer and a fluidic layer. The control layer contains a valve to regulate the flow of the aqueous solution under study. The fluidic layer contains the channels for the aqueous solution to travel through. Many devices have a cross slot where two opposing laminar streams converge. This creates planar extensional flow with a point where velocity becomes zero, which is known as the fluid stagnation point. Upon analyzing a <b>fluid</b> with <b>beads,</b> DNA, or other very small particles under a microscope, the trajectories of the particles and the stagnation point can be determined.|$|R

40|$|The millimeter-long soil-dwelling {{nematode}} C. elegans propels {{itself by}} producing undulations that propagate along its body and turns by assuming highly curved shapes. According to our recent study [PLoS ONE 7, e 40121 (2012) ] all these postures can be accurately {{described by a}} piecewise-harmonic-curvature (PHC) model. We combine this curvature-based description with highly accurate hydrodynamic bead models to evaluate the normalized velocity and turning angles for a worm swimming in an unconfined fluid and in a parallel-wall cell. We find that the worm moves twice as fast and navigates more effectively under a strong confinement, due to the large transverse-to-longitudinal resistance-coefficient ratio resulting from the wall-mediated far-field hydrodynamic coupling between body segments. We also note that the optimal swimming gait {{is similar to the}} gait observed for nematodes swimming in high-viscosity <b>fluids.</b> Our <b>bead</b> models allow us {{to determine the effects of}} confinement and finite thickness of the body of the nematode on its locomotion.

40|$|By {{sequentially}} pushing micro-beads towards {{and away}} from a sensing surface, we show that ultrasonic radiation forces can be used to enhance the interaction between a functionalised glass surface and polystyrene micro-beads, and identify those that bind to the surface by illuminating bound beads using an evanescent field generated by guided light. The movement towards and immobilisation of streptavidin coated beads onto a biotin functionalised waveguide surface is achieved by using a quarter-wavelength mode pushing beads onto the surface, while the removal of non-specifically bound beads uses a second quarter-wavelength mode which exhibits a kinetic energy maximum at the boundary between the carrier layer and <b>fluid,</b> drawing <b>beads</b> towards this surface. This has been achieved using a multi-modal acoustic device which exhibits both of these quarter-wavelength resonances. Both 1 -D acoustic modelling and finite element analysis has been used to design this device and to investigate the spatial uniformity of the field. We demonstrate experimentally that 90 % of specifically bound beads remain attached after applying ultrasound, with 80 % of non-specifically bound control beads being successfully removed acoustically. This approach overcomes problems associated with lengthy sedimentation processes used for bead-based bioassays and surface (electrostatic) forces, which delay or prevent immobilisation.

40|$|Litz wire bundles {{are highly}} {{effective}} at enhancing the {{current carrying capacity}} and limiting the losses of electronic devices up to MHz frequencies due to the pattern in which the individual wires are braided in the bundle. However, the technology to fabricate Litz wire bundles at higher radio frequencies has not been developed due to current manufacturing limitations. Litz wire bundles developed to accommodate higher radio frequencies would have a tremendous impact for electronic devices because these bundles would allow for inductors to be manufactured with increased quality factors from the current range of less than 10 to a possible range of up to 1000 at frequencies of 1 - 10 GHz. This would allow for less spectral crowding, jamming, improved power handling, and more efficient systems.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a novel platform for mechanical cell lysis {{of even the most}} difficult to lyse cell types on a micro or nanoscale (maximum 70 μL total volume). The system incorporates a machined plastic circular disk assembly, magnetic field actuated microfluidics, centrifugal cells and tissue homogenizer and centrifugation system. The mechanism of tissue disruption of this novel cell homogenization apparatus derives from the relative motion of ferromagnetic metal disks and grinding matrices in a liquid medium within individual chambers of the disk in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field. The oscillation of the ferromagnetic disks or blades produces mechanical impaction and shear forces capable of disrupting cells within the chamber both by direct action of the blade and by the motion of the surrounding lysis matrix, and by motion induced vortexing of buffer <b>fluid.</b> Glass <b>beads</b> or other grinding media are integrated into each lysis chamber within the disk to enhance the transfer of energy from the oscillating metal blade to the cells.

Ask any bearing company about {{the leading cause}} of bearing failure and they will point to contamination. Once a foreign substance lands on the raceway of a bearing or on the track, pitting of the surface will occur, and once the surface is compromised, wear will accelerate. Building shrouds around your conveyors can help prevent the ingress of contaminants. Or, pressurize the contained area using a simple fan and duct arrangement. Contamination can also apply to belts (causing slippage, {{or in the case of}} some materials premature wear), and of the motors themselves. Since the motors can generate a considerable amount of heat, keeping the surface clean is an almost-free maintenance procedure that can keep heat from getting trapped by dust and grime, which may lead to motor burnout.|$|R

Therefore, a robust and stable means to prevent bacteria growth is possible. Next, protein in urine is detected using a simple colorimetric output by evaporating droplets on a SH surface. Contrary to evaporation on a flat surface, evaporation on a SH surface allows fluid to dramatically concentrate because the weak adhesion constantly decreases the footprint area. On a SH surface, molecules in solution are confined to a footprint area 8. 5 x smaller than the original. By concentrating molecules, greater than 160 x improvements in detection sensitivity are achieved compared to controls. Utility is demonstrated by detecting protein in urine in the pre-eclampsia range (150 - 300 µgmL- 1) for pregnant women. Further, SH surfaces repel bodily fluids including blood, urine, and saliva.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Commercial gentamicin-loaded {{bone cement}} beads (Septopal) {{constitute}} an effective delivery system for local antibiotic therapy. These beads {{are not available}} {{in all parts of}} the world, and are too expensive for frequent use in others. Thus, orthopedic surgeons worldwide make antibiotic-loaded beads themselves. However, these beads are usually not as effective as the commercial beads because of inadequate release kinetics. Our purpose was to develop a simple, cheap, and effective formulation to prepare gentamicin-loaded beads with release properties and antibacterial efficacy similar to the commercially ones. METHODS: Acrylic beads were prepared with variable monomer content: 100 % (500 microL/g polymer), 75 %, and 50 % to increase gentamicin release through creation of a less dense polymer matrix. Using the optimal monomer content, different gel-forming polymeric fillers were added to enhance the permeation of <b>fluids</b> into the <b>beads.</b> Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 17 was selected as a suitable filler; its concentration was varied and the antibiotic release and antibacterial efficacy of these beads were compared with the corresponding properties of the commercial ones. RESULTS: Gentamicin release rate and the extent of release from beads prepared with 50 % monomer increased when the PVP 17 content was increased. Beads with 15 w/w% PVP 17 released 87 % of their antibiotic content. This is substantially more than the gentamicin release from Septopal beads (59 %). Acrylic beads with 15 w/w% PVP 17 reduced bacterial growth by up to 93 %, which is similar to the antibacterial properties of the commercial ones. INTERPRETATION: A simple, cheap, and effective formulation and preparation process has been described for hand-made gentamicin-releasing acrylic beads, with better release kinetics and with antibacterial efficacy similar to that of the commercial ones...|$|R
