40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. From {{the early}} 1900 s to 1961, cattle ranchers in Southern states, {{particularly}} Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, and Texas, {{were required to}} control ticks on cattle to prevent Texas Cattle Fever, a disease that impacted cattle in the South. A United States Department of Agriculture program provided for the construction and operation of over 3, 200 cattle <b>dip</b> <b>vats.</b> Solutions containing arsenic were initially used, until the ticks developed a resistance to the arsenic solution. Around the mid- 1940 s, arsenical pesticides were replaced by organochlorinated pesticides. The historic operations of cattle <b>dip</b> <b>vats</b> have lingering impacts on groundwater and soil that {{pose a threat to}} human health and the environment. Geosyntec Consultants has contracted with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to evaluate groundwater and soil impacts associated with historic cattle <b>dip</b> <b>vats</b> that are located in the Florida State Park System. A multi-faceted approach was used to characterize contaminant migration in groundwater and soils with respect to historical site operations, archaeological preservation, and environmental health. Several case studies at state parks located across Florida are presented, including methods of delineation and remediation. The approaches employed in these studies will assist others in future investigations of historic cattle <b>dip</b> <b>vats</b> that exist across the South, including Georgia.

40|$|Coumaphos, an {{organophosphate}} insecticide, is {{used for}} tick control in cattle <b>dipping</b> <b>vats</b> along the U. S. -Mexican border. Recently, several vats (problem vats) have experienced a loss of efficacy because of microbial degradation. Three morphologically distinct bacteria (designated B- 1, B- 2, and B- 3) that metabolized coumaphos were isolated from enrichment cultures that were initiated from problem <b>vat</b> <b>dip</b> material. In general, amino acids, pyrimidines, and acetate supported growth; carbohydrates were not utilized. Only B- 2 required growth factors. In resting cell experiments, coumaphos was hydrolyzed to diethylthiophosphoric acid and chlorferon by all three isolates. Chlorferon was subsequently metabolized by B- 1 and B- 2 to α-chloro-β-methyl- 2, 3, 4 -trihydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid. Only B- 1 produced additional metabolites. Experiments with [benzo ring-labeled U- 14 C]coumaphos or chlorferon demonstrated that B- 1 was capable of both mineralizing and incorporating into biomass the aromatic portion of the molecule. The majority of label, however, was recovered {{in the form of}} soluble products, including α-chloro-β-methyl- 2, 3, 4 -trihydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid. Although B- 1 had the capacity to use chlorferon as a carbon source at low concentrations (100 μg/ml), visible growth at higher concentrations (1, 000 μg/ml) was not observed. The addition of 400 μg of chlorferon per ml to B- 1 cells in the mid-log phase of growth resulted in complete inhibition of growth, while the addition of 100 to 200 μg of chlorferon per ml resulted in partial inhibition. The growth of B- 2 and B- 3 was inhibited by 100 μg of chlorferon per ml. These data suggest that, although B- 1 and, to a lesser extent, B- 2 and B- 3 are responsible for the primary degradation of coumaphos, other organisms in the enrichment culture may play a secondary role in coumaphos degradation by removing inhibitory products of coumaphos metabolism...|$|R

5000|$|Nugent and Brunson {{were killed}} by Walter Johnson (born ca. 1894), a farmer from the Aloha community, who was charged with double murder in the slaying. After the murders, Johnson fled into the dense Lake Iatt swamp. Sam Johnson, Walter Johnson's 84-year-old father, was taken from Colfax, the parish seat, to an {{undisclosed}} place of incarceration and held under a $1,900 appearance bond as a material witness in the case. Louisiana state police {{and local law enforcement}} officers, armed with guns, tear gas, bombs, and bloodhounds, combed the wooded area where Walter Johnson fled. The two Johnsons claimed that dipping cattle causes the animals to become ill. Sheriff Nugent came to serve an order from the 8th Judicial District Court upon Walter Johnson to compel him to have his animals dipped. Nugent and two other officers then began loading some of Johnson's cattle onto a truck to transport them to the <b>dipping</b> <b>vat.</b> Perched in a wooded area, Walter Johnson fired on the officers with a rifle. Brunson and Nugent were found an hour later. The Grant Parish coroner, Dr. J. H. Sandifer, determined that the pair was killed by No. 6 buckshot slugs fired from a shotgun. Walter Johnson was thought to have used a [...]30-.30 calibre rifle. It was then believed that Johnson had two weapons. Bloodhounds brought from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola failed to pursue Johnson's trail because of heavy rains the previous night. The search was directed by Brigadier-General Louis F. Guerre, the commander of the Louisiana state police. Area sheriffs, including U. T. Downs of Rapides Parish, Bryant Sholars of Winn Parish, and Henderson Jordan, who had two years earlier participated in the capture of the bank bandits and murderers Bonnie and Clyde in his own Bienville Parish, headed posses of local citizens in searches of the region. The men found Johnson's truck near the scene of the shooting. Bloodhounds were unable to pick up the trail thereafter. The crime occurred after months of controversy between certain cattlemen and officers over enforcement of the tick eradication law. When finally captured, Walter Johnson was taken to a jail outside Grant Parish because of the fear that a mob might try to kill him. Nugent died of two shots to the head; Brunson, of three shots to the body. A joint funeral was held for the officers at the First Baptist Church of Colfax, with the pastor, the Reverend D. L.

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] PU for CHE, 1999. Objective: To develop {{effective}} <b>dip</b> <b>vat</b> {{management and}} waste disposal strategies, this {{study focused on}} establishing ways to stabilise or destabiJise amitraz, an ectoparasitic compound, in solution. Background: The formamidines form {{a small group of}} insecticides. Their current value lies in the control of organophosphate and carbamate-resistant pests. The accumulation of this compound in the environment is of concern because amitraz is widely used in South Africa to control ticks in mobile and stationary spray and <b>dip</b> <b>vats</b> of up to 1000 L. Through this process large quantities of semiconcentrated wastes is generated. Formamidine poisoning symptoms are distinctly different from other pesticides. Their proposed action is the inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which is responsible for degrading the neurotransmitters norephedrine and serotonin. Methods: The pseudo-first order rate constants, k, of 2]. Lg/ml Amitraz solutions in seven buffers with a pH range from 3 to 10 and a 0. 1 M NaOH solution were determined at 25 °C. The decrease in amitraz concentration was determined at 285 nm with a spectrophotometer. Using different concentration buffers at the same pH the effect of buffers on degradation was also tested. The rate of hydrolysis of amitraz a~ temperatures of 50 °C and 75 °C were also determined. This was compared to the results at 25 °C. Hydrolysis tempo in different concentrations of ethanol, propylene glycol and dimethyl sulphoxide (OMSO) was also determined. The hydrolysis rates in surfactant solutions containing sodium lauryl sulphate, cetrimide or Tween 80 were also determined. Mass spectra were used to confirm the hydrolysis products of Amitraz. Results: Amitraz degrade by means of hydrolysis. At low pH values the acid-stable 2, 4 -dimethylphenylformamide is formed. This can be further hydrolysed to 2, 4 -dimethyl aniline. The hydrolysis of 2, 4 -dimethylphenylformamide is faster under basic conditions. Thus, the addition of lime, used to stabilise amitraz, will enhance the hydrolysis of its degradation products to aniline. A pseudofirst order rate process is followed, as described by this equation: In([amitraz]/[amitraz]o) = -kobst, where [amitraz] is the amitraz concentration at time t, [amitraz]o is the initial amitraz concentration and kobs is the apparent pseudo-first order rate constant. At low pH values the hydrolysis of amitraz is very fast. The hydrolysis rate decreased as the pH rose. It was the slowest at neutral to alkali pH values. The hydrolysis rate increased again as the pH values became very high, above pH 10. Hydrolysis was the fastest at 75 °C and the slowest at 25 °C. The activation energy for the hydrolysis of amitraz rose between pH 4 and 6. From pH 6 to 11 the activation energy decreased at a constant rate. The ionic strength had a slight effect on the hydrolysis of amitraz in the acetate buffer. At higher ionic strength, the reaction became slower. Ionic strength had no effect on the phosphate buffer. The pH rate profile for amitraz hydrolysis was type ABCD, which means that hydrolysis starts fast and the rate decreased at a constant rate between pH 3 and 6. The hydrolysis rate decreased further between pH 6 and 10, but this decrease was slower than that between pH 3 and 6. A small increase in hydrolysis rate took place between pH 10 and 14. The same ABCD pH rate profile was observed at 25 and 50 °C, but at 75 °C the rate of hydrolysis decreased very slowly between pH 10 and 14. When hydrolysis in three organic solvents were compared with one another, the propylene glycol solution degraded amitraz the fastest, ethanol a bit slower and DMSO the slowest. Overalf degradation was still fastest in water. It is evident for amitraz that anionic micelles enhance and cationic micelles retard the rate of hydrolysis and that the magnitude of micellar effects become less with increasing concentrations of the surfactants. Non-ionic surfactants either decreased or had insignificant effects on the rate constants for hydrolysis of amitraz. At higher detergent concentration the catalysis of amitraz hydrolysis became progressively less pronounced. The maximum rate acceleration occurs in the region of catalyst concentration at which the bulk of the amitraz is incorporated in the micelles and additional surfactant, simply solubilise the nucleophllies in the stem layer, thereby rendering them inactive. Conclusion: It was shown that amitraz hydrolysis is the fastest in acid conditions and slowest in neutral to alkaline conditions. Hydrolysis also increased with an increase in temperature. Very importantly, in anionic surfactant solutions amitraz is solubilised and the hydrolysis rate is increased. This surfactant might therefore be used when trying to dispose of <b>dip</b> <b>vat</b> waste. Master...|$|R

50|$|HISTORY OF WOODFORD AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY BY THE OKLAHOMA HISTORY CLASS OF WOODFORD HIGH SCHOOL, 1930CHAPTER 1. BEGINNING OF WOODFORDThe {{little town}} of Woodford {{is located at the}} foot of the Arbuckle Mountains. This little town was started when two {{bachelor}} brother, by the name of Bywater, came to this part of the world and established a small log store and a blacksmith shop. This was about the year of 1874. Their places of business were located about two hundred yards east of the present post office. These two brothers stayed in business here for four years, and Mr. George Akers bought them out. A few years later he established a small grocery store where the post office is now located. This store was built of Bywater’s old building and a part of the lumber was hauled from Gainesville, Texas with teams and wagons. Woodford was first called Bywater because the Bywaters were the first to settle here.About the year of 1877 Mr. Wood Smith came to this little town and established a United States Post Office. The building was also built of logs cut and hauled from the Arbuckle Mountains. This building is now used by Mr. Arthur Presley. This little town was afterward called “Woodford” for its first postmaster.The old settlers of this community seem to disagree as to where the first schoolhouse was established. Some say it was about three miles north of where the Hickory Dam is now located, while other say it was about one quarter mile west of the post office. There was in time a schoolhouse located one-quarter mile west of the post office, but whether it was the first one or not is not known. This building was destroyed by a storm and was afterwards moved to the southern part of the little town where the high school now stands. Miss Susie Love was the first teacher of Woodford and Mrs. Jimmie Speake, formerly Miss Tarver was the second.The cemetery is located about one-quarter mile west of the post office, on top of a hill. Some of the old settlers of this community say a child by the name of Job was the first to be buried in this cemetery while other say an outlaw was the first. This outlaw was said to be hiding out and was captured by two U.S. Marshals from Fort Worth, Texas and was shot under a tree, a few hundred yards east of the cemetery. A very pretty sulfur springs marks the general appearance of Woodford. The exact time of this spring’s beginning in not known. It originated from a broken water stream in the Arbuckle Mountains. This spring has supplied practically all the people of Woodford ever since its origination. Until about statehood this spring was walled with a hollowed-out log. It was fenced with hewed logs which were fixed by the first settlers. The users of this spring got to it by means of a step-ladder over the fence made of sawed-off logs.The first roads through this part of the country were almost no roads at all. They were mere trails which were made by cattlemen. These roads did not have any particular course; they led in most all directions across the hills and hollows. The first road from Woodford to Ardmore led straight across the country southeast to Ardmore. Before statehood, there were no section lines in this country. Ira and J. M. Redding and Mr. Finch were the men who put the first wire fence in this country.There were hardly any crops raised here during the early days. What land that was owned by individuals living here was mostly used for pasture. There were some few small patches of land cultivated by settlers. These were very small and were mostly worked by hand.Woodford’s first gin was established about one mile southwest of the little town. This first gin was owned by Cummie Littleington and the next by Jim Alverson.Mr. John Wood established the first drug store at Woodford and Mr. J. M. Hill the first hotel, in the eastern part of town where he now lives.The first constable of Woodford was Bird Pruitt. Mr. Williams was the first Justice of the Peace and Mr. Holmes Akers, a brother to Mr. George Akers, was a deputy Sheriff.A few of the earliest settlers of Woodford were: Mr. Fahgan, Lewis McKinley, Edd Chicken, Joe Murray, Wood Smith and the two Bywater brothers.CHAPTER 2. EARLY OCCUPATIONS AND INDUSTRIES OF WOODFORD COMMUNITYBefore statehood there were very few homes in this community. What few homes that were located here were very rude little huts or cabins. These were built of logs cut and hauled out of the Arbuckle Mountains. The logs were notched five or six inches from the ends so that they would fit closely together. The cracks between these were daubed with a mixture of sod and water. These houses were usually just one-roomed but sometimes a two-roomed house was built with a hall between. In the one-room house there was usually one door and a window while the two room houses there were more. These homes were covered usually with very rough lumber but it was often the case to see them covered with sod or sheet iron.The furniture which was used in these homes was as rude as the homes themselves. The average family’s furniture consisted of one or two wooden beds, three or four chairs, a homemade dining table, a mirror which hung on the walls instead of a dresser, and sometimes a wood stove on which they cooked their meals, but usually though cooked on fireplaces.During this time the people were not definitely engaged in farming or any other occupation. Cotton and corn were their most common crop. Cotton sold for only three or four cents per pound. Cottonseed couldn’t be sold at any price so this enabled the farmer to haul it back home for cattle feed. They would very often have more seed than they could make use of. When this was the case the seed was burned or destroyed in some way. Corn sold for twelve and one half cents per bushel. Most of the land around Woodford is well suited for both cotton and corn.Ranching was another important industry here at this time. There were only a few ranchmen here before statehood. Some of these owned their ranches and others rented them. Stock law hadn’t been organized here at this time. Most of the stock ranged on the outside. When branding time came the ranchers and cowboys would round all their cattle up in small rail corrals, which had been built for this purpose. Three or four men would be at the corrals ready to brand the cattle. When the cattle were ready for shipping they were rounded up and driven across the mountains to the nearest shipping point. When this required more than one days’ drive the ranchmen would camp on some creek for the night. Sometimes the cattle wouldn’t be very worried from traveling and would give quite a bit of trouble during the night. In these days cattle were allowed to run in stalk fields and pastures during the spring and winter time until branding time. It was often the case that someone came along and caught the calves and took them home to their ranch and pasture and claimed them.The farmers were all poor people. They would usually put in an average crop, which never produced an enormous amount of products. These crops were a lot more difficult to raise and gather than they are today. This was due to the lack of improved farm machinery, with which we are now equipped. The highest and best grade of seeds were not in use then. The crops were then fenced with rails split by the farmer himself. The farmers very often owned a herd or at least had a few hogs. Since the farmers were well-supplied with wild hogs they had to keep their hogs closely confined. This was very difficult. The farmers finally developed a method of fencing which proved to be very successful. This was a fence built of rock and clay. Trenches were dug about one foot deep, large rocks placed in this and smaller rocks and clay were put on top of this to make it secure. These rock fences usually were about three or four feet high and on top of this two or three barbed wires were placed.Mr. Sheridan Joines began a ranch in the Arbuckle Mountains about the time of statehood.Mr. George Faulkner established the first <b>dipping</b> <b>vat</b> in this community for the purpose of getting rid of ticks which were a very dangerous pest to stock.Labor was also cheap in early days. A girl by the name of Mary Spencer washed dishes for a family in Woodford for fifty cents per month.Mr. McLish owned a ranch and homestead at this time, about four miles northwest of Woodford. It is now the “Morrow Ranch”.CHAPTER 3. EARLY GOVERNMENT OF THE WOODFORD COMMUNITYThe first laws in the Woodford community were the gun laws. Later the United States marshals came here, some of them were from Fort Worth while others were from Paris. The Federal officers were the first enforcement of laws of this community. Some of the other officers were Mr. Holmes Akers first sheriff, Mr. A. W. Speake first County Commissioner, Mr. Jerdy Akers was the delegate to the Constitutional Convention from Woodford. Other officers were J. F. McCants first representative to the State Legislature. Bird Pruitt was the Justice of the Peace, Williams was the first constable of the Woodford community.The early roads from Woodford to Ardmore were southeast in a straight line from Woodford. These roads were poorly constructed. When the roads were improved the people had to do it themselves.In the early days the people had to pay taxes according to the business in which they were engaged. The people who were engaged in farming and other forms of small business did not have to pay as much taxes as those who were engaged in a larger business. Harris McClane was the first tax collector for the Chickasaw Nation.As soon as District 36 was organized the people of the Woodford community voted bonds to build an addition to the old schoolhouse in order to have a high school. The schoolhouse was built in 1921.Doctor Taylor and Mrs. Speake served on the first school board. Mrs. Taylor was one of the early school teachers; while she was teaching school here Doctor Taylor got acquainted with her and later they were married.Both of the churches of Woodford were built in 1907, while the Methodist Church was rebuilt in 1929.The first doctor of the Woodford community was Doctor Miller, later Doctor Taylor came to Woodford and began his practice. Doctor Amerson was another doctor who practiced medicine in Woodford.THE PRESENT DAY WOODFORDThe present population of Woodford has decreased very much in the last few years. The people of Woodford have settled down to an almost strictly farming district. There are a few more different occupations here; Mr. Greer owns a “goobernut plant”, this gives Woodford a manufacturing plant.At present there are two churches in Woodford, a post office, two stores, and a garage.Woodford has an accredited high school. There are five teachers in the school system.Two miles north from Woodford there is a lake built by the city of Ardmore. This lake supplies Woodford and Ardmore with water.|$|E
40|$|The ticks Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus and R. (B.) microplus, {{commonly}} known as cattle and southern cattle tick, respectively, impede the development and sustainability of livestock industries throughout tropical and other world regions. They affect animal productivity and wellbeing directly through their obligate blood feeding habit and indirectly by serving as vectors of the infectious agents causing bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis. The monumental scientific discovery of certain arthropod species as vectors of infectious agents {{is associated with the}} history of research on bovine babesiosis and R. annulatus. Together, R. microplus and R. annulatus are referred to as cattle fever ticks (CFT). Bovine babesiosis became a regulated foreign animal disease in the United States of America (U. S.) through efforts of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) established in 1906. The U. S. was declared free of CFT in 1943, {{with the exception of a}} permanent quarantine zone in south Texas along the border with Mexico. This achievement contributed greatly to the development and productivity of animal agriculture in the U. S. The permanent quarantine zone buffers CFT incursions from Mexico where both ticks and babesiosis are endemic. Until recently, the elimination of CFT outbreaks relied solely on the use of coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide, in <b>dipping</b> <b>vats</b> or as a spray to treat livestock, or the vacation of pastures. However, ecological, societal, and economical changes are shifting the paradigm of systematically treating livestock to eradicate CFT. Keeping the U. S. CFT-free is a critical animal health issue affecting the economic stability of livestock and wildlife enterprises. Here, we describe vulnerabilities associated with global change forces challenging the CFTEP. The concept of integrated CFT eradication is discussed in reference to global change...|$|R
