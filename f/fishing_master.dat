50|$|Because {{cormorant}} {{fishing is}} a daily activity for nearly five months of the year, the <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> begin each day by selecting ten to twelve healthy cormorants for the evening’s activities.

50|$|As {{cormorant}} {{fishing on}} the Nagara has long gone unchanged, the tools used have generally remained unchanged as well. The largest tool is the cormorant boat (鵜舟 ubune) itself. This 13-meter boat holds the three riders, the cormorants and the night's catch. Hanging {{from the front}} of the boat is an iron basket (篝 kagari), which is supported by the fire pole (篝棒 kagaribō) and holds the fire in front of the boat. That fire (篝火 kagaribi) is used to light both the <b>fishing</b> <b>master's</b> path and make it easier for the cormorants to find <b>fish.</b> The <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> use split pinewood (松割木 matsuwariki) because it burns easily and brightly. Also, the cormorants are controlled by the <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> through the use of ropes (手縄 tenawa).|$|R

When they are back in the boat, the <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> remove the <b>fish</b> from the birds’ throats. Each bird can hold up to six fish in its throat. The birds are prevented from swallowing the fish because of a ring tied around their necks. The cormorants, however, are still able to swallow smaller fish. Though the ropes are strong, the <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> are able to quickly break them if a bird’s rope gets caught beneath rocks, ensuring the bird will not drown.|$|R

The purpose of this study was to apply local ecological knowledge (LEK) to assist in the planning of future in situ studies of fish behaviour around drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs) by prioritizing research topics, thereby reducing the number of potential hypotheses to explore. Interviews of <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> of the purse-seine fleets working in the western Indian Ocean provided an alternate, independent, and previously unexplored source of behavioural information, specifically on the attraction, retention, and departure behaviours of tuna schools in relation to DFADs. Most <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> agreed that the maximum attraction distance of a DFAD is approximately 10 km and generally agreed to the following statements. Tuna form distinct schools under FADs, commonly segregated by species and size. The main reasons for the departure of tuna aggregations from FADs are changes in currents or FAD movements and location in relation to physical or oceanographic features. The number of actively monitored DFADs at sea in the western Indian Ocean was estimated at approximately 2100. Incorporating fishers into the planning and design stages of future research projects will facilitate collaborative and integrated approaches...|$|R

This study uses local ecological knowledge (LEK) obtained through standardized interviews of <b>fishing</b> <b>masters</b> to compare and characterize the body of local ecological knowledge, fishing technology and fishing strategies of both fleets, with the goal of obtaining useful information for the management of the fishery. A notable difference between fleets was the number of DFADs actively monitored per vessel at any given time, which was much higher for Spanish vessels (ca. 60 versus 20 DFADs). Spanish vessels also achieved higher vessel CPUE (catch per DFAD set) than their French counterparts. The use of supply vessels to manage, monitor and protect productive DFADs, and the latest satellite-based technology to track and remotely monitor DFAD aggregations is restricted to the Spanish fleet. The French do not use supply vessels and deploy less sophisticated tracking buoys. These technological disparities resulted in some fishing strategy differences between both fleets, but few differences were found in the knowledge of tuna behavior accumulated by the fishers...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} and distinguish between visual stimuli is fundamental for everyday survival of many species. While diverse aspects of cognition, including complex visual discrimination tasks were previously successfully assessed in fish, it remains unknown if fish can learn a matching-to-sample concept using geometrical shapes and discriminate between images and their mirror-image counterparts. For this purpose a total of nine Malawi cichlids (Pseudotropheus sp.) were trained in two matching-to-sample (MTS) and three two-choice discrimination tasks using geometrical, two-dimensional visual stimuli. Two out of the three discrimination experiments focused {{on the ability to}} discriminate between images and their mirror-images, the last was a general discrimination test.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} issue of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing. The {{aim is to}} refer to this problem and provide fundamental information {{on the subject of}} illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. About 11 and 26 million tons of fish are caught by IUU fishing annually, which stands for as much as one third of overall annual fish catch. Numbers provided demonstrate the magnitude of the issue. First part describes IUU fishing, in general. Several terms important for orientation in the topic are explained there, such as bycatch or RFMO. Economical aspects - such as motivation of fishermen involved in IUU fishing activities - and world oceans sustainability are analysed there, as well. It is likely that the decrease of marine fish will reach its critical scale, within several decades if industrial fishing goes on beyond any limits. 	Second part provides description of main types of fishing gear and fishing methods, which are commonly used by fishermen all across the world. Fishing devices are therefore categorized and described in detail, several provided with pictures. 	Third part of the thesis examines the development of international sea law: which was being shaped at three United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea - and final division of sea waters into zones as well. The last chapter focuses on current possibilities of preventing IUU fishing. It provides several options and suggestions, such as following: banning usage of specific pieces of fishing gear which can be labelled inhuman, raising financial sanctions against individuals involved in IUU fishing, designing a database purposed for gathering valid information of <b>fishing</b> <b>masters...</b>|$|R
