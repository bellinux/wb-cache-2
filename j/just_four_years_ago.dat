[...] . On the threshold of a new millennium, small, often experimental companies, passionately convinced of the relevance of, and excited by the artistic potential inherent in this revitalized form of opera, formed a loose consortium of creative artists internationally, similar in spirit to the original Camerata of the 16 th century, making use of current technologies. Whether these newer works may be styled 'chamber opera' or 'music theatre', they represent a form in evolution, capable of further development into a new genre, a vital nexus of traditional skills applied to current issues, peculiarly suited to integration with electronic modes such as television.

40|$|Economic and {{monetary}} union (EMU) is, undoubtedly, {{a unique and}} bold experiment. Although {{the introduction of the}} euro went well, the economic management of the EU as a whole, and the euro area in particular, has been subject to growing criticism (see, for example, Pisani-Ferry, 2002). Today, the EU has to confront sluggish growth, persistent unemployment and an apparent inability to deal with weaknesses in the supply-side of the economy. The optimism surrounding the launch of the euro <b>just</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> {{has been replaced by a}} pervasive feeling of gloom. Rather than looking with envy at Ireland, many are now looking with trepidation at what has happened in Japan since 1990. What is less clear, however, is whether the difficulties now apparent are the result of policy mistakes, flaws in the architecture of the EMU policy system, or the impact of longer-run changes that have been inadequately analysed and dealt with. A crucial question is whether the combination of a monetary policy set by an independent, supranational central bank and fiscal (and other) policies controlled by national governments is conducive to both price stability and economic growth. Since the inception of the euro in 1999 and even during the period of convergence that preceded it, there has been a steady stream of criticism about the EU's machinery for economic policy coordination (Buiter et al., 1993; Boyer, 2002) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} high {{frequency}} trading span {{far beyond what}} many are able to comprehend. There is, however, {{a great deal of}} evidence regarding the affects that trade volumes have on stock prices. As previously mentioned, computers now conduct over 70 % of all trades made every day. <b>Just</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> the market was 30 % computer based (CBS News, 2010). It is evident, then, that the numbers of shares traded each day (volume) have increased with the rise in the trades made each day (frequency). For example, the average volume of trades made weekly on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 2000 - 2005 leapt over 180 % from 2005 - 2010 (Yahoo! Finance, 2010). So, since high frequency trading can be linked to the large increase in trade volumes, it is appropriate to look at the relationship between volatility of the stock market and the volume of trades made. By using time series analysis, it is hoped to find whether or not high frequency trading (looked at in terms of trade volume) is positively or negatively affecting the stock market. It is hypothesized that the higher the volume of trades made, the more volatile the stock prices will be. If this is the case, there may be policy implications regarding restrictions placed on the firms using high frequency trading...|$|E
40|$|Remember when Prime Minister Turnbull and Immigration Minister Dutton blamed unionized {{construction}} workers {{for the high}} cost of housing in Australia? The idea that workers (not property speculators or bankers) are to blame for the property bubble is pretty far-fetched - in fact, it sparked a viral storm on social media, using the #blameunions hashtag. We 2 ̆ 7 ve looked in detail at the empirical data regarding the relationship (or lack thereof) between unions, construction wages, and housing prices.   The results are surprising [...] . A new research paper from the Centre for Future Work has found that: 	Average earnings in the construction industry have grown more slowly than the Australian average over the last five years. 	Real wage increases in construction have been slower than real productivity growth, with the effect that real unit labour costs in construction have declined. 	Construction labour accounts for only 17 - 22 percent of the total costs of new building. 	Construction costs, in turn, account for less than half the market value of residential property. 	Construction labour costs correspond to less than 10 percent of housing prices (and even less than that in Australia’s biggest cities). 	Construction workers receive far less income from the housing sector than land-owners, property investors, and banks. 	Construction labour accounts for about the same proportion of a house purchase as real estate commissions and stamp duty. 	Homes in Australia are becoming unaffordable even for the workers who build them: on average, a construction worker would need to spend 9. 2 years of their pre-tax earnings to purchase a median home (25 percent more than <b>just</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> ...|$|E
