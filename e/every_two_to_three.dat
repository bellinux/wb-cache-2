He also speculated on any follow-ups mimicking the development cycle of Grand Theft Auto, with a new release expected <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years. 2K's president Christoph Hartmann stated that BioShock could have five sequels, comparing the franchise to the Star Wars movies.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} are {{not very}} widely distributed; they are all restricted to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction. River dolphins feed primarily on fish. Male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and}} summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.|$|E

5|$|By 1896, {{the company}} {{produced}} one new car <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> weeks and built vehicles on order for $2,000. As the orders increased, the company formally incorporated as Haynes-Apperson on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in capital from stock issued to Portland and Kokomo businessmen. At {{the end of}} that year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased. Haynes-Apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans are widespread, but some, as {{with the}} mysticetes, specialise in certain environments. Most mysticetes prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Gray whales are {{specialized}} for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and}} summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Some whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably the songs of the humpback whale. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises are {{not very}} widespread, with many specialising near the polar regions, usually near the coast. Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much {{like the rest of}} the odontocetes. Males {{typically}} mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Some porpoises produce a variety of clicks and whistles, which are thought to be primarily for social purposes. A few species, like the harbour porpoise, are highly sociable, but pods generally do not exceed ten individuals for most species.|$|E

5|$|Young velvet bellies feed {{mainly on}} krill and small bony fish, {{transitioning}} to squid and shrimp {{as they grow}} larger. There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age. This species exhibits a number of adaptations to living in the deep sea, such as specialized T-cells and liver proteins {{for dealing with the}} higher concentrations of heavy metals found there. Velvet bellies often carry a heavy parasite load. It is ovoviviparous, giving birth to litters of six to 20 young <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years. This species has virtually no commercial value, but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries. Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns.|$|E

40|$|Fluctuations in {{estrogen}} and progesterone during the menstrual cycle can cause changes in body systems {{other than the}} reproductive system. We conducted several studies to determine a possible correlation between phases of the menstrual cycle and specific skin properties. Healthy Caucasian women (ages 21 - 48), who had a typical 26 - 29 day menstrual cycle, participated in the studies. Measurements of skin barrier strength, dryness, response to lactic acid stinging, skin surface lipids, and microflora were obtained <b>every</b> week for <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> months. Ultraviolet B susceptibility in terms of minimal erythemal dose was also studied. The skin barrier was the weakest between days 22 and 26 of the cycle. Elevated neuronal response (lactic acid sting) was not observed to vary much with the cycle. Skin was driest between day 1 and day 6, while skin surface lipid secretion appeared to be highest on days 16 - 20 of the hormonal cycle. The highest microbial count was around days 16 - 22, {{and there was a}} high UV-B susceptibility between days 20 and 28 of the menstrual cycle...|$|R

25|$|Toothed whales {{consist of}} some of the most {{widespread}} mammals, but some, as with the vaquita, are restricted to certain areas. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years, making them polygynous. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer, and females bear the responsibility for raising them, but more sociable species rely on the family group to care for calves.

40|$|Pediatric age is {{the most}} {{important}} period for preventive eye care services and research. Vision loss in this period could cause a long life without sight and also significant financial and moral losses, in terms of people and society. Rational screening programs may reduce vision loss in childhood and this issue increases the value of the subject. Retinopathy of prematurity, congenital/infantile cataracts and glaucoma, optic nerve and retinal pathologies, refractive errors, amblyopia, and strabismus are the major clinical pictures causing visual loss in childhood. Using the epidemiological data, it could be estimated that <b>every</b> year approximately <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> thousand children suffer an ophthalmologic disease that causes significant visual loss. Regarding the refractive errors and amblyopia, it could be estimated that hundreds of thousands of children need ophthalmological follow-up in the country. For the timely treatment of these pathologies, a couple of short eye examination programs seem more realistic. Childhood vision loss in the country could be reduced, by informing pediatricians and family physicians and by proper guiding of the public opinion. Effective eye screening could be achieved with the implementation of simple methods like red reflex/Brückner test with ophthalmoscopy, or simultaneous (binocular) retinoscopy and ophthalmoscopy of both eyes. Screening programs could be spread throughout the country by appropriate training of the physicians in the health institutions of the country. Screening programs will contribute to reduce the rate of visual disability by disseminating ophthalmologic practices throughout the country. (Turk J Ophthalmol 2013; 43 : 195 - 201...|$|R
