5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward <b>flight</b> <b>mode,</b> these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E

25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 7 September, El Mundo suggested that during the flight preparation and takeoff attempts, the aircraft had some of its systems in <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> rather than ground mode. If true, this might explain why de-icing of the Total Air Temperature probe activated on the ground, causing overheating, since in flight the heater would activate only {{when there was no}} air flow in the probe, a sign of icing. This might also explain why the flaps and slats alarm had not sounded, since this alarm is disabled in <b>flight</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
25|$|Full VTOL {{testing at}} Edwards AFB was delayed pending the {{availability}} of the 7,100 shp Allison YT54, which never materialized. After the brief unintentional hop, the aircraft made a total of 32 flights. All further XFV-1 flights did not involve any vertical takeoffs or landings. The XFV-1 was able to make a few transitions in flight from the conventional to the vertical <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> and back, and had briefly held in hover at altitude. Performance remained limited by the confines of the flight test regime. With the realization that the XFV's top speeds would be eclipsed by contemporary fighters and that only highly experienced pilots could fly the aircraft, the project was cancelled in June 1955.|$|E
25|$|In SkyDrift players pilot one {{of several}} {{airplanes}} in a fictional racing competition. Gameplay is similar to other airplane racing games such as Plane Crazy and the <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> of Diddy Kong Racing. The game features 33 single player challenge stages as well as online multiplayer. While the primary focus is racing, dogfights play a large part in some of SkyDrifts game modes. Players are rewarded with boost, which provides a temporary burst of speed, by flying acrobatically, low to the ground, or by taking down opponents. Planes and their separate liveries are unlocked as players progress and complete specified challenges. As players progress on a given course they are sometimes presented with progressing environment hazards such as falling rocks or an avalanche.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{generating}} provably-safe conflict resolution maneuvers for aircraft in uncertain environments. We assume that a maneuver is composed of a sequence of <b>flight</b> <b>modes,</b> which are segments of constant heading, of constant bank angle, or of constant airspeed. Each of these <b>flight</b> <b>modes</b> has associated to it the kinematics of the aircraft, and hence the maneuver is a hybrid system. While the <b>flight</b> <b>modes</b> are defined ahead of time, their sequencing and parameter values do not necessarily have to be. We present an algorithm for generating provably safe maneuvers, which is based on a general procedure for designing controllers for hybrid systems. The result is a maneuver, proven to be safe within the limits of the models used, which is a familiar sequence of commands easily executable by the flight management systems. The maneuvers may be viewed as protocols, or "rules of the road", and are well-defined for each conflict scenario. We present results for two example maneuvers. ...|$|R

25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary {{actuating}} devices during normal <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient, atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Autobots salvage the Energon from the tower, Starscream and his Combaticons arrive to reclaim it. Onslaught, the Combaticons' leader, briefs {{them on a}} plan to ambush the Autobot {{transport}} carrying the Energon. The Combaticons Vortex, Brawl and [...] destroy the supports of the bridge the transport must cross. Starscream then orders the Decepticons to attack from the air despite warnings from Onslaught about the transport's anti-aircraft cannons. As a result, Swindle and Onslaught engage the Autobot ground forces and destroy the wheel struts underneath the transport. The transport activates its <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> and the Autobots engage the Decepticon team. Starscream orders the Combaticons to abort the mission, but they defy him and combine to form Bruticus, who brings the transport down, inadvertently losing half the Energon in the crash. Starscream arrives at the crash site and arrests the Combaticons for insubordination.|$|E
500|$|For the Bus, Altenau {{explained}} that it [...] "has all kinds of S.H.I.E.L.D. technology that is revealed over time as the series progresses. This includes an extra wing and engines in the rear giving the plane the ability to operate vertically for take-offs and landings, and even mid-flight u-turns ... FuseFX was {{given the opportunity to}} design the Bus. The design included many features from the start, such as the ability to do vertical take-offs and landing". FuseFX designed the Bus, and [...] "Extreme attention was paid when designing the textures and rigging for this asset. Half a dozen 8k maps make up the details on the plane which allows the camera to get right up {{to the surface of the}} plane without any loss of detail. A very complex rig controls every aspect of the plane from the landing gear, engine transformation, doors opening, lighting and even the wings have flex controls for the animators to sell the weight of this massive aircraft.

2500|$|James W. Hudspeth, an {{investigator}} {{of a previous}} near accident (an MD-83, starting from Lanzarote) that was similar in its details, {{pointed out that the}} fuse of the so-called [...] "left ground control relay" [...] at position K-33 of the control panel might have been the actual culprit in the erroneous flight mode: Hudspeth found out during a 2-week investigation at Lanzarote that it is customary in normal maintenance routine to temporarily remove this fuse to engage <b>flight</b> <b>mode,</b> but the fuse is afterwards sometimes not replaced correctly. Because of the frequent handling of this fuse, it is also not easy to visually check that the fuse is functioning properly (as is customary for the pilots to do when they enter the cockpit). Hudspeth speculates that this may have happened with both JK 5022 and Northwest Airlines Flight 255.|$|E
2500|$|Under these stresses, {{the crew}} {{continued}} their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were {{tuned to the}} two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the autopilot {{was set up to}} use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, [...] "Well, generally it's absolute shit here," [...] and that, [...] "(we) were lucky to land at the last moment." [...] The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was , but told PLF 101, [...] "you might try...(to make an approach)." [...] The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to PLF 101 concerning their distance from the runway {{and whether or not they}} were on the glidepath. The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not.|$|E
