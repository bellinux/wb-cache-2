The roles played by families, employers, trade unions, <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> community <b>organizations,</b> affiliation groups, and governmental agencies vary tremendously. Yet despite these differences, in almost every country the government is ultimately the pension insurer of last resort, either explicitly or implicitly. If designed well and managed well, a system of government pension insurance can enhance the wellbeing of the individuals served by it and even contribute towards the resilience of the financial system at large. But if designed or managed poorly, it can undermine economic security at both the micro and macro level. This paper explores the principles for the successful management of pension insurance and draws some lessons from the mistakes made by the U.

These operations contain several types of risks. Operational risks related to information security are becoming sensational for <b>financial</b> <b>organizations.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>organizations</b> concentrate to reduce the exposure of operational risk related to information security because these risks can affect the business to a great extent. <b>Financial</b> <b>organizations</b> need such policies and techniques which can be used to reduce the exposure of operational risk and to enhance information security. Several authors discuss about several types of operational risk related to information security, and several authors discuss about the techniques to avoid these risks in order to enhance information security. Problem: Investigate the concept of Operational Risks related to Information Security and how it is perceived in <b>Financial</b> <b>Organization?</b> Purpose: The aspiration of writing this report is to describe and analyze operational risks related to information security in <b>financial</b> <b>organizations</b> and then to present some suggestions in form of polices or techniques which can be used by <b>financial</b> <b>organizations</b> to enhance their information security. Method: Since the type of our thesis is Qualitative based, therefore exploratory research approach is used to carry out research. Authors tried to use secondary source of information as well as primary source of information in order to get maximum knowledge about the topic and to come up with maximum possible output. Target Audience The target audience in our mind for this paper consists of both, academic readers and professionals who have interest and some knowledge about information security and operational risks. Target audience for this research work includes professionals, academic readers and both investigated organizations (NCCPL and CDC). Conclusion By critically analyzing the literature written by various authors and the worthy information provided by our primary sources gave us the opportunity to develop a solution to keep the operations secure from risks and to fix the current problems related to information security. We found that there are different types of operational risks related to information security which can affect the business of <b>financial</b> <b>organizations</b> and there are various techniques which can be used by <b>financial</b> <b>organizations</b> to solve the current issue related to operational risks in order to enhance information security. It was also found that top management in <b>financial</b> <b>organizations</b> is interested in issues about information security operational risk and they showed their keen interest in adopting new effective techniques.

40|$|The authors {{extend the}} recent {{literature}} on the link between financial development and economic volatility {{by focusing on the}} channels through which the development of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> affects economic volatility. Their theoretical model predicts that well-developed <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> dampen the effect of real sector shocks on the volatility ofgrowth while magnifying the effect of monetary shocks-suggesting that, overall, <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> have no unambiguous effect on growth volatility. The authors test these predictions in a panel data set covering 63 countries over the period 1960 - 97, using the volatility of terms of trade to proxy for real volatility, and the volatility of inflation to proxy for monetary volatility. They find no robust relationship between the development of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and growth volatility, weak evidence that <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> dampen the effect of terms of trade volatility, and evidence that <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> magnify the impact of inflation volatility in low- and middle-income countries.

40|$|Microfinance is an {{effective}} tool for poverty reduction of rural areas in Nepal. Especially from 1990 s, the development of microfinance institutions (MFIs) has contributed to diminish the poverty of the country comparatively than previous days, by providing microfinance to the poor people. But still more than 25 % {{of the total population}} is under poverty (Microfinance Summit Nepal, 2010). To make these microfinance institutions more sustainable as well as more accessible to the poor is a crucial agenda for the country. There are several factors affecting the sustainability of MFIs, and governance is one of them. In this paper, there are the explanations of 2 types of governances. One type of governance is the governance inside the MFIs, which is distinguished as corporate governance. The other is governance as a policy body, the system of the Government regarding microfinance policy in Nepal. It can also be distinguished as good governance. Governance inside the MFIs is also meaningful essence to attempt the security of the customers of microfinance. The microfinance act and regulations are complicated in Nepal so as customersʼ point of view itʼs hard to deal with the process while using microfinance. Microfinance institutions in Nepal are governed by Banks and Financial Institutions Act 2006 (BAFIA) whereas there are lots of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCs) and Small Farmer Cooperatives Ltd (SFCLs), those are handled by Cooperative Act (1992). There is also <b>Financial</b> <b>Intermediary</b> Act 1998 to control the activities of <b>Financial</b> <b>Intermediary</b> Non-government <b>Organizations</b> (FINGOs).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the direct and}} indirect effects of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development on output fluctuations based on the theoretical works by Bacchetta and Caminal (2000) and Beck, Lundberg and Majnoni (2006).

This paper examines whether <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> serve as shock absorbers or shock magnifiers that mitigate or amplify the effect of real and monetary shocks on output fluctuations. Using data from 8 countries of ASEAN- 5 Plus 3, the empirical results indicate that (1) there is strong and robust evidence for the dampening effect of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development on output fluctuations via the propagation of real shocks, (2) there is somewhat weak evidence for the magnifying effect of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development via the propagation of monetary shocks and (3) <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development has strong direct impact on output fluctuations if countries are bankdependent in the cointegration regression.

40|$|Futures {{exchanges and}} other <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> assume {{counterparty}} risks and demand in return guarantees that these counterparties will deliver on their promises. It is often argued that to attract volume, <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> would settle for excessively low contractual guarantees. In Tano Santos and José Scheinkman (2001) we model financial intermediation {{in an environment}} where traders may choose to default, and we examine the characteristics of the equilibrium. In particular, we investigate whether competition implies excessively low standards. We show that in fact, when society punishes default and intermediaries can impose collateral requirements to effectively limit the size of positions, competition leads to a (constrained) optimal amount of contractual guarantees. In Santos and Scheinkman (2001) we assume that exchanges cannot control the size of the positions taken by individuals, but we preclude investors from participating in more than one exchange. This ignores the effect that trading with one <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> may have on the risks faced by other <b>intermediaries.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> typically cannot control the amount of risk that counterparties will take with other intermediaries.
