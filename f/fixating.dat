5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by <b>fixating</b> a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply <b>fixating</b> on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E

Acuity declines towards the periphery in an inverse-linear fashion (i.e. the decline follows a hyperbola).|$|E
40|$|The Queensland <b>Fixated</b> Threat Assessment Centre (QFTAC) is an {{integrated}} police-mental health agency established in Queensland, Australia, in 2013 to deal specifically with lone, <b>fixated</b> persons. Many {{of these individuals}} are mentally ill, but are unknown to psychiatric services or have disengaged from care. QFTAC identifies <b>fixated</b> persons through their ominous contacts with public office holders and intervenes, often by facilitating mental health care, to prevent progression to harmful outcomes. Prior to the G 20 Meetings convened in Queensland in 2014 there was no empirically based procedural framework for managing <b>fixated</b> persons at major public figure gatherings. This paper describes {{the development of a}} diversionary model for assessing and managing <b>fixated</b> persons during major events, which combined the resources and expertise of police intelligence officers and forensic mental health practitioners. This approach effectively mitigated the risk posed by <b>fixated</b> individuals to delegates, staff and mentally ill intruders in the secure, armed environment of these events. The model highlights the importance for police, security and mental health services of considering <b>fixated</b> loners in major event planning, {{for the safety of the}} event, the public and vulnerable, mentally ill, <b>fixated</b> persons...|$|R
30|$|A search error {{occurs when}} the eyes fail to <b>fixate</b> a {{critical}} region of a visual scene, rendering a feature undetected; these have also been labeled as scanning errors because the critical feature {{was not in the}} scan path (Cain, Adamo, & Mitroff, 2013). For example, a radiologist failing to <b>fixate</b> a lung nodule (Manning, Ethell, Donovan, & Crawford, 2006), a pathologist failing to <b>fixate</b> large nucleoli in pleomorphic cells (Brunyé, Mercan, Weaver, & Elmore, 2017), or a neuro-radiologist failing to <b>fixate</b> a cerebral infarction (Matsumoto et al., 2011). Theoretically, if the diagnostician has not <b>fixated</b> a diagnostically relevant region of a medical image then successful search has not occurred, and without it, recognition and decision-making are not possible.|$|R

25|$|The {{destruction}} of the Second Temple in 70 CE marked {{a turning point in}} Jewish history. In the absence of the Temple, the synagogue became the center of Jewish life. When the Temple was destroyed, Judaism responded by <b>fixating</b> on the commandments of the Torah. Synagogues replaced the temple as a central meeting place, and the rabbis replaced high priests as Jewish community leaders. Because of the rabbis' dominance after 70 CE, the era is called the rabbinic period. The rabbis filled the void of Jewish leadership {{in the aftermath of the}} Great Revolt, and they created a new kind of Judaism through their literature and teachings.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{main risk}} of serious harm at major public figure gatherings {{comes not from}} terrorists or {{criminal}} activity but from <b>fixated</b> persons, {{many of whom have}} a serious mental illness. This paper reviews a collaborative mental healthpolice diversionary model for assessing and managing mentally ill individuals who attend major events because of their fixation on a dignitary or some idiosyncratic cause. Method: We examine the role of a multidisciplinary <b>fixated</b> threat assessment service during the pre-operational, operational and post-operational phases of major events in Queensland in 2014, including the G 20 World Leaders? Summit. The benefits and challenges of this unique approach are reviewed. Results: The royal visit and G 20 Finance Ministers? Meeting presented opportunities for the Queensland <b>Fixated</b> Threat Assessment Centre to develop and refine its approach to assessing and managing the threat posed by <b>fixated</b> persons at such events. Based on this experience, we also developed a typology to assist in the assessment of mentally ill people who present at public figure gatherings. In the week prior to the G 20 Summit, six <b>fixated</b> people required hospitalisation for acute psychosis. A further 18 cases were identified during the event, one of whom was an involuntary patient whose leave from hospital was revoked as a consequence of his concerning behaviour at one of the G 20 venues. There were no other admissions to hospital during the event, but in the remaining cases, where indicated, follow-up was arranged through the treating mental health service or general practitioner. There were no disruptive incidents involving <b>fixated</b> individuals during the G 20. Conclusion: This novel diversionary model for assessing and intervening with concerning, <b>fixated</b> persons at major events proved effective in mitigating the risk posed by these individuals. It also highlighted the need for police, security and mental health services to consider the <b>fixated</b> in major event planning, {{for the safety of the}} event, the public and vulnerable mentally ill, <b>fixated</b> persons...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{contributing}} to a seamless visual experience is object correspondence-that is, the integration of pre- and postsaccadic visual object information into one representation. Previous research had suggested that before the execution of a saccade, a target object is loaded into visual working memory and subsequently is used to locate the target object after the saccade. Until now, studies on object correspondence have not taken previous fixations into account. In the present study, we investigated the influence of previously <b>fixated</b> information on object correspondence. To this end, we adapted a gaze correction paradigm in which a saccade was executed toward either a previously <b>fixated</b> or a novel target. During the saccade, the stimuli were displaced such that the participant's gaze landed between the target stimulus and a distractor. Participants then executed a corrective saccade to the target. The results indicated that these corrective saccades had lower latencies toward previously <b>fixated</b> than toward nonfixated targets, indicating object-specific facilitation. In two follow-up experiments, we showed that presaccadic spatial and object (surface feature) information can contribute separately to the execution of a corrective saccade, {{as well as in}} conjunction. Whereas the execution of a corrective saccade to a previously <b>fixated</b> target object at a previously <b>fixated</b> location is slowed down (i. e., inhibition of return), corrective saccades toward either a previously <b>fixated</b> target object or a previously <b>fixated</b> location are facilitated. We concluded that corrective saccades are executed on the basis of object files rather than of unintegrated feature information...|$|R
