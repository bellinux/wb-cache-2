This will allow mobile terminal to stay in connection even they are migrating into different segment coverage through the handoff process. With the increase of teletraffic demands in mobile cellular system, hierarchical cellular systems have been adopted extensively for more efficient channel utilization and better QoS (Quality of Service). This paper presents a bidirectional call overflow scheme between two layers of microcells and macrocells, where handoffs are decided by the velocity of mobile making the call. To ensure that handoff calls are given higher priorities, it is assumed that guard channels are assigned in both macrocells and microcells. A <b>hysteresis</b> <b>value</b> introduced in mobile velocity is used to allow mobile roam in the same cell if its velocity changes back within the set threshold values.

Most models have relied on conventional mathematical models which does not adequately track some of the multifaceted challenges of such a system.

This translates into better user satisfaction and a more efficient use of network resources. Several methods for load balancing have been proposed.

40|$|Icing is a {{major problem}} for ships, airplanes, and wind turbines, among many other applications. To reduce or remove icing is {{extremely}} costly and is constantly in need of manpower. In this thesis the possibility of a passive resolution is investigated; a surface that reduces icing without external influence. A hydrophobic surface on steel is first developed through modification of topography and subsequent coating. Further, the icing behaviour of these hydrophobic surfaces are investigated. The surface modification was performed by creating a hierarchical surface roughness by sand blasting and subsequent synthesis of ZnO-nanowires, a combination not found similar in literature. Samples with solely micrometric and nanometric roughness were also created in order to compare with the hierarchical roughness. Deposition of a highly hydrophobic coating layer was performed by dip-coating and vapour deposition. When nanometric roughness was induced, dip-coating was no longer an applicable method of deposition as the coating layer was too thick and compromised the topography. Vapour deposition had no such negative effects on the topography, which resulted in superior contact angle values. Superhydrophobic contact angle values (> 150) were achieved for all samples where roughness was induced. The superior hydrophobic behaviour was observed on the sample with hierarchical roughness, with a contact angle of 164 +/- 1. 54 degrees. Upon measuring the contact angle hysteresis, superhydrophobic behaviour was not observed. The hierarchical sample showed a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>value</b> of approximately 80 degrees. The sample with superior hysteresis values was the sand blasted sample, with a value of 37 degrees. These values suggest poor performance regarding icephobicity, as hysteresis values near zero are desired. During the icing experiments, all samples showed the same behaviour with no definite prevention of crystallisation. Upon deicing the ice melted and slid off of all samples within 6 minutes, except the hierarchical sample where the water seemed to adhere more strongly, leaving the sample wet {{for a longer period of}} time. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the ZnO-nanowires promote an undesirable state of wetting, Wenzel wetting, which would increase the adhesion of water significantly, causing large hysteresis values and no slide-off behaviour. The <b>hysteresis</b> <b>value</b> measured on the sand blasted sample is however also too high. This may be due to misalignments of the hydrophobic molecules deposited on the surface. In order to achieve hydrophobic surfaces with anti-icing properties, the sole development of hierarchical roughness is thus not enough. The dimensions of both the micrometric and nanometric structures must be within the range of achieving the desired Cassie-Baxter wetting state, and resist a subsequent transition to the Wenzel state. This may be achieved by an increase in ZnO-nanowire density and height, along with a decrease of the diameters. In addition, the coating needs investigation to ensure the correct alignment of the hydrophobic molecules...|$|E

We have designed and implemented the algorithm based on a simulation model of a 37 -cell UMTS/GSM system consisting of an island of 7 UMTS cells surrounded by 30 GSM cells. The simulation model includes mobility of all users in the system and spatial correlation of the log-normal shadow losses in the 2. 1 GHz (for UMTS) and 900 MHz (for GSM) frequency bands.
