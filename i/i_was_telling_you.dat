25|$|In 1732 Lord Cobham's nephew Gilbert West wrote {{a lengthy}} poem, The Gardens of the Right Honourable Richard Viscount Cobham, that is {{actually}} {{a guide to the}} gardens in verse form. Charles Bridgeman commissioned 15 engravings of the gardens from Jacques Rigaud which were published in 1739. In 1744 Benton Seeley published A Description of the Gardens of Lord Cobham at Stow Buckinghamshire. In 1748 William Gilpin produced the Views of the Temples and other Ornamental Buildings in the Gardens at Stow followed in 1749 by A Dialogue upon the Gardens at Stow. Unlicensed copies of all three books were published in 1750 by George Bickham as The Beauties of Stow. To cater to the large number of French visitors, a French guidebook, Les Charmes de Stow, was published in 1748. In the 1750s Jean-Jacques Rousseau had visited the gardens and his writings about the gardens helped spread their fame and influence throughout Europe. He had this to say 'Stowe is composed of very beautiful and very picturesque spots chosen to represent different kinds of scenery, all of which seem natural except when considered as a whole, as in the Chinese gardens of which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you.</b> The master and creator of this superb domain has also erected ruins, temples and ancient buildings, like the scenes, exhibit a magnificence which is more than human'. Georges-Louis Le Rouge published in 1777 Détails de nouveaux jardins à la mode that included engravings of buildings at Stowe as well as at other famous gardens in Britain. In Germany Christian Cay Lorenz Hirschfeld published Theorie der Gartenkunst in 5 volumes in Leipzig 1779–1785, that included Stowe. The last edition of the Seeley guide was published in 1827. In 1805-9 John Claude Nattes painted 105 wash drawings of both the house and gardens.|$|E
