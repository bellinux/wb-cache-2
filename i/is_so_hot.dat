500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, the lead vocalist of Yellowcard, Ryan Key, praised Clarkson in the music video. He said, [...] "She is so unbelievably gorgeous in that video that is all over TV right now [...] The wet wedding dress and the wet hair and ... come on, man! Who knew? She <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot.</b> She looks so good in it." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy opined that the music video is Clarkson's best video to date. The music video had a successful run at Total Request Live where it topped the chart for 33 days, a record that Clarkson holds for the longest stay by a female artist at {{number one on the}} chart.|$|E
500|$|In a {{cover story}} for Entertainment Weekly, Mars stated that the song [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] was {{rejected}} by a [...] "music industry decision-maker" [...] (a person he won't name) because of his race. That experience made him feel like a [...] "mutant", {{and he says that}} was his lowest point. [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E

500|$|The Shiva Purana {{describes}} {{that the}} creator god Brahma created all male beings, the Prajapatis, {{and told them to}} regenerate, which they were unable to do. Confronted with the resulting decline in the pace of creation, Brahma was perplexed and contemplated on Shiva for help. To enlighten Brahma of his folly, Shiva appeared before him as Ardhanarishvara. Brahma prayed to the female half of Shiva to give him a female to continue creation. The goddess agreed and created various female powers from her body, thereby allowing creation to progress. In other Puranas like the Linga Purana, Vayu Purana, Vishnu Purana, Skanda Purana, Kurma Purana, and Markandeya Purana, Rudra (identified with Shiva) appears as Ardhanarishvara, emerging from Brahma's head, forehead, mouth or soul as the embodiment of Brahma's fury and frustration due to the slow pace of creation. Brahma asks Rudra to divide himself, and the latter complies by dividing into male and female. Numerous beings, including the 11 Rudras and various female shaktis, are created from both the halves. In some versions, the goddess unites with Shiva again and promises to be born as Sati on earth to be Shiva's wife. In the Linga Purana, the Ardhanarishvara Rudra <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> that in the process of appearing from Brahma's forehead, he burns Brahma himself. Ardhanarishvara Shiva then enjoys his own half – the Great Goddess – by [...] "the path of yoga" [...] and creates Brahma and Vishnu from her body. In the repetitive cycle of aeons, Ardhanarishvara is ordained to reappear at the beginning of every creation as in the past.|$|E
500|$|Upon the album's {{release in}} early April 1962 in both mono and stereo format, a {{reviewer}} for Billboard magazine claimed that [...] "In {{addition to being}} powerful dealer material, this package will fracture knowledgeable jockeys who will find in it a wealth of material to talk {{about as well as}} play." [...] By mid-April, reports of the album's sales and radio airplay had started coming in from cities such as Dallas and Philadelphia. On June 23, 1962, the mono issue of Modern Sounds replaced the West Side Story soundtrack album as the number one album in the United States, knocking it {{off the top of the}} Billboard Pop Albums chart. The album spawned four charting singles, [...] "Born to Lose", [...] "Careless Love", [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You" [...] and [...] "You Don't Know Me", the latter two of which went number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The hit singles quickly gained a significant amount of radio airplay on both country and R stations. By mid-May, the album's lead single, [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You", had sold 700,000 copies within its first four weeks of release. Record dealers began describing the album as [...] "equal in sales action to some of the early Presley disks" [...] and, after moving 400,000 copies of the single, influential Atlanta record distributor Gwen Kestler told Billboard magazine that [...] "the record <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> in her district that people who don't even own record players are buying it." [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You" [...] hit number one on the Billboard Pop Singles chart on June 2, spending five consecutive weeks at the top of the chart. By the time it fell off the top, the single was reported to have reached nearly a million and a half in sales, moving over 100,000 copies per week. In July the record spent two weeks at number one in Great Britain.|$|E

2500|$|The Norris Geyser Basin [...] is {{the hottest}} geyser basin {{in the park and}} is located near the {{northwest}} edge of Yellowstone Caldera near Norris Junction and on the intersection of three major faults. The Norris-Mammoth Corridor is a fault that runs from Norris north through Mammoth to the Gardiner, Montana, area. The Hebgen Lake fault runs from northwest of West Yellowstone, Montana, to Norris. This fault experienced an earthquake in 1959 that measured 7.4 on the Richter scale (sources vary on exact magnitude between 7.1 and 7.8; see 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake). Norris Geyser Basin <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> and dynamic because these two faults intersect with the ring fracture zone that resulted from the creation of the Yellowstone Caldera of 640,000 years ago.|$|E
2500|$|Laser {{medicine}}: {{medicine and}} especially dentistry have found many new uses for diode lasers. The shrinking size {{and cost of}} the units and their increasing user friendliness makes them very attractive to clinicians for minor soft tissue procedures. Diode wavelengths range from 810 [...] to 1,100 nm, are poorly absorbed by soft tissue, and are not used for cutting or ablation. Soft tissue is not cut by the laser’s beam, but is instead cut by contact with a hot charred glass tip. The laser’s irradiation is highly absorbed at the distal end of the tip and heats it up to 500°C to 900°C. [...] Because the tip <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot,</b> {{it can be used}} to cut soft-tissue and can cause hemostasis through cauterization and carbonization. Diode lasers when used on soft tissue can cause extensive collateral thermal damage to surrounding tissue.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 fashion {{consultant}} Gok Wan cited a {{broderie anglaise}} top worn by Nadine Coyle {{of the group}} Girls Aloud as evidence that [...] "the folk/boho look <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> for summer", while Marks & Spencer employed the headline [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] to summarise its summer range, which owed much to the colours and patterns of the early 1970s. At the beginning of June that year fashion writer Carrie Gorman announced that [...] "this week, shopping is about going bright and bold with a boho feel", citing, among other trends, multi-coloured tank tops ("or dress, according to your height") by Harlow, {{said to be the}} favorite label of American actress Rachel Bilson. Bilson has cited Kate Moss and actress Diane Keaton as among her stylistic influences; striped multi-colored panties with brodierie edging were a feature of her photographic shoot for Stuff magazine in 2004.|$|E
