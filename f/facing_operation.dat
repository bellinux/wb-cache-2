Among many experimental parameters, the change of the pitch of fine grooves on a lapping plate formed by the <b>facing</b> <b>operation</b> has a significant effect on the removal rate. This agrees well with the calculated number of loose grains under various pitches of groove. The average removal rate with fixed and loose grains was found to be about 2. 7 times higher than that with only fixed grains. These results indicate that during lapping, the material is mainly removed by loose grains. It is evident from AFM images that the lapped surface with material removed by fixed grains differs very much from that with material removed simultaneously by fixed and loose grains...|$|E
40|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} is an applied {{methodology of}} scientific objective techniques which {{will improve the}} tasks in a process to be performed {{with a minimum of}} non-value-added activities. It is being increasingly adopted as a potential solution for many automotive manufacturing industries. This paper addresses the implementation of lean principles in an automotive component manufacturing company with a focus on current manufacturing practices and visual identification of non-value-added time, such as bottle necking, waiting time and material handling, etc. The typical operations involved in making the Glow Plug are caulking, tig welding, MgO filling & O-ring pressing, swaging, facing, thread rolling, inspection and assembly. The <b>facing</b> <b>operation</b> can be eliminated by stabilizing the variations generated during the MgO filling machine. The MgO filling activity contains various forms of non-value-added activities such as worn-out gripper, insufficient clamping tension, physical shaking of the WPC on the agitation unit instead of fine vibration, Jerky insertion of the WPC shank into the agitation locator. It was identified that approximately 15 mm material was wasted per piece, though there is no value addition on the part.

40|$|The {{concept of}} SDN {{has emerged as}} a way to address {{numerous}} challenges with traditional network architectures by decoupling network control and forwarding. So far, the use cases for SDN mainly targeted data-center applications. This article considers SDN for network carriers, <b>facing</b> <b>operation</b> of large-scale networks with millions of customers, multiple technologies, and high availability demands. With specific carrier-grade features such as scalability, reliability, flexibility, modularity, and virtualization in mind, the SPARC EU project has developed the SPARC SplitArchitecture concept. The SplitArchitecture control plane allows hierarchical layering of several control plane layers which can be flexibly mapped to data plane layers. Between control layers open interfaces are used. Furthermore, SplitArchitecture proposes an additional split of forwarding and processing functions in data path elements, enabling switch based OAM functionality and handling of tunneling techniques. The SplitArchitecture concept is evaluated in a prototype demonstrating an SDN version of BRAS: the floating BRAS. The floating BRAS allows creation of residential Internet access services with dynamically managed BRAS instances. The demo is based on a controller enabling protected MPLS transport connections spanning SDN-controlled aggregation and IP/MPLS-based core domains. The prototype showcases how SplitArchitecture enables virtualization of service nodes in an SDN-controlled network, leading to increased flexibility in configuration and placement of service creation functions. Overall, the results show that it is technically and economically beneficial to apply SDN, and specifically the SplitArchitecture concept, to the carrier domain.
