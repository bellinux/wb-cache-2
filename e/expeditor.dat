During this timeframe Marxuach had been promoted three times, from first lieutenant to major. As major, {{he served as}} {{the commander of the}} 2nd Infantry Battalion of the 296th. Together with his men, he received intense jungle training and was later put in charge of a rescue mission which searched for the remains of various American soldiers who perished aboard a C-45 <b>Expeditor</b> military aircraft which crashed in the Panamanian jungles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Royal Canadian Air Force’s {{standard}} elementary training aircraft was the de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk. Flight instruction {{was completed by}} student pilots on the DHC-1 before they progressed to the then-brand-new Canadair CT-114 Tutor jet trainer. A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as {{it was felt that}} the CT-114 was easy enough to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a wash-out rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots and it was clear that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF’s previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's <b>Expeditor</b> twin-engine aircraft, a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971. The first CT-134 arrived at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971.|$|E

5000|$|Production got {{an early}} boost when Nationalist China paid the company US$750,000 for six M18R light bombers, {{but by the}} time of the U.S. entry into World War II, only 39 Model 18s had been sold, of which 29 were for {{civilian}} customers. Work began in earnest on a variant specifically for training military pilots, bombardiers, and navigators. The effort resulted in the Army AT-7 and Navy SNB. Further development led to the AT-11 and SNB-2 navigation trainers and the C-45 military transport. The United States Air Force (USAF) Strategic Air Command had Model 18 variants (AT-11 Kansans, C-45 <b>Expeditors,</b> F-2 <b>Expeditors</b> (the [...] "F" [...] standing for [...] "Fotorecon", short for [...] "photographic reconnaissance"), and UC-45 <b>Expeditors)</b> from 1946 until 1951. From 1951 to 1955, the USAF had many of its aircraft remanufactured with new fuselages, wing center sections, and undercarriages to take advantage of the improvements to the civil models since the end of World War II. Eventually, 900 aircraft were remanufactured to be similar to the then-current Model D18S and given new designations, constructor's numbers and Air Force serial numbers. The USN had many of its surviving aircraft remanufactured as well, these being redesignated as SNB-5s and SNB-5Ps. The C-45 flew in USAF service until 1963, the USN retired its last SNB in 1972, while the U.S. Army flew its C-45s until 1976. In later years, the military called these aircraft [...] "bug smashers" [...] in reference to their extensive use supplying mandatory flight hours for desk-bound aviators in the Pentagon.|$|R

For multi-engine aircraft, trainees went to an Advanced Flying School where they would train on <b>Expeditors</b> or Mitchells.
