5|$|The Avianca Flight 52 {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK-2016). The {{aircraft was}} manufactured in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca from Pan Am in 1977. By {{the time of the}} crash, the aircraft was 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours. The 707 was equipped with four JT3D-3B engines modified with a <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> to reduce noise pollution. Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a five-percent fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> along with an additional five-percent overburn due to the age of the aircraft. Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft's autopilot, including the altitude hold function.|$|E

5000|$|Super 748 - Basically {{the same}} as the 2B but fitted with <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> on the engines. 8 Built.|$|R
50|$|The JT8D-217 and -219 engine(s) {{were tested}} in 2001 and were deemed {{suitable}} replacements for the old TF33 engines on military and commercial aircraft {{as part of the}} Super 27 re-engining program. The updated engines offer reduced (Stage-3) noise compliance standards without the need for <b>hush</b> <b>kits,</b> enhanced short field performance, steeper and faster climb rates with roughly a 10% reduction in fuel burn for extended range.|$|R
50|$|Speed was {{increased}} by 50 mi/h km/h by {{replacement of the}} two side engines with the JT8D-217 or the JT8D-219, which are also found on many MD-80s, along {{with the addition of}} <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> to the center engine. Winglets were added to some of these aircraft to increase fuel efficiency. This modification was originally developed by Valsan Partners, but was later marketed by Quiet Wing Technologies in Redmond, Washington.|$|R
50|$|Operations of the 707 were {{threatened}} by the enactment of international noise regulations in 1985. Shannon Engineering of Seattle developed a <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> with funding from Tracor, Inc, of Austin, Texas. By the late 1980s, 172 Boeing 707s had been equipped with the Quiet 707 package. Boeing acknowledged that more 707s were in service then than before the <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> was available. Most remaining 707s are in freighter form, or as business jets.|$|E
50|$|Since September 1, 2010, 727 jetliners (including {{those with}} a <b>hush</b> <b>kit)</b> are banned from some Australian {{airports}} because they are too loud.|$|E
50|$|Hush kits add {{weight to}} {{aircraft}} that are fitted with them. They sometimes reduce engine efficiency, which can lower aircraft range and/or cruise speed. For example, a <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> for the Gulfstream II might weigh 234 lb (total airplane weight 65500 lb) and cause about a 1.6% reduction in aircraft range {{due to the}} hush kit's reduction in engine efficiency. Another <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> for the Gulfstream G-II and G-III jets weighs about 370 lb and has a calculated 2% drop in range, although the reduction in range has not been noticed during actual flights. A different example is Federal Express's <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> for its Boeing 727s, which adds 900 lb of extra weight (total airplane weight up to 190000 lb), causing a 0.5% increase in fuel burn for short trips and no measurable increase for long flights.|$|E
5000|$|Independent Air {{was granted}} a license for {{worldwide}} charters in 1984. The company purchased two Boeing 707s (N7232X and N7231T) from Trans World Airlines. The company's permission to operate these aircraft was withdrawn in 1984 following new noise regulations. The company was exempted from the permission withdrawal following a successful lawsuit. In 1985, the aircraft were fitted with <b>hush</b> <b>kits,</b> allowing the aircraft to meet Stage 3 noise levels.|$|R
50|$|The 727 {{was heavily}} {{produced}} into the 1970s; the last 727 {{was completed in}} 1984. , a total of 64 Boeing 727s (4× 727-100s and 60× -200s) were in commercial service with 26 airlines, plus a few more in government and private use. Airport noise regulations have led to 727s being equipped with <b>hush</b> <b>kits.</b> Since 1964 there have been 118 fatal incidents involving the Boeing 727. Successor models include variants of the 737 and the 757-200.|$|R
5000|$|BCal {{decided to}} retire the four ex-Laker One-Eleven 300s and to acquire another {{second-hand}} One-Eleven 500, {{giving it a}} total fleet strength of 13. Standardizing its short-haul, narrowbodied fleet on the same aircraft sub-type enhanced its ability to interchange aircraft across that fleet. As part of a [...] "mid-life update", of its entire One-Eleven fleet, <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> were fitted to comply with stricter, post-1985 noise abatement rules. This {{was to keep the}} One-Eleven effective until more modern aircraft were delivered in 1988.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> is {{a device}} for {{reducing}} noise from an engine. It is typically {{used on a}} low-bypass turbofan engine in older commercial aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Avianca Flight 52 {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK 2016). The {{aircraft was}} manufactured in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca from Pan Am in 1977. By {{the time of the}} crash, the aircraft was 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours.

5000|$|Current {{regulations}} {{require that}} a 727 in commercial service must be retrofitted with a <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> to reduce engine noise to Stage 3 levels. One such <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> {{is offered by}} FedEx, and has been purchased by over 60 customers. [...] Aftermarket winglet kits, originally developed by Valsan Partners and later marketed by Quiet Wing Corp. have been installed on many 727s to reduce noise at lower speeds, {{as well as to}} reduce fuel consumption. In addition, Raisbeck Engineering developed packages to enable 727s to meet the Stage 3 noise requirements. These packages managed to get light- and medium-weight 727s to meet Stage 3 with simple changes to the flap and slat schedules. For heavier-weight 727s, exhaust mixers must be added to meet Stage 3. American Airlines ordered and took delivery of 52 Raisbeck 727 Stage 3 systems. Other customers included TWA, Pan Am, Air Algérie, TAME, and many smaller airlines.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{aircraft}} {{equipped with}} high-bypass turbofan engines {{are able to}} comply with contemporary aviation noise abatement laws and ICAO regulations. <b>Hush</b> <b>kits</b> are used on the many older freight and passenger aircraft still in service, such as the Boeing 727 and 737-200, Douglas DC-8 and DC-9, and Tupolev Tu-154. While hushkits are normally found on older aircraft, small business jets and other aircraft {{too small to be}} fitted with large, high bypass turbofan engines will be manufactured with hushkits installed, a more economical way to meet noise restrictions than expensive engine or design changes.|$|R
25|$|In 1977, fatigue cracks were {{discovered}} in {{the wings of the}} British Airways Trident fleet. The aircraft were ferried back to the manufacturer and repaired, then returned to service. On 1 January 1986, new ICAO noise legislation came into force, requiring operators of first- and second-generation jet airliners to have <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> fitted to their engines; the main British operator of the type, British Airways, viewed the refit as unviable and instead they chose to phase the Trident out of their fleet. A total of 117 Tridents were produced, while the Boeing 727, built to the original specification for the Trident, sold 1,832 units.|$|R
50|$|Hawaiian Airlines {{began to}} expand its {{footprint}} throughout the 1980s, {{as the result of}} intense competition on inter-island routes created by the entrance of Mid Pacific Air into the market. In 1985 the company began its first foray outside of the inter-island market through charter services to the South Pacific and then {{throughout the rest of the}} Pacific using Douglas DC-8 aircraft. Despite the early successes of this new business, Hawaiian was forced to curtail its charter services when the Federal Government banned all DC-8 and B707 aircraft without <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> from operating within the US. Hawaiian did, however, manage to gain a short exemption for its South Pacific services.|$|R
50|$|While hush kits {{effectively}} reduce {{noise emissions}} from older aircraft, noise cannot always {{be reduced to}} the level of modern planes at a reasonable cost. In 1999 this has led to a dispute between the United States and the European Union. The EU's proposed noise ordinances effectively prevented the use of hush kits in Europe, reducing the value of the mostly American used airplanes so equipped and hurting the profits of American <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> manufacturers. EU Regulation 925/99 was passed over US threats to ban Concorde, but was superseded and effectively repealed by EU Directive No. 2002/30/EC issued March 26, 2002.|$|E
50|$|In 1993 another airline called Air Caribbean appeared. It {{was based}} at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad and Tobago, and used YS-11 {{aircraft}} {{for the first}} five years. The airline seemed to be doing reasonably well until the arrival of ageing Boeing 737 aircraft, in July 1998. These aircraft had fuel-thirsty and noisy JT8D engines, and were a financial burden on the airline. Air Caribbean intended to use the 737s on flights to Miami International Airport, but the planes were too noisy for American noise regulations. One of the 737s was so old that a <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> couldn't be fitted. As a consequence, the planes had to be grounded whilst the hush-kits were fitted to the suitable aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Jet {{aircraft}} {{generate a}} lot of noise, contributing to noise pollution near airports. In modern high-bypass turbofan engines, the fan mounted afore the jet engine core is very large. The bigger the fan {{in comparison to the}} jet core, the more effective the bypass air is in enveloping the jet exhaust {{at the rear of the}} engine, reducing noise. The larger turbines needed to spin the large fan slow the jet exhaust, which also reduces noise. A <b>hush</b> <b>kit</b> produces a similar effect, using several modifications to the existing engine. Primarily, a device called a multilobe exhaust mixer on the rear of the engine mixes the exhaust gases of the jet core with the surrounding air and the small amount of bypass air available. Similar systems are also employed on many modern turbofan engines as standard equipment to further reduce noise. Most kits also make further modifications to the exhaust with acoustically treated tailpipes, revised inlet nacelles and guide vanes, all of which reduce forward propagating high-pitched noise caused by the small, high-speed fan.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, fatigue cracks were {{discovered}} in {{the wings of the}} British Airways Trident fleet. The aircraft were ferried back to the manufacturer and repaired, then returned to service. On 1 January 1986, new ICAO noise legislation came into force, requiring operators of first- and second-generation jet airliners to have <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> fitted to their engines; the main British operator of the type, British Airways, viewed the refit as unviable and instead they chose to phase the Trident out of their fleet.

50|$|During 2013, the FAA {{modified}} 14 CFR part 91 {{rules to}} prohibit {{the operation of}} jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that were not Stage 3 noise compliant after 31 December 2015. The Falcon 20 was listed explicitly in Federal Register 78 FR 39576. Any examples of the type that were not been modified, either by the installation of Stage 3 noise-compliant engines or have had <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> installed upon non-compliant engines, were no longer permitted to fly anywhere in the contiguous 48 states after 31 December 2015. However, 14 CFR §91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less - lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after 31 December 2015.|$|R
50|$|South Pacific Island Airways (SPIA) was {{an airline}} {{operating}} flights in the Pacific including American Samoa and Hawaii with {{service to the}} west coast of U.S. and Canada as well as to Alaska, New Zealand, Guam and Tahiti from 1973 to 1987. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the carrier in 1984, when it almost flew a charter flight into the airspace of the Soviet Union. SPIA was allowed to continue operations after some management changes were made at the airline, but was grounded again in 1985 due to some allegedly questionable dealings involving engine <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> for its Boeing 707 jetliners. South Pacific continued to operate limited services until it ceased all operations in 1987.|$|R
50|$|Other {{proposed}} {{noise mitigation}} measures include a barrier {{on the north}} side of the airport and the extension of Runway 8-26 by 1850 ft to the east and displacing the western end of the runway by the same amount, thereby maintaining the runway's length. Community opposition to the construction of a barrier led the State to abandon the idea. It remains unclear if the Hawaii State Department of Transportation will proceed with relocating Runway 8-26 east by 1,850 feet, especially given the 2009 demise of Aloha Airlines, whose older generation Boeing 737 fleet was considerably louder than Hawaiian Airlines' relatively modern Boeing 717s. However those Boeing 737 aircraft are still being used by Aloha Air Cargo (although equipped with <b>hush</b> <b>kits)</b> which continues with night flights to Honolulu.|$|R
5000|$|Because of federally {{mandated}} {{aircraft noise}} restrictions, {{the company went}} public to raise funding {{to pay for the}} required <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> on the aircraft. In an effort to increase aircraft use, the aircraft began operating as a separate charter company after being rebranded as Skyworld Airlines under FAR part 121, enabling them to operate non-travel club charter services as well. In the wake of public ownership, and after several leadership changes, the company essentially suffered a hostile take over. The new controlling interests liquidated the aircraft assets and shut down the airline portion, remaining open as a travel club sans-aircraft. They sold just one of the B707 aircraft, a [...] "combi" [...] (having been originally built by Boeing to be easily convertible to a freighter) for over $4 million.|$|R
50|$|After {{the name}} change from Atlanta Skylarks to Independent Air, the company {{acquired}} two Boeing 707-331Bs from TWA (N7232X and N7231T). The two Boeing 720s were disposed of. Initially, {{the company was}} not granted {{permission to use the}} 707s in the US since their engines were not fitted with <b>hush</b> <b>kits.</b> In 1987, Independent Air added a Boeing 727-100 (N154FN) to their fleet but this aircraft was returned to the lessor before the end of that year. Independent Air also leased a Boeing 707 from Skystar International (N728Q) in 1987. The fleet's mainstays (N7231T and N7232X) were sold to International Air Leases Inc. in 1988 and leased back. The Boeing 707 N7231T that was lost in the Azores was replaced in 1989 by a 707 from Denver Ports of Call (N457PC). Both aircraft were returned to International Air Leases in 1990, when Independent Air ceased operations.|$|R
50|$|One-Elevens {{remained}} in widespread use with European operators into the 1990s. Once retired from major operators, {{they were often}} sold to smaller airlines, often in the Far East and Africa. Nigeria was a major operator until the type was grounded after a crash in 2002. A major factor for the withdrawal from European service of remaining One-Elevens was the Stage III noise abatement regulations, which came into effect from March 2003. Bringing the Rolls-Royce Spey engines into compliance with the noise regulations with <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> was expensive, and many European operators chose {{to dispose of the}} type from their fleets. In 2010, the European Aviation Safety Agency accepted an Airbus request to revoke the Type Certificate for the BAC One-Eleven. As a result, BAC One-Eleven aircraft registered in any EU Member State are no longer eligible for a normal certificate of airworthiness. In December 2012, the last operational One-Eleven in the UK, which had continued to fly as a military aircraft, was retired.|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} {{model of}} the aircraft, designated the Falcon 200, was developed. This variant, powered {{by a pair of}} Garrett ATF3 engines, featured several major improvements to increase its range, capacity and comfort. Additionally, a number of Falcon 20s that had been originally powered by the CF700 engines were later re-engined with the Garrett TFE731 turbofan engine. The aircraft proved to be so popular that production did not end until 1988, by which point it had been superseded by more advanced developments of the Falcon family. Due to the increasing implementation of noise abatement regulations, the Falcon 20 has either been subject to restrictions on its use in some nations, or been retrofitted with Stage 3 noise-compliant engines or <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> upon its non-compliant engines. The type has also been used as a flying test bed and aerial laboratory by a number of operators, including NASA and Cobham Aviation. In November 2012, a Falcon 20 had the distinction of becoming the first civil jet to fly on 100 per cent biofuel.|$|R
25|$|The 89-seat One-Eleven 400s and 119-seat One-Eleven 500s {{operated}} by the second BIA filled a niche in the UK charter market, {{which at the time}} was dominated by 130-seat Boeing 737-200s {{operated by}} BIA's much bigger, vertically integrated competitors. These smaller, second-hand aircraft's lower acquisition costs (compared with the competition's bigger and newer 737-200s) enabled BIA to offer tour operators lower capacity aircraft at keener rates, giving it a competitive advantage on less dense routes. The One-Eleven 400's ability to match the 737-200's range, as well as both One-Eleven variants' ability to match the 737's fuel consumption and to comply with stricter, post-1985 noise abatement rules (as a result of having <b>hush</b> <b>kits</b> fitted to their engines), further enhanced BIA's competitiveness vis-à-vis its rivals. This helped attract business from the big tour operators that owned its rivals, especially to secondary European ski destinations served in winter where the lower trip costs of BIA's older planes outweighed the seat-mile cost advantage of the in-house airlines' technologically more advanced equipment. This in turn helped minimise the tour operators' risk, thereby representing a 'win-win' situation for both parties.|$|R
