40|$|In the {{resistance}} spot welding process, copper-based electrodes both conduct current and deliver force. The resultant heat and pressure of the welding process causes wear that decreases the useable life of the electrode. The wear process is accelerated considerably when welding galvanized steel sheet as compared to bare steel sheet. Electrodes used to weld galvanized sheet experience higher temperatures, pressures, and chemical attack from the zinc coating. As a result, the electrode material softens, the <b>electrode</b> <b>face</b> enlarges, and brass alloy layers form on the <b>electrode</b> <b>face.</b> If these wear mechanisms can be circumvented, electrode life can be appreciably increased and the principle user of the spot welding process, the automotive industry, can recognize significant cost savings.

The variables include the <b>electrode</b> <b>face</b> thickness, coolant flow rate, welding schedule, electrode force and zinc coating. Two different experimental methods were used. The first one uses an infrared emission monitoring method which measures the surface temperature using a Thermovision system. The other method uses high speed cinematography of a cross sectioned welding setup. The cross sectioned surface was painted with thermosensitive paint. It {{was found that the}} slowest step of heat transfer. in the axial direction in resistance spot welding is convective heat transfer to the coolant at the electrode / coolant interface. The thermally optimal <b>electrode</b> <b>face</b> thickness was found to be 4. 7 mm for a 12 cycle wel d. A discontinuity in temperature was proven to exist across the electrode / work-piece interface.

It was also found that galvannealed steel and bare steel induce lower currents in comparison to galvanized steels. Nonthelcss; the overall temperature profiles are higher for galvannealed steel and bare steel due to a 2 lower heat transfer rate at the electrode/work-piece interface.

Spectroscopic observation revealed that even {{the case of the}} filamentary mode is not really filamentary but is actually X-ray emitting spots (hot spots) densely arranged in a column along the electrode axis. By using the soft X-ray high speed imaging system, the streak mode display is restructured from the data obtained in a single shot, Temporally resolved observations in streak mode showed that a spot appeared at a point near the <b>electrode</b> <b>face</b> first, then different hot spots appeared successively along the axis and in a direction away from the <b>electrode</b> <b>face.</b> It is clarified that the hot spot is a small region from which intense H-like and He-like spectral lines are emitted.

40|$|This program {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} common manufacturing variables on spike-tempering effectiveness. The investigation used design-of-experiment (DOE) techniques, and examined both dual-phase and martensitic grades of high-strength steels (HSS). The specific grades chosen for this project were: Dual-phase (DP) 600, galvannealed (GA), 1. 55 mm (DP) 600; Dual-phase (DP) 980 (uncoated), 1. 55 mm (DP) 980; and Martensitic (M) 1300, 1. 55 mm (M) 1300. Common manufacturing conditions of interest included tempering practice (quench and temper time), button size, simulated part fitup (sheet angular misalignment and fitup), and electrode wear (increased <b>electrode</b> <b>face</b> diameter). All of these conditions were evaluated against mechanical performance (static and dynamic tensile shear). Weld hardness data was also used to examine correlations between mechanical performance {{and the degree of}} tempering. Mechanical performance data was used to develop empirical models. The models were used to examine the robustness of weld strength and toughness to the selected processing conditions. This was done using standard EWI techniques. Graphical representations of robustness were then coupled with metallographic data to relate mechanical properties to the effectiveness of spike tempering. Mechanical properties for all three materials were relatively robust to variation in tempering. Major deviations in mechanical properties were caused by degradation of the weld itself. This was supported by a lack of correlation between hardness data and mechanical results. Small button sizes and large <b>electrode</b> <b>face</b> diameters (worn electrodes) produced large reductions in both static and dynamic strength levels when compared to standard production setups.

40|$|ABSTRACT. It is {{impossible}} to make {{a complete list of}} welding schedules in resistance spot welding because of the large number of possibilities of sheet combinations. Therefore, the welding parameters chosen for a particular welding operation are largely dependent on the experience of the operator, although some guidelines are available. The difficulty in schedule selection arises from the number of interdependent parameters involved, such as different sheet thickness combinations, different material properties of the sheets, welding current and welding time, <b>electrode</b> <b>face</b> diameter, electrode force, etc. There are a number of efforts attempting to develop systematic procedures for welding schedule selection, such as the law of thermal similarity, yet none of them has been widely accepted, primarily {{due to the fact that}} the schedules produced by these procedures are often proven inadequate. In this study, a new method is proposed for selecting welding schedules based on the heat balance in welding. A theoretical derivation of welding parameters is conducted using a “characteristic ” thickness, instead of the physical thickness of sheets. This thickness consists of the effects and contributions of electrode indentation, heataffected zone, and fusion zone. The theory has been verified by welding low-carbon steel sheets of uneven thickness...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} tests was {{performed}} to characterize battery performance relating to certain operating parameters which included charge current, discharge current, temperature and pressure. The parameters were varied to confirm battery design concepts and to determine optimal operating conditions. Spacecraft power requirements are constantly increasing. Special spacecraft such as the Space Station and platforms will require energy storage systems of 130 and 25 kWh, respectively. The complexity of these high power systems will demand high reliability, and reduced mass and volume. A system that uses batteries for storage will require a cell count in excess of 400 units. These cell units must then be assembled into several batteries with over 100 cells in a series connected string. In an attempt to simplify the construction of conventional cells and batteries, the NASA Lewis Research Center battery systems group initiated work on a nickel-hydrogen battery in a bipolar configuration in early 1981. Features of the battery with this bipolar construction show promise in improving both volumetric and gravimetric energy densities as well as thermal management. Bipolar construction allows cooling in closer proximity to the cell components, thus heat removal can be accomplished at a higher rejection temperature than conventional cell designs. Also, higher current densities are achievable because of low cell impedance.
