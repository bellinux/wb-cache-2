50|$|Culioli {{was taken}} to Paris {{on the evening of}} 23 June and, shortly after midnight, a German officer pretending {{to be one of the}} {{recently}} parachuted agents came to the apartment where Norman was staying and he and Borrel were arrested. The apartment was full of false papers and new ID cards were needed because the specification had just been changed. Suttill would in any case have needed a new one as <b>he</b> had <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> on 19 June. The Germans sent a team to Suttill's new address and he was arrested around the middle of the morning of 24 June when he returned there.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 January, Justice Gerald Winter granted bail to Kean in the Suva High Court. In {{granting}} bail {{over the}} objections of the investigating officer, Inspector Alelia Volau (who had claimed in his affidavits that there was a considerable possibility that Kean would abscond if bailed), Winter imposed strict conditions, including the payment of F$1000 in surety (which two of his relatives paid) and the surrender of his passport. [...] In addition, he was not to interfere with prosecution witnesses, had to be on good behaviour, and had to inform the State if <b>he</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> home <b>address.</b> <b>He</b> had to report is to report to the Nabua Police Station each Wednesday and Friday, and a 9 pm − 7 am curfew was imposed on him. He was also banned from visiting the military camp. Breach of the bail conditions would lead to imprisonment.|$|R
60|$|But John Bull, Junior, {{has added}} his mother's maiden name to his own, and remembers with {{pleasure}} that {{he belongs to}} a good old county family. <b>He</b> has <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> from Bedford Square to South Kensington, and has been educated at a Public School and at a University. Young, tall and fair-haired, {{there is nothing to}} suggest that he will ever have that inelegant paunch which prevented the father, even in his loftiest moments of moral indignation, from being dignified. Of course he is a soldier, for the army is still the only profession for a gentleman, and England's hero is that above all things. His morals are unexceptional, since to the ten commandments of Moses he has added the decalogue of good form. His clothes, whether he wears a Norfolk jacket or a frock coat, fit to perfection. He is a good shot, a daring rider, a serviceable cricketer. His heart beats with simple emotions, he will ever cheer {{at the sight of the}} Union Jack, and the strains of Rule Britannia bring patriotic tears to his eyes. Of late, (like myself,) he has become an Imperialist. His intentions are always strictly honourable, and he would not kiss the tip of a woman's fingers except Hymen gave him the strictest rights to do so. If he became enamoured of a lady with whom such tender sentiments should not be harboured, he would invariably remember his duty at the psychological moment, and with many moving expressions renounce her: in fact he is a devil at renouncing women. I wonder it flatters them.|$|R
5000|$|He came to Laredo Junior College as the dean-register in 1949, {{two years}} after its {{establishment}} by the Laredo Independent School District. In 1960, he succeeded the founding president, W. J. Adkins. During his 14-year presidential tenure, LJC acquired new buildings and federal grants. The nursing program was added, and enrollment expanded. In 1964, Laird authorized a master plan for the accommodation of a college for at least 1,500 students, but enrollment reached nearly four thousand {{by the time that}} Laird retired as president in 1974 at the age of sixty-seven, and the leadership passed to the third president, Domingo Arechiga. Campus buildings, all within close proximity to one another, are named for Adkins, Laird, and Arechiga. [...] An unusual personnel case dogged Laird during his last years as president. A tenured history professor, Lyndon L. Daly, began to argue that LJC, as it was then known, should grant greater governance by the faculty, rather than the administration. Daly headed the American Association of University Professors chapter on the LJC campus and was the vice-chairman of the Faculty Senate. After four years at the institution, Daly disappeared without giving notice that he was undergoing medical treatment in Houston, Texas. Laird terminated Daly's employment after several attempts to locate him failed. <b>He</b> had <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> Laredo <b>address</b> and disconnected <b>his</b> telephone. Two years later, Daly filed suit for $50,000 in damages on a claim of wrongful termination and infringement upon his right to free speech and the right of association. The jury awarded him $8,000 in punitive damages. LJC then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, Louisiana, and obtained in 1974, as Laird was leaving the institution, the cancellation of the damages considering the circumstances of Daly's departure from the school. The court declared that [...] "There is no indication in the record of any desire of the college to dismiss the plaintiff for any reason other than his failure to honor his contract commitment to them. There are no facts to support the conclusion that an abridgement of the plaintiff's First Amendment rights took place ...". Laird retired to Kerrville in Kerr County in the Texas Hill Country with his wife, Helen S. Laird (1915-1977). The couple had a son, Charles William Laird of Wilmore in Jessamine County near Lexington, Kentucky. He also had two sisters, Ruth Margaret Carmin (1917-2012) of Wellington in Iroquois County, Illinois, and Rosemary L. Stone (1923-2010) of Williamsport in western Indiana, and three brothers, Reed Laird of Waukegan near Chicago, Illinois, and Robert C. [...] "Bob" [...] Laird (1927-1995) and Russell [...] "Jack" [...] Laird (1920-2002), both of Rolla in Phelps County in south central Missouri. The Lairds are interred at Garden of Memories Cemetery in Kerrville. He was an Episcopalian.|$|R
