5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend <b>Harvard</b> University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, <b>Harvard</b> withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. at <b>Harvard.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the <b>Harvard</b> herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at <b>Harvard,</b> no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to <b>Harvard</b> to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at <b>Harvard.</b> Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E

5|$|<b>Harvard</b> had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from <b>Harvard</b> and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from <b>Harvard</b> and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to <b>Harvard</b> in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at <b>Harvard</b> in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
