40|$|Much recent machine {{learning}} {{research has been}} directed towards leveraging shared statistics among labels, instances and data views, {{commonly referred to as}} multi-label, multi-instance and multi-view learning. The underlying premises are that there exist correlations among <b>input</b> <b>parts</b> and among output targets, and the predictive performance would increase when the correlations are incorporated. In this paper, we propose Column Bundle (CLB), a novel deep neural network for capturing the shared statistics in data. CLB is generic that the same architecture can be applied for various types of shared statistics by changing only input and output handling. CLB is capable of scaling to thousands of <b>input</b> <b>parts</b> and output labels by avoiding explicit modeling of pairwise relations. We evaluate CLB on different types of data: (a) multi-label, (b) multi-view, (c) multi-view/multi-label and (d) multi-instance. CLB demonstrates a comparable and competitive performance in all datasets against state-of-the-art methods designed specifically for each type...|$|E

40|$|Teacher neural {{networks}} are a systematic experimental approach to study {{neural networks}}. A teacher is a neural network that is employed {{to generate the}} examples of the training and the testing set. The weights of {{the teacher and the}} <b>input</b> <b>parts</b> of the examples are set according to some probability distribution. The <b>input</b> <b>parts</b> are then presented to the teacher neural network and recorded together with its response. A pupil neural network is then trained on this data. Hence, a neural network instead of a real or synthetic application defines the task, according to which the performance of the pupil is investigated. One issue is the dependence of the training success on the training set size. Surprisingly, there exists a critical value above which the training error drops to zero. This critical training set size is proportional to the number of weights in the neural network. A sudden transition exists for the generalization capability, too: the generalization error measured on a large independent testing set drops to zero, and the effect of overfitting vanishes. Thus, there are two regions with a sudden transition in-between: below the critical training set size, training and generalization fails, and severe overfitting occurs; above the critical training set size, training and generalization is perfect and there is no overfitting...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{reachability}} {{problem is}} one of the most important issues in the verification of hybrid systems. Computing the reachable sets of dif-ferential equations is difficult, although computing the reachable sets of finite state machines is well developed. Hence, it is not surprising that the reachability of most of hybrid systems is undecidable. In this paper, we identify a family of vector fields and show its reachability problem is decidable. The family consists of all vector fields whose state parts are linear, while <b>input</b> <b>parts</b> are non-linear, possibly with exponential expressions. Such vector fields are commonly used in practice. To the best of our knowledge, the family {{is one of}} the most expressive families of vector fields with a decidable reachability problem. The decidability is achieved by proving the decidability of the extension of Tarski’s alge-bra with some specific exponential functions, which has been proved in [21, 22] due to Strzebonski. In this paper, we propose another decision procedure, which is more efficient when all constraints are open sets. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of our approach, even better than existing approaches based on approximation and numeric computation in general...|$|E

Our field-guided approach (see middle for a visualization of the fields) leads to alignment of parts {{away from each}} other and feature-conforming surface blending. The bridging surfaces generated (colored yellow on the right) are piecewise smooth. We present an automatic shape composition method to fuse two shape parts which may not overlap and possibly contain sharp features, a scenario often encountered when modeling man-made objects. At the core of our method is a novel field-guided approach to automatically align two <b>input</b> <b>parts</b> in a feature-conforming manner. The key to our field-guided shape registration is a natural continuation of one part into the ambient field as a means to introduce an overlap with the distant part, which then allows a surface-tofield registration. The ambient vector field we compute is featureconforming; it characterizes a piecewise smooth field which respects and naturally extrapolates the surface features. Once the two parts are aligned, gap filling is carried out by spline interpolation between matching feature curves followed by piecewise smooth least-squares surface reconstruction. We apply our algorithm to obtain feature-conforming shape composition on a variety of models and demonstrate generality of the method with results on parts with or without overlap and with or without salient features...|$|E
