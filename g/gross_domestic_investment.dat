Vector Error Correction Method and co-integration techniques are used for analyzing the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic savings (GDS) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> (GDI) in this study. The Johansen co-integration test indicates gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic savings (GDS) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> (GDI) are co-integrated, and that a long-run equilibrium exists between them. The Vector Error Correction test reveals that there is unidirectional causality running from gross domestic savings (GDS) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> (GDI) to gross domestic product (GDP) {{in the short run}} {{as well as in the}} long run. It means gross domestic savings (GDS) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> (GDI) lead to gross domestic product (GDP) but gross domestic product (GDP) does not lead to gross domestic savings (GDS) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> (GDI) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{changing}} FDI landscape, in particular, a drastic increase in outward FDI from developing and transition economies in recent years, this paper attempts to explore the possible impacts of outward FDI other than domestic savings and inward foreign direct investment on domestic investment. The major contribution {{of this study is}} that it is the first effort to empirically analyse the short- and long-run effects of the outward FDI using panel data of ASEAN– 8 countries, which could provide useful policy implications for governments at both regional and international levels to achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development. Using pool mean group analysis, this paper finds that the gross domestic saving, inward FDI and outward FDI have a positive long-run impact on the <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> even though their long-run estimates are inelastic.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effects of dollarisation on economic growth in Zimbabwe from Q 1 : 2000 to Q 4 : 2014. The variables included are gross domestic product per capita (GDPP), interest rates (lending), trade openness, <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> and dollarisation. The study did not, however, include inflation data because it produced spurious results {{due to the nature}} of data and some missing figures during the economic crisis. The study adopted an Auto Regressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) procedure and the results showed that dollarisation, interest rates, lagged GDPP and trade openness were significant at 1 % level whilst <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> was found to be weakly significant. All results met expectations except for lagged GDPP. Dollarisation and trade openness significantly positively influenced economic activity at 1 % level and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> was found to be positive but weakly significant at 10 % level for the period under consideration. Interest rates negatively influenced economic growth at 1 % level of significance. The paper recommends that the dollarization stance should be maintained due to its positive impact on economic activity. This is because dollarization resulted in economic stability and improved financial sector credibility and it is still premature to de-dollarise the economy until a sufficient level of credibility is gained by the central bank. The current liquidity constraints can be addressed by engaging respective central banks of anchor countries especially the Federal Reserve for a formal and systematic financial injection although this comes at a cost of losing national sovereignty. Zimbabwean policy makers should also establish additional complementary policies which foster economic integration with anchor countries and reduce credit risk (reflected by highly significant negative interest rates). In addition, there should be institutional and structural reforms to enhance synchronisation with business cycles and global economic trends...|$|E

A functional relationship was modeled between macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth rate, teledensity, number of mobile telephone subscribers, number of landline subscribers, degree of openness in the economy, <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment</b> and foreign direct investment. This study adopted an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) estimation techniques approach to cointegration test using bound test, stability test and others. The results from the analysis revealed the existence of long run relationship between telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth in Nigeria and concluded that, <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>investment,</b> foreign direct investment and degree of openness in the country has improved the teledensity, number of mobile telephone subscribers as well as number of landline which facilitates or enhanced economic activities and in turn leads to increased economic growth. We therefore recommends that government should implement policies that will enhance the development of the telecommunications sectors and complementary factors such as electrification particularly in rural areas, pay more attention to measures that would increase mobile telephone penetration such as reduce tariffs on telecommunication components, as well as formulate policies that will enhance domestic savings and attract more foreign direct investment...|$|E

In the neoclassical tradition, the model has to allow for profit-maximising or cost-minimising decision-making processes by firms, where supply-side factors such as taxes, interest rates and funding in the broader sense, play a significant role. Internal and external financial constraints have an enormous influence on South Africa's <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> fixed <b>investment,</b> as was demonstrated clearly by the vulnerability during, for example, the imposition of international sanctions against South Africa as well as during the East Asian and Russian crises.
