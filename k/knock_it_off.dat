[...] Ruslan awakens the head, which becomes angered and begins to taunt him. [...] It sticks out its tongue. [...] Ruslan seizes the opportunity and thrusts his lance into the tongue. [...] Then, he gives it a slap powerful enough to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> its place. Where it once stood, Ruslan finds a shining sword suitable for a bogatyr. [...] As Ruslan prepares to attack with the sword, the head pleads for mercy.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> altogether," [...] ses Silas Winch, in a awful voice. [...] "You're not {{to touch}} another drop of beer, wine, or spirits {{as long as you}} live. D'ye hear me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down. You've {{given me}} a great deal of trouble. Do you know it cost me a {{sovereign}} in tips to find out your address? I couldn't get it out of my sister, and I had to apply to the butler. I've a good mind to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> your first week's pin-money." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No. The barn was locked. Nothing but a cat {{could get}} in. I suppose he went under the barrel, perhaps {{in pursuit of}} a mouse, and somehow <b>knocked</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the block and so imprisoned himself." ...|$|R
60|$|Frankly, is it {{not time}} to knock the {{improper}} object off its shelf? It has stood too long there. Hatched in Pekin (I should say) by some Board of Respectable Rites, the little caravan monster has come to us by way of Moscow--I suppose. It is outlandish. It is not venerable. It does not belong here. Is it not time to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> its dark shelf with some implement appropriate to its worth and status? With an old broom handle for instance.|$|E
60|$|Furthermore, it {{was remarkably}} easy to {{overthrow}} a dog taken by surprise; while a dog, thus overthrown, invariably exposed {{for a moment}} the soft underside of its neck--the vulnerable point at which to strike for its life. White Fang knew this point. It was a knowledge bequeathed to him directly from the hunting generation of wolves. So it was that White Fang's method when he took the offensive, was: first to find a young dog alone; second, to surprise it and <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> its feet; and third, to drive in with his teeth at the soft throat.|$|E
6000|$|Charles {{was less}} complimentary. [...] "You fool," [...] he answered, with that {{unpleasant}} frankness {{which is much}} too common with him. [...] "Supposing it is, why on earth {{should you try to}} <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and disclose him? What good would it have done? If it is a wig, and we spot it, that's all that we need. We are put on our guard; we know with whom we have now to deal. But you can't take a man up on a charge of wig-wearing. The law doesn't interfere with it. Most respectable men may sometimes wear wigs. Why, I knew a promoter who did, and also the director of fourteen companies! What we have to do next is, wait till he tries to cheat us, and then--pounce down upon him. Sooner or later, you may be sure, his plans will reveal themselves." ...|$|E
50|$|The Loonatics - In {{the year}} 2772, a meteor strikes the planet Acmetropolis, <b>knocking</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> its axis. <b>It</b> gave Ace Bunny, his sister Lexi, Danger Duck, Slam Tasmanian, Tech E. Coyote, and Rev Runner special superpowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I see. Well, sir, as to that, I've bin in the 'abit of doin' {{without it}} so much of late from needcessity, that I don't think I'd find much {{difficulty}} in <b>knocking</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> altogether, if I was to bring principle to bear." ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{the black}} {{moustache}} curled, {{but this time}} with a touch of ferocity, for the shot partly took effect, cutting the rigging to some extent, killing one man of the crew, and wounding several. A musket-ball also struck his own cap and <b>knocked</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} that mood when one could scream because a mat is crooked?" [...] he said to March, as they {{walked up and down}} in the back garden below the line of dingy statues. [...] "Women get into it when they've worked too hard; and I've been working pretty hard lately, of course. It drives me mad when Herries will wear his hat a little crooked--habit of looking like a gay dog. Sometime I swear I'll <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> That statue of Britannia over there isn't quite straight; it sticks forward a bit as if the lady were going to topple over. The damned thing is that it doesn't topple over and be done with it. See, it's clamped with an iron prop. Don't be {{surprised}} if I get up in the middle of the night to hike it down." ...|$|E
60|$|Their fights {{were mostly}} {{informal}} scuffles, {{on and off}} in a flash, and conducted {{with none of the}} ceremony which I have read of concerning the fights of English boys. It was believed that some of the fellows knew how to box, and all the fellows intended to learn, but nobody ever did. The fights sprang usually out of some trouble of the moment; but at times they were arranged to settle some question of moral or physical superiority. Then one boy put a chip on his shoulder and dared the other to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> It took a great while to bring the champions to blows, and I have known the mere preparatory insults of a fight of this kind to wear out the spirit of the combatants and the patience of the spectators, so that not a blow was struck, finally, and the whole affair fell through.|$|E
60|$|In the hurry of the London season I {{did not see}} so much of Lowell on {{our second}} sojourn as on our first, but once when we were alone in his study there was {{a return to the}} terms of the old {{meetings}} in Cambridge. He smoked his pipe, and sat by his fire and philosophized; and but for the great London sea swirling outside and bursting through our shelter, and dashing him with notes that must be instantly answered, it was a very fair image of the past. He wanted to tell me about his coachman whom he had got at on his human side with great liking and amusement, and there was a patient gentleness in his manner with the footman who had to keep coming in upon him with those notes which was like the echo of his young faith in the equality of men. But he always distinguished between the simple unconscious equality of the ordinary American and its assumption by a foreigner. He said he did not mind such an American's coming into his house with his hat on; but if a German or Englishman did it, he wanted to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> He was apt to be rather punctilious in his shows of deference towards others, and at one time he practised removing his own hat when he went into shops in Cambridge. It must have mystified the Cambridge salesmen, and I doubt if he kept it up.|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} a massive object, such as a {{spacecraft}} or even another near-Earth object, is another possible solution to a pending NEO impact. An object with a high mass close to the Earth could be sent out into {{a collision course with}} the asteroid, <b>knocking</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> course.|$|R
50|$|In the Spring of 1927, {{during a}} storm {{lightning}} struck the steeple {{of the school}} and <b>knocked</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> The lightning strike occurred during school time and several students were injured. The following year concerns about the structural integrity of the building were voiced and the school board petitioned to remodel the building in 1929.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. Put me, I pray, in the {{forefront}} of the battle.' Dick turned his face to Torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight, but, miscalculating the distance, <b>knocked</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Torpenhow saw that his hair was gray on the temples, and that his face was the face of an old man.|$|R
60|$|The parasitical habit tends inevitably {{to degrade}} the species {{acquiring}} it, dulling its senses and faculties, {{especially those of}} sight and locomotion; but the Ornithomyia seems an exception, its dependent life having had a contrary effect; the extreme sensitiveness, keenness of sight, and quickness of the bird having reacted on the insect, giving it a subtlety in its habits and motions almost without a parallel even among free insects. A man with a blood-sucking flat-bodied flying squirrel, concealing itself among his clothing and gliding and dodging all over his body with so much artifice and rapidity as to defeat all efforts made to capturo it or <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> would be a case parallel {{to that of the}} bird-fly on the small bird. It might be supposed that the Firewood-gatherer, like some ants that keep domestic pets, makes a pet of the fly; for it is a very pretty insect, barred with green, and with rainbow reflections on its wings--and birds are believed by some theorists to possess aesthetic tastes; but the discomfort of having such a vampire on the body would, I imagine, be too great to allow a kindly instinct of that nature to grow up. Moreover, I have on several occasions seen the bird making frantic efforts to capture one of the flies, which had incautiously flown up from the nest at the wrong moment. Bird and fly seem to know each other wonderfully well.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, actor Robert Conrad was the {{spokesman}} for Eveready Alkaline Power Cells, in which he compared his tough physique {{to the performance of}} the battery placed on his shoulder, and daring someone to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 10, a FARDC {{officer in}} the eastern town of Kabambare, Captain Kengo Lengo, {{destroyed}} the broadcast equipment of Tujenge Kabambare, a community radio station, temporarily <b>knocking</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the air after it had alleged abuses by the FARDC. The officer later defended his action by claiming that the station's director had failed to answer a summons.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, she {{was taking}} another woman on her first flight near Le Bourget when the engine failed. As she was {{attempting}} to land, the plane hit some telegraph wires, <b>knocking</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> course. Bolland was able to land the plane {{on the roof of}} a nearby shed and restrain her panicked passenger. Both women escaped unharmed; the plane was damaged beyond repair.|$|R
5000|$|The Cup {{has even}} gained {{experience}} as an [...] "actor". It has appeared in several scenes of the long-running soap opera Guiding Light. It also appeared on Boston Legal where William Shatner <b>knocked</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> a balcony, and on the 30 Rock episode [...] "Subway Hero". It also appeared on Chicago Fire along with the Keeper of the Cup, Phil Pritchard.|$|R
5000|$|... "Everyone I {{talked to}} within the {{department}} felt I probably would {{meet a lot of}} negative response, but I could not believe the support. Even the biggest clowns had nothing to say. Now maybe some of those cops who are already suspect and are teased a bit may finally say, 'Hey, <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> I am gay.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the game}} of Aunt Sally is still played as a pub game in Oxfordshire. The ball is on a short plinth about 10 cm high, and {{is known as a}} 'dolly'. The dolly is placed on a dog-legged metal spike and players throw sticks or short battens at the dolly, trying to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> without hitting the spike.|$|E
50|$|Teams played individually. The kid guides {{a remote}} {{controlled}} car through a race course and across a finish line. At the same time, the adult, {{who also has}} an RC car, will try to crash into the kids car to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> course. Each kid gets 3 attempts to get their car successfully through the course without overturning or going off the track. Each successful attempt scores 10 points(for a 30-point maximum). This game has no time limit.|$|E
60|$|On a seat {{against the}} railing {{was a young woman}} dressed {{suitable}} for red automobiles, with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum. In passing by, Tobin kicks her foot without intentions, and, being polite to ladies when in drink, he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising. But he <b>knocks</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> and the wind carries it overboard.|$|R
5000|$|... 1930: On September 13, {{the barge}} Pacific Gatherer becomes wedged under the bridge’s fixed centre span. The tide rose pushing the barge {{up under the}} span, <b>knocking</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> its supports. The span hung off one side before {{suddenly}} breaking free and sinking {{into the depths of}} Burrard Inlet. Lawsuits and the bankruptcy of the Bridge company delayed any attempt at repairs. The bridge remained closed for four years.|$|R
5000|$|Clean: verb {{modifier}} {{which is}} used to mean entirely completing an action. Can be used in place of 'all the way', e.g., [...] "He <b>knocked</b> <b>it</b> clean <b>off</b> the table." ...|$|R
5000|$|The ball is {{on a short}} plinth about 100 to 150 mm high x 75mm diameter, {{known as}} the [...] "dolly", which is placed on a dog-legged metal spike about 750mm to 1000mm high. Players throw sticks or short battens (450 x 50mm) at the dolly, trying to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> without hitting the spike. Successfully hitting the dolly off {{is known as a}} [...] "doll"; however if the spike is hit first, then the score does not count and is called an [...] "iron".|$|E

Ruslan awakens the head, which becomes angered and begins to taunt him. It sticks out its tongue. Ruslan seizes the opportunity and thrusts his lance into the tongue.

50|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{consists of}} accelerating the cursor {{just at the}} right times so that it circles the reactor core with enough speed to have control via its own momentum when the enemy particles try to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> course, and then to place decoys and actually use the acceleration of the ball itself to knock enemies into control rods, traps or the reactor core. By pressing the primary button the player cursor can go into high power mode, providing higher repulsion of enemies and conversely higher risk to the player.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} a {{financial}} success for Comedy Central and helped the network transform into [...] "a cable industry power almost overnight". Despite this, critics gave the season mixed reviews. Parents Television Council rated it so offensive that it [...] "shouldn't have been made": [...] "it doesn't just push the envelope; <b>it</b> <b>knocks</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the table", while another critic {{thought of it as}} [...] "coming pretty damn close" [...] to being a [...] "perfect" [...] television series season.|$|R
2500|$|When Gary Sobers {{was a boy}} Atkinson {{encouraged}} him by asking him to bowl to him at practice. Atkinson, who played for the Wanderers Cricket Club in Barbados, was able to leave work at his insurance office early for extra batting practice, {{and he used to}} put a shilling on top of the stumps and tell Sobers he could have <b>it</b> if he <b>knocked</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Sobers said, [...] "it was through him that I eventually received recognition".|$|R
