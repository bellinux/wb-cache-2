40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} due to {{degenerative}} lumbar spine {{is one of}} the most common presenting complaints in out-patient and orthopaedic clinics. While most cases usually resolve in few weeks, 2 % of them develop radiculopathy and need further radiological investigations. Regardless of age and occupation of patients, back pain is a common cause of disability and gives a great personal and social impact to the individual and families, and economic burden to the society. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for investigation of degenerative disc disease for its superior soft tissue contrast, multiplanar imaging capability and non-ionizing property. Changes of degenerative intervertebral discs are well-demonstrated. Disc herniations, thickened ligamentum flavum and osteophytosis cause narrowing of neuroforamina, and further compromise the spinal cord and exiting nerve roots. Therefore, MRI is valuable to determine the degree of stenosis and level of compression, and hence, used as a guide to aid plan of surgical decompression. Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) {{is one of the}} surgical technique of nerve root decompression using posterior approach. In PLIF procedure, incision is made at midline at the back. This is followed by laminectomy to gain access to the intervertebral disc space. Discectomy is then performed and disc materials are replaced with <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> to restore disc height. It was postulated that PLIF procedure is able to restore foraminal height and therefore relieved nerve root compression without foraminotomy. Objectives: To study the improvement of exit foramina and lateral recess stenosis in patients with back pain who underwent Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF), using MRI as diagnostic tool, to correlate the MRI findings with clinical symptoms and to determine whether <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height is a good predictor for improvement of lateral recess and exit foramina. Methodology: It is a cross-sectional, observational study of patients with back pain due to degenerative disc disease who underwent Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) in Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II from June 2007 till June 2010. Patients’ clinical symptoms were assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) pre- and postprocedure. MRI lumbosacral pre and post PLIF were analysed in axial and sagittal views. The depth of the lateral recess and exit foramina were measured at mid zone, exit zone and far lateral zone, and compared pre and post PLIF. The height of the <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> was measured at mid sagittal views. Mean difference of lateral recess and exit foramina size before and after procedure were analysed using paired t-test, and correlated with ODI score using Pearson’s correlation test. Correlation test was also used to determine whether <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height is a good predictor for improvement of lateral recess and exit foramina size. Results: From 39 patients underwent PLIF in Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II, 25 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria with 43 lumbar segments available for analysis. Increment of lateral recess and exit foramina measurements post PLIF were observed at all levels which was statistically significant (p 0. 05). It was also noted that the height of the <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> was not a predictor for increment of exit foramen (p> 0. 05) Conclusion: Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion is proven to restore depth of lateral recess and exit foramen. Patients underwent PLIF had significant good surgical outcome. The difference of <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height used in the procedure did not determine the increment of exit foramina. Therefore, current practice of using <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height according to adjacent disc height is an acceptable method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system for modelling and digital fabrication of discrete and functionally graded multi-material objects for biomedical applications. The MMVP system {{consists of a}} DMMVP module, an FGMVP module, and a virtual reality (VR) simulation module. The DMMVP module is used to model discrete multi-material (DMM) objects, while the FGMVP module is for functionally graded multi-material (FGM) objects. The VR simulation module integrates these two modules to perform digital fabrication of multi-material objects, which can be subsequently visualized and analyzed in a virtual environment to optimize MMLM processes for fabrication of product prototypes. Using the MMVP system, two biomedical objects, including a DMM human spine and an FGM intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> are modelled and digitally fabricated for visualization and analysis in a VR environment. These studies show the MMVP system is a practical tool for modelling, visualization, and subsequent fabrication of biomedical objects of discrete and functionally graded multi-materials for biomedical applications. The system may be adapted to control MMLM machines with appropriate hardware for physical fabrication of biomedical objects...|$|E
40|$|The ventral {{cervical}} disectomie and fusion with autologeus {{bone graft}} for degenerative {{disease of the}} cervical spine often shows complications and pain at the donor graft site. For this reason more and more alternative fusion materials so called intervertebral cages are used. At this time {{the choice of the}} most valuable fusion material is in discussion {{because of a lack of}} studies about the comparison of different implants. Between 2000 and 2003 55 Patientens with degenerative disease of the cervical spine were treated with four different intervertebral implants at the Clinic of Neurosurgery, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Charité-Universitätsmedizin. The aim of this study is a radiological and clinical comparison of the used implants approximately 29 months after surgery. The Cespace Cage and the ABC-Plate from Aesculap were used in 10 cases, in 18 cases the Titanium Cespace Cage, in 8 cases the Titanium Mini <b>disc</b> <b>Spacer</b> from Ulrich Medizinsysteme, in 11 cases the PEEK Solis Cage from Stryker Spine and in 8 cases Palacos from Heraeus medical. In this evaluation we could show that all materials are effective and secure for cervical fusion, there was no significant difference between the used materials...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: According to {{anterior}} spine fusion intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> made of titanium or cobalt-chromium al-loys are {{of special}} interest. With regard to postoperative problems implant related artifacts {{can lead to}} a decreased MRI evaluation. The focus {{of this study was to}} compare the respective implant artifact artifact range dependend on different MRI sequences. To simplify artifact evaluation we introduced in this study a new developed 0 - 1 - 2 score. Material and Methods: We performed an MRI artifact evaluation of 2 different metallic intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> (cobalt-chromium and titanium alloy). A carcass porcine spine was employed. Considering 12 defined spinal regions of interest we evaluated the respective implant artifact properties independent from the total artifact volume by using a new developed 0 - 1 - 2 score. The artifact range was documented for 15 different MRI-sequences. Results: For the titanium spacer as well as the cobalt-chromium-spacer an MRI evaluation of the implant/disc space situation could not be carried out. In contrast to the cobalt chromium spacer the titanium spacer allowed a good differentiation of the spinal canal opposite to the implant. Optimal MRI imaging results for both metallic intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> could be achieved considering TSE sequences. Conclusion: A comparison of these two metallic spacers showed in all examined sequences clear advantages in favour of the titanium spacer. The best MRI representation of both tested implants by reducing implant related artifacts could be achieved with fast spin echo (TSE-) sequences. In spite of the use of TSE sequences a variability of susceptibility artifacts has to be included with regard to implant shape and material. With regard to the results of this study the easy use of a new developed artifact score represented a useful help to compare implant related MRI artifact properties independent from the actual implant related total artifact volume...|$|R

40|$|A case of late {{dislocation}} of a <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> L 5 /S 1 with perforation of the {{sigmoid colon}} and transanal passage 4  years after implantation is reported. The {{objective is to}} describe an uncommon complication of anterior endoscopic spondylodesis L 5 /S 1. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report on this rare complication. A 39 -year-old patient suffering from a spondylolisthesis L 5 /S 1 (Meyerding grade 2) with bilateral lysis L 5 was operated with posterior instrumentation L 5 /S 1 and anterior endoscopic insertion of two disc spacers. 4  years after surgery the patient noticed one of the spacers in the toilet. Radiographic examination of the colon with contrast dye revealed a perforation at the distal sigmoid colon. At the lumbosacral junction there was a bony defect {{at the site of the}} absent spacer and an anterior dislocation of the second spacer. A partial resection of the colon at the perforation site with end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The second spacer was removed, and the defect was packed with autologous cancellous bone and local antibiotics. The further course was uneventful. 2  weeks postoperatively the patient was discharged without signs of infection. The radiographic examination after 6  months showed healing of the bone graft with bony fusion L 5 /S 1. In case of incomplete or absent bony fusion the dislocation of intradiscal spacers may arise even years after the primary surgery. In consequence periodical radiographic examinations of spinal instrumentations are recommended until complete bony fusion occurred. Unclear abdominal symptoms following anterior spine surgery require immediate examination...|$|E
40|$|Interbody <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> for {{anterior}} spine fusion {{are made}} of different materials, such as titanium alloys or carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Implant-related susceptibility artifacts can decrease the quality of MRI scans. This cadaveric study aimed to demonstrate the extent that implant-related MRI artifacting affects the post fusion differentiation of the spinal canal (SC) and intervertebral disc space (IDS). In 6 cadaveric porcine spines, we evaluated the post-im- plantation MRI scans of a titanium and CFRP spacer that differed in shape and surface qualities. A spacer made of human cortical bone {{was used as a}} control. A defined evaluation unit was divided into regions of interest (ROI) to characterize the SC and IDS. Considering 15 different MRI sequences read independently by an interobserver-validated team of specialists artifact-affected image quality of the median MRI slice was rated on a modified score of 0 - 1 - 2 - 3. A maximum score of 15 points for the SC and 9 points for the IDS (100 %) was possible. Turbo spin echo sequences produced the best scores for both spacers and the control. Only the control achieved a score of 100 %. For the IDS the titanium and CFRP spacer maximally scored 0 % and 74 %, for the SC 80 % and 99 %, respectively. By using favored T 1 TSE sequences the CFRP-spacer represented clear advantages in post fusion spinal imaging. Independent of artifact dimensions the used scoring system allowed us to create an implant-related ranking of MRI scan quality in reference to the bone control...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} limiting the life of critical aircraft engine components, such as compressor <b>discs</b> and <b>spacers,</b> is the formation of low cycle fatigue (LCF) cracks in the fastener bolt holes. Such cracks are often initiated from corners and their surfaces are oxidized during the engine operation. Eddy current techniques using rotating probes {{are considered to be}} the most appropriate for detecting bolt hole cracks. Inspection according to damage tolerance criteria requires repeatable detection (90 % probability of detection with 95 % confidence) of cracks of the order of 0. 125 mm (0. 005 ″). If only threshold setting methods are used by a human analyst or implemented by means of electronic instrumentation, detectability can be low since it is difficult to distinguish between the actual flaw signal and noise in the eddy current signal as both are of similar amplitude. However, in certain cases, searching for structure in the noisy waveform can provide indications of defects that escape detection by threshold setting techniques. One way of achieving this is by using multi-parameter signal analysis and pattern recognition methods...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the 1 st stage of HP rotor blade assembly steam turbine TK 120. The methodology was focused on the selection of mechanical properties and the way of the rotor disc modeling and estimating the degree of damage caused by creep. Then the dynamic interference between the frequencies of excitation and the natural frequencies was assessed. Static calculations were performed for the cyclic sectors consisting of the <b>disc,</b> <b>disc</b> blades, <b>spacers</b> and shrouding, including loads as temperature, mass forces from the angular velocity and the pressure on the blades. Then, the creep analysis using a Norton’s model and the modal analysis were performed. Static analysis gave information concerning the distributions of displacements, stress and strain components. In the creep analysis, the creep displacements and stress relaxation versus time were determined and the estimated degree of damage caused by creep was evaluated at each part of the rotor disc. In the modal analysis, the natural frequencies and modes of vibrations corresponding to the nodal diameters were found. The results of modal analysis were shown in the SAFE graph. Numerical calculations have shown that the rotor disc was a well-designed structure and did not reveal any dynamic interference...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a high power target and ion source {{for the production of}} Radioactive Beams at intensities approaching two orders of magnitude greater than currently possible is presented. This was a key aim of the RIST experiment, designed to utilise the proton synchrotron of the ISIS facility at Rutherford Appleton laboratory, Chilton, Oxfordshire, where an 800 MeV proton beam is available at currents of up to 200 #mu#A. A number of different target designs were considered and analysed, and high temperature power dissipation tests were conducted. This culminated in the manufacture of a diffusion bonded structure comprising 6000 separate tantalum foil <b>discs</b> and <b>spacer</b> washers. The target was installed in the RIST facility, and thermal tests using electron beam heating demonstrated that the target was capable of dissipating 24 kW by thermal radiation, at the desired temperature of 2000 deg C. This is equivalent to running with the 800 MeV ISIS proton beam at a current of 100 #mu#A. A smaller diameter target of otherwise similar geometry was successfully tested online at the ISOLDE facility, CERN, producing Radioactive Beam yields and release times at least as good as a normal ISOLDE target. A Monte Carlo program was written to investigate the parameters responsible for the delay time of radioactive atoms from their production within the target foils to extraction from the ion source. Data on the critical parameters, principally the diffusion coefficients and surface sticking times, is scarce for the elements of interest at the high temperatures required. By calculating the path length and number of surface interactions within the target geometry, it was possible in many cases to fit the calculated delay curves to the experimental results gained at ISOLDE, thus providing estimates of the diffusion constants and surface sticking times. This gave insight into which were the dominant mechanisms, and made it possible to predict the delay characteristics of the full size RIST target.

40|$|A stacked-disc {{structure}} {{is comprised of}} a stack of annular discs (13) scalloped along the outer edge to provide lobes (13 a) and etched on one side to provide lands (13 a). A web (13 d) is retained in the lobes to strengthen the discs {{so that they will}} not collapse due to high fluid pressure. The stack of discs is retained by a housing (10) having a fluted interior wall to retain the ends of the lobes. End plates (11 and 12) secure the stack of <b>discs</b> with a <b>spacer</b> (14) at one end having lands (14 a) on lobes which match the lobes of the stacked discs to allow fluid to flow into, or out of, the spaces between the lobes of the stacked discs. The spaces between the lands on the etched discs provide passages for fluid flow into or out of the hollow core of the stack. The height of the lands (i. e., depth of the etch) determines the size of the smallest particle that will be permitted to flow through. The stacked-disc structure may be connected to the inlet of a valve, or be incorporated into the valve housing on the inlet side of the valve seat to assure substantially constant fluid velocity, and thereby reduce valve noise when the valve is operated...|$|R
