40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the newly developed anticoagulant rodenticide, <b>difethialone</b> was evaluated against various rodent species in laboratory and fields. <b>Difethialone</b> at 0. 025 % concentration {{in the form of}} loose bait (broken wheat and rice + vegetable oil + garlic powder) gave absolute mortality in Rattus rattus, Mus musculus, Funambulus pennanti, and Meriones hurrianae during ‘no-choice’ tests in one day feeding. No significant difference was noted in poison bait intake and mean days to death between two and three days poison feeding. Mean days to death were ranged between 2. 9 to 5. 70 in all the species tested. In fields, baiting with the same loose bait (0. 025 %) was performed in the live burrows and 88. 89 % control recorded on the 4 th day after treatment.

40|$|International audienceVitamin K antagonists (VKA) {{are used}} either in human {{medicine}} to prevent thromboembolic disorders oras rodenticides for pest control management. In rodents, female rats are described {{to be more}} tolerant tothe action of vitamin K antagonists than males. Nevertheless, the mechanism of this greatest tolerance isstill unknown and this study aims to identify {{the origin of this}} greatest tolerance after VKAadministration. Therefore, <b>difethialone,</b> {{one of the most powerful}} VKA was used in this study. A possible difference in the pharmacokinetics of <b>difethialone</b> between males and females wasfirstinvestigated. The determination of the pharmacokinetic parameters allowed to exclude a pharmacokineticorigin of the greatest tolerance of females to VKA. Thus, a natural resistance to <b>difethialone</b> of theliver VKOR activity, which is the target of VKA, was thus explored in females. The determination of Kitowards <b>difethialone</b> in liver microsomes allowed to also exclude this hypothesis. Therefore, equipmentin vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and properties of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors wereexplored. Basal activity of clotting factors VII and X were found significantly higher in females ofrespectively 43 % and 21 %. Moreover, after VKA administration, half-lives of clotting factors II and X werefound significantly longer in females of respectively 27 % and 10 % and a lag time of 4 h before thebeginning of the decay of factor VII was observed only in females after <b>difethialone</b> administration. Thegreater tolerance of female rats to VKA is thus due a stronger basal pool of vitamin K-dependent clottingfactors VII and X and to a slower decline of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII and X after VKAadministration...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Preliminary studies {{completed}} on commensal rodents {{with the new}} anticoagulant rodenticide <b>difethialone</b> showed very good efficacy, such that 25 ppm baits could be used effectively. New test results presented in this publication confirm the activity as shown under laboratory conditions in choice tests, which represent more severe conditions, {{as well as its}} effectiveness against rodents that are resistant and non-resistant to warfarin. In tests where the palatability was only fair the chemical activity resulted in excellent mortality. In a field test against a large population of Mus musculus the results proved very satisfactory. <b>Difethialone</b> is toxic to birds and fish. However, it seems to be better tolerated by dogs and pigs, animals that are frequently on the list of accidental poisonings. <b>Difethialone</b> is stored over a prolonged period in the liver but the risk to non-target species consuming rodents having ingested the compound {{does not seem to be}} high. For reasons attributed to the mode of action, <b>difethialone</b> must be handled with precautions as other anticoagulants for which Vitamin Kj is the antidote. In the event of an accidental poisoning, an antidotal therapy plan is proposed. The lower levels of active ingredient in finished baits (25 ppm) should pose a low risk to non-target species...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} seven steps synthesis of brodifacoum and <b>difethialone</b> from phenylacetyl chloride is described.

It was found that brodifacoum showed favorable inhibiting activities on LPS-stimulated nitrite production in BV- 2 microglia cells. Brodifacoum exhibited superior anti-inflammatory effects than <b>difethialone.</b> We expect that an efficient linear synthesis of 4 -hydroxycoumarin derivatives and key fragments that are useful agents for the modulation of inflammation as well as inhibition of coagulation will be of practical use...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{influencing}} {{the design and}} execution of a secondary hazard study are presented using the anticoagulant rodenticide, <b>difethialone,</b> as a model. Frequently, regulatory agencies require a determination of the potential hazard posed to non-target species by the application of pesticides. This hazard can occur through: 1) primary hazard, direct consumption of the bait or formulation containing the pesticide, or 2) secondary hazard, indirect consumption of the pesticide via ingestion of biological matrices such as animals or plants containing pesticide residues. In making this determination, the selection of appropriate test species as well as routes and level of exposure are critical. For the example study of the estimation of secondary hazards associated with <b>difethialone,</b> albino rats served as the representative species for the primary target animal.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reappraisal {{of the blood}} clotting response (BCR) tests for anticoagulant rodenticides, and proposes a standardised methodology for identifying and quantifying physiological resistance in populations of rodent species.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Vitamin K are {{essential}} molecules {{involved in the}} post-transcriptional activation of some proteins called protein vitamin K dependent (PVKD). The best know PVKD are the four involved in the coagulation cascade: factor II, VII, IX and X. In mammals, vitamin K has two origins: foods and a recycling system lead by an enzyme called Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC 1). The vitamin K requirement is dependent of the efficiency of this enzyme [1]. The aim of our work is to block the recycling mechanism in order to evaluate the efficiency of vitamin K 1 to balance the recycle system and so {{to better understand the}} vitamin K 1 action. Animals and material and methods: Thirty one 31 male 8 weeks-old rats (Sprague Dawley) receive per os a lethal dose of 10 mg/kg (25 fold the effective dose 50) of <b>difethialone</b> (a VKORC 1 inhibitor). 48 hForty eight hours after, a 10 mg. /kg- 1 dose of vitamin K 1 was administered per os to each rat. Rats were killed at a predetermined time after vitamin K administration and blood samples were taken. To avoid an interaction with vitamin K food, rats have been fed before and during the experiment with a vitamin K devoid food. Blood samples were assessed for blood clotting time (prothrombin time) and vitamin K dependent clotting factor activities (factor II, VII, IX and X). For statistical analysis, Wilcoxon tests were performed. Results and discussion: The delay between <b>difethialone</b> and vitamin K 1 administration have been chosen to maximize the diminution of the vitamin K dependent clotting factor activities without involving death [2]. The results of the regeneration of vitamin K dependent clotting factor activities are presented on the figure. Regeneration evolutions fitted with a sigmoidal model (Factor II R²= 0. 88; VII R²= 0. 84; IX R²= 0. 78; X R²= 0. 93). After 360 minutes, factor II and factor IX were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than their basal activity level before <b>difethialone</b> administration (set at 100 %). For all factors, a lag time was observed during the first hour after the vitamin K administration. Then, activities increased during about one hour before to stagnate. The prothrombin time was within the normal range from 120 minutes. The lag time was expected but not the stagnation and the different levels of factor activities. The difference between factors might be explained by different affinities in the post-transcriptional modification. The stop of increasing might be explained by lack of vitamin K. However, with this hypothesis the activities should decrease but they do not. This stagnation under the normal level was not described in the case of regeneration by recovery of recycling mechanism [3]. So, unrecycled vitamin K might have a different activity or affinity which leads to a new equilibrium. Conclusion: Our experiment pinpoints that the regeneration of clotting factor activities is more complex to understand. The study of the clotting factors’ regeneration might disclose some new regulation mechanisms. References: 1. Markussen MD, Heiberg A-C, Nielsen R, Leirs H.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet (UV) and {{fluorescence detection}} {{was developed for}} the analysis of one indandione and four hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant rodenticides in human serum. The superwarfarin rodenticides, chlorophacinone, bromadiolone, difenacoum, brodifacoum, and <b>difethialone,</b> can be identified and quantitated simultaneously with this method. After adding a buffer (pH 5. 5), the anticoagulants were xtracted from serum with chloroform-acetone. The organic phase was separated and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was subjected to chromatographic analysis. The anticoagulants were separated by reversed-phase chromatography and detected by UV absorption at 285 nm and by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 265 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm. Extraction efficiencies from 55 to 131 % were obtained. The within-run precision ranged from 2. 0 to 7. 1 % for UV detection and from 0. 0 to 4. 8 % for fluorescence detection. Between-run precision ranged from 1. 3 to 16. 0 % for UV detection and from 1. 8 to 9. 0 % for fluorescence detection.

Eight groups of mice dosed orally with a different anticoagulant rodenticide in a dose equal to one-half the lethal dose 50 (LD(50)), were killed at various times up to 21 days after administration. The eight anticoagulant rodenticides were assayed in plasma and liver by an LC-ESI-MS/MS method. Depending on the compound, the limit of quantification was set at 1 or 5 ng/mL in plasma. In liver, the limit of quantification was set at 250 ng/g for coumatetralyl and warfarin and at 100 ng/g for the other compounds. The elimination half-lives in plasma for first-generation rodenticides were shorter than those for second-generation rodenticides. Coumatetralyl, a first-generation product, had a plasma elimination half-life of 0. 52 days. Brodifacoum, a second-generation product, showed a plasma elimination half-life of 91. 7 days. The elimination half-lives in liver varied from 15. 8 days for coumatetralyl to 307. 4 days for brodifacoum.

The coagulation function was thus monitored with global coagulation assays and specialty assays after <b>difethialone</b> administration in rats. Despite many parameters obtained by thromboelastometry, only clotting time and clot formation time obtained by ExTEM were modified. Their evolution was fast with doubling time 1 respectively of 4. 0 h and 3. 7 h but their increases were delayed with a lag time higher than 8 h. Conversely, prothrombin time evolution presented a lag time of only 2 h, but a higher doubling time of 7. 2 h. The measurements of factor VII and X activities were the most sensitive assays to monitor vitamin K antagonists effect with almost no lag time and the fastest evolution. Nevertheless, factor X was shown to be the only key factor driving prothrombin time.

Commercially available rodenticides in Australia include coumatetralyl, warfarin, brodifa-coum, bromadiolone, difenacoum, flocoumafen, <b>difethialone,</b> diphaci-none and chlorophacinone. A Waters ACQUITY UPLC TQD system operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to conduct the analysis. Two different ionization techniques, ES 1 and ES 2, were examined to achieve optimal sensitivity and selectivity resulting in detection by MS–MS using electrospray ionization in positive mode for difenacoum and brodifacoum and in negative mode for all other analytes. All analytes were extracted from 200 mL of whole blood with ethylacetate and separated on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH-C 18 column using gradient elution. Ammonium acetate (10 mM, pH 7. 5) and methanol were used as mobile phases with a total run time of 8 min. Recoveries were between 70 and 105 % with limits of detection ranging from 0. 5 to 1 ng/mL.

40|$|Anticoagulant rodenticides are {{chemical}} baits used {{to reduce}} rodent problems. They are used both indoors and outdoors, and are often found in both urban and rural settings. They are usually formulated into pellets or dusts that are often bright blue-green in color. 1, 10, 11 • Anticoagulant rodenticides can be classified into two different categories: first and second generation rodenticides. First generation anticoagulants are usually less toxic {{and more than one}} dose needs to be eaten by the animals for the product to be effective. Rodenticides in this category are made from chemicals such as warfarin and diphacinone. Second generation products are much more potent and act faster than first generation products.

For the normal coagulation to occur, vitamin K is needed to work with protein enzymes to recycle factors involved in the coagulation cascade. Anticoagulant rodenticides work by blocking the body’s ability to conserve vitamin K which in turn stops the body from producing and activating new factors needed for coagulation.

Birds of prey had lower levels of bromadiolone than hedgehogs, whereas no difference was found for other ARs.

40|$|International audienceSecond {{generation}} anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs), pesticides used worldwide {{to control}} rodent populations, exist in two diastereoisomer chemical species because they own two stereogenic centers. A core-shell LC-MS/MS multi-residue method for comprehensive quantitative {{analysis of the}} diastereoisomers of five SGARs as well as three first generation anticoagulant rodenticide molecules has been fully validated in liver of rats according to a bioanalytical guideline. A core-shell column (superficially porous particles) has been chosen {{for its ability to}} separate the diastereomers of bromadiolone, difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen and <b>difethialone</b> and for its robustness to rat liver extracts. The highly selective chromatographic separation of the diastereoisomers contributes to good signal to noise ratios and then enhances the sensitivity of the method compared to the ones of fully porous columns. An elution gradient has been optimized with 10 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile as aqueous/organic mobile phase respectively. Triple quadrupole mass detector has been used to achieve specifity and LLOQ from 0. 92 to 2. 2 ng/g for each diastereoisomer, or first generation anticoagulant rodenticides. Then we evidenced diastereoisomeric ratios in liver of rats issued from not controlled exposure of wild rats (Rattus norvegicus) trapped in a French Parisian park through a campaign of rodent eradication. We compared them to diastereoisomeric ratios in SGARs commercial baits that contain both isomers, and showed that one of the two diastereoiomers had nearly disappeared in liver of rats. The proportions of cis-bromadiolone and trans-difenacoum were really lowered compared to the baits: 5 / 7 and 9 / 12 rats had only trans-bromadiolone and cis-difenacoum hepatic residues respectively. Liver persistence of the two diastereoisomers of bromadiolone and difenacoum was different due to differences in their pharmacokinetics in wild rats. The new Core-shell LC-MS/MS method is particularly well adapted for further exploration of diastereoisomers ratios in rodent and predatory wildlife biological samples in order to evaluate ecological consequences of actual baits, to explore new formulated baits with a good balance between efficacity (ability to kill rodents) and diastereoisomers persistence, and hopefully to mitigate exposure of non-target species...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Resistance to {{anticoagulants}} in Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) {{and house}} mice (Mus domesticus) {{has been studied}} in the UK since the early 1960 s. In no {{other country in the}} world is our understanding of resistance phenomena so extensive and profound. Almost every aspect of resistance in the key rodent target species has been examined in laboratory and field trials and results obtained by independent researchers have been published. It is the principal purpose of this document to present a short synopsis of this information. More recently, however, the development of genetical techniques has provided a definitive means of detection of resistant genotypes among pest rodent populations. Preliminary information from a number of such surveys will also be presented. Resistance in Norway rats: A total of nine different anticoagulant resistance mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) are found among Norway rats in the UK. In no other country worldwide are present so many different forms of Norway rat resistance. Among these nine SNPs, five are known to confer on rats that carry them a significant degree of resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides. These mutations are: L 128 Q, Y 139 S, L 120 Q, Y 139 C and Y 139 F. The latter three mutations confer, to varying degrees, practical resistance to bromadiolone and difenacoum, the two second-generation anticoagulants in predominant use in the UK. It is the recommendation of RRAG that bromadiolone and difenacoum should not be used against rats carrying the L 120 Q, Y 139 C and Y 139 F mutations because this will promote the spread of resistance and jeopardise the long-term efficacy of anticoagulants. Brodifacoum, flocoumafen and <b>difethialone</b> are effective against these three genotypes but cannot presently be used because of the regulatory restriction that they can only be applied against rats that are living and feeding predominantly indoors. Our understanding of the geographical distribution of Norway rat resistance in incomplete but is rapidly increasing. In particular, the mapping of the focus of L 120 Q Norway rat resistance in central-southern England by DNA sequencing is well advanced. We now know that rats carrying this resistance mutation are present across a large part of the counties of Hampshire, Berkshire and Wiltshire, and the resistance spreads into Avon, Oxfordshire and Surrey. It is also found, perhaps as outlier foci, in south-west Scotland and East Sussex. L 120 Q is currently the most severe form of anticoagulant resistance found in Norway rats and is prevalent over a considerable part of central-southern England. A second form of advanced Norway rat resistance is conferred by the Y 139 C mutation. This is noteworthy because it occurs in at least four different foci that are widely geographically dispersed, namely in Dumfries and Galloway, Gloucestershire, Yorkshire and Norfolk. Once again, bromadiolone and difenacoum are not recommended for use against rats carrying this genotype and a concern of RRAG is that continued applications of resisted active substances may result in Y 139 C becoming more or less ubiquitous across much of the UK. Another type of advanced resistance, the Y 139 F mutation, is present in Kent and Sussex. This means that Norway rats, carrying some degree of resistance to bromadiolone and difenacoum, are now found from the south coast of Kent, west into the city of Bristol, to Yorkshire in the north-east and to the south-west of Scotland. This difficult situation can only deteriorate further where these three genotypes exist and resisted anticoagulants are predominantly used against them. Resistance in house mice: House mouse is not so well understood but the presence in the UK of two resistant genotypes, L 128 S and Y 139 C, is confirmed. House mice are naturally tolerant to anticoagulants and such is the nature of this tolerance, and the presence of genetical resistance, that house mice resistant to the first-generation anticoagulants are considered to be widespread in the UK. Consequently, baits containing warfarin, sodium warfarin, chlorophacinone and coumatetralyl are not approved for use against mice. This regulatory position is endorsed by RRAG. Baits containing brodifacoum, flocoumafen and <b>difethialone</b> are effective against house mice and may be applied in practice because house mouse infestations are predominantly indoors. There are some reports of resistance among mice in some areas to the second-generation anticoagulant bromadiolone, while difenacoum remains largely efficacious. Alternatives to anticoagulants: The use of habitat manipulation, that is the removal of harbourage, denial of the availability of food and the prevention of ingress to structures, is an essential component of sustainable rodent pest management. All are of importance in the management of resistant rodents and have the advantage of not selecting for resistant genotypes. The use of these techniques may be particularly valuable in preventing the build-up of rat infestations. However, none can be used to remove any sizeable extant rat infestation and for practical reasons their use against house mice is problematic. Few alternative chemical interventions are available in the European Union because of the removal from the market of zinc phosphide, calciferol and bromethalin. Our virtual complete reliance on the use of anticoagulants for the chemical control of rodents in the UK, and more widely in the EU, calls for improved schemes for resistance management. Of course, these might involve the use of alternatives to anticoagulant rodenticides. Also important is an increasing knowledge of the distribution of resistance mutations in rats and mice and the use of only fully effective anticoagulants against them...|$|E
40|$|Second {{generation}} anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) can be {{toxic to}} all mammals and birds. Various {{studies have shown}} that, in Britain, there is widespread exposure to SGARs in a diverse range of predatory mammals and birds, including red kites (Milvus milvus) which scavenge dead rats, a target species for rodent control. The Wildlife Incident Monitoring Scheme (WIIS) and the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) have shown that some mortalities result from this secondary exposure. The aim {{of the current study}} was to assess the scale and severity of exposure to SGARs (as assessed from the presence of liver SGAR residues) in red kites found dead in Britain in 2015. Carcasses, typically found by members of the public, were submitted for examination and analysis either to the Institute of Zoology’s Disease Risk Analysis and Health Surveillance programme (DRAHS) or to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme, partners in the WILDCOMS network. We also report the results of SGAR analysis of red kites from England, Wales and Scotland that died in 2015 and analysed by the WIIS, who are also partners of the WILDCOMS network. Eighteen red kites from England & Wales were necropsied by either the DRAHS or the PBMS and the livers of the birds were analysed for SGARs by the PBMS. All had detectable liver residues of difenacoum and brodifacoum, and most also contained detectable liver bromadiolone residues. <b>Difethialone</b> was less frequently detected and flocoumafen was not detected in any birds. The presence of detectable brodifacoum residues in all birds may partly reflect the predominance of adult birds in the 2015 sample but may also indicate a growing prevalence of exposure to this compound. The percentage of red kites found by the PBMS to contain brodifacoum has increased since 2010 although any influence of age on this trend has not yet been examined. Sum liver SGAR concentrations in the 18 kites ranged between 50 and 1266 ng/g wet wt. (arithmetic mean: 463 ng/g). Post-mortems indicated that 7 of the kites had internal hemorrhaging that was not associated with detectable trauma; these birds typically had elevated sum SGAR liver concentrations. On the basis of these two factors, it is considered probable that SGARs were a contributory cause of death in these birds. The exposure pattern observed in 8 red kites from England & Wales analysed by the WIIS was very similar to that observed in birds analysed by the PBMS, with detectable liver residues of difenacoum and brodifacoum in all birds and bromadiolone in most. SGARs were assessed to be a contributory cause of death in two birds. Thus, of the 26 red kites from England & Wales analysed overall, SGARs were considered to be implicated in the deaths of 9 (35...|$|E
