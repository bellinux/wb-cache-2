5|$|Having {{just been}} elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield the best choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention {{was enough to make}} Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E
5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> {{refused to be}} the Democratic candidate, perhaps because he had already {{decided to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

5|$|On February 4, 2014, {{conservative}} political consultant Jeff Bell announced his bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Bell won the Republican Primary and received significant {{support from the}} conservative American Principles Fund, which ran a direct mail operation costing over $80,000, and the National Organization for Marriage, an anti-same-sex marriage group, which paid for $6,000 of automated calling.|$|E
5|$|Aide Greg Schneiders {{suggested}} an unusual strategy, inspired by Glenn's personal campaign and voting style, of avoiding appealing to {{special interest groups}} and instead seeking support from ordinary Democratic primary voters. After Mondale defeated him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> Glenn carried $3million in campaign debt for over 20years before receiving a reprieve from the Federal Election Commission. He was considered as a vice-presidential candidate in 1984, 1988, and 1992.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} as {{the first}} runner-up in the Joliet City Council election of 1989, but when a sitting councilwoman died {{a few months after}} the election he was passed over several times <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> This was controversial as the nomination is customarily given to the runner-up in the most recent election. He returned to elective politics to defeat the mayor, who did not nominate him in the subsequent election in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four men, all former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the favorite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> {{at the outset of the}} Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers in the western part of the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E

5|$|In his Cabinet appointments, Pierce {{sought to}} unite {{a party that}} was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most of the party had not {{originally}} supported him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{clinched}} enough delegates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> and {{his focus}} shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged {{battle for the}} Democratic nomination. McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounts {{for most of the}} couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.|$|E

He was the only candidate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} McKinley was nominated, {{it was not}} clear who his Democratic rival would be. Cleveland's opponents within his party had mobilized into an {{organized}} effort to take over the Democratic Party and pass a platform supporting free silver. The platform was deemed of highest priority, and only once that fight was won was a candidate for president to be considered. Despite this resolution, several Democrats sought the nomination, with the foremost being former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. Others either seeking or spoken of <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> included South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, and former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's distant cousin, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II (grandson {{of former}} vice {{president}} Adlai Stevenson I), was considered his primary competition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> but had not committed before the convention. Richard Russell, Jr. and Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver were also interested in the nomination. Kentucky's delegation to the 1952 Democratic National Convention announced that they would support Barkley, and Truman encouraged Missouri's delegates to do so. Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson {{was not going to}} be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.|$|E
50|$|The 2008 congressional {{elections}} in Mississippi were held on November 4, 2008 {{to determine who}} will represent the state of Mississippi in the United States House of Representatives. <b>The</b> primary election <b>for</b> candidates seeking <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> of <b>the</b> Republican Party or the Democratic Party was held on March 11, with a run-off being held <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republican <b>nomination</b> in <b>the</b> first and third districts, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Democratic <b>nomination</b> in <b>the</b> first district.|$|R

5|$|Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown {{seemed to}} be the {{favorite}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> On the first ballot, he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.|$|E
5|$|Gravel {{actively}} {{campaigned for}} the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that he was interested in running <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was not alone in this effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E
