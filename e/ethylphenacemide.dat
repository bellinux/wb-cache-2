5000|$|Pheneturide (INN, BAN) (brand names Benuride, Deturid, Pheneturid, Septotence, Trinuride), {{also known}} as phenylethylacetylurea (or <b>ethylphenacemide),</b> is an {{anticonvulsant}} of the ureide class. Conceptually, it can be formed in the body as a metabolic degradation product from [...] It {{is considered to be}} obsolete, and is now seldom used. It is marketed in Europe, including in Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Pheneturide has a similar profile of anticonvulsant activity and toxicity relative to phenacemide, but is less toxic in comparison, despite still being a toxic drug. As such, it is only used in cases of severe epilepsy when other, less-toxic drugs have failed. Pheneturide inhibits the metabolism and thus increases the levels of other anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin.|$|E

Although these compounds possess straight-chain acetylurea groupings, in the crystalline state both molecules adopt a pseudocyclic conformation of the acetylurea chain through amide [...] . carbonyl oxygen intramolecular hydrogen bonding. This results in spatial positioning and relative orientation of two electron-donating functional groups in these molecules {{similar to those of}} comparable atoms in diphenylhydantoin and other heterocycle-containing anticonvulsants...|$|E
