They are especially useful when measuring over very large distances, consider if the calipers are used to measure a large diameter pipe. A vernier caliper does not have the depth capacity to straddle this large diameter {{while at the same time}} reach the outermost points of the pipe's diameter. They are made from high carbon steel.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Ill-fitting {{footwear}} {{is one of}} {{the well-known}} risk factors causing foot ulceration in the diabetic population. Current literature for fitness of foot dimensions is insufficient, especially on foot-shoe length and foot-shoe width measurement in absolute numerical differences. The aims of the study were to compare and identify the footwear fitness in diabetic patients with peripheral sensory neuropathy, diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy and non diabetes. Materials and Method 　　Diabetes patients were assessed for peripheral sensory neuropathy by two sensory tests, 10 -g monofilament test using 10 -g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and vibration perception threshold test using neurotheisometer. Abnormal results of both tests indicated diabetes sensory neuropathy. The dimensions of foot length and foot width were determined by the Brannock device while internal shoe length and internal shoe width were measured by an <b>inside</b> <b>caliper.</b> The mean of internal shoe-length difference and shoe-width difference of three groups were calculated and compared. Reference ranges of 10 - 15 mm of shoe-length difference and 0 - 7 mm were selected from past literature. The values of shoe-length and shoe-width differences were dichotomized into correct and incorrect fit category. Footwear fitness of the three groups was compared. Demographics of patients, information on self foot care, shoe size check and footwear habit were collected for correlation analysis. Results Data was collected from 20 diabetes patients with sensory neuropathy, 60 diabetes patients without neuropathy and 40 non diabetes controls. There were significant difference in shoe-length difference among three groups, with larger shoe-length difference in diabetic neuropathy group (left: 21. 9 mm, / right: 21. 7 mm), followed by non neuropathy diabetes (left: 15. 2 mm, / right: 15. 5 mm) and controls (left: 13. 4 mm, / right: 14. 5 mm) (left p= 0. 002 / right p= 0. 008). The shoe-length differences of both diabetes groups exceeded the reference range, indicating long footwear. No significant difference was reported related to shoe-width difference. Analysis of shoe fit category showed around 15 - 17 % of diabetes patients were wearing correctly fit shoes in both length and width. A high prevalence of diabetes patient had ill-fitting footwear while nearly half of them wear shoes with correct width but incorrect length. There is nearly no correlations between shoe-length fit, shoe-width fit and frequency of self foot check, frequency of footwear size check and frequency of diabetic footwear education. Discussion Most diabetes patients wear ill-fitting footwear, especially those with peripheral sensory neuropathy when compared to control group. There is significant difference in shoe-length difference among the three groups, with reference to the 10 - 15 mm range as the gap length allowance. Diabetic patients tend to wear long and loose footwear in this study even they had past foot education and practice proper self foot check regularly. These might imply incomprehensive proper diabetic footwear education and self footwear assessment in current diabetes care pathway. These components are essential in diabetes foot care and people with diabetes are highly recommended to select a pair of good fit footwear. Further research is required to standardize the methodologies of measurement in foot dimensions and footwear fitness as well as investigate on relations of additional foot parameters in shoe fitting. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E

5000|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of high performance brake systems on offer for the C4 S4. [...] All S4s' initially had 310 mm diameter by 25 mm thick, radially ventilated disc brakes up front, each with an ATE single-piston sliding <b>caliper</b> <b>inside</b> a 'UFO' styled bell-shaped disc. With the introduction of the V8 engine, a new front brake setup became standard; again the discs used radial ventilation, but these front discs were now sized at 314 mm by 30 mm - with a conventionally mounted Lucas-Girling caliper in an external position over the disc. US models had smaller 276 mm discs. The rear brakes, 269 mm by 20 mm and also radially ventilated - remained the same throughout C4 production; they used a Lucas-Girling single-piston sliding caliper with an integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism. A Bosch three-channel operation (four-channel sensing) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with a mechanical load sensing valve for the rear brakes was standard throughout production.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method to}} characterize the dynamic behavior of a normal production hydraulic brake system through experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop test bench for both modeling (part I) and control (part II) tasks. The activity is relative to the analysis, modeling, and control of anti-lock braking system and electronic stability control digital valves, and is aimed at obtaining reference tracking and disturbance-rejection performance similar to that achievable when using pressure proportional valves. The {{first part of this}} two-part study is focused on the development of a mathematical model that emulates the pressure dynamics <b>inside</b> a brake <b>caliper</b> when the inlet valve, outlet valve, and motor pump are controlled by digital or pulse width modulated signals. The model takes into account some inherent nonlinearities of these systems, e. g. the variation of fluid bulk modulus with pressure, while inlet and outlet valves together with the relay box are modeled as second-order systems with variable gains. The hardware-in-the-loop test rig is used for both parameter estimation and model validation; the parameters and model will be used for the control strategy development presented {{in the second part of}} this study...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} vehicle uses of master {{cylinders}} are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders <b>inside</b> of brake <b>calipers</b> and/or drum brakes; these cylinders {{may be called}} wheel cylinders or slave cylinders, and they push the brake pads towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a drum, or a disc, a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, {{for their ability to}} withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement).|$|R
