5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the <b>idiosoma,</b> the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The <b>idiosoma</b> (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E

25|$|Mites are arachnids and, as such, {{evolved from}} a {{segmented}} body with the segments organised into two tagmata: a prosoma (cephalothorax) and an opisthosoma (abdomen). However, only the faintest traces of primary segmentation remain in mites; the prosoma and opisthosoma are fused, and a region of flexible cuticle (the cirumcapitular furrow) separates the chelicerae and pedipalps {{from the rest of}} the body. This anterior body region is called the capitulum or gnathosoma and, according to some works, is also found in Ricinulei. The remainder of the body is called the <b>idiosoma</b> and is unique to mites.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the faintest}} traces of primary {{segmentation}} remain in mites, the prosoma and opisthosoma being insensibly fused, and {{a region of}} flexible cuticle (the cirumcapitular furrow) separates the chelicerae and pedipalps {{from the rest of}} the body. This anterior body region is called the gnathosoma (or capitulum) and is also found in the Ricinulei. The remainder of the body is called the <b>idiosoma</b> and is unique to mites. Most adult mites have four pairs of legs, like other arachnids, but some have fewer. For example, gall mites like Phyllocoptes variabilis (superfamily Eriophyioidea) have a wormlike body with only two pairs of legs; some parasitic mites have only one or three pairs of legs in the adult stage. Larval and prelarval stages have a maximum of three pairs of legs; adult mites with only three pairs of legs may be called 'larviform'.|$|E
500|$|Ticks, like mites, are {{arthropods}} {{that have}} lost the segmentation of the abdomen that their ancestors had, and there has subsequently been a fusion of the abdomen with the cephalothorax. The tagmata typical of other Chelicera {{have been replaced by}} two new body sections, the anterior capitulum (or gnathosoma), which is retractable and contains the [...] mouthparts, and the posterior <b>idiosoma</b> which contains the legs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The capitulum is a feeding structure with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood; it is only the front of the head and contains neither the brain nor the eyes. The ventral side of the <b>idiosoma</b> bears sclerites, and the gonopore is located between the fourth pair of legs. In the absence of segmentation, the positioning of the eyes, limbs and gonopore on the <b>idiosoma</b> provide the only locational guidance.|$|E

The Tydeinae subfamily, to which Lorryia formosa belongs, is characterized by having three pairs of lyrifissures (grooves that encircle the surface of an appendage) {{and a pair of}} primitive eyes (oculi) which commonly occur laterally on the propodosoma, the middle body segment to which the first two pairs of legs are attached. The genital region includes a progenital aperture flanked by setae. Specimens are generally less than 250 µm long.|$|E

5000|$|The gnathosoma (from Greek , [...] = [...] "jaw" [...] and , [...] = [...] "body") is {{the part}} of the body of the Acari (mites and ticks) {{comprising}} the mouth and feeding parts.

50|$|Phragmosis is any {{method by}} which an animal defends itself in its burrow by using its own body as a barrier. An example {{can be seen in}} the mygalomorph spider <b>Idiosoma</b> nigrum (Black Rugose Trapdoor Spider), which protects itself in its burrow by {{positioning}} itself so as to block the burrow with its abdomen, which is unusually hard. Another example is the shield of Cyclocosmia species (Ctenizidae).

It also shows 2 pairs of sensillae, {{both of which are}} nude. Its <b>idiosoma</b> counts with a pair of short setae ventrally. Between its coxae II and III it exhibits two setae and 14 setae posterior to coxae III, all barbed. Its gnathosoma shows nude hypostomalae and galealae. The palpfemur has barbed seta, as does the palpgenu. The palptibia, in turn has 3 setae (two barbed, one nude), and the palptarsus possesses 6 nude setae.|$|E
5000|$|This species' dorsum counts {{with about}} 250 [...] setae, and {{one eye on}} each side. Its dorsal scutum has a concave {{anterior}} border. Its posterior border is pointed.

Its <b>idiosoma</b> has eight setae between coxae I and II ventrally, 36 setae between coxae II and III and behind coxae III there are about 46 setulose setae. Its coxala Ib is its longest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idiosoma</b> nigrum, {{commonly}} called the Black rugose trapdoor spider, can {{grow up to}} 30 mm long. Males reach a body size of up to 18 mm. The skin of their opisthosoma is hardened, with a flattened end and deep grooves running along the sides. The thickened skin helps to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It {{also serves as a}} kind of plug to shield itself from predators. This phenomenon is called phragmosis and occurs in perfection in the spider genus Cyclocosmia (Ctenizidae). However, some parasitic wasps have evolved paper-thin abdomens and long, slender ovipositors and lay their eggs on the softer skin {{at the front of the}} spider's opisthosoma.|$|E

5000|$|The {{parasitic}} mites {{are either}} just {{visible to the}} naked eye or one needs a microscope to see them clearly. The distinct body segmentation characteristic of most arthropods is greatly reduced in the Acari. At the left of the diagram is an anterior section bearing the mouthparts (gnathosoma or capitulum), and at right, a posterior section comprising the main body (<b>idiosoma).</b> Mouthparts are characterized by a central pair of chelicerae, a ventral hypostome, and a lateral pair of palps. Chelicerae are protrusible, cutting or piercing structures essential to feeding. Palps are of sensory function during feeding and do not penetrate the host's skin. Acarines have no antennae and, except for some genera of ticks, are without eyes. A tube for ingesting food and secreting saliva is formed by apposition of both the chelicerae and the hypostome. The main body bears three pairs of legs in the larvae and four pairs in the nymphs and adults. The legs are multiple-jointed and operate by contraction of their internal muscles. The distal segment of the legs, the tarsus, is equipped with a terminal claw or pair of claws and sometimes with an adhesive pad or sucker that enables the mite to crawl up smooth surfaces. The internal organs (or viscera) include a tubular gut with a posterior anus, paired excretory tubes (Malpighian tubules) that empty out into the anus, paired respiratory tubes (tracheae) that carry atmospheric air directly up against the viscera, paired salivary glands with ducts to the mouthparts, female or male reproductive organs (ovary or testes), and a central nervous ganglion that acts as a simple brain.|$|E
