25|$|A written {{document}} that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created {{for students with}} disabilities, who are {{required by law to}} have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore Sports School is <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{perceived}} by the school to excel in sports it offers.

It was opened in January 2004 and the school takes students directly into the school provided they have an active background in the sports offered by the school. When the school had its first intake, many students applied who were judged to excel in their sport but were posted to the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams. The school rejected these pupils as the school sought pupils who excelled both physically and academically. The school was criticised for being too result wise instead of grooming them into future sportspeople. Some {{of the students were}} finally accepted on an appeal basis after that. Students in the school aim for the International Baccalaureate (IB) paper, similar to the Singapore Arts School.|$|E

2500|$|Regular {{admission}} {{is a good}} choice <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unsure where they would like to go. One advantage is that it can help students who have improved their grades substantially in the fall of twelfth grade, since decisions are not made until March of that year. In addition, it offers students more time to make their decision about a college under somewhat less pressure than an early method. The fairly dominant view is that regular {{admission is}} more likely to result in higher offers of financial aid, particularly if students are admitted to several institutions that present different aid offers. Accordingly, one offer can be used as leverage {{to try to get a}} better offer at another institution, particularly if there are competing multiple acceptances. Several reports suggested that a [...] "growing number of colleges" [...] including Harvard, Cornell, and Carnegie-Mellon have stated publicly that they will consider matching offers from competing colleges. Kim Clark explained: ...|$|E
2500|$|Binding commitment. Early {{decision}} is a binding decision, meaning that students must withdraw applications to other schools if accepted. It is not legally binding, {{but there is}} a commitment involved with penalties for withdrawing for spurious reasons. Advisers suggest that this method is only <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> absolutely certain about wanting to attend a specific school. If financial aid is a concern or if a family is [...] "shopping for the best deal", then it is usually advised to apply early action or regular decision instead. The one stipulated situation under which a student may back out of the agreement is if the financial aid offer is insufficient. A student who backs out for other reasons may be [...] "blacklisted" [...] by the early decision college, which may contact the student's high school guidance office, and prevent it from sending transcripts to other colleges, and high schools generally comply with such requests. In addition, the jilted college may contact other colleges about the withdrawal, and the other colleges would likely break off their offers of acceptance as well. And by the time that an early decision aid package is offered it may be March or April of twelfth grade, and then if a student backs out at that point for financial reasons, valuable time may be lost.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that chances for admission are higher <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> prepared to pay the full price, {{there are indications that}} this has been even more prevalent {{in the past few years}} given economic uncertainty and rising college costs, particularly at schools without large endowments. Half of admissions officers at both public universities and a third of officers at four-year colleges were actively seeking students who could [...] "pay full price" [...] and did not need financial aid, according to one survey of 462 admissions directors and managers in 2011. The report suggested that full-pay students tended to have lower high school grades and test scores than other students, compared to other applicants, on average. Two other reports confirmed that public university admissions officers were actively seeking out-of-state and international students since they paid higher rates for tuition. Another report found that one in ten admissions officers had said that their college admitted full-pay students despite their having lower average grades and test scores. Reports vary about whether the financial neediness of applicants impacts admissions chances; one suggested that applicants with strong academic credentials or talents are more likely to get financial aid, but that depending on the college, [...] "borderline admits" [...] needing money were most vulnerable; a second report was that [...] "colleges like rich students". George Washington University, despite claiming to have need blind admissions, was more likely to waitlist financially needy applicants, according to one report. One view was that financial aid depends on how a specific student compares with other students: ...|$|E
