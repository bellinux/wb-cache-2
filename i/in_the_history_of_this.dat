Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.|$|E

It has been reported that in all three of Boca Juniors' victories on Brazilian soil, Boca's players were not allowed to properly sleep in their hotel rooms the night before their final matches because of the chaos and noise created by Brazilian fans outside the hotel rooms, who attempted to disrupt the Argentine players from performing to their best of their abilities the following day.|$|E

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's No Place Like Home", but ranked {{it in the middle of}} his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's No Place Like Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this."
