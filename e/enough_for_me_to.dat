500|$|Following Omkara, Kapoor took a {{short break}} from acting, as she felt that [...] "nothing [...] {{challenging}} <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say yes". In an interview with The Times of India Kapoor commented, [...] "In my initial years in the industry, I pushed myself {{to do a lot}} of work because I was greedy. I did some films—which I now regret—purely for the money. Today, I want to do selective films." [...] Later that year, she appeared briefly in one of the year's biggest hits, the Farhan Akhtar action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name).|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} among the final five Saturn titles to be {{released}} in America. Each of the main developers reflected on what they were proudest of: Naka expressed relief that Sonic Team were able to [...] "get a good overall balance" [...] for the game, whereas Miyoshi thought that the voice navigation system was the strongest aspect. Main programmer Takuya Matsumoto was delighted to see it released before the Saturn's discontinuation, saying [...] "the fact that we've been able to push the Saturn this far is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> die happy". Burning Rangers was released exactly nine months before the Japanese release of the Dreamcast.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Price Peterson of TV.com wrote, [...] "Honestly, that fake-rape reveal was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> flip my {{television}} the bird. [...] Can we please {{end this}} nonsense {{and get into}} a main storyline that isn't bad and offensive?" [...] However, he also added, [...] "so yeah, other than the faked rapes, this was a largely entertaining episode." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club was very negative towards the episode, calling it [...] "downright weird" [...] and that it [...] "veers wildly in tone". He also was critical of Hearst's plotline, {{saying that it was}} too referential to real-life events and fictional works to stand well on its own. Concluding, the reviewer wrote, [...] "The oscillations between drama and comedy, normally the show's strength, seem excessive. [...] And the rape storyline continues to be tonally difficult at best, tone-deaf at worst." ...|$|E
500|$|Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune {{wrote that}} [...] " [...] almost as touched and {{relieved}} by the reunion as Desmond and Penny are"; however, {{she did not}} review [...] "The Constant" [...] as favorably as other critics, giving it an [...] "A–". [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal gave [...] "The Constant" [...] a mixed review. [...] He described it as [...] "an entertaining episode [...] a fine acting performance by Henry Ian Cusick", but criticized Desmond's repetitive story arc, criticized Frank's character, said that [...] "Jeff Fahey is a fine actor, but so far, his character just hasn't really evolved <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> care yet" [...] and concluded, [...] "this episode didn't seem to really raise or answer anything of major importance, so I can't help but feel that it {{was nothing more than}} mid-season filler." [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy graded it with four out of five stars, and wrote that [...] "a refreshing shift in Lost's tone enabled loyal viewers to have their hearts warmed by the long distance smoochfest between Desmond and his beloved Penny".|$|E
2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and {{my job is to}} enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E

Afterwards, he {{and several}} other wrestlers, {{including}} Monster Pro Wrestling's Heavy Metal, spent several hours at the Citrus bar. On September 15, 2007, Jessome participated in a special fundraiser for the Special Olympics in Comox, British Columbia.

Former World Wrestling Federation veteran Tito Santana also made an appearance at the event. Both Santana and himself were quoted by the Cape Breton Post voicing their criticism towards steroid abuse in professional wrestling. Jessome said [...] "I've got size and technical abilities, plus I love to entertain a crowd, so I think that's <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>To</b> put your health at risk just to do something like that, that's not acceptable."

2500|$|Denver's first {{marriage}} was to Anne Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. She {{was the subject}} of his hit [...] "Annie's Song," [...] which he composed in only ten minutes as he sat on a Colorado ski lift after the couple had an argument. They lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of [...] "Rocky Mountain High", inspired by a camping trip with Anne and some friends, Denver purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado. He lived in Aspen continuously until his death. The Denvers adopted a boy, Zachary John, and girl, Anna Kate, who Denver would say were [...] "meant to be" [...] theirs. Denver once said, [...] "I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be remembered by. That's more than enough." [...] Zachary, who is African-American, {{was the subject of}} [...] "A Baby Just Like You", a song that included the line [...] "Merry Christmas, little Zachary" [...] and which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Martell divorced in 1982. In a 1983 interview shown in the documentary John Denver: Country Boy (2013), Denver said that career demands drove them apart; Anne said that they were too young and immature to deal with John's sudden mega-success. The ensuing property settlement caused Denver to become so enraged, he nearly choked Martell, then used a chainsaw to cut their marital bed in half.|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E
