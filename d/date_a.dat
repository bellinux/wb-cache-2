5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses.

A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to <b>date</b> <b>a</b> battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of hydroelectric power are directly related to industrial development.

Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting.
