40|$|A {{computational}} {{model for the}} representation of visual stimuli {{with a population of}} spiking neurons is presented. We show that under mild conditions it is possible to faithfully represent an analog video stream into a sequence of spike trains and provide an algorithm that recovers the video input by using only the spike times of the population. In our model an analog, bandlimited in time, video stream approaches the dendritic trees of a neural population. At each neuron, the multi-dimensional video input is filtered by the neuron's spatiotemporal receptive field, and the one-dimensional output <b>dendritic</b> <b>current</b> enters the soma of the neuron (see Figure 1). The set of the spatial receptive fields is modeled as a Gabor filterbank. The spike generation mechanism is threshold based: Each time the <b>dendritic</b> <b>current</b> exceeds a threshold a spike is fired and the membrane potential is reset by a negative potential through a negative feedback loop that gets triggered by the spike. This simple spike mechanism has been shown to accurately model the responses of various neurons in the early visual system 1. Figure 1 Encoding and decoding mechanisms for video stimuli: The stimulus is filtered by the receptive fields of the neurons and enters the soma Encoding and decoding mechanisms for video stimuli: The stimulus is filtered by the receptive fields of the neurons and enters the soma. Spike generation is threshold based and a negative feedback mechanism resets the membrane potential after each spike. In the decoding part each spike, represented by a delta pulse, is weighted by an appropriate coefficient and then filtered from the same receptive field for stimulus reconstruction. The total sum is passed from a low pass filter to recover the original input stimulus. We prove and demonstrate that we can recover the whole video stream based only on the knowledge of the spike times, provided that the size of the neural population is sufficiently big. Increasing the number of neurons to achieve better representation is consistent with basic neurobiological thought 2. Although very precise, the responses of visual neurons show some variability between subsequent stimulus repeats, which can be attributed to various noise sources 1.

40|$|The {{firing rate}} gain of neurons, {{defined as the}} slope of the {{relation}} between input to a neuron and its firing rate, has received considerable attention in the past few years. This has been largely motivated by the many experimental demonstrations of behavior related gain changes in a variety of neural circuits of the CNS. A surprising result was that a prime candidate, shunting inhibition, apparently does not change the firing rate gain of neurons. However, in this paper, we show a physiologically plausible mechanism by which shunting inhibition in the dendritic tree does, in a simple and direct manner, modulate the firing gain of neurons. The effect is due to a strong attenuation of the <b>dendritic</b> <b>current</b> arriving at the soma by shunting dendritic inhibition. Increasing the dendritic inhibitory conductance enhances the attenuation of current flowing from the dendritic to the somatic compartment and thus reduces firing gain. This mechanism relies on known physiological and anatomical properties of CNS neurons and does not require special features such as tunable neural noise inputs. Gain control by the proposed mechanism may prove to be a ubiquitous feature of neural circuit operations and it is readily verifiable experimentally...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} activity of neurons in brains fluctuates erratically {{both in terms}} of pulse trains of single neurons and the <b>dendritic</b> <b>currents</b> of populations of neurons. Obviously the neurons interact with one another in the production of intelligent behavior, so it is reasonable to expect to find evidence for varying degrees of synchronization of their pulse trains and <b>dendritic</b> <b>currents</b> in relation to behavior. However, synaptic communication between neurons depends on propagation of action potentials between neurons, often with appreciable distances between them, and the transmission delays are not compatible with synchronization in any simple way. Evidence is on hand showing that the principal form of synchrony is by establishment of a low degree of covariance among very large numbers of otherwise autonomous neurons, which allows for rapid state transitions of neural populations between successive chaotic basins of attraction along itinerant trajectories. The small fraction of covariant activity is extracted by spatial integration upon axonal transmission over divergent-convergent pathways, through which a remarkable improvement in signal:noise ratio is achieved. The raw traces of local activity show little evidence for synchrony, other than zero-lag correlation, which appears to be largely a statistical artifact. Brains rely less on tight phase-locking of small numbers of repetitively firing neurons and more on low degrees of cooperativity achieved by order parameters influencing very large numbers of neurons. Brains appear to be indifferent to and undisturbed by widely varying time and phase relations between individual neurons and even large semi-autonomous areas of cortex comprising their cooperative neural masses...|$|R

40|$|The {{dendrites}} of spinal motoneurones {{are highly}} active, generating a strong persistent inward current (PIC) {{that has an}} enormous impact on processing of synaptic input. The PIC is subject to regulation by descending neuromodulatory systems releasing the monoamines serotonin and noradrenaline. At high monoaminergic drive levels, the PIC dominates synaptic integration, generating an intrinsic <b>dendritic</b> <b>current</b> that is as much as 5 -fold larger than the current entering via synapses. Without the PIC, motoneurone excitability is very low. Presumably, this descending control of the synaptic integration via the PIC is used to adjust the excitability (gain) of motoneurones for different motor tasks. A problem with this gain control is that monoaminergic input to the cord is very diffuse, affecting many motor pools simultaneously, probably including both agonists and antagonists. The PIC is, however, exquisitely sensitive to the reciprocal inhibition mediated by length sensitive muscle spindle Ia afferents and Ia interneurones. Reciprocal inhibition is tightly focused, shared only between strict mechanical antagonists, and thus can act to ‘sculpt’ specific movement patterns out of a background of diffuse neuromodulation. Thus it is likely that motoneurone gain is set by the interaction between diffuse descending neuromodulation and specific and focused local synaptic inhibitory circuits...|$|E

Here we show in brain slices from young rats that two kinetically different T-type Ca 2 + currents exist in nRT neurones, with a slowly inactivating current expressed only on proximal dendrites, and fast inactivating current predominantly expressed on soma. Nickel was about twofold more potent in blocking fast (IC 50 64 μm) than slow current (IC 50 107 μm). The halogenated volatile anaesthetic enflurane blocked both currents, but only the slowly inactivating current was affected in voltage-dependent fashion. Slow <b>dendritic</b> <b>current</b> was essential for generation of low-threshold Ca 2 + spikes (LTS), and both enflurane and nickel also suppressed LTS and neuronal burst firing at concentrations that blocked isolated T currents.

Furthermore, since blockade of two different T currents in nRT neurones by enflurane and other volatile anaesthetics occurs within concentrations that are relevant during clinical anaesthesia, our findings suggest that these actions could contribute to some important clinical effects of anaesthetics...|$|E

By contrast, in slices from rats subjected to seizures in vivo, dentate activation additionally produces GABAA receptor-mediated field synaptic responses {{in the presence of}} glutamate receptor antagonists. One-dimensional current source density analysis confirmed the spatial coincidence of the glutamatergic and GABAergic <b>dendritic</b> <b>currents.</b> The GABAA receptor-mediated field responses show frequency-dependent facilitation and strong inhibition during activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. In the presence of glutamate receptor blockers, a conditioning pulse delivered to one site of the dentate gyrus inhibits the population synaptic response and the afferent volley provoked by the activation of a second site, in a bicuculline-sensitive manner. In accordance with this, antidromic responses evoked by mossy fibre activation were enhanced by perfusion of bicuculline. Our results suggest that, for GABA receptor-dependent field potentials to be detected, a considerable number of boutons of a well-defined GABAergic pathway should simultaneously release GABA to act on a large number of receptors. Therefore, putative GABA release from the mossy fibres acts on pre- and postsynaptic sites to affect hippocampal activity at the network level after seizures...|$|R
40|$|The depth-resolved {{synaptic}} local-field potential (LFP) footprint in {{sensory cortex}} following firing in individual thalamic projection neurons can be accurately measured by averaging cortical multielectrode (ME) LFP signals {{over thousands of}} spontaneous thalamic firing events [1, 2]. This spike-triggered LFP method offers a unique window into the thalamocortical connection. However, {{the interpretation of the}} detailed spatiotemporal profile of this LFP footprint is not trivial as the LFP signal reflects a weighted sum over contributions from all <b>dendritic</b> transmembrane <b>currents</b> located {{in the vicinity of the}} recording electrode [3]. We here present results from a biophysically detailed computational study of this LFP footprint, focusing on the thalamocortical LFP response in layer 4 of rodent barrel cortex [1]. As illustrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{common factor}} that {{underlies}} {{several types of}} functional brain imaging is the electric current of masses of dendrites. The prodigious demands for the energy that is required to drive the <b>dendritic</b> <b>currents</b> are met by hemodynamic and metabolic responses that are visualized with fMRI and PET techniques. The high current densities in parallel dendritic shafts and the broad distributions of the loop currents outside the dendrites generate both the scalp EEG and the magnetic ﬁelds seen in the MEG. The measurements of image intensities and potential ﬁelds provide state variables for modeling. The relationships between the intensities of current density and the electric, magnetic, and hemodynamic state variables are complex and far from proportionate. The state variables are complementary, because the information they convey comes from differing albeit overlapping neural populations, so that efforts to cross-validate localization of neural activity relating to speciﬁed cognitive behaviors {{have not always been}} successful. We propose an alternative way to use the three methods in combination through studies of hemisphere-wide, high-resolution spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity recorded non-invasively and analyzed with multivariate statistics. Success in this proposed endeavor requires speciﬁcation of what patterns to look for. At the present level of understanding, an appropriate pattern is any signiﬁcant departure from random noise in the spectral, temporal and spatial domains that can be scaled into the coarse-graining of time by fMRI/BOLD and the coarse-graining of space by EEG and MEG. Here the requisite patterns are predicted to be large-scale spatial amplitude modulation (AM) of synchronized neuronal signals in the beta and gamma ranges that are coordinated but not correlated with fMRI intensities...|$|R
40|$|When {{we think}} about neural cells, we {{immediately}} recall the wealth of electrical behaviour which, eventually, brings about consciousness. Hidden deep in the frequencies and timings of action potentials, in subthreshold oscillations, and in the cooperation of {{tens of billions of}} neurons, are synchronicities and emergent behaviours that result in high-level, system-wide properties such as thought and cognition. However, neurons are even more remarkable for their elaborate morphologies, unique among biological cells. The principal, and most striking, component of neuronal morphologies is the dendritic tree. Despite comprising {{the vast majority of the}} surface area and volume of a neuron, dendrites are often neglected in many neuron models, due to their sheer complexity. The vast array of dendritic geometries, combined with heterogeneous properties of the cell membrane, continue to challenge scientists in predicting neuronal input-output relationships, even in the case of subthreshold <b>dendritic</b> <b>currents.</b> In this thesis, we will explore the properties of neuronal dendritic trees, and how they alter and integrate the electrical signals that diffuse along them. After an introduction to neural cell biology and membrane biophysics, we will review Abbott's dendritic path integral in detail, and derive the theoretical convergence of its infinite sum solution. On certain symmetric structures, closed-form solutions will be found; for arbitrary geometries, we will propose algorithms using various heuristics for constructing the solution, and assess their computational convergences on real neuronal morphologies. We will demonstrate how generating terms for the path integral solution in an order that optimises convergence is non-trivial, and how a computationally-significant number of terms is required for reasonable accuracy. We will, however, derive a highly-efficient and accurate algorithm for application to discretised dendritic trees. Finally, a modular method for constructing a solution in the Laplace domain will be developed...|$|R
