5|$|According to {{the famous}} DNA {{hybridization}} study into avian phylogenetic relationships by Sibley and Ahlquist, the split of the Procellariiformes into the four families occurred around 30 million years ago; a fossil bone often attributed to the order, described as the genus Tytthostonyx, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> rocks dating around the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (70-60 mya), but the remains are too incomplete for placement within the Procellariiformes to be certain.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E
5|$|Both Douglas fir and Suillus lakei are {{non-native}} {{introduced species}} in Europe.

5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase.
