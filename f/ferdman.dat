He {{worked as a}} mechanical engineer until 1969, and played as an amateur with Mark Rozovsky company based at Moscow University. <b>Ferdman</b> first appeared on screen in 1967. His stage name Farada was a nickname that emerged {{in one of his}} early filming tours of Central Asia. A studio manager refused to insert a Jewish surname, <b>Ferdman,</b> into film credits, and when <b>Ferdman</b> pressed him to [...] "just invent some charade" [...] (шарада, sharada), found nothing better than Sharada Farada. Farada stuck with the actor.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ferdman</b> {{was born}} into the Jewish family of Army officer Lev <b>Ferdman</b> and {{pharmacist}} Ida Shuman. His father died when Semyon was 14. Later he tried to pursue a military career but failed the physical test at the Tank Forces School. He applied to Bauman Moscow State Technical University (then MVTU) and barely passed the exams; after {{three years in the}} classes he was drafted into the Baltic Fleet where he served for four years. The navy noticed Ferdman's artistic talent and assigned him to the garrison theatre in Baltiysk. There while playing the part of a long-haired anarchist on stage, he was the only Baltic Fleet sailor allowed to wear long hair.|$|E

5000|$|Many journalists, like Roberto A. <b>Ferdman,</b> {{author of}} Stop Calling Yourself a Foodie in the Washington Post, also criticize the word saying [...] "There {{is a great}} irony in {{describing}} yourself as a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever would." [...] <b>Ferdman</b> claims that people who associate themselves with being a [...] "foodie" [...] are in fact distancing themselves from the group they wish to be associated with. The author then states {{that there is nothing}} wrong with having an interest in food, in fact this popular trend is helping the food movement thrive. Ferdmans main argument is that since the word is so widely used, its meaning has become ubiquitous and some meaning is lost upon the need to constantly announce how much someone likes to eat.|$|E

40|$|Diverse and {{inclusive}} organizations {{are supposed to}} enrich members ’ task effectiveness, interpersonal relation-ships, and personal efficacy so that members can achieve their best. In our previous columns, {{we have tried to}} com-municate the shape and texture of inclusion—to present our vision of what inclusive environments might look like and how they can be cultivated (Davidson & <b>Ferdman,</b> 2001, 2002; <b>Ferdman,</b> 2003; <b>Ferdman</b> & Davidson, 2002 a, 2002 b). But the vision of an inclusive organization is severely compromised if it doesn’t also address the paradox of inclusion: What happens when someone really doesn’t fit in the inclusive environment? This {{is one of the most}} chal-lenging questions facing leaders and managers who genuinely want to make their organizations more inclusive. The vision for inclusion may be com-pelling, but people want to know how to get there and how to “live ” there effectively when they arrive...|$|E

40|$|Rapidly {{changing}} {{demographics and}} evolving socioeconomic factors are now {{much more likely}} to be the deciding factors in the longevity or the brief career prospects of a teacher, than matters of pedagogy. As baby boomers retire, it is simply becoming more and more difficult to find and recruit teachers (Chevalier, McIntosh & Dolton, 2007). In such a context, it has become radically important not just to train teachers but to retain them within the profession (Schwartz & Wurtzel, 2007). If you add to this the profound overhaul inclusive education has represented for all teachers, and particularly the young and inexperienced, the tasks appears a near impossible leadership challenge (Wasserman, Gallegos & <b>Ferdman,</b> 2008). Teaching is increasingly becoming a juggling act between the fast paced acquisition of adapted pedagogical skills, the development of empathy an...|$|E
40|$|All {{differences}} are not created equally. Earnest and well-meaning {{efforts to create}} inclusion in organizations often come up short for reasons that appear hard to under-stand. The leaders of the organization implement policies, procedures, and practices similar to those we outlined in our last column (<b>Ferdman</b> & Davidson, 2002) {{as a way of}} fos-tering inclusion in organizations. Yet they feel stymied by the intractability of continuing problems in the work com-munity such as racial or gender inequities, perceptions of unfair exclusion by a variety of organization members, and pervasive feelings of alienation. At this year’s SIOP Conference in Toronto, we convened a special ses-sion, Dialogue on Diversity and Inclusion in Organizations: SIOP and Beyond, in which a diverse group of SIOP members engaged one another in an exciting and provocative conversation that revealed just this paradox. Three invited panelists—Ann Marie Ryan, Robert Dipboye, and Michel...|$|E
40|$|To {{choose not}} to engage in {{dialogue}} about diversity in almost any modern organization is just plain dumb. On the surface, that may seem like a controversial, even offensive, statement. After all, thoughtful individuals have grappled with the implications of valuing diversity in a variety of organizations. For every proponent who argues that diversi-ty is the right and rational thing to do in a corporation, school, or profes-sional organization, there is an equally articulate opponent arguing that “valuing diversity ” is too often a proxy for instituting unjust policies (e. g., quotas) that deny qualified people opportunities, and harm the underquali-fied people afforded opportunities with which they are unprepared to cope (<b>Ferdman,</b> 1997). This kind of powerful discourse (sometimes conducted in less than civil tones) pervades modern organizations in the United States, and increasing-ly, {{in other parts of the}} world.

40|$|The Double Pulsar, PSR J 0737 - 3039 A/B, is {{a unique}} system in which both neutron stars have been {{detected}} as radio pulsars. As shown in <b>Ferdman</b> et al., {{there is no evidence}} for pulse profile evolution of the A pulsar, and the geometry of the pulsar was fit well with a double-pole circular radio beam model. Assuming a more realistic polar cap model with a vacuum retarded dipole magnetosphere configuration including special relativistic effects, we create synthesized pulse profiles for A given the best-fit geometry from the simple circular beam model. By fitting synthesized pulse profiles to those observed from pulsar A, we constrain the geometry of the radio beam, namely the half-opening angle and the emission altitude, to be 30 ^∘ and 10 neutron star radii, respectively. Combining the observational constraints of PSR J 0737 - 3039 A/B, we are able to construct the full three-dimensional orbital geometry of the Double Pulsar. The relative angle between the spin axes of the two pulsars (Δ_S) is estimated to be (138 ^∘± 5 ^∘) at the current epoch and will likely remain constant until tidal interactions become important in ∼ 85 Myr, at merger.

40|$|Food {{is the one}} {{consistent}} variable between {{cultures and}} communities that unites people. In the last 80 years, {{as a result of}} the shift from locally owned family farms to the industrial scale production of cash crops, consumers have become isolated and alienated from where food comes from and how it is grown (<b>Ferdman,</b> 2014) This lack of understanding is due to an absence of education about food production, raising the question: How can food production be reimagined and presented in a way that is eye catching, promotes a healthy diet, and fosters an excitement about and fundamental understanding of how food grows? As defined in my thesis, urban agriculture is a contemporary response to some of these problems, aiming to re-educate and re-connect people to food in a hands on way. MOD Food aims to advance this example by sparking a discussion about, and responding to, these questions to provide a system that is functional, adaptable, and educational for a multitude of ages, demographics, and communities. I create a new mobile food installation to fill the gaps in the existing and innovative modular food systems. The design responds to themes in existing mobile food systems. MOD food accomplishes an integration of multiple production methods, drawing from a list of programatic and educational components to provide awareness and education about healthy foods...|$|E
40|$|Terfezia pfeilii is an edible {{mycorrhizal}} fungus that {{thrives in}} the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa. It {{is best known}} by desert dwellers for its flavour and {{as a source of}} nutrition. Although the genus Terfezia is generally regarded as being an ectomycorrhizal mycobiont, the exact mycorrhizal type formed by T. pfeilli and its' associated host plants remains uncertain. Discovery of the host plants for T. pfeilii would first be required in order to further investigate the life cycle and cultivation of this truffle. This study focussed on the isolation of mycelia from the ascocarp, optimising the growth conditions of the mycelial cultures, rapid molecular identification of T. pfeilii, investigation of potential helper bacteria and mycorrhizal synthesis experiments. T. pfeilii ascocarps were harvested from the Spitskop Nature Reserve in Upington, South Africa. Ascocarps were successfully identified using both morphological and molecular methods. Despite the delayed growth mostly caused by contaminating microorganisms, the isolation of T. pfeilii mycelia culture was successful. Molecular techniques were used to confirm the identity of the pure culture. Further studies were conducted on ways to improve the growth conditions of the mycelial culture on Fontana medium. An optimum temperature of 32 °C, the addition of Bovine Serum Albumin as a nitrogen source and a pH of 7. 5 significantly improved the growth of T. pfeilii in vitro. A rapid PeR-based molecular method was developed to speed up the identification of T. pfeilii. Specific primers that can exclusively amplify the ITS region of T. pfeilii were designed and used to identify both the ascocarps and the mycelial culture. The specificity of these primers was confirmed by their inability to amplify DNA from the isolates of contamining fungi obtained during the isolation process. Molecular comparison was made to confirm the reclassification of South African samples of T. pfeilii as Kalaharituber pfeilii as proposed by <b>Ferdman</b> et al.,(2005). However, in this study, the name T. pfeilii has been retained. A total of 17 bacterial isolates were obtained from the fruiting bodies of T. pfeaii and these were tested for stimulation of mycelial growth in vitro, indole production and phosphate solubilising capabilities. Bacterial isolates that showed potential to be Mycorrhization Helper Bacteria (MHB) were identified as Paenibacillus sp., Bacillus sp. and Rhizobium tropici. Selected plant seedlings were inoculated with T. pfeilii cultures or ascocarp slurry in order to re-establish the mycorrhizal association. After 8 months, light microscopy observations revealed an endomycorrhizal type association between Cynodon dactylon and T. pfeilii. This was confirmed with molecular analysis using specific T. pfeilii ITS primers. After 15 months, molecular methods confirmed Acacia erioloba as another host plant. These results have provided essential information paving the way for further investigation into the life cycle and biology of the Kalahari truffle.
