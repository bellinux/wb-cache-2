5|$|Javier Lugo from Manga Life found Shikamaru's {{fight in}} the series' fourteenth volume good despite how {{threatening}} it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> For Part II, Park Cooper from the same site acclaimed Shikamaru's strategy {{in dealing with the}} members from the series' antagonist, Akatsuki. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network praised how Shikamaru's epilogue episodes helps to expand his characterization as he decides to aid Naruto when he becomes the Hokage. Reviewing the anime s third episode, Sam Stewart from IGN enjoyed the adult Shikamaru's characterization for how he helps his sons Shikadai but ultimately felt he was overshadowed by his wife Temari.|$|E

The more he indulges in the illusion, the harder it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to face reality.

25|$|Males of {{some species}} use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, {{to aid in}} the {{coercion}} of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, the more likely it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.|$|E

500|$|Lester's fantasies are {{emphasized}} by slow- and repetitive-motion shots; Mendes uses double-and-triple cutbacks in several sequences, and the score alters {{to make the}} audience aware that it is entering a fantasy. One example is the gymnasium scene—Lester's first encounter with Angela. While the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to [...] "On Broadway", Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela. Time slows to represent his [...] "voyeuristic hypnosis" [...] and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela's performance <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> alone. [...] "On Broadway"—which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action—is replaced by discordant, percussive music that lacks melody or progression. This nondiegetic score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Stan Link likens to [...] "vertical time", described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that imparts [...] "a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite 'now' that nonetheless feels like an instant". The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of [...] "On Broadway" [...] and teleological time.|$|E
500|$|Burt {{suffers a}} heart attack {{early in the second}} season. He is {{comatose}} for several days, and Kurt is terrified that he might lose him. When members of the glee club sing religious songs to comfort him, Kurt, who does not believe in God, feels alienated, and lashes out at them. Burt eventually regains consciousness, and Kurt takes charge of his recovery. In the episode [...] "Duets", Kurt suspects new glee club member and transfer student Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is gay and recruits Sam to be his teammate in the club's duets competition. Finn attempts to dissuade Kurt from partnering with Sam by predicting that Sam will be bullied to the point of quitting the club if he sings a duet with another male student. After Burt points out that Kurt may be taking advantage of Sam, Kurt terminates the partnership, and performs a [...] "duet" [...] with himself, singing [...] "Le Jazz Hot!" [...] from Victor Victoria. With unusual empathy, Rachel notices how lonely and unhappy Kurt seems, and realizes how hard it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to be the only publicly gay student at school. She reminds Kurt that the club members value him highly and that he is not alone, and asks him to sing the Judy Garland / Barbra Streisand duet of [...] "Get Happy" [...] and [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again" [...] with her.|$|E
500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Chris Richards from The Washington Post called it [...] "an information-age masterpiece", while USA Today critic Steve Jones said [...] "West deftly uses the 808 drum machine and Auto-Tune vocal effect to channel his feelings of hurt, anger and doubt through his well-crafted lyrics". Dan Cairns from The Times stated, [...] "This so should not work...Yet 808s & Heartbreak is a triumph, recklessly departing from the commercially copper-bottomed script and venturing far beyond West’s comfort zone." [...] Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commended West's {{incorporation of the}} Roland TR-808 drum machine and described the album as [...] "Kanye's would-be Here, My Dear or Blood on the Tracks, a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot called it West's [...] "most radical yet" [...] and said while West's fans may be disappointed, [...] "this one <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> It {{remains to be seen}} if he goes back to making records for everybody else. For now, this is one fascinatingly perverse detour." [...] PopMatters critic Dave Heaton was impressed by West's [...] "song and album construction, and with the way he captures a particular feeling through unusual, evocative, carefully crafted music that’s both simple and complex, cold and warm, mechanical and human, melodic and harsh". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found it [...] "brilliant" [...] with a unique [...] "dark sound" [...] and [...] "engaging tunes", despite a second-half drop-off, and praised West's use of Auto-Tune, which he felt [...] "both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties".|$|E

500|$|On October 24, Trump {{appeared}} on Meet the Press, where {{he announced that}} he would officially join the Reform Party. [...] During the interview, Trump questioned why a politician was better suited to be president than him, commenting [...] "I understand this stuff." [...] He said that the Republican Party has become [...] "too crazy right." [...] Notably, he identified Buchanan as a [...] "Hitler-lover" [...] and mused, [...] "I guess he's an anti-Semite [...] [...] [...] He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't like the gays. [...] It's just incredible that anybody could embrace this guy." [...] As for his reputation as a womanizer, Trump said he would not run if he believed it would be an impediment. [...] The next day, Trump formally joined the Reform Party, changing his voter registration from Republican to Independence Party, the New York affiliate of the Reform Party. [...] On the same day, Buchanan announced that he too would leave the Republican Party to join with the Reform Party and attempt to obtain its presidential nomination. Buchanan said he refused to engage in a [...] "name-calling" [...] contest with Trump but made a thinly veiled attack against Trump's wealth, arguing, [...] "I don't believe the Reform Party nomination can be bought, and I don't believe the Presidency can be bought." [...] On Face the Nation, Pat Choate, the Reform Party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, said Trump would [...] "make a good candidate," [...] but argued that Buchanan could challenge Trump [...] "on the merits" [...] and that Trump and the media were misrepresenting Buchanan's views through [...] "hate politics." [...] Other party members expressed reservations about Trump's comments and personal life. [...] Verney wondered [...] "what the compelling reason <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to seek the presidency." [...] Trump acknowledged himself as [...] "certainly controversial" [...] but labeled himself as [...] "a great businessman," [...] who would [...] "make the greatest treaties that this country's seen in a long time." [...] On Fox News Sunday, he criticized U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and said that as president he himself would fill the position and negotiate trade deals with other countries. [...] He identified France, Japan, Germany, and Saudi Arabia as nations taking advantage of badly negotiated trade deals with the United States.|$|E
