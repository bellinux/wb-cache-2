Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E

H.A.R.M. states that if their ransom <b>demands</b> <b>are</b> not met, {{they will continue to}} use human time bombs to cause destruction around the world. Cate embarks on a train ride to Washington State, where Dr. Schenker is believed to be located. Cate finds him and manages to escort him to safety using an underground base.|$|E
5|$|Tails and Amy {{infiltrate}} G.U.N.'s {{island base}} and rescue Sonic, while Eggman, Shadow and Rouge collect three Emeralds on the island. Eggman makes a global broadcast threatening to fire on Earth in 24 hours if his <b>demands</b> <b>are</b> not met, demonstrating the cannon's power by destroying half the Moon. Sonic, Tails, Amy and Knuckles use their Chaos Emerald {{to track down}} the other six. They infiltrate Eggman's base, boarding his shuttle as it launches into space. Knuckles' Master Emerald shards are spilled along the way, and he leaves to collect them. He again fights Rouge, but when he saves her from falling into a lava pit, she gives him her shards and he restores the Master Emerald.|$|E

The player must destroy both Kilbaba and Ortega and stop four trucks carrying nuclear bombs from blowing up the White House. The PC version also extends the storyline with an extra level set in Alaska, in which the player must wipe out the remainder of Ortega's forces {{under the command of}} a Russian defector named Ptofski, who has taken control of oil tankers and is threatening to destroy the ecosystem with crude oil if his <b>demands</b> <b>are</b> not met.

5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme <b>demands</b> <b>are</b> placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory that}} is being {{examined}} to explain age related declines in working memory {{is that there is}} a limit in attentional resources seen as we age.

Tasks that are simple and more automatic, however, see fewer declines as we age. Working memory tasks often involve divided attention, thus they are more likely to strain the limited resources of aging individuals.|$|E
