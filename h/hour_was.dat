5|$|The White House, the Capitol, {{and various}} other {{buildings}} were evacuated. The afternoon traffic rush <b>hour</b> <b>was</b> affected, with some traffic lights inoperative, and the Washington Metro system's trains operated at reduced speeds while tracks and tunnels were inspected.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{measurements of}} TV audiences were {{performed by the}} C. E. Hooper company of New York. DuMont performed well in the Hooper ratings; in fact, DuMont's talent program, The Original Amateur <b>Hour,</b> <b>was</b> the most popular series of the 1947–48 season. Variety ranked DuMont's popular variety series Cavalcade of Stars as the tenth most popular series two seasons later.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} that had to be used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero <b>hour</b> <b>was</b> once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E
50|$|Unequal <b>hours</b> <b>were</b> {{the result}} of {{dividing}} up the period of daylight into 12 equal hours, and night time into another 12. In Europe, there is more daylight in the summer, and less night, so each of the 12 daylight <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> longer than a night hour. Similarly in winter, daylight <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> shorter, and night <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> longer. These unequal <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> shown by the curved lines radiating from the center. The longer daylight hours in summer can usually be seen at {{the outer edge of}} the dial, and the time in unequal <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> read by noting the intersection of the sun hand with the appropriate curved line.|$|R

50|$|The Binghamton Police Patrol Division {{is divided}} into three daily shifts (reliefs). 'Relief One' <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 10:45pm to 6:45am, 'Relief Two' <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 6:45am to 2:45pm, and 'Relief Three' <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 2:45pm to 10:45pm. Each shift {{consists}} of 1 Captain, 1 Lieutenant, 3 Sergeants, several patrol officers, and 1 K-9 unit.|$|R
5|$|Flies have rapid {{reflexes}} {{that aid}} their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low. Dolichopodid {{flies in the}} genus Condylostylus respond in less than 5 milliseconds to camera flashes by taking flight. In the past, the deer bot fly, Cephenemyia, was claimed {{to be one of}} the fastest insects on the basis of an estimate made visually by Charles Townsend in 1927. This claim, of speeds of 600 to 800 miles per <b>hour,</b> <b>was</b> regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by Irving Langmuir. Langmuir suggested an estimated speed of 25 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during Amenhotep I's reign the first water clock was invented. Amenhotep's court {{astronomer}} Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography, although the oldest surviving mechanism {{dates to the}} reign of Amenhotep III. This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping, because the Egyptian <b>hour</b> <b>was</b> not a fixed amount of time, but was measured as 1/12 of the night. When the nights were shorter in the summer, these waterclocks could be adjusted to measure the shorter hours accurately.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight <b>hour</b> <b>was</b> longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, captain Grubbs had 21,043 hours of flight time, of which 564 <b>hours</b> <b>were</b> on the 747.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918 Holst {{had asked}} Joseph to provide a {{libretto}} for his opera The Perfect Fool, feeling that she might possess the required light touch that he thought his own writing lacked. It {{is not clear whether}} she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music The Sneezing Charm; the ballet, entitled A Magic <b>Hour,</b> <b>was</b> performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her Mirage cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an <b>hour</b> <b>was</b> added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|On the January 31, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, the Mean Street Posse asked the Acolytes to protect them, which {{they refused to}} do, until the Posse offered to pay them. When they did, Bradshaw started the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). In reality, the gimmick of the tag team was created by Bradshaw. To further enhance their gimmick, the APA began to appear weekly {{backstage}} in an office, dubbed the APA Office. After protecting many WWF superstars, the APA began a feud with Bull Buchanan and The Big Bossman. The feud began on the April 10, 2000 edition of Raw, where Buchanan and Bossman attacked the APA during a match, where they protected Kai En Tai. The APA, however, was unsuccessful in winning a tag team match against them at Backlash. On the May 18, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the APA were hired to protect Crash Holly for an hour, {{to prevent him from}} losing his WWF Hardcore Championship. After the <b>hour</b> <b>was</b> up, the APA left, allowing Gerald Brisco to pin Holly for the Hardcore Championship. The situation resulted in Holly challenging Bradshaw in a Hardcore match, which Bradshaw won. Later that week on SmackDown!, Faarooq defeated Holly in a Hardcore match.|$|E
