Firstly, the mechanical sensitivity and the shock response of the micro-gyroscope are theoretically analyzed. In the mechanical design, a novel <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism is proposed to change the modal order and to improve the frequency separation. The micro-gyroscope with the <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism optimizes the drive mode order, increasing the in-phase mode frequency to be {{much larger than the}} anti-phase one. Shock analysis results show that the micro-gyroscope structure with the designed <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism can notably reduce the magnitudes of the shock response and cut down the stress produced in the shock process compared with the traditional elastic coupled one. Simulations reveal that the shock resistance along the drive direction is greatly increased. Consequently, the <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism can change the gyroscope’s modal order and improve the frequency separation by structurally offering a higher stiffness difference ratio. The shock resistance along the driving direction is tremendously enhanced without loss of the mechanical sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|PaperPg. 149 - 152. Compressor {{and driver}} shafts often {{prove to be}} {{overstressed}} in equipment uprate situations. This paper shows how a change from conventional gear-type couplings to the more recent <b>diaphragm</b> <b>coupling</b> design can lower the shaft stresses sufficient to avoid shaft replacement during power uprates of centrifugal compressors or compressor drivers. Equipment uprate projects involving turbomachinery often appear to require time consuming and costly shaft replacements. However, closer examination of how the equipment vendor arrived at his maximum allowable stress levels may frequently show that such shaft replacements can be avoided without undue risk if the coupling selection is optimized. This conclusion {{is based on the}} fact that gear-type coupling have the potential of inducing in a shaft both torional stresses and bending stresses, whereas diaphragm couplings tend to primarily induce torisonal stresses and insignificant bending stresses at best. The economic incentives of finding ways of salvaging major rotating equipment shafts illustrated on a steam turbine shaft originally rated to transmit 17, 600 hp maximum at 6, 400 rpm. If uprating the turbine to 19, 600 hp were being considered, the required changeout of stationary steam path components would cost around $ 60, 000, but a combined replacement cost of about $ 500, 000 would probably be quoted for the main and spare rotor shafts.

40|$|Microphone arrays {{have been}} widely used in sound source {{localization}} for many applications. In order to locate the sound in a discernible manner, the separation between microphones needs to be greater than a critical distance, which poses a fundamental constraint for the miniaturization of directional microphones. In nature, animal hearing organs are also governed by the size constraint; the smaller the organ size, the smaller the available directional cues for directional hearing. However, with an auditory organ separation of only 520 µm, the fly Ormia ochracea is found to exhibit remarkable ability to pinpoint its host cricket at 5 kHz. The key to this fly's phenomenal directional hearing ability {{is believed to be the}} mechanical coupling between the eardrums. This innovative solution can inspire one to find alternative approaches to tackle the challenge of developing miniature directional microphones. The overall goal of this dissertation work is to unravel the underlying physics of the fly ear hearing mechanisms, and to apply this understanding to develop and study novel bio-inspired miniature directional microphones. First, through mechanics and optimization analysis, a fundamental biological conclusion is reached: the fly ear can be viewed as a nature-designed optimal structure that is endowed with the dual optimality characteristic of maximum average directional sensitivity and minimum nonlinearity, at its working frequency of 5 kHz. It is shown that this dual optimality characteristic is only achievable when the right mechanical coupling between the eardrums is used (i. e., proper contributions from both rocking and bending modes are used). More importantly, it is further revealed that the dual optimality characteristic of the fly ear is replicable in a synthetic device, whose structural parameters can be tailored to work at any chosen frequency. Next, a novel bio-inspired directional microphone with mechanically <b>coupled</b> <b>diaphragms</b> is designed to capture the essential dynamics of the fly ear. To study the performance of this design, a novel continuum mechanics model is developed, which features two coupling modules, one for the mechanical coupling of the two diaphragms through a beam and the other for each <b>diaphragm</b> <b>coupled</b> through an air gap. Parametric studies are carried out to explore how the key normalized parameters affect the performance of this directional microphone. Finally, this mechanics model is used to guide the development of a large-scale microphone and a fly-ear sized microphone, both of which are experimentally studied by using a low-coherence fiber optic interferometric detection system. With the large-scale sensor, the importance of using proper contribution from both rocking and bending modes is validated. The fly-ear sized sensor is demonstrated to achieve the dual optimality characteristic at 8 kHz with a ten-fold amplification in the directional sensitivity, which is equivalent to that obtainable from a conventional microphone pair that is ten times larger in size. To best use this sensor for sound source localization, a robotic platform with a control scheme inspired by the fly's localization/lateralization scheme is developed, with which a localization accuracy of better than ± 2 degrees (the same as the fly ear) is demonstrated in an indoor lab environment. This dissertation work provides a quantitative and mechanistic explanation for the fly's sound localization ability for the first time, and it provides a framework for the development of fly-ear inspired acoustic sensors that will impact many fronts...|$|R
