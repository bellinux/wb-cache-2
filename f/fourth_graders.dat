5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, and work in national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading <b>fourth</b> <b>graders</b> on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E
5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and <b>fourth</b> <b>graders</b> can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E

40|$|Science {{is one of}} the {{subjects}} of National Standard School Final Examination (UASBN) in SD/MI, hence the learning achievement of the subject determines the students 2 ̆ 7 graduation. UASBN topics are taken from fourth until sixth grade materials so that science learning achievement of <b>fourth</b> <b>grader</b> needs more attention. But the fact is, based on the data of <b>fourth</b> <b>grader</b> in SDN ‘X 2 ̆ 7 Yogyakarta, the average value for science is sequence to 9 of 11 subjects. Besides, the science average value is still lower than the minimum criteria for completeness (KKM) of science. For years, the method developing in school is the conventional method (Kumara, 2004; Brahim, 2007; Depdiknas, 2008), whereas science is a subject which needs skill of understanding, analyzing, and relating a phenomenon with other phenomenon (Depdiknas, 2007). The purpose of this research is to examine the capability of Menggambar-Menceritakan Gambar method to improve the <b>fourth</b> <b>grader</b> 2 ̆ 7 s science learning achievement. This research used a quasi experimental method with an “untreated control group design with pretest and posttest“. Science test was given for pretest and posttest. The intervention was applied for 10 sessions (3 sessions a week), which was held in 75 minutes. There were 32 partisipants, divided into two groups, experimental group (n= 22) and control group (n= 10). The data was analyzed by T-test. The gain-score was used for the analysis. The result of independent sample t-test analysis showed the differences in science learning achievement between experimental and control group (t= 3, 878; p< 0, 01), while the results of paired sample t-test analysis showed a difference between pretest and posttest scores of the experimental group (t=- 9. 298, p< 0. 01).
