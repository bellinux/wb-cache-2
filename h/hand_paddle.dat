2500|$|The {{shoulder}} girdle is only partly known but {{appears to be}} typical for plesiosaurs. It includes fused clavicles at the anterior end, scapulae (shoulder blades), and large coracoids. The scapulae and coracoids both contribute to the glenoids (arm sockets). A pair of oval holes called pectoral fenestrae are found midway along the scapular/coracoid contacts. The forelimbs are elongate and relatively narrow compared to those of most plesiosaurs. The humerus (upper arm bone) has distinctive curvature, {{which appears to be}} a retained primitive feature among sauropterygians. Mature Plesiosaurus also have a distinctive groove along the ventral surface of the humerus. The forearm includes a flat, broad, crescent-shaped ulna and a [...] "robust and pillar-like" [...] radius. The wrist includes six bones. The <b>hand</b> <b>paddle</b> has five digits; the phalangeal formula is uncertain, but the count for one large individual, from [...] "thumb" [...] to fifth [...] "finger", is 4-8-9-8-6.|$|E

5000|$|The sensations {{produced}} by impact play {{depend on the}} area in which the impact is concentrated. Wide implements such as an open <b>hand,</b> <b>paddle</b> or flogger produce a dull [...] "thuddy" [...] sensation. Narrow implements such as a cane, riding crop, belt or single tail produce a sharp [...] "stingy" [...] sensation.|$|E
5000|$|Handle paddles {{increase}} the resistance the hand experiences {{as it tries}} to move through the water during the effective part of the arm stroke - the part of the stroke described as the [...] "pull". [...] This gives the swimmer considerably more forward propulsion from the arm stroke than does a naked hand, and affords an enhanced kinesthetic [...] "feel" [...] of the pull. It also enhances the swimmer's feel of the [...] "catch", the phase prior to the pull, where the hand turns from a streamlined position to grasp the water and begin the pull. If the hand catches or pulls at an incorrect angle, the increased resistance afforded by the <b>hand</b> <b>paddle</b> will exacerbate the result twisting moment, making the defect clearer to the swimmer. The considerably increased load imposed by the <b>hand</b> <b>paddle</b> on the arm and shoulder can, however, lead to pain and an increased risk of injury, so coaches advise only limited use of paddles and that use be discontinued if the swimmer feels shoulder pain.|$|E
50|$|Reward Challenge: Contestants <b>hand</b> <b>paddle</b> {{on their}} rafts {{from one end}} of the course, {{gathering}} six wheel spokes tied to ropes along the way. Meanwhile, their loved ones at the other end of the course untie their rafts from their buoys. Once the contestants gather all six spokes, they would assemble them on a wheel attached to their partner's raft and use it to bring their partner to the center platform. The first team to accomplish this wins immunity.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>hand</b> <b>paddles,</b> parachute and <b>hand</b> <b>paddles</b> plus parachute on the inter-limb coordination of butterfly swimming. Thirteen male swimmers were evaluated in four random maximal intensity conditions: without equipment, with <b>hand</b> <b>paddles,</b> with parachute and with hand paddles+parachute. Arm and leg stroke phases were identified by 2 D video analysis to calculate the total time gap (T 1 : time between hands' entry {{in the water and}} high break-even point of the first undulation; T 2 : time between the beginning of the hand's backward movement and low break-even point of the first undulation; T 3 : time between the hand's arrival in a vertical plane to the shoulders and high break-even point of the second undulation; T 4 : time between the hand's release from the water and low break-even point of the second undulation). the swimming velocity was reduced and T 1, T 2 and T 3 increased in parachute and hand paddles+parachute. No changes were observed in T 4. Total time gap decreased in parachute and hand paddles+parachute. It is concluded that <b>hand</b> <b>paddles</b> do not influence the arm-to-leg coordination in butterfly, while parachute and hand paddles+parachute do change it, providing a greater propulsive continuity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the influence of different sizes of <b>hand</b> <b>paddles</b> on kinematic parameters during a 100 m freestyle swimming performance in elite swimmers. Nine elite swimmers (19. 1 ± 1. 9 years) completed three tests of 100 m without paddles, with small paddles (271. 27 cm 2) and with large paddles (332. 67 cm 2), respectively. One video camera was used to record the performance during the three trials. The mean swimming velocity, stroke rate and stroke length were measured in the central 10 meters of each 50 m length. The results showed that stroke length tended to increase significantly when wearing <b>hand</b> <b>paddles</b> (p < 0. 05) during both the first and second 50 m sections whereas the increase in swimming velocity occurred only in the second 50 m (p < 0. 05). Conversely, the stroke rate showed a slight decreasing trend with increasing paddle size. During the 100 m freestyle trial the stroke kinematics were changed significantly as a result of the increase in propelling surface size when <b>hand</b> <b>paddles</b> were worn...|$|R

5000|$|Extreme racing {{involves}} paddling a kayak down {{a section}} of hard whitewater. The race {{is similar to a}} timed version of creeking. The rivers used for this sport are typically class V, containing waterfalls and dangerous rapids. Races may have mass-starts or individual timed runs. Having two boat categories is also becoming popular among extreme racers. Many races have different classes including short boat, long boat, and <b>hand</b> <b>paddle.</b> [...] By comparison, whitewater racing involves racing specialized canoes or kayaks down grade II to IV rivers. Traditional whitewater racing boats would be unsuitable for rivers used in extreme races because they are typically made from lightweight carbon fiber, and thus are beyond the ability of the majority of whitewater kayakers. Many whitewater kayak manufacturers are now introducing specialized extreme racing kayaks. These kayaks feature the same durable plastic as many whitewater boats, while incorporating faster hull shapes. Some leading whitewater kayak manufacturers are Jackson Kayaks and Dagger Kayaks ...|$|E
5000|$|A B&O Railroad {{magazine}} {{wrote an}} article noting that Frederick was [...] "an eccentric German with indefatigable energy." [...] When Frederick opened a beer garden and bowling alley, he first built a railroad up the mountainside and had mules turning a pulley system at the top, which moved the railroad cars up the mountain, carrying tourists. But that was not sustainable, so he invented a type of cigar-shaped balloon/blimp {{to be filled with}} hydrogen and which was made of fabric pieces sewn by Margaret, his wife, by <b>hand.</b> <b>Paddle</b> wheels were on the sides and it had two cranks for propulsion windlass. Although hydrogen was plentiful, it was very expensive, and Frederick sunk all his money into financing the gas. Numerous newspaper accounts were made interviewing him about his secretly keeping his inventions in a cave in the Knobly Mountains of West Virginia, and that he applied for patents in New York. One of his balloons was destroyed by fire as it was being filled with hydrogen. Another was supposedly cut to pieces by some of his enemies who thought he was crazy. Another was taken away suddenly by a terrible wind.|$|E

50|$|Cheaper kayak paddles have an {{aluminium}} shaft {{while more}} expensive ones use a lighter fibreglass or carbon fibre shaft. Some paddles have a smaller diameter shaft {{for people with}} smaller <b>hands.</b> <b>Paddle</b> length varies with a longer paddle being better suited for stronger people, taller people, and people using the paddle in a wider kayak. Some paddle makers have an online paddle size calculator. Blades vary in size and shape. A blade with a larger surface area may be desirable for a strong person with good shoulder joints, but tiring for a weaker person or a person with less than perfect shoulder joints. Some paddle makers offer blades in three sizes.|$|R

Description of the data The data has been acquired through a kinect camera and the OpenNI drivers through its ROS interface, which yields a stream of values of markers on the body. Each example from the dataset is associated to a sequence of 3 D positions {{of each of the}} 15 markers. Thus for a sequence of length T, the example would corresponds to T* 15 * 7 values.
