Possible accidents include derailment (jumping the track), a collision with another train or collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians at level crossings. The last accounts {{for the majority of}} rail accidents and casualties. The most <b>important</b> <b>safety</b> measures to prevent accidents are strict operating rules, e.g. railway signalling and gates or grade separation at crossings. Train whistles, bells or horns warn of the presence of a train, while trackside signals maintain the distances between trains.|$|E
25|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} a stick and a rope (or leather belt). The rope is made into a loop that fits over the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by twisting the stick. The primitive device may stem the flow of blood but side-effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur due to the application of unknown, uncontrollable and excessively high pressures and pressure gradients. It is well established by evidence in the clinical literature that higher tourniquet pressures are associated with higher probabilities of tourniquet-related injuries. Modern pneumatic tourniquet systems are microcomputer-based, allowing more accurate and automatic pressure control and many <b>important</b> <b>safety</b> features to minimize the risk of patient injury. Recent trends toward personalized care has increased patient safety by allowing perioperative staff to measure and select a personalized tourniquet pressure based on the patient’s Limb Occlusion Pressure, and select and apply a personalized tourniquet cuff that can adapt the shape of the tourniquet cuff {{to a wide range of}} non-cylindrical limb shapes.|$|E

500|$|As well as {{reporting}} on political violence, Goldstone proposed practical measures {{to end the}} violence in venues such as commuter trains, taxis, mines, township hostels and the troubled Natal region. He also succeeded in persuading the government to accept an international rôle in the transition – which it had previously strongly opposed – as well as forcing it to undertake a major restructuring {{of the security forces}} and purging subversive elements in the military. According to Goldstone, the commission's work helped to calm South Africa during the transition period. He regarded it as [...] "a vitally <b>important</b> <b>safety</b> valve" [...] that provided a [...] "credible public instrument" [...] to deal with incidents that might otherwise have derailed the negotiations.

2500|$|Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy) - Ignoring {{the minor}} effect of surface tensions, an object, wholly or {{partially}} {{immersed in a}} fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to {{the weight of the}} fluid displaced by the object.

2500|$|The benefitsas well as adverse effectsare {{expected}} to be the same for bioidentical and synthetic hormones. Dosages used in BHRT can be as high as ten times the oral dose provided by comparable HRT regimens; the hormones used are known to adversely impact biological markers of cardiovascular disease and may produce a substantially higher risk of heart attack or stroke because of this. [...] There are potentially serious adverse effects and <b>important</b> <b>safety</b> information which is required to be given with FDA approved HRT in the form of package inserts; however, package inserts are typically not given (or required) with compounded bioidentical preparations. This has led consumers into the erroneous assumption that bioidenticals are safer than FDA-approved hormones or lack any adverse effectsone of the concerns expressed about the hormones. [...] BHRT has also been associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E
2500|$|The International Menopause Society, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, The Endocrine Society, [...] the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), United States Food and Drug Administration, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society and the Mayo Clinic have {{released}} statements {{that there is}} a lack of evidence that the benefits and risks of bioidentical hormones are different from well-studied nonbioidentical counterparts; until such evidence is produced the risks should be treated as if they are similar; and that compounded hormone products may have additional risks related to compounding. A major safety concern in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is that there is no requirement to include package inserts, despite the potential for serious adverse effects (including life-threatening adverse effects) associated with HRT. This can lead to consumers being deceived (and harmed), as they are misled into believing that any hormone-related problems and dangers are exclusively related to nonbioidentical hormones, and that BHRT is therefore safe and has no side effects. In reality, the risks of bioidentical hormones have not been studied to the extent of nonbioidentical hormones, so the risks are not well understood. Regulatory bodies require pharmacies to include <b>important</b> <b>safety</b> information with conventional hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) via package inserts.|$|E
2500|$|Pressurized water reactors, {{like all}} thermal reactor designs, require the fast fission {{neutrons}} to be slowed down (a process called moderation or thermal) {{in order to}} interact with the nuclear fuel and sustain the chain reaction. In PWRs the coolant water is used as a moderator by letting the neutrons undergo multiple collisions with light hydrogen atoms in the water, losing speed in the process. This [...] "moderating" [...] of neutrons will happen more often when the water is more dense (more collisions will occur). The use of water as a moderator is an <b>important</b> <b>safety</b> feature of PWRs, as an increase in temperature may cause the water to expand, giving greater 'gaps' between the water molecules and reducing the probability of thermalisation—thereby reducing the extent to which neutrons are slowed down and hence reducing the reactivity in the reactor. Therefore, if reactivity increases beyond normal, the reduced moderation of neutrons will cause the chain reaction to slow down, producing less heat. This property, known as the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, makes PWR reactors very stable. This process is referred to as 'Self-Regulating', i.e. the hotter the coolant becomes, the less reactive the plant becomes, shutting itself down slightly to compensate and vice versa. Thus the plant controls itself around a given temperature set by the position of the control rods.|$|E
