5|$|Scouting {{is taught}} using the Scout method, which {{incorporates}} an informal educational system that emphasizes practical activities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors.</b> Programs exist for Scouts {{ranging in age}} from 6 to 25 (though age limits vary slightly by country), and program specifics target Scouts in a manner appropriate to their age.|$|E
5|$|Scouting {{virtually}} started itself, but {{the trigger}} that set it going was the 1908 publication of Scouting for Boys written by Robert Baden-Powell. At Charterhouse, one of England's most famous public schools, Baden-Powell {{had an interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors.</b> Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he {{took an interest in}} military scouting and in 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|E
5|$|Boy Scouts {{learn to}} use the ideals {{spelled out in the}} Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto ("Be prepared"), and the Scout slogan ("Do a good turn daily"). They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors.</b> The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E

5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors</b> of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{founding}} the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell saw {{the need}} for leader training. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire. Baden-Powell wanted practical training <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors</b> in campsites. World War I delayed the development of leader training, so the first formal Wood Badge course was not offered until 1919. Gilwell Park, just outside London, was purchased specifically to provide a venue for the course and the Opening Ceremonies were held on July 26, 1919. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief at Gilwell Park, conducted the first Wood Badge course there from September 8–19, 1919. It was produced by Percy Everett, the Commissioner of Training, and Baden-Powell himself gave lectures. The course was attended by 18 participants, and other lecturers. After this first course, Wood Badge training continued at Gilwell Park, and it became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement.|$|E
5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, {{he turned to}} his childhood experiences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors</b> as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E

25|$|The Golden Retriever is a large-sized {{breed of}} dog bred as gun dogs to {{retrieve}} shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' {{because of their}} ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors,</b> and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual tendency to roam. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland feudalism and its {{bonds of}} {{allegiance}} to the local laird {{was associated with the}} Jacobite risings with the result that the Hanoverian Government took steps to undermine the system. After 1747 the moot hill was not used {{as a part of the}} baronial court process and the requirement for a gathering place for soldiers was also a thing of the past. The construction of Moot halls did away with the need to meet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors.</b> Moot hills gradually ceased to have any significant role and many have suffered the final ignomy of being ploughed out and their existence almost or actually forgotten. Place names and local folklore have preserved the memory of a few, however records suggest that the majority have been destroyed. A few moot hills ended up with unlikely secondary uses, such as Knockenlaw, which was used as the 'blast wall' for a gunpowder magazine and Chapel Hill which was used as a viewing point for watching horse racing.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that <b>the</b> <b>outdoors</b> environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and <b>in</b> school. <b>The</b> <b>outdoors</b> stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using <b>the</b> <b>outdoors</b> avoids <b>the</b> negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|R

2500|$|A {{distinct}} {{characteristic of}} Rioja wine {{is the effect}} of oak aging. First introduced in the early 18th century by Bordeaux influenced winemakers, the use of oak and the pronounced vanilla flavors in the wines has been a virtual trademark of the region though some modern winemakers are experimenting with making wines less influenced by oak. Originally French oak was used but as the cost of the barrels increased many bodegas began to buy American oak planks and fashion them into barrels at Spanish cooperages in a style more closely resembling the French method. This included hand splitting the wood, rather than sawing, and allowing the planks time to dry and [...] "season" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outdoors</b> versus drying in the kiln.
