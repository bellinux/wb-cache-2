5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park.

In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E

5|$|It is {{seen that}} Justinian regards {{this as a}} novel {{enactment}} of an old law, and that he <b>includes</b> <b>not</b> only the symbolic interpretations of the punishment as found in for example Cicero, but also Constantine's extension of the penalty to fathers who murder their own children. In Justinian, relative to Constantine, we see the inclusion in the sack of the dog, cock and monkey, not just the serpent(s) in Constantine. Some modern historians, such as O.F. Robinson, suspects that the precise wording of the text in the Institutes 4.18.6 suggests that the claimed reference in Digest 48.9.9 from Modestinus is actually a sixth CE interpolation into the third century CE law text, rather than being a faithful citation of Modestinus.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this choice is entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which <b>includes</b> <b>not</b> injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or anyone, and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VII is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Square (now Square Enix) {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment as the seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series. Released in 1997, the game sparked {{the release of a}} collection of media centered on the game entitled the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. The music of the Final Fantasy VII series <b>includes</b> <b>not</b> only the soundtrack to the original game and its associated albums, but also the soundtracks and music albums released for the other titles in the collection. The first album produced was Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack, a compilation of all the music in the game. It was released as a soundtrack album on four CDs by DigiCube in 1997. A selection of tracks from the album was released in the single-disc Reunion Tracks by DigiCube the same year. Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII, an album featuring piano arrangements of pieces from the soundtrack, was released in 2003 by DigiCube, and Square Enix began reprinting all three albums in 2004. To date, these are the only released albums based on the original game's soundtrack, and were solely composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu; his role for the majority of subsequent albums has been filled by Masashi Hamauzu and Takeharu Ishimoto.|$|E

5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This <b>includes</b> <b>not</b> only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution <b>includes</b> <b>not</b> only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E
