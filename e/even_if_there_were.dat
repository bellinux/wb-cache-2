25|$|Some Wágluȟe went {{north to}} the Powder River Country to fight in Red Cloud's War and became closely tied to militant Miniconjou, Sans Arc and Hunkpappa. Other Wágluȟe {{supplied}} food and munitions to Red Cloud. All Wágluȟe respected Red Cloud. The U.S. Army concluded that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> doubts about their reliability, the Wágluȟe’s role as scouts, civil administrators and mediators was absolutely essential.|$|E
25|$|The F-15 {{can trace}} its origins to the Vietnam War, when the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy fought over {{tactical}} aircraft {{being used in}} the war. At the time, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was pressing for both services to use as many common aircraft as possible, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> performance sacrifices involved. As part of this policy, the USAF and Navy were involved in the TFX (F-111) program, aiming to deliver a medium-range interdiction aircraft in Air Force use that would also serve as a long-range interceptor aircraft for the Navy.|$|E

If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.|$|E
25|$|For the besiegers desperate {{measures}} {{were to be}} made; at nightfall an English officer approached the bastion with a flag of truce. This was a ruse - behind him in the dark Norrey's English soldiers quietly approached hoping {{to take advantage of}} the situation. The ruse was successful - they then threw themselves at the breach and this time swept in, overwhelming the Spanish in desperate hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish fought bravely but were all eventually put to the sword; no quarter was given <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> women and children inside.|$|E

After the consulship, with Rome {{struggling}} with famine caused by the slave revolt on Sicily, Aquillius was sent to put it down. Aquilius completely subdued Salvius and his insurgents and got an ovation in Rome in 100 BC. In 98 BC, Aquillius was accused by Lucius Fufius of maladministration in Sicily. In the trial he was defended by Marcus Antonius, Consul in 99 BC, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> strong proofs of his guilt, he was acquitted because of his bravery in the war.|$|E
25|$|If a cow had {{two black}} or white hairs growing within one follicle, it was invalid. Rabbi Judah said even within one hollow. If the hairs grew within two {{adjacent}} follicles, the cow was invalid. Rabbi Akiva ruled that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> four or even five non-red hairs, if they were dispersed, they could be plucked out. Rabbi Eliezer ruled that even as many as 50 such hairs could be plucked. But Rabbi Joshua ben Bathyra ruled that {{even if it had}} only one non-red hair on its head and one on its tail, it was invalid. If the cow had two hairs in one follicle with their roots black and their tips red or with their roots red and their tips black, Rabbi Meir taught that what was visible determined validity; but the Sages ruled that validity followed the root.|$|E

The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and I think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E

25|$|In 1637, Grandmaster Giovanni Paolo Lascaris {{set out to}} levy a tax of 50,000 scudi on the Maltese for the {{construction}} of the Floriana Lines. The Grandmaster ignored a protest against the tax by the Maltese clergy, lodged with Pope Urban VIII. The Pope sided with the Order against the laity and the clergy, and the Grandmaster ordered taxmen to start their collections. The tax collectors met immediately with opposition and an uprising began in September in Żejtun, the first village where collection was attempted. The leaders hoped to assemble the people at Marsa, then to march on Valletta as a procession with a cross or some statue of a saint. The parish priest of Żejtun was alarmed at these preparations, particularly the suggestions to bear arms in the protest, and informed Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa. The Bishop sent the priest to the inquisitor, Fabio Chigi, later Pope Alexander VII, who ordered him to report everything to the grandmaster. The latter imprisoned the lay leaders of the revolt. Acting on Chigi's advice, the grandmaster did not arrest local priests, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> suspicions they were involved in the revolt.|$|E
25|$|From 1860 many {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} Persian Jewish community to secure assistance from European Jews against Muslims. These requests were full of descriptions of poverty and persecution faced by Jews in Persia. The following is one example of such requests :"Allow us to present our supplications to you. You would not want your brethren, your own flesh and blood, to perish in frightful penury, to be victims of renewed persecutions which awaits them with each passing day. We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and do with us whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant dread of some new tragedy which they might bring upon us. our lives, property, honor, everything that is dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{identify}} differentially expressed genes using a {{fold change}} cutoff, {{one can use}} a variety of statistical tests or omnibus tests such as ANOVA, all of which consider both fold change and variability to create a p-value, an estimate of how often we would observe the data by chance alone. Applying p-values to microarrays is complicated by the large number of multiple comparisons (genes) involved. For example, a p-value of 0.05 is typically thought to indicate significance, since it estimates a 5% probability of observing the data by chance. But with 10,000 genes on a microarray, 500 genes would be identified as significant at p < 0.05 <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no difference between the experimental groups. One obvious solution is to consider significant only those genes meeting a much more stringent p value criterion, e.g., one could perform a Bonferroni correction on the p-values, or use a false discovery rate calculation to adjust p-values in proportion to the number of parallel tests involved. Unfortunately, these approaches may reduce the number of significant genes to zero, even when genes are in fact differentially expressed. Current statistics such as Rank products aim {{to strike a balance between}} false discovery of genes due to chance variation and non-discovery of differentially expressed genes. Commonly cited methods include the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a wide variety of methods are available from Bioconductor and a variety of analysis packages from bioinformatics companies.|$|E

During the following season, 1899–1900, with Lloyd as captain, the club was reinvigorated and scored 416 points compared with 192 in the previous season. Phillips and Lloyd were adjudged to be the half-back pair of the season at both club and international level, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some more brilliant individuals. In total, Phillips appeared 90 times for Newport, scoring 9 tries, 2 drop goals and 1 penalty.

500|$|There {{has been}} a {{difference}} between Marine Le Pen's and her father's views concerning the Holocaust and Jews. In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine Rivarol that the German occupation of France [...] "was not particularly inhumane, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a few blunders, inevitable {{in a country of}} [...] " [...] and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as [...] "a point of detail {{of the history of the}} Second World War." [...] He has repeated the latter claim several times. Also in 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said [...] "I do not question the existence of concentration camps but historians could discuss the number of deaths. As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to speak their minds" [...] (de se déterminer). Jean-Marie Le Pen received fines for this sentence, Bruno Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation. The current leader of the party, Marine Le Pen distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest against her father's comment.|$|E
