25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E
25|$|Online {{infidelity}} {{can be just}} as {{damaging to}} a relationship as offline physical unfaithfulness. A possible explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> brain registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly. Several studies have concluded that online infidelity, whether sexual or emotional in nature, often leads to off-line infidelity.|$|E
25|$|Social action models {{help explain}} Social Outcomes because of basic sociological ideas {{such as the}} Looking Glass Self. The idea of Cooley's looking glass self <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> sense of self {{develops}} as we observe and reflect upon others and what they may think of our actions. Additionally, impression formation processes allow us to interpret the significance of others' actions.|$|E

30|$|Some of the {{limitations}} of the present study <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> sample <b>was</b> composed mainly of university students who read frequently, making them atypical of the surrounding population, since the Brazilian reading standard has a high index of functional illiteracy (INAF, 2016). Other limitations <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> semantic decision task was not validated, and we only used one semantic measure. Thus, we encourage other researchers to use larger and more diverse samples. It would also be interesting to attempt to validate the semantic decision task.|$|R

25|$|The {{issue of}} climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril. There may still be {{disputes}} about exactly how much is naturally occurring, but what we can be scientifically certain of <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us {{to a point of}} no return. And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|Dennett's thesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> modern {{understanding}} of consciousness is unduly {{influenced by the}} ideas of René Descartes. To show why, he starts {{with a description of}} the phi illusion. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour before the second light is observed.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E

25|$|The {{cells in}} which all these DNA {{alterations}} accumulate are difficult to trace, but two recent lines of evidence suggest that normal stem cells may be the cells of origin in cancers. First, there exists a highly positive correlation (Spearman’s rho = 0.81; P < 3.5 × 10−8) between {{the risk of developing}} cancer in a tissue and the number of normal stem cell divisions taking place in that same tissue. The correlation applied to 31 cancer types and extended across five orders of magnitude. This correlation means that if the normal stem cells from a tissue divide once, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 1X. If they divide 1,000 times, the cancer risk is 1,000X. And if the normal stem cells from a tissue divide 100,000 times, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 100,000X. This strongly suggests that the main reason we have cancer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> normal stem cells divide, which implies that cancer originates in normal stem cells. Second, statistics show that most human cancers are diagnosed in aged people. A possible explanation is that cancers occur because cells accumulate damage through time. DNA is the only cellular component that can accumulate damage over the entire course of a life, and stem cells are the only cells that can transmit DNA from the zygote to cells late in life. Other cells cannot keep DNA from the beginning of life until a possible cancer occurs. This implies that most cancers arise from normal stem cells.|$|E
500|$|Black, however, {{believed}} that this interpretation of the due process clause was unjustifiably broad. In his dissent to Griswold, he charged that the doctrine of substantive due process [...] "takes away from Congress and States {{the power to make}} laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom, and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination." [...] Instead, Black advocated a much narrower interpretation of the clause. In his dissent to In re Winship, he analyzed the history of the term [...] "due process of law", and concluded: [...] "For me, the only correct meaning of that phrase <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> Government must proceed according to the 'law of the land'—that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions as interpreted by court decisions." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{version of}} events was refuted in 1827 by {{historian}} William James, who wrote in response [...] to Brenton that [...] "All we [...] can say to this extraordinary statement <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> [...] account was taken chiefly from Bostons log book, {{and we have not}} the least reason, from subsequent inquiries, to believe it to be incorrect." [...] Subsequent histories, including William Laird Clowes' book of 1900 and Richard Woodman's of 2001 follow James, but in his 1837 reprint Brenton defended the account and named Alexander Robert Kerr, second lieutenant of Boston during the action, as his source. In the same year a magazine article written by a niece of Captain Courtenay continued to repeat the allegations, stating that [...] "the treacherous or – to say the least of it – the improper and unprofessional conduct of Lieutenant Edwards" [...] had been responsible for his commander's death.|$|E

500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{previous}} lockout, which shortened the [...] from 82 to 50 games, a six-year deal between the owners, led by commissioner David Stern, and the players, led by director Billy Hunter and president Patrick Ewing {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), was reached. As the CBA was set to expire on June 30, 2005, the two sides began to negotiate in early 2005. There were several issues obstructing the new agreement, which included adding an age limit for rookies, toughening the existing drug-testing program and limiting the length of long-term contracts. However, negotiations went smoothly and the two sides were able to reach a deal in June 2005, avoiding the lockout. That deal guaranteed players 57percent of basketball-related income (BRI) and lasted for six years, until June 30, 2011. A year after signing the deal, eight owners signed a petition requesting Stern address the disparity between small-market and large-market teams. They wrote that [...] "the hard truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> current economic system works only for larger-market teams and a few teams that have extraordinary success ...The {{rest of us are}} looking at significant and unacceptable annual financial losses." ...|$|E

[...] Secretary General Irene Khan also responded saying, [...] "The administration's response has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> report <b>is</b> absurd, <b>that</b> <b>our</b> allegations have no basis, and our answer is very simple: if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so, open up these detention centres, allow us and others to visit them." ...|$|R
