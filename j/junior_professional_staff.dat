This paper presents the results of a study which examines how the level of cooperative relationship between the parents of persons with moderate, severe and profound learning disabilities and the <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> of Training, Occupation and Care Centres in Slovenia is correlated to the interactive style and family competence of their families. The sample comprised 296 randomly selected parents and 298 randomly selected <b>professional</b> <b>staff.</b> The results show that the level of the relationship between parents and <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> is significantly correlated {{to the level of the}} interactive style and family competence both in the parents' families and the families of the <b>professional</b> <b>staff.</b> The conclusion proposes some steps for improving the situation in this field...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} shift in the discourses around <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> in higher {{education}} that has been influenced by neoliberal agenda that focused on driving education reforms. Earlier discussions centring around nomenclature variations have progressed to those about creating and developing borderless professionals operating in the third space – a notional space where <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> and academic staff with diverse and valuable skills work as equal professional partners on complex and multifaceted projects. This article looks at the evolution of the debates around <b>professional</b> <b>staff.</b> It considers how the notions of professionalism and professionalisation are being reconceptualised in the third space. Discussion progresses towards capability building and developmental opportunities of aspiring third space <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> in higher education settings. Possible pathways of engaging with and empowering <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> in designing their future careers and professional identities are considered. Building a community of research practices {{under the auspices of the}} Association for Tertiary Education Management (ATEM) and engaging postgraduate students in the university third space project work are proposed as potential areas for further research in the field of <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> capability building...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} full-time, live-in <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> {{member is}} one of {{critical}} importance to college and university communities, especially {{as it relates to}} the management of the co-curricular, holistic living and learning experience that is to be provided within an on-campus residential facility. Thousands of students undertake the collegiate experience each year, and the full-time, live-in <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> assumes the critical role of "pseudo parent " for these students that have now come to call their college campuses home. The responsibilities are major and the impact of the full-time, live-in <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> upon students under his or her supervision can be profound. Consequently, just as it is important to cater to the vast array of needs presented by students, it is just as important to underscore the well-being of the full-time, live-in <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> member. A mixed-method study investigating the factors that influence employee morale of full-time, live-in <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> at two single-gender institutions of higher education was the central focus ofthis research investigation.

The main findings were that: ·	<b>Professional</b> <b>staff</b> turnover was 50 % within a period of 18 months across all the NGOs interviewed. ·	For the <b>professional</b> <b>staff,</b> the main factors contributing to staff turnover were: ineffective organisational policies, systems and procedures; poor relationships and communication; and poor organisational values and culture. ·	In addressing the problem, NGO leaders tend to concentrate on efforts to improve salaries and other monetary benefits; and training opportunities. In order to more comprehensively address the problem of staff turnover among the <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> however, NGO leaders must adopt a process or an Organisation Development (OD) approach.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{research}} university has had many consequences including an evolving workforce. With growth and evolution has come a need to keep faculty primarily engaged in their teaching and research roles, freeing them from other administrative burdens. To accomplish this task, the university began employing more administrators and <b>professional</b> <b>staff.</b> Over time, however, specialization and differentiation of the academic workforce have resulted in an overlap of some responsibilities between <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> and faculty.;The {{purposes of this study}} were to develop {{a better understanding of the}} roles and responsibilities of <b>professional</b> <b>staff,</b> especially those who have become involved in the academic mission at American research universities, and to reveal the degree to which these roles overlap with the roles and responsibilities of faculty. The importance of this study lies in using this new understanding to most effectively employ academic <b>professional</b> <b>staff</b> for the overall excellence of the university they serve.;As part of the study, questions were asked about roles, characteristics, and careers of academic professionals in a research university and where these roles overlapped with faculty.
