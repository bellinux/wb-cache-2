50|$|Appendix Two {{contains}} the following (all in Latin):• Five collect-style prayers to God.• A short litany <b>of</b> <b>invocations</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Trinity.• A long litany <b>of</b> <b>invocations</b> <b>of</b> Jesus.• Short <b>invocations</b> to the Lord with the sign <b>of</b> the Cross.• <b>Invocations</b> <b>of</b> the Blessed Virgin Mary, including the Sub tuum and Memorare.• The well-known shorter Prayer to St Michael.• A short litany of saints.|$|R
50|$|The litany is {{published}} in five sections.

5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion.

5|$|March 20/March 21. The Equinox of the Gods, {{which is}} {{commonly}} referred to as the Thelemic New Year (although some celebrate the New Year on April 8). Although the equinox and the <b>Invocation</b> <b>of</b> Horus often fall on the same day, they are often treated as two different events. This date is the Autumnal equinox in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> Miranda rights {{could be}} implied from the behavior or ambiguous {{words of the}} accused. It concluded (in line with previous cases such as Davis v. United States) that there was good reason why invoking these rights should require an unambiguous act of the accused, including certainty for police, prosecutors, and accused, and social benefit in law enforcement.|$|E

5|$|The Cylinder {{itself is}} part of a {{continuous}} Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures. Newly crowned kings of Babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns, often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings. Some contained messages, while others did not, and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through the <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> divine protection.|$|E
5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon {{would have had}} to have been designed from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized prior to the breakdown of the London Naval Treaty and the <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (which the United States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, especially to the United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm guns of contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm guns, of which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently {{amounted to a}} footnote. For instance, English Thelemite Kenneth Grant suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked {{the start of the}} appearance of flying saucers in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the Roswell UFO incident and Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. Cameron postulated that the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident was a spiritual reaction to Parsons' death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite Kenneth Anger's short film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> Babalon begun by Parsons' working, and later said that his Book of the AntiChrist prophecies were fulfilled through the manifestation of Babalon in her person.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five permanent members of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E

5|$|The NATO council {{declared}} {{the attacks on}} the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter. This marked the first <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind. Australian Prime Minister John Howard who was in Washington D.C. during the attacks invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty. The Bush administration announced a War on Terror, with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.|$|E
5|$|Inter-Sultanate marriages {{normalised}} {{relations and}} Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565. The most notable {{ruler of the}} dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine-year-old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by {{the first of the}} Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor Akbar, but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate. A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called Kitab-e-Nauras is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> the Hindu Goddess Saraswati. During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from Ahmadnagar joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Vellore came during these campaigns.|$|E
5|$|While the proem and <b>invocation</b> <b>of</b> Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi are {{composed}} of several original lines of Latin in addition to lines borrowed from or alluding to the Roman poet Virgil, the Silver Age poet Lucan, and the fourth-century poet Juvencus, {{the rest of the}} work is entirely a Virgilian cento, which is a patchwork poem of verses extracted from the works of Virgil. Proba's choice to rework Virgil seems to have been made for two reasons: First, Virgil was an influential poet who was commissioned by Caesar Augustus, the first Roman emperor, to write the epic Aeneid. The poet's influence was felt well into late antiquity, and he was imitated by Juvencus and Prudentius. The respect given to Virgil eventually manifested in centos, which reached their peak in the fourth century AD. Second, Virgil was often appropriated by Christian authors due to a popular interpretation of his fourth Eclogue, which many believed to be a prophecy of the birth of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Jagger {{has also}} had an {{intermittent}} acting career, most well-known {{for his role in}} Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film <b>Invocation</b> <b>of</b> My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. Jagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry the original performer from its run on London's West End. The same year he was approached by director Alejandro Jodorowsky {{to play the role of}} Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, but the movie never made it to the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978 and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, in the late 1970s. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2002).|$|E
