5|$|Above all, {{he possessed}} a {{resolute}} decision of character, which, however unfortunately it may <b>have</b> <b>operated</b> under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at {{the crisis of}} continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak {{for it in the}} scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.|$|E
