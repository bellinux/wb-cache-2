50|$|The Malatya {{region is}} best known for its apricot orchards. About 50% of the fresh apricot {{production}} and 95% of the dried apricot production in Turkey, the world's leading apricot producer, is provided by Malatya {{and the name of the}} fruit is synonymous with the city. It reached its most delicious and sophisticated form in the fertile soil of Malatya, nourished from the alluvial soil of the Euphrates. Overall, about 10-15% of the worldwide crop of <b>fresh</b> <b>apricots,</b> and about 65-80% of the worldwide production of dried apricots comes out of Malatya. Malatya apricots are often sun-dried by family-run orchards using traditional methods, before they are collected and shipped throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>apricot</b> {{pulp and}} its {{processed}} products (bar, chutney, and leather) were analyzed for physicochemical (moisture content, titrable acidity (TA), ascorbic acid, and percent reducing sugars) and antioxidant properties (2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power, total phenolics, lipid peroxidation, ferric reducing antioxidant potential, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity). Reducing sugars, TA, and ascorbic acid content {{were found to}} be higher in the processed products than the fresh pulp. A significant difference in the antioxidant properties between the <b>fresh</b> <b>apricot</b> pulp and its processed products was observed. The difference in antioxidant properties between the fresh and the processed products may be attributed to the partial degradation of the bioactive compounds by the action of heat during processing. Among the processed products, apricot bar showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Therefore, production of apricot bar could a suitable option for processing of apricots...|$|R

40|$|Dried {{apricots}} {{are one of}} Tajikistan’s major export products. The country {{wants to}} expand its production in the southern region. However, the producers don’t have the expertise needed to produce dried apricots that meet the quality requirements of the European Union and other potential export markets. Local producers in southern Tajikistan would benefit from improvements in methods of applying sulfur and drying the apricots. This {{would allow them to}} gain a share of global markets. Methods that were studied include sulfur treatment prior to drying and approaches for rapidly drying the apricots while preventing contamination. Because the project has just started, efforts are focused on developing the methods to determine the quality of apricots. Preliminary tests were conducted on dried apricots purchased from local stores or on <b>fresh</b> <b>apricots</b> dried by project personnel. These will serve as standards against which Tajikistan dried apricots will be compared. Quality factors evaluated included color, microbial content, sulfur content, water activity, percent soluble solids, and moisture content. This paper reports results of preliminary quality tests conducted on dried apricots purchased from stores in West Lafayette and Lafayette, Indiana. To prepare for future studies, thin layer drying tests were conducted on <b>fresh</b> <b>apricots</b> purchased from local stores and apricots grown in Michigan which were obtained from a contact in the Lafayette Farmer’s Market. These apricots were treated and dried in a thin layer dryer at three different temperatures to better understand factors that affect drying rate.

40|$|The {{influence}} of two commercial Prunus rootstocks (‘Myrabolan 29 /C’ and apricot ‘Seedling’) on fruit entity {{and quality of}} ‘Pisana’ apricot cultivar (Prunus armeniaca L.) was evaluated over two consecutive crop seasons. The effect of rootstock on the total antioxidant capacity, total phenols and physicalchemical traits of <b>fresh</b> <b>apricots</b> was studied at the ready-to-eat stage and after 14 days at 4 °C cold storage. The rootstocks had no significant influence on the flowering and fruiting entity but affected some fruit quality traits. The ‘Myrabolan 29 /C’ appeared to induce the highest fruit weight, total antioxidant capacity and total phenols. The results showed an important role of the climatic conditions in determining the fruit antioxidant content. A drought ripening period improved the antioxidant potential of fruit independently of the rootstock. After cold storage, apricot fruits maintained good levels of antioxidants...|$|E
40|$|The total {{antioxidant}} capacity, total phenols, {{and selected}} pomological traits of <b>fresh</b> <b>apricots</b> belonging to 12 genotypes were investigated over a 3 -year period.

40|$|Techniques {{to improve}} fruit {{firmness}} and quality in apricot would enhance marketability. Apricot is {{considered as one}} of the most delicious temperate fruits, and good balance of sugars and acids and a strong apricot aroma are the major determinants of exceptional fruit quality. Studies were conducted in three different varieties of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) namely ‘Rival’, ‘Goldrich’ and ‘Orangered® Bhart’ to determine if pre-harvest foliar applications of different concentrations of boron and ReTain® influences fruit quality and fruit yield. Firmness and sugars were of specific concern as <b>fresh</b> <b>apricot</b> has a very short shelf life of five to six days and transfer of fruit from farm to market within limited time span is a major concern. Firm fruit with adequate sweetness will allow Tasmanian orchardist to export more fruit. The selection of the varieties for the main study was done by screening nine different varieties based on their maturity periods and availability of maximum samples. ‘Orangered® Bhart’ is an early harvested variety and ‘Rival’ and ‘Goldrich’ are middle harvested varieties. For this experiment, treatments consisted of four sprays of different concentration of boron in the form of Solubor (20...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe rapid texture loss of apricot fruit during {{storage and}} {{transformation}} is a limiting factor for its commercialisation and use. Apricot flesh exhibits different tissue zones which differ in texture. To better understand texture in apricot fruit, we have studied (i) the intra-fruit heterogeneity of texture measured by puncture test (tissue firmness) (ii) {{the effect of}} thinning on whole fruit firmness (global firmness), measured by compression, and on tissue firmness and (iii) the evolution of texture upon steam cooking, on apricots of contrasted texture. Nine tissue zones were defined in <b>fresh</b> <b>apricot</b> fruits in order to study differences in texture from the peduncle to the pistil zones and from the external to the internal tissue. In the nine apricot varieties used, tissue firmness decreased gradually from the external to the internal tissue. However, from the peduncle to the pistil zone, the variation of texture seemed to be variety-dependent. Overall the textures measured for the nine tissue zones were highly correlated, indicative of the major differentiation between soft and firm fruits. However distinct heterogeneity patterns could be observed on axes 2 and 3 of a principal component analysis carried out on the textures of the nine zones. The effect of thinning on fruit firmness appeared variety-dependent. Tissue firmness of the raw apricots assessed by penetrometry explained {{about two-thirds of the}} variability of firmness of cooked apricots, versus only 40 % for the compression test. High correlations between texture after cooking and prior to cooking were found for four (external equatorial, external pistil, median equatorial and median pistil) out of the nine tissue zones...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the effect of ohmic heating {{processing}} on the quality and shelf-life of apricots in syrup was investigated. Each 100 g of product contained 30 g of pre-heated syrup (15 °Brix) and 70 g of blanched apricot pieces with a cubic shape (size 1. 2 cm). The liquid-solid mixture (pH< 4) was pasteurized at 90 °C for about 113 s in a 30 kW aseptic continuous pilot ohmic system using a 25 kHz alternating electric current. The aseptically packaged samples were stored at 25 °C and periodically examined over one year period. The parameters measured during the preservation period were: pH, °Brix, color, ascorbic acid content, and microbial spoilage. During the shelf-life, no swelling of the packages was detected. Moreover, the product kept its microbiological stability during the whole storage period of 52 weeks. The ascorbic acid content was slightly reduced by the elctrothermal treatment. However, it was well preserved for the entire storage time. Similarly, the quality characteristics of the <b>fresh</b> <b>apricots</b> in syrup were not adversely affected by ohmic processing and a high retention of the quality attributes was observed during the storage time...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>apricots</b> (Prunus armeniaca L.) are in high demand, but are {{available}} for only a short period during the Spring {{and the beginning of}} the Summer. There is no information on the correct harvest maturity stage that should be chosen to ensure a long post-harvest life and high sensory quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of maturity stage at harvest on the sensory quality of ‘Palsteyn’ apricots after 14, 28, or 42 d in cold storage. Sourness, flavour, and acceptability showed major changes during cold storage. Ripe fruit (orange-yellow skin colour) showed the highest acceptability, as assessed by a “mini-consumer test” (i. e., an untrained panel; n = 36). Fruit harvested at an intermediate stage of maturity (light yellow skin colour) reached an average acceptability, while unripe fruit (greenish skin colour) were not acceptable. After 28 d of cold storage, fruits were still acceptable; but, after 42 d, fruits reached the “dislike” zone. On a principal component analysis, acceptability was shown to be positively associated with sweetness, flavour, juiciness, and aroma, and negatively associated with sourness. After 28 d and 42 d of cold storage, unripe fruit appeared to have low acceptability and quality attributes. ‘Palsteyn’ apricot harvested with an orangeyellow skin colour, as the least ripe fruits, showed that they could reach high sensory quality standards and were able to withstand long periods of cold storage...|$|E

Apricots were harvested at two commercial maturity stages respectively characterised by an average penetrometer reading of 8 and 10. 8 Kg/cm 2 and a soluble solids content of 13. 6 and 11. 9 Brix°. Fruits were stored at 20 °C and 70 % RH. Soluble solids, polygalacturonase and carotenoid content increased during the apricot storage. A SDS-PAGE assay involving a specific staining of polygalacturonic acid {{was used to determine}} polygalacturonase activity. Fruit firmness decreased during the storage and a linear relationship was found with the polygalacturonase activity. An in vitro assay was used to determine the carotenoid bioavailability. This parameter increased with the carotenoid concentration and was correlated to fruit softening and polygalacturonase activity. Apricots were processed for puree production, yields increased with the maturity stage as well as the puree carotenoid content and bioavailability.
