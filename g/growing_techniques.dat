It was launched in 1962 to overcome the drawbacks faced by the economy at large, with vanilla production being the economy's cornerstone at the time. In an effort to spark innovation and new <b>growing</b> <b>techniques,</b> emphasis was shifted to [...] "shade house cultivation", with less-intensive labour required (due to the controlled indoor climate), and reduction in chemicals necessary for outdoor farming. Controlled growth resulted in an export record or 12 tons in 2010. In the present day, the production is largely locally utilized in view of Tahitian vanilla becoming a [...] "status symbol of cultural identity and pride in Polynesia." [...] Promotional actions instituted by the government to act upon this pride and boost vanilla production are many; even a dessert served by an airline in the on-board meal is infused with Tahitian vanilla.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the performance of a region <b>growing</b> <b>technique</b> for segmenting prostate, bladder and rectum in CT images of prostate cancer patients. Prostate, bladder and rectum were segmented in all CT images of 10 patients using the region <b>growing</b> <b>technique</b> and manual tracing. Volumes of the above organs computed with the region <b>growing</b> <b>technique</b> were compared with those from manually traced images on a slice-by-slice basis. Measurement reproducibility of both segmentation techniques was evaluated using the data obtained from four independent observers. The region <b>growing</b> <b>technique</b> was 1. 5 times faster than manual tracing. There was no statistical difference between the slice volumes of prostate, bladder and rectum obtained by the two segmentation techniques (p. 0. 05, paired Student’s t-test). Correlation between slice volumes of all organs of interest provided both by region growing and by manual tracing was very good (prostate r 2 50. 84; bladder r 2 50. 93; rectum r 2 50. 85). An overall reasonable agreement was found between the two segmentation techniques. The intraobserver and interobserver variations for prostate, bladder and rectum volume segmentation were found to be lower with the region <b>growing</b> <b>technique</b> than with manual tracing. The suggested semi-automatic technique allows the possibility of generating accurate an...|$|R

For third-party certification, Nestlé has partnered with UTZ Certified to ensure that best practices are being used. Many of Nestlé’s efforts {{are focused on the}} Ivory Coast, where 40 percent of the world's cocoa comes from. The company has developed a higher-yielding, more drought- and disease-resistant cocoa tree; and they have given 3 million of these super trees to farmers thus far and plan to give away 12 million of them in total. They are also training farmers in efficient and sustainable <b>growing</b> <b>techniques,</b> which focuses on better farming practices, including pruning trees, pest control (with an emphasis on integrated pest management) and harvesting, as well as caring for the environment. In addition, they have built 23 new schools so far and plan to build 40 in total by 2015. Another part of the plan has been to address child labor. Nestlé says that according to U.S. statistics, there are about 800,000 children who work the cocoa supply chain. With this in mind, Nestlé approached the Fair Labor Association to map out strategies to help curb child labor in the cocoa sector, and these efforts – including community education and the building of schools – have become a focus of the Cocoa Plan.|$|E

The first one is a window merging method based on Lorentz information measure (LIM) but the second one is a window growing method using the notion of entropy. We propose two new window merging criterion where the window merging is carried out based on linear combination of local and global statistics. In window growing method, we define a notion of feature entropy and the window is selected employing jointly entropy and feature entropy. The two window merging schemes perform better than the schemes using only LIM. The proposed window <b>growing</b> <b>technique</b> is compared with schemes using only LIM and the proposed two merging techniques.
