Moreover {{in order to get}} a higher pressure than its Chapman-Jouguet pressure (C-J pressure), a combined explosives system, consisting of two explosives, was used. When a high explosive with a lower detonation velocity is inserted into the high explosive tube with a <b>higher</b> detonation <b>velocity,</b> the detonation characteristics of the lower <b>velocity</b> <b>explosives</b> is improved by the influence of the <b>higher</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>explosives</b> and a pressure is higher than the C-J pressure was obtained.

40|$|Abstract. Mixtures of fme powders {{of copper}} and {{molybdenum}} {{were subjected to}} ball milling before shock-wave consolidation. The degree of previous plastic working by milling was varied by varying the milling time. The shock-wave pressure was varied by using different explosives. The microstructure, conduction and porosity of the resulting compacts were investigated. The shock-consolidated powders have extensively deformed particle interiors. The characteristics of the deformed structures of each composite were studied using X-ray diffraction line broadening. It {{was found that the}} previous milling produces micro-deformation in the particles which is proportional to the milling time. Additionally, compaction using low detonation <b>velocity</b> <b>explosives</b> increases the micro-strains. With intense prior milling with subsequently <b>higher</b> detonation <b>velocity</b> <b>explosives</b> results in lower micro-strains. Also, crystal defects form sub-boundaries, so a dispersed sub-grain structure results.

40|$|Tungsten heavy alloys {{have been}} {{traditionally}} manufactured by thermal sintering were the compaction {{is achieved by}} heating under pressure the pre-compacted powders, to elevated temperatures, up to 3000 °C. Additives such as dopants are usually incorporated in the original powder mixtures {{in order to control}} the grain sizes, and mechanical properties of the sintered microstructures. This process is capable of producing high-density tungsten heavy alloys but has its own limitations. Shock induced synthesis (SIS) and shock compaction (SC) or dynamic compaction (DC), are processes used for the manufacture of advanced materials. In shock synthesis <b>high</b> detonation <b>velocity</b> <b>explosives</b> are used for the synthesis, whereas in shock compaction low detonation <b>velocity</b> <b>explosives,</b> elevated temperatures and prior coating of the powders are used to generate the shock waves required for optimal densification. Due to the <b>high</b> shock wave <b>velocity,</b> the temperatures within the capsule raise above the melting points of some or all the elements present in the powder mixtures. The liquid mixtures are then quenched in microseconds, which results in novel phases. Shock compaction offers the possibility of producing high temperatures necessary for strong metallurgical bonding within the particle surface regions where they are most required, while the internal powder mass, within the particles remain at relatively lower temperatures. A novel approach for producing dense and fine grain tungsten heavy alloys has been investigated. This approach combines reaction synthesis and dynamic consolidation. By combining these two processes tungsten heavy alloys with 98 % of the theoretical density have been produced. In this work four tungsten-iron-nickel heavy alloys and one tungsten-copper-nickel heavy alloy were manufactured by shock synthesis and densification. The elemental powders were mixed and pre-compacted at 20 °C by packing them in cylindrical steel capsules of 25 mm diameter. Ammonite with a detonation velocity of 3. 6 km/s was used as the main explosive. The samples were preheated to temperatures between 300 and 1000 °C before the application of the shock wave. The specimens were then characterized by optical microscopy, SEM analysis, EDS quantitative analysis, quantitative image analysis, X-ray diffraction, hardness and microhardness testing. This paper will discuss the effects of the shock parameters on the microstructure and strength of these five tungsten heavy alloys and compares the results obtained with those of alloys of similar compositions manufactured by thermal sintering. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|The AMRL flyer {{sensitivity}} test apparatus (FSTA) uses the electric gun technique to accelerate 50 pm thick plastic flyer plates of about 3. 5 mm in diameter to <b>high</b> <b>velocity.</b> Impacting <b>high</b> <b>explosives</b> with the flyer plates generates short duration shock pulses with sufficient energy to cause ignition. By varying the charge voltage, {{and hence the}} flyer velocity, the relative shock sensitivity of explosives can be measured.

The FSTA {{was found to be}} suitable for testing 50 mg samples of pressed explosives with shock sensitivities in the range represented by PETN (high) to Composition B (low). A flyer velocity versus charge voltage calibration up to a charge voltage of 6 kV was performed using a VISAR velocity interferometer.

40|$|AbstractComputational {{continuum}} codes {{can provide}} many {{details on the}} response of metals to <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> impact and <b>explosive</b> loading events. However, most “production” level calculations use a homogeneous description of the metal. This is an incorrect representation since metals possess a microstructure whose details create variations in material strength and other properties such as strain to failure. Ultimately these variations influence the formation of fragments at the macroscopic level. The spatial scale of the microstructure is {{on the order of}} micrometers and is not readily accessible to current computational tools and resources for system level calculations. Rather than explicitly model the microstructure one can attempt to capture the effects of material non-homogeneity {{through the use of a}} statistical description. Specifically, a statistically compensated failure strain criterion can be used to simulate the non-homogeneity of a material. This technique has been used previously by the authors on a tungsten alloy with some success. In those experiments, tungsten alloy rings were subjected to explosive loading. This resulted in a stress state approaching uniaxial stress. Furthermore, the tungsten alloy had relatively low ductility. The combination of these two factors resulted in fragments that were formed by tensile failure. It is important to determine if this technique can be used on a more ductile material under a different stress state. Fragmentation data was available for explosively loaded cylinders of Eglin Steel- 1 (ES- 1). The combination of the cylinder geometry and a more ductile metal resulted in fragments formed by shear failure. The experiment was simulated using CTH for the explosive and Pronto 3 D for the ES- 1. Comparisons of the cylinder calculation results are made to the experimental fragmentation data and the results analyzed show a viable path forward on the use of statistical descriptions of these continuum models...|$|R

40|$|Recently the {{commissioning}} APOGEE {{observations of}} the Galactic bulge reported that a significant fraction of stars (similar to 10 %) are in a cold (sigma nu approximate to 30 km s(- 1)) <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> peak (Galactocentric radial velocity approximate to 200 km s- 1). These stars are speculated to reflect the stellar orbits in the Galactic bar. In this study, we use two N-body models of a Milky Way-like disk galaxy with different bar strengths to critically examine this possibility. The general trends of the Galactocentric radial velocity distribution in observations and simulations are similar, but neither our models nor the BRAVA data reveal a statistically significant cold <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> peak. A Monte Carlo test further {{suggests that it is}} possible for a spurious <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> peak to appear if there are {{only a limited number of}} stars observed. Thus, the reported cold <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> peak, even if it is real, is unlikely due to stars on the bar-supporting orbits. Our models do predict an excess of stars with <b>high</b> radial <b>velocity,</b> but not in a distinct peak. In the distance-velocity diagram, the <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> particles in different fields exist at a similar distance similar to 8. 5 +/- 1 kpc away from the Sun. This result may be explained by geometric intersections between the line-of-sight and the particle orbits; <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> stars naturally exist approximately at the tangent point, without constituting a distinct peak. We further demonstrate that even without the presence of a bar structure, particle motions in an axisymmetric disk can also exhibit an excess of <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> stars...|$|R
