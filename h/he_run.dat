5|$|For the {{expression}} of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that <b>he</b> <b>run</b> every day; imperative Run!).|$|E
5|$|Madison's {{political}} experience before becoming governor {{consisted of a}} twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for governor in 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped out early due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, {{he became the first}} Kentucky governor to die in office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office.|$|E
5|$|At 42, Glenn was {{the oldest}} member of the {{astronaut}} corps and would likely be close to 50 {{by the time the}} lunar landings took place. During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Ohio the following day.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí {{was always}} in favour of Catalan culture but was {{reluctant}} to become politically active to campaign for its autonomy. Politicians, such as Francesc Cambó and Enric Prat de la Riba, suggested that <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for deputy but he refused. In 1920 he was beaten by police in a riot during the Floral Games celebrations. On 11 September 1924, National Day of Catalonia, he was beaten at a demonstration against the banning of the Catalan language by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Gaudí was arrested by the Civil Guard, resulting in a short stay in prison, from which he was freed after paying 50 pesetas bail.|$|E
5|$|The PJ held primary {{elections}} for the 1989 presidential elections between Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, and Antonio Cafiero, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Menem won these elections, with Duhalde as candidate for the vice presidency under his ticket, and then won the general elections. Duhalde {{did not like the}} legislative work, and preferred to work with the actual administration of a district. Menem suggested that <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for governor of the populous Buenos Aires Province, which Duhalde accepted on the condition of a great budget aid to the province. This proposal was supported in Congress by Alfonsín, which led to a steady alliance between both politicians. Duhalde was elected governor, ending the political influence of Cafiero.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, <b>he</b> <b>run</b> errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E

25|$|After Johnson's {{acquittal}} and Stanton's resignation, Johnson's administration {{seized upon}} the narrative {{that those who}} wanted his impeachment were black-hearted, especially Stanton. However, Stanton left office with strong public and Republican support. In other matters, however, Stanton was in peril. His health was in a dire state, the product of his relentless efforts {{during and after the}} war, and his finances were greatly lacking. After his resignation, Stanton possessed only the remnants of his salary, and a $500 loan. Stanton rejected calls from his fellow Republicans that <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for the Senate, choosing instead to resume his law practice.|$|E
25|$|A {{month later}} on 24 January 2016, Faugheen made his debut at the Leopardstown Racecourse {{and it was}} {{for the first time in}} his three racing seasons when <b>he</b> <b>run</b> in the same {{calendar}} year prior to the Cheltenham Festival in which he was favourite for the Cheltenham Champion Hurdle with the main two dangers in the betting, Arctic Fire and Nichols Canyon also taking him on in this race. Arctic Fire was the 2015 Champion Hurdle runner-up and was considered by the official handicappers the main danger while Nichols Canyon was the only horse to have finished ahead of Faugheen in all of his 13 starts to date and was coming into the race on back of a victory in the Grade 1 December Festival Hurdle. The outsiders of the race were Plinth at 100/1 — Grade 2 Istabraq Hurdle winner at the start of the season trained by Aidan O'Brien and King Of The Picts at 150/1 — a previous season Grade 3 winner over hurdles who reversed back to the smaller obstacles after little success in his previous starts over fences.|$|E
25|$|Lord Clifden {{started the}} 1864 {{season in the}} Claret Stakes in April, where he only faced two rivals. As Parr led him onto the course a large crowd {{surrounded}} him. They got so close {{that they had to}} be ordered to get back of course officials. After the start, Rapid Rhone had a clear lead. Lord Clifden never got on terms and faded in the straight to finish second, ten lengths behind Rapid Rhone. On 9 June at Royal Ascot <b>he</b> <b>run</b> in the Gold Cup {{in front of one of}} the largest crowds ever seen at Ascot. However he spent the whole of the race at the rear of the field and could not challenge the leaders. In the end he finished unplaced, over 20 lengths behind winner Scottish Chief. Little Stag was second and Lord Zetland third. In late July Lord Clifden was allotted top weight of 8st 12lb for the Chesterfield Cup run over one and a quarter miles at Goodwood. With half of a mile left to run, Lord Clifden was struck into by his half-sister Lady Clifden. This caused him to blunder and fall on his head, throwing John Osbourne to the ground, although the jockey did not sustain any serious injuries. The race was won by King of Utopia. Later the same day Lord Clifden walked over for a sweepstakes of £100 each. He was then retired to stud. For part of his four-year-old season, Lord Clifden was trained by William Bevill.|$|E

500|$|In Harrison's {{report of}} the battle to Secretary of War John Armstrong, Jr., he said of Shelby, [...] "I am {{at a loss to}} how to mention [...] of Governor Shelby, being {{convinced}} that no eulogism of mine can reach his merit." [...] In 1817, Shelby received the thanks of Congress and was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his service in the war. Friends of Shelby suggested <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for Vice President, but Shelby quickly and emphatically declined.|$|E
500|$|Arthur {{left office}} in 1885 and {{returned}} to his New York City home. Two months before the end of his term, several New York Stalwarts approached him to request that <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for United States Senate, but he declined, preferring to return to his old law practice at Arthur, Knevals & Ransom. [...] His health limited his activity with the firm, and Arthur served only of counsel. He took on few assignments with the firm and was often too ill to leave his house. [...] He managed a few public appearances, until the end of 1885.|$|E
500|$|Slaughter's {{supporters}} mocked Shelby's {{advanced age}} (he was almost 62), calling him [...] "Old Daddy Shelby". One Kentucky paper even printed an anonymous charge that Shelby had {{run from the}} Battle of King's Mountain. Though few even among Shelby's enemies believed the story, his supporters and Shelby himself responded through missives in the state's newspapers. One supporter typified these responses, writing [...] "It is reported that Colonel Shelby 'run [...] at King's Mountain.' True he did. He first run [...] up to the enemy... then after an action of about forty-seven minutes, <b>he</b> <b>run</b> [...] again with 900 prisoners." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{reason for}} Hobart's success {{in both the}} private and public sectors was his genial personality. [...] He worked well with others, and was noted for tact and charm. [...] Senator Mark Hatfield, in his book on American vice presidents, {{suggests}} that these qualities would have made Hobart successful in Washington had <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for Congress. [...] Hatfield states that the reason why Hobart chose not to move from state to national politics before 1896 was a reluctance to leave a comfortable life and successful law practice in Paterson. [...] Instead, Hobart continued to involve himself in party politics; he was widely regarded as Northern New Jersey's most influential Republican. [...] Beginning in 1876, he was a delegate to every Republican National Convention in his lifetime. [...] He {{was a member of the}} New Jersey Republican Committee from 1880 to 1891, resigning the position as he became more deeply involved in Republican National Committee affairs—he was New Jersey's representative on the committee after 1884, rising to become vice chairman.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{stated that}} he would support John Kerry again should <b>he</b> <b>run</b> for president in 2008, but in January 2007, Kerry {{said he would not}} seek a second attempt for the White House. Kennedy then remained neutral as the 2008 Democratic nomination battle between Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama intensified, as his friend Chris Dodd was also running. After the initial caucuses and primaries had been split between the two and Dodd had withdrawn, Kennedy became dissatisfied with the tone of the Clinton campaign and what he saw as racially tinged remarks by Bill Clinton. Kennedy gave an endorsement to Obama on January 28, 2008, despite appeals by both Clintons not to do so. In a move that was seen as a symbolic passing of the torch, Kennedy said that it was [...] "time again {{for a new generation of}} leadership," [...] and compared Obama's ability to inspire with that of his fallen brothers. In return, Kennedy gained a commitment from Obama to make universal health care a top priority of his administration if elected. Kennedy's endorsement was considered among the most influential that any Democrat could get, and raised the possibility of improving Obama's vote-getting among unions, Hispanics, and traditional base Democrats. It dominated the political news, and gave national exposure to a candidate who was still not well known in much of the country, as the Super Tuesday primaries across the nation approached.|$|E
