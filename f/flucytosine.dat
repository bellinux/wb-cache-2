25|$|It is {{not known}} if <b>flucytosine</b> is {{distributed}} in human breast milk. Given the potential risk to the child, the patient should not breastfeed during treatment with <b>flucytosine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In animal models (rats), <b>flucytosine</b> {{has been}} found to be teratogenic. Sufficient human data does not exist. Pregnant women should be given <b>flucytosine</b> only if the {{potential}} benefits exceed the potential harm to the fetus.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} if <b>flucytosine</b> is a human carcinogen. The issue has been raised because traces of 5-fluorouracil, which is a known carcinogen, {{are found in the}} colon {{resulting}} from the metabolization of <b>flucytosine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucytosine</b> may {{increase}} the toxicity of amphotericin B and vice versa, although the combination may be life-saving and should be used whenever indicated (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). The cytostatic cytarabine inhibits the antimycotic activity of <b>flucytosine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucytosine,</b> {{also known}} as 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), is an {{antifungal}} medication. It is specifically used, together with amphotericin B, for serious Candida infections and cryptococcosis. It may be used by itself or with other antifungals for chromomycosis. <b>Flucytosine</b> is used by mouth and by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Although a generic, off patent {{medication}} in the U.S., as of January 2016, {{there was}} only one FDA-approved pharmaceutical supplier, Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Due to this monopoly, the cost per 250mg tablet was $70.46 per tablet for a daily treatment cost of ~$2110/day for a 75kg adult (165 pounds) adult and $29,591 for a two-week treatment course as of December 2015. As the most common indication for <b>flucytosine</b> is cryptococcal meningitis, this cost makes <b>flucytosine</b> unavailable for the majority of persons in the U.S. requiring the medicine. This cost of <b>flucytosine</b> is more than 100-fold higher in the U.S. than in the United Kingdom and Europe via Meda AB Pharmaceuticals. <b>Flucytosine</b> tablets are available in India for USD 2.00 per tablet via Jolly Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. and are available in 100 tablet packs.|$|E
25|$|All {{patients}} receiving <b>flucytosine</b> should be under strict medical supervision.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucytosine</b> also {{undergoes}} conversion into 5-fluorodeoxyuridinemonophosphate which inhibits fungal DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucytosine</b> by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. <b>Flucytosine</b> must not be used as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with <b>flucytosine</b> alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{renal disease}} should receive <b>flucytosine</b> {{cautiously}} and in reduced doses. Guidelines for proper dosing exist. Serum level determinations are mandatory for these patients.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, such as Switzerland, <b>flucytosine</b> {{has been}} {{licensed}} to treat cats, dogs and birds (in most cases together with amphotericin B) {{for the same}} indications as in humans.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{fungal infections}} may occur {{in those who}} are immunocompromised. These people benefit from {{combination}} therapy including <b>flucytosine,</b> but the incidence of side-effects of a combination therapy, particular with amphotericin B, may be higher.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{is quite}} {{commonly}} seen {{as well in}} treatment-naive patients and under current treatment with <b>flucytosine.</b> In different strains of Candida resistance has been noted to occur in 1 to 50% of all specimens obtained from patients.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include bone marrow suppression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, and psychosis. {{anaphylaxis}} and other allergic reactions occasionally occur. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is {{safe for the}} baby. <b>Flucytosine</b> is in the fluorinated pyrimidine analogue family of medications. It works by being converted into fluorouracil inside the fungus which then blocks its ability to make protein.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and their}} severities are unknown, because <b>flucytosine</b> is used under close medical supervision, but {{expected}} to be an excess of the usually encountered side effects on the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney function. Vigorous hydration and hemodialysis may be helpful in removing the drug from the body. Hemodialysis is particular useful in patients with impaired renal function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucytosine</b> is well absorbed (75 to 90%) {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Intake with meals slows the absorption, {{but does not}} decrease the amount absorbed. Following an oral dose of 2grams peak serum levels are reached after approximately 6 hours. The time to peak level decreases with continued therapy. After 4 days peak levels are measured after 2 hours. The drug is eliminated renally. In normal patients <b>flucytosine</b> has reportedly a half-life of 2.5 to 6 hours. In patients with impaired renal function higher serum levels are seen and the drug tends to accumulate. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine (90% of an oral dose) and only traces are metabolized and excreted in the feces. Therapeutic serum levels range from 25 to 100µg/ml. Serum levels in excess of 100µg {{are associated with a}} higher incidence of side effects. Periodic measurements of serum levels are recommended for all patients and are a must in patients with renal damage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucytosine</b> {{was first}} made in 1957. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. As of 2016, in the United States the medication cost about 2,000 USD per day while in the United Kingdom it is about 22 USD per day. It is not available in much of the developing world.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, several {{compounds}} (antifungals, fungicides, and biocides) where {{shown to}} effectively inhibit {{the growth of}} P.destructans including benzalkonium chloride, chloroacetoxyquinoline, chloroxine, ciclopirox olamine, econazole, phenylmercuric acetate, pyrithione zinc and sulconazole. The same study showed that P.destructans was sensitive to Amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole, while the fungus had some resistance to anidulafungin, caspofungin, <b>flucytosine</b> and micafungin. A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Flucytosine</b> is intrafungally {{converted}} into the cytostatic fluorouracil which undergoes further steps of activation and finally interacts as 5-fluorouridinetriphosphate with RNA biosynthesis thus disturbing {{the building of}} certain essential proteins.|$|E
5000|$|Cryptococcal {{meningitis}} {{should be}} treated for two weeks with intravenous amphotericin B 0.7 - 1.0 mg/kg/day and oral <b>flucytosine</b> 100 mg/kg/day (or intravenous <b>flucytosine</b> 75 mg/kg/day if the patient is unable to swallow). This should then be followed by oral fluconazole 400-800 mg daily for ten weeks and then 200 mg daily {{for at least one}} year and until the patient's CD4 count is above 200 cells/mcl. [...] <b>Flucytosine</b> is a generic, off-patent medicine. However, a market failure exists, with a two-week cost of <b>flucytosine</b> therapy being about $10,000.
