Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts <b>fluorination,</b> in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts.

5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. <b>Fluorination</b> also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to <b>fluorination.</b> Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium and {{technetium}} form a {{range of}} oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO3Cl, so BhO3Cl should be formed in this reaction. <b>Fluorination</b> results in MO3F and MO2F3 for the heavier elements {{in addition to the}} rhenium compounds ReOF5 and ReF7. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties. Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large dipole moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the enthalpies of adsorption of these three compounds. The values are for TcO3Cl and ReO3Cl are −51kJ/mol and −61kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO3Cl is −77.8kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5kJ/mol.|$|E

Also diols can give cyclic sulfite esters, (RO)2SO. Carboxylic acids convert to trifluoromethyl derivatives. For example treatment of heptanoic acid with SF4 at 100-130 °C produces 1,1,1-trifluoroheptane. Hexafluoro-2-butyne can be similarly produced from acetylenedicarboxylic acid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A two-step Ir-catalyzed borylation/Pd-catalyzed dehalo-genation {{sequence}} {{allows for}} the net synthesis of fluoroarenes where the boronic ester is ortho to fluorine.

ReF 5 and ReF 6. When HF is used as the solvent, a similar process is indicated, but partial hydrolysis of HF solutions of HF solutions of Re(CO) 5 F.

The oxidation of [(n 5 -C 5 H 5) Fe (CO) 2] 2 with AgF in acetone produced 5 evidence for a new fluoride, (n 5 -C 5 H 5) Fe(CO) 2 F. It was surmised that the maintenance of stable (Re(CO) 5 F) or (Re(CO) 6) + units governs the course of these <b>fluorinations,</b> and that, in general, carbonyl fluorides will only exist with certain, specific, stable units. Analogous units were proposed for other carbonyl fluoride systems, and a general progression for metal carbonyl <b>fluorinations</b> was established, through simple carbonyl fluoride to carbonyl fluoride-pentafluoride complex(es), and finally binary fluoride.

Inhibitors of STS {{are believed to}} have potential for treating estrogen-dependent breast cancer. A new class of potential irreversible suicide inhibitors of STS, based on aryl sulfates bearing a monofluoromethyl or difluoromethyl group ortho to the sulfate group, was synthesized. Key to the success of these syntheses was the use of new sulfation methodology recently developed in the Taylor group. A new and efficient route to 4 -formyl estrone, a time-dependent, irreversible STS inhibitor, is also reported. Several new classes of potential, reversible STS inhibitors were synthesized. These compounds are analogs of known STS substrates in which the sulfate group is replaced with an ,-difluoromethylenesulfonamide group, a boronic acid group or a sulfinic acid group. We also report the synthesis of estrone sulfate analogs that bear a carboxylate moiety at the 17 -position and a sulfate surrogate at the 3 -position. It is anticipated that these compounds will inhibit STS by interacting with Arg 98 which lies at the periphery of the active site. Key to the success of this synthesis was the use of the t-butyl group as a protecting group for the 2 -position of estrone.

Although the introduction of fluorine at the C 8 position prevented the mutarotation of the ketones in solution, the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine also reduced the nucleophilicity of the quinuclidine nitrogen.;A small library of new derivatised cinchona alkaloids containing a quaternary carbon at the C 9 position were synthesised in three steps. After oxidising quinine to quinidinone, the diastereoselective addition of a Grignard reagent to the ketone was developed and the hydroxyl function was protected in the third step. The stereochemistry at the C 8 and C 9 positions of 9 -methylquinidine and the novel 9 -phenylquinidine were determined by NOESY spectroscopy and the 8 -(R) and 9 -(S) configurations were assigned.

40|$|An {{extensive}} reveiw of the {{platinum group metal}} fluorides {{has been}} carried out and in the light of this, new preparative routes have been developed and characterisation has been significantly improved. The preparation of the platinum group metal fluorides in both static and dynamic systems is discussed in chapter two. The <b>fluorinations</b> of ruthenium, rhodium and platinum sponges in dynamic systems proved to be of greatest interest. In these studies large amounts of ruthenium hexafluoride and platinum hexafluoride were produced and traces of rhodium hexafluoride were noted, where as previously more forcing conditions had been employed in the preparation of these compounds. It is believed that rigorous drying of the flow line and hydrogenation of the metal in situ are responsible for the success of this new preparative route. When ruthenium is fluorinated in the dynamic system ruthenium hexafluoride and tetrameric ruthenium pentafluoride are produced in large quantities, and smaller amounts of a red glassy material is also formed. There have been no previous reports of any red material forming during this reaction. It is now believed that this material is a trimeric form of ruthenium pentafluoride. The charaterisation of these fluorides was carried out using a large variety of techniques, the most useful being mass spectrometry and matrix isolated infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry proved invaluble in the characterisation of the trimeric ruthenium pentafluoride, while matrix isolation enabled good quality infrared spectra of the reactive hexafluorides to be recorded. These techniques were also utilised to give the first insight into the behaviour of the tetrameric pentafluorides in the gas phase. Iridium pentafluoride {{has been shown to be}} monomeric at elevated temperatures, under similar conditions ruthenium and osmium pentafluorides decompose to the metal and fluorine.
