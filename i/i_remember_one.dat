25|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> was an {{economics}} minister. He waited there anxiously for {{a signal to}} join the discussion; but it never came. It was Rajaratnam of Singapore who opposed the inclusion of Sri Lanka. He argued the country's domestic situation was unstable {{and there would be}} trouble. Not good for a new organisation.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> set {{of twins}} in particular: Guido and Ina, aged about four. One day, Mengele took them away. When they returned, {{they were in}} a terrible state: they had been sewn together, back to back, like Siamese twins. Their wounds were {{infected}} and oozing pus. They screamed day and night. Then their parents—I remember the mother's name was Stella—managed to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground. And every man had a round red spot {{on top of his}} head, about as big as a dollar where the redskins had taken his scalp. It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>one</b> myself had made, [...] What time I {{watched the}} swallow winging south [...] From mine own land, part made long since, and part [...] Now while I sang, and maidenlike as far [...] As I could ape their treble, did I sing.|$|R
6000|$|I was in despair. Then, suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> how <b>one</b> fright {{could destroy}} another fright, and I frowned {{up at him}} and shouted sternly: ...|$|R
5000|$|Ranny Grim of The Seattle Times {{wrote of}} this book: [...] "Through 30 years of {{reviewing}} pet books, <b>I</b> can't <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> {{that has left}} such a lasting impression..." ...|$|R
500|$|That sitcom {{tradition}} is very strange when you're performing to both {{a camera and}} an audience at the same time...The thing that sometimes held us up is my stammer. Some words and some phrases did catch me out..."B"s in particular. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> episode in which Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie were going [...] "woof" [...] a lot, and my line was [...] "it's like Battersea Dogs Home in here". The B of Battersea was a problem for me. The floor manager suggested that I say [...] "Crufts" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|... {{to be in}} {{this picture}} that I {{probably}} never saw the negative side as much. I just didn't. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> piece of advice ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In Iraq in 2004, {{the surveys}} took {{about twice as}} long and it usually took a two-person team about three hours to {{interview}} a 30-house cluster. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> rural cluster that took about six hours and we got back after dark. Nonetheless, Dr. Hicks' concerns are not valid as many days one team interviewed two clusters in 2004." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> in <b>one</b> of his lectures, after {{describing}} the sordid {{aspect of a}} great English city, he draws for us {{a picture of what}} were the artistic surroundings long ago.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{examined}} the cat-picture {{and laid it}} with the MS. for introduction; {{but it was not}} until yesterday that <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>one</b> of the cats was named Buffalo Bill.|$|R

2500|$|The {{perpetrators}} {{identified themselves}} as [...] "al-Qaida" [...] and [...] "Taliban". Some were teenagers, while others were in their twenties and the leader was older. [...] "They were shouting God is Great, long live Islam and long live Osama bin Laden", Sher Khan remembered. [...] "They kept shouting as they left. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> shouting: [...] "this is revenge for Sheikh bin Laden"." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the operation, Watson {{could barely}} walk, and the tumour had {{affected}} his pituitary gland which controls hormone levels: [...] "My mood swings went from ecstatic to suicidal. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> night {{standing on the}} balcony, full of dark thoughts and self-pity, thinking 'God, this is f**king terrible, why me?' I went back to bed, couldn't sleep, got up again. I thought I'd had enough. If it hadn't been for the girls ..." [...] His energy levels were very low {{and he did not}} leave his house for two months: [...] "I couldn't deal with more than {{one person at a time}} or with multitasking and I cried easily." [...] Watson was readmitted to hospital in Manchester for tests on 6 October 2006 after complaining of dizziness, headaches and blurred vision.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> {{beautiful}} and instructive little lyric that {{emanated from the}} physiology class. The most striking line of it was this: ...|$|E
60|$|P. 53. Burnet. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> in <b>one</b> fast-day {{there were}} six sermons preached without intermission. I was there myself, and not a little weary of so tedious a service.--Swift. Burnet was not then eight years old.|$|R
60|$|The view I take, I believe, is the Common law principle, as to {{retiring}} {{officers and}} their successors, to which <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> but <b>one</b> exception, {{which is the}} case of Sheriff and ministerial officers of that class.|$|R
60|$|Also {{there were}} lots of other noises that <b>I</b> cannot <b>remember,</b> except <b>one</b> which a dog made.|$|R
60|$|Oh, no, they {{interest}} me enormously. <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>one</b> of the Kings of Uganda gave a dance in my honour. Ten thousand warriors in war-paint. I assure {{you it was}} most impressive.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is near Wells on {{the east}} coast," [...] she said. [...] "Now I think of it, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> has to drive from Wells. Can I have a ticket to there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> autumn {{afternoon}} {{having a}} violent quarrel with Gene Hollister that bade fair {{to end in}} blows, when he suddenly demanded:--"I'll bet you anything you don't know why you're a Republican." ...|$|E
60|$|PROF. D. I know {{something}} of that family; clever people, but bred up--on principle, {{if it can be}} so called, with their minds a blank as to religion. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> seeing <b>one</b> of the daughters at the party where I met Miss Moldwarp.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> <b>one</b> day as <b>I</b> sat in {{the train}} hastening to Charing Cross on my way from France, that that was George's birthday. I had the feeling of him upon me, heavily, and I could not rid myself of the depression. I put it down to travel fatigue, and tried to dismiss it. As I watched the evening sun glitter along the new corn-stubble in the fields we passed, trying to {{describe}} the effect to myself, I found myself asking: [...] "But—what's the matter? I've not had bad news, have I, to make my chest feel so weighted?" ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the time}} of our working at the boat, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> only <b>one</b> other thing: that I asked Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it was; and he answered, it was the worst {{possible}} for him, for it was a land of the Campbells.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{fallen in}} myself before now. <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>one</b> evening I {{came back from}} shooting, and I fell in, gun and all. Now I get a boy to carry my gun for me." ...|$|E
60|$|That is, {{as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>one</b> of {{the most}} {{finished}} pieces of sunset he has given; {{and it has a}} woful moral; yet one which, with Scott, is inseparable from the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I was saying, Madam Budd, we seamen {{drop into}} our forefathers' ways. Now, when I was a youngster, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>one</b> day, that {{we fell in}} with a ketch--you know, Miss Rose, what a ketch is, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I can't make head or tail of it," [...] said Nugent, {{rising and}} pacing the room. [...] "I {{came here to}} meet my father. So far as <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> had <b>one</b> drink of whisky--your whisky--and then I woke up in your bedroom with a {{splitting}} headache and a tongue {{like a piece of}} leather. Can you account for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> heard <b>one</b> of them ask Joe to {{call him}} at half after seven--I {{think it was the}} one on the left--no, it was the one to the east of the other one--but I didn't hear the other one say any thing. I wonder if he wants to be called too. Do you reckon it's too late to ask?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite a lot, if <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> The <b>one</b> he {{objected to}} was thief... I {{repeated}} that, and snatched some telegrams from his pocket. He tried to draw his gun on me--and then I drove them both out of camp. They got through safely, {{for they were}} seen in Benton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You English are a hardy {{folk who}} take the spring air so early. Well, in such company I would do the same. Truly she is a {{beauteous}} maiden. I have some experience of the sex, but never do <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> so fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, {{her best}} style ain't her viciousness. What she pulls in our store {{is to come}} in smiling with Christian Fortitude and keep a clerk busy for one hour while she picks out half a dozen fourpenny nails. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> time----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poet!" [...] she smiled. [...] "No, it isn't quite poinsetta. It's {{nearer the}} red-orange {{of a tree}} <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> autumn, in the White Mountains, with the setting sun on it. But that wasn't {{what we were talking}} about. Laurels! Your laurels." ...|$|E
6000|$|TASSO. In this {{description}} of the cock, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> a spirited <b>one</b> of the same animal in the 'L'Agriculture ou Les Géorgiques Françoises', of M. Rossuet.--W. W. 1793.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] cried Mary Phillips, [...] "those {{were the}} {{messages}} <b>I</b> sent. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> particularly the <b>one</b> {{about the last}} one back and the heartiest welcome." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> only <b>one</b> thing... <b>I</b> said to Kuper that {{although}} {{this was the}} first time I had sat in the dock, I did not mind it at all. He said to me, with that gentle smile which was one of his great characteristics, [...] "I don't like it at all." ...|$|R
