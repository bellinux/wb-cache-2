Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the <b>fractionated</b> vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.|$|E

The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether T. cruzi can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.|$|E
5|$|To the east, {{across the}} Klickitat River, lies the Simcoe Mountains {{volcanic}} field. This area contains many small shield volcanoes and cinder cones of mainly alkalic intraplate basalt with <b>fractionated</b> intermediate alkalic products, subordinate subalkaline mafic lavas, and several rhyolites as secondary products. There are about 205 vents that were active between 4.2 million and 600 thousand years ago.|$|E
5|$|Boron has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also <b>fractionated</b> during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E

25|$|Radiogenic {{isotopes}} provide powerful tracers {{for studying}} the ages and origins of Earth systems. They are particularly useful to understand mixing processes between different components, because (heavy) radiogenic isotope ratios are not usually <b>fractionated</b> by chemical processes.|$|E
25|$|Epilation (hair loss) {{may occur}} on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1Gy. It only occurs within the {{radiation}} field/s. Hair loss may be permanent {{with a single}} dose of 10Gy, but if the dose is <b>fractionated</b> permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45Gy.|$|E
25|$|The Bravo Lake Formation {{in central}} Baffin Island {{is a rare}} alkaline-suite that formed {{as a result of}} {{submarine}} rifting during the Paleoproterozoic period. The lavas of the volcanic belt display geochemical characteristics similar to modern ocean-island-basalt groups. The range from moderately to intensely <b>fractionated</b> REE-profiles is similar to that from tholeiitic basalts to extremely alkaline lavas in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|Perfume oils {{are often}} diluted with a solvent, {{though this is}} not always the case, and its {{necessity}} is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is an alcohol solution typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a rectified spirit. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as <b>fractionated</b> coconut oil, or liquid waxes such as jojoba oil.|$|E
25|$|The total dose is <b>fractionated</b> (spread {{out over}} time) for several {{important}} reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells {{that were in}} a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more radioresistant) may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.|$|E
25|$|In the Colonial era {{the energy}} {{policy of the}} United States was for free use of {{standing}} timber for heating and industry. In the 19th century, new {{emphasis was placed on}} access to coal and its use for transport, heating and industry. Whales were rendered into lamp oil. Later, coal gas was <b>fractionated</b> for use as lighting and town gas. Natural gas was first used in America for lighting in 1816., it has grown in importance for use in homes, industry, and power plants, but natural gas production reached its U.S. peak in 1973, and the price has risen significantly since then.|$|E
25|$|Geochemically, the Kambalda Ratio Ni:Cr/Cu:Zn {{identifies}} {{areas of}} enriched Ni, Cu and depleted Cr and Zn. Cr {{is associated with}} <b>fractionated,</b> low-MgO rocks and Zn is a typical sediment contaminant. If the ratio is at around unity or greater than 1, the komatiite flow is considered fertile. Other geochemical trends sought include high MgO contents to identify the area with highest cumulate olivine contents; identifying low-Zn flows; tracking Al content to identify contaminated lavas and, chiefly, identifying anomalously enriched Ni (direct detection). In many areas, economic deposits are identified within a halo of lower grade mineralisation, with a 1% or 2% Ni in hole value contoured.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to these developments, {{a similar approach}} was designed for a linear particle accelerator or Linac. Installation of the first 4MeV clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the Hammersmith Hospital, London. The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work by at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory {{led to the development}} of a 6-MV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956. Linac units quickly became favored devices for conventional <b>fractionated</b> radiotherapy but it lasted until the 1980s before dedicated Linac radiosurgery became a reality. In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon radiosurgery for the treatment of AVMs and epilepsy. In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system. Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved stereotactic positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components. Using a modified Linac, the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital in February 1986.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemical}} properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical, {{which makes the}} two difficult to separate. The methods first used — fractional crystallization of ammonium fluoride salts or the <b>fractionated</b> distillation of the chloride — have not proven suitable for an industrial-scale production. After zirconium was chosen as material for nuclear reactor programs in the 1940s, a separation method had to be developed. Liquid-liquid extraction processes {{with a wide variety}} of solvents were developed and are still used for the production of hafnium. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by-product of zirconium refinement. The end product of the separation is hafnium(IV) chloride. The purified hafnium(IV) chloride is converted to the metal by reduction [...] with magnesium or sodium, as in the Kroll process.|$|E

[...] Under the agreed settlement, a maximum of $99.9 million had been allocated for the lawyers fees but they had demanded $223 million. Acting on behalf of Kimberly Craven, a Sisseton-Wahpeton Ovate tribe member, Frank argued that the case was about pure greed, stating that it included [...] "an outrageous fee request that has resulted in bipartisan criticism" [...] and that the Class Counsel were [...] "more interested in maximizing their personal recovery than the interests of the class." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{claim of}} a {{discovery}} {{was published by}} Luigi Rolla and Lorenzo Fernandes of Florence, Italy. After separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the Brazilian mineral monazite by <b>fractionated</b> crystallization, they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium. This solution gave x-ray spectra attributed to samarium and element 61. In honor of their city, they named element 61 [...] "florentium." [...] The results were published in 1926, but the scientists claimed that the experiments were done in 1924. Also in 1926, {{a group of scientists}} from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Smith Hopkins and Len Yntema published the discovery of element 61. They named it [...] "illinium," [...] after the university. Both of these reported discoveries were shown to be erroneous because the spectrum line that [...] "corresponded" [...] to element 61 was identical to that of didymium; the lines thought to belong to element 61 turned out to belong to a few impurities (barium, chromium, and platinum).|$|E
500|$|Praseodymium {{may then}} be {{separated}} from the other lanthanides via ion-exchange chromatography, or by using a solvent such as tributyl phosphate where the solubility of Ln3+ increases as the atomic number increases. If ion-exchange chromatography is used, the mixture of lanthanides is loaded into one column of cation-exchange resin and Cu2+ or Zn2+ or Fe3+ is loaded into the other. An aqueous solution of a complexing agent, known as the eluant (usually triammonium edtate), is passed through the columns, and Ln3+ is displaced from the first column and redeposited in a compact band {{at the top of the}} column before being re-displaced by [...] The Gibbs free energy of formation for Ln(edta·H) complexes increases along the lanthanides by about one quarter from Ce3+ to Lu3+, so that the Ln3+ cations descend the development column in a band and are <b>fractionated</b> repeatedly, eluting from heaviest to lightest. They are then precipitated as their insoluble oxalates, burned to form the oxides, and then reduced to the metals.|$|E
2500|$|Radiation therapy {{may include}} photon-beam or proton-beam treatment, or <b>fractionated</b> {{external}} beam radiation. [...] Radiosurgery {{may be used}} in lieu of surgery in small tumors located away from critical structures. <b>Fractionated</b> external-beam radiation also can be used as primary treatment for tumors that are surgically unresectable or, for patients who are inoperable for medical reasons.|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st {{century the}} {{original}} concept of radiosurgery [...] {{expanded to include}} treatments comprising up to five fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, {{without the need for}} a surgical incision. [...] Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic radiosurgery and <b>fractionated</b> radiotherapy the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications. The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery is to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where <b>fractionated</b> radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the total accumulated radiation dose. Historically, the field of <b>fractionated</b> radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of radiobiology: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation. Today, both treatment techniques are complementary, as tumors that may be resistant to <b>fractionated</b> radiotherapy may respond well to radiosurgery, and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe radiosurgery may be suitable candidates for <b>fractionated</b> radiotherapy.|$|E

Jake M discovery may mean that alkaline magmas may be more common on Mars than on Earth and that Curiosity could encounter even more <b>fractionated</b> alkaline rocks (for example, phonolites and trachytes).|$|E

2500|$|Radiotherapy {{treatments}} are typically prescribed {{in terms of}} the local absorbed dose, which might be 60Gy or higher.

2500|$|The stable carbon isotope ratio, δ13C, is {{measured}} against Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The stable carbon isotopes are <b>fractionated</b> primarily by photosynthesis (Faure, 2004). [...] The 13C/12C ratio {{is also an}} indicator of paleoclimate: {{a change in the}} ratio in the remains of plants indicates a change in the amount of photosynthetic activity, and thus in how favorable the environment was for the plants. During photosynthesis, organisms using the [...] C3 pathway show different enrichments compared to those using the [...] C4 pathway, allowing scientists not only to distinguish organic matter from abiotic carbon, but also what type of photosynthetic pathway the organic matter was using. [...] Occasional spikes in the global 13C/12C ratio have also been useful as stratigraphic markers for chemostratigraphy, especially during the Paleozoic.|$|E
2500|$|Water is {{the primary}} source of {{hydrogen}} to all living organisms, so the isotopic composition of environmental water is a first-order control on that of the biosphere. The hydrological cycle moves water around different reservoirs {{on the surface of the}} earth, during which hydrogen isotopes in water are significantly <b>fractionated.</b> [...] As the primary moisture source to the atmosphere, the ocean has a relatively uniform hydrogen isotope composition across the globe around 0‰ (VSMOW). Variations of δD larger than 10‰ in the ocean are generally confined to surface waters due to evaporation, sea ice formation, and addition of meteoric waters by precipitation, rivers or icebergs. In the hydrological cycle, the two major processes that fractionate hydrogen isotopes from ocean water are evaporation and condensation. It should be pointed out that oxygen isotopic composition (18O/16O) of water is also an important tracer in the hydrological cycle, and cannot be separated from hydrogen isotopes when we talk about isotope fractionation processes associated with water.|$|E
2500|$|He {{then turned}} to {{sequencing}} DNA, which would require an entirely different approach. He looked at different ways of using DNA polymerase I from E. coli to copy single stranded DNA. In 1975, together with Alan Coulson, he published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the [...] "Plus and Minus" [...] technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be <b>fractionated</b> by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement on what had gone before, but was still very laborious. Nevertheless, his group were able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174. This was the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. To their surprise they discovered that the coding regions {{of some of the}} genes overlapped with one another.|$|E
2500|$|Essentially, Vandervert {{has argued}} that {{when a person is}} confronted with a {{challenging}} new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (<b>fractionated)</b> by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. Most recently, he {{has argued that}} this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans. Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology. Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive [...] "mental prototyping" [...] or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.|$|E
2500|$|To {{get to this}} point, Sanger refined a {{partition}} chromatography method first developed by Richard Laurence Millington Synge and Archer John Porter Martin to determine the composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (now, also known as Sanger's reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from poisonous gas research by Bernhard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger's reagent proved effective at labelling the [...] N-terminal amino group {{at one end of}} the polypeptide chain. He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as trypsin. The mixture of peptides was <b>fractionated</b> in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by electrophoresis in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by chromatography in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with ninhydrin, moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called [...] "fingerprints". [...] The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete acid hydrolysis and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.|$|E
2500|$|Sucrose {{gradient}} centrifugation [...] {{a linear}} concentration gradient of sugar (typically sucrose, glycerol, or a silica based density gradient media, like Percoll) is generated in a tube {{such that the}} highest concentration is {{on the bottom and}} lowest on top. Percoll is a trademark owned by GE Healthcare companies. A protein sample is then layered on top of the gradient and spun at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. This causes heavy macromolecules to migrate towards the bottom of the tube faster than lighter material. [...] During centrifugation in the absence of sucrose, as particles move farther and farther from the center of rotation, they experience more and more centrifugal force (the further they move, the faster they move). [...] The problem with this is that the useful separation range of within the vessel is restricted to a small observable window. [...] Spinning a sample twice as long doesn't mean the particle of interest will go twice as far, in fact, it will go significantly further. [...] However, when the proteins are moving through a sucrose gradient, they encounter liquid of increasing density and viscosity. [...] A properly designed sucrose gradient will counteract the increasing centrifugal force so the particles move in close proportion to the time {{they have been in the}} centrifugal field. [...] Samples separated by these gradients are referred to as [...] "rate zonal" [...] centrifugations. [...] After separating the protein/particles, the gradient is then <b>fractionated</b> and collected.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues {{played a key role}} in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects.

The refinement of the Plus and Minus method resulted in the chain-termination, or Sanger method (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the Maxam-Gilbert method (also known as the chemical method) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).|$|E
