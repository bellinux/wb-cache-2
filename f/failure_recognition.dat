This {{is done by}} planning the takeoff around three critical V speeds, V1, VR and V2. V1 is the critical engine <b>failure</b> <b>recognition</b> speed, {{the speed at which}} a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed {{in the event of a}} rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed. The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times.|$|E

In this context, faulty, maladjusted and otherwise influenced sensors must be recognized (error detection), and adequate measures for failure correction (error recovery) must be taken. As a general basis for monitoring the state of environmental sensors, a so called "error detection model" was created, which consists of sub-models for data from laser range finders and ultrasonic sensors. With {{the aid of the}} created models, different kinds of redundancy can be utilized and consistency and plausibility checks can be carried out.

40|$|A lack {{of access}} to {{specialist}} palliative care (SPC) has led to a lack of clinicians' skills, knowledge and attitudes pertinent to the management of patients with chronic conditions such as end-stage heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and renal <b>failure.</b> <b>Recognition</b> of the 'end-stage' remains a key challenge. This article discusses how a palliative care approach can be incorporated into standard active treatment, outlines the management of important symptoms and discusses the importance of advance care planning. The particular problems experienced by patients with chronic neurodegenerative disease are discussed, and swallowing and respiratory difficulties are explored in the context of potential loss of mental capacity and ability to communicate. The importance of excellent communication skills is highlighted in particular regard to advance planning for end-of-life issues. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” We {{present an}} {{evolutionary}} approach using multiobjective genetic programming to derive optimal feature extraction pre-processing stages for robot failure detection. This data-driven machine learning method is compared both with conventional (non-evolutionary) classifiers {{and a set}} of domain-dependent feature extraction methods. We conclude MOGP is an effective and practical design method for <b>failure</b> <b>recognition</b> systems with enhanced recognition accuracy over conventional classifiers, independent of domain knowledge. Note to Practitioners â€” Detecting failures in robotic systems is critical to their autonomous operation since it allows mitigating/compensating control strategies to be brought into play. In this paper we employ multiobjective genetic programming to derive (near-) optimal feature extraction stages for failure detection which we demonstrate to yield significantly better detection performance than a range of comparator methods on benchmark datasets. Our approach requires no domain knowledge...|$|E

40|$|In this article, a new fault {{detection}} technique is proposed for squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) based on detection of rotor bar failure. This type of {{fault detection}} is commonly carried out, while motor {{continues to work}} at a steady-state regime. Recently, several methods have been presented for rotor bar failure detection based on evaluation of the start-up transient current. The proposed method here is capable of fault detection immediately after bar breakage, where a three-phase SCIM is modelled in finite element method (FEM) using Maxwell 2 D software. Broken rotor bars are then modelled by the corresponding outer rotor impedance obtained by GA, thereby presenting an analogue model extracted from FEM to be simulated in a flexible environment such as MATLAB/SIMULINK.

The activator arc definition and the H-EPN subnet definitions are integrated with the SPNP package 1 for simulation and analysis purposes.

40|$|Soundness of {{inference}} {{systems for}} inductive proofs is sometimes shown ad hoc and a posteriori, lacking modularization and interface notions. As a consequence, these soundness proofs {{tend to be}} clumsy, difficult to understand and maintain, and error prone with difficult to localize errors. Furthermore, common properties of the inference rules are often hidden, and the comparison with similar systems is difficult. To overcome these problems we propose to develop soundness proofs systematically by presenting an abstract frame inference system a priori and then to design each concrete inference rule locally as a sub-rule of some frame inference rule and to show its soundness by a small local proof establishing this sub-rule relationship. We present a frame inference system and two approaches to show its soundness, discuss an alternative, and briefly classify the literature.
