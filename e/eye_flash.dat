40|$|Introduction. It {{has been}} shown that thyroid hormone levels {{regulate}} cone photoreceptors development and modulate opsin production in mature cones. A limited number of cases have been reported where the flash electroretinogram (fERG), a global retinal response, have shown enhanced responses in patients with adult-onset thyroid dysfunction. It is unknown how retinal photoreceptor functions are affected topographically, and how this might impact multifocal ERG (mfERG) responses. Case Presentation. We report on a patient with hyperthyroidism caused by recently diagnosed Graves disease who presented with enhanced ERG cone responses. A 27 -year-old white female was diagnosed with Graves disease two months prior and started on Methimazole and Propranolol. Her past ocular history was significant for strabismic amblyopia treated at age of six years with patching. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 25 in the right and 20 / 20 in the left <b>eye.</b> <b>Flash</b> ERG showed enhanced amplitude in the photopic responses. Further mfERG testing showed amplitude enhancement with normal implicit time from foveal to perifoveal areas topographically in both eyes. Deviation From the Expected. This case first demonstrates enhanced cone responses in both fERG and mfERG testing in a patient with hyperthyroidism. Discussion. It provides evidence that thyroid hormone levels continue to affect adult retinal cone function. Conclusion. It shows the potential application of mfERG testing in mapping retinal function and diagnosis of ocular involvement in patients with early hyperthyroid dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{document}} the clinical, functional, and in vivo microanatomic {{characteristics of a}} patient with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome with a novel nonsense mutation in PTCH (patched). METHODS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography, electrophysiologic testing, visual field, magnetic resonance imaging, and mutation screening of PTCH gene. RESULTS. Visual acuity was 20 / 20 in the right eye and 20 / 25 in the left. Fundus examination revealed myelinated nerve fibers in the left eye and bilateral epiretinal membranes with lamellar macular hole also documented with macular OCT. A reduction of the retinal nerve fiber layers in both eyes was found with fiber nervous OCT. Fluorescein angiography showed bilaterally foveal hyperfluorescence and the visual field revealed inferior hemianopia in the right eye. Pattern visual evoked potentials registered a reduction of amplitude in both eyes and latency was delayed in the left eye. Pattern electroretinogram showed a reduction in P 50 and N 95 peak time and a delay in P 50 peak time in the left <b>eye.</b> <b>Flash</b> electroretinogram was reduced in rod response, maximal response, and oscillatory potentials in both eyes. Cone response was normal and 30 -Hz flicker was slightly reduced in both eyes. Mutation screening identified a novel nonsense mutation in PTCH. CONCLUSIONS. A novel nonsense mutation in the PTCH gene was found. We report the occurrence of epiretinal membranes and the persistence of myelinated nerve fibers. Electrophysiologic and visual field alterations, supporting a neuroretinal dysfunction, were also documented...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} regional cerebral {{blood flow}} (rCBF) in 19 healthy elderly subjects, mean age 64 Â± 11 (SD, years), during a passive visual stimulus in which pattern-flash frequency was parametrically manipulated. Using goggles with a grid of red lights imbedded into each lens, we performed five positron emission tomography (PET) {H 215 O} water scans on each subject at alternating (left to right <b>eye)</b> <b>flash</b> frequencies of 0, 1, 4, 7, and 14 Hz. We found a biphasic rising and falling rCBF response in the striate cortex (7 Hz peak) and left anterior cingulate (4 Hz peak), 1 Hz activation in left middle temporal gyrus (V 5), monotonically increasing rCBF in posterior areas (lateral and inferior visual association areas, Brodmann 18 and 19), and monotonically decreasing rCBF in anterior areas (frontal, cingulate, and superior temporal) predominantly in right hemisphere. We suggest the striate rCBF changes at all frequencies primarily reflect lateral geniculate input, the middle temporal activation at 1 Hz reflects perception of apparent motion, and the posterior extrastriate rCBF monotonic increase represents a neural response to increasing luminance intensity and form and color complexity that occur as pattern-flash frequency increases. The anterior monotonic rCBF decrease may represent active cross-modal functional suppression of brain areas irrelevant for processing the passive visual stimulus. Pattern-flash rCBF responses were highly reproducible (no series effect), more so in posterior than in anterior brain regions. The reproducibility and systematically changing rCBF responses to this passive stimulus suggest {{that it could be}} successfully used as a disease probe to evaluate neural function and drug effects in cognitively impaired patients...|$|E
