5|$|High-speed USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between high-speed USB2.0 {{buses and}} <b>full</b> <b>and</b> low speed buses. When a high-speed USB2.0 hub is plugged into a high-speed USB host or hub, it operates in high-speed mode. The USB hub then uses either one transaction translator per hub {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all <b>full</b> <b>and</b> low speed devices on the hub, or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the team}} left WWC, Miller {{decided he wanted}} to move closer to home to be with family and {{returned}} to Australia and New Zealand to wrestle. Williams remained in the United States, reforming the team with [...] "Lord" [...] Jonathan Boyd. The duo of Williams and Boyd quickly gained {{a reputation as one of}} the most violent, hard hitting teams in the business. In late 1981 in South Eastern Championship Wrestling, the team of Robert <b>Fuller</b> <b>and</b> Jos LeDuc had split up after LeDuc turned on Fuller during a match. LeDuc brought in the Sheepherders to be a part of his Commonwealth Connection stable to fight against <b>Fuller</b> <b>and</b> his family. In December 1981, the Sheepherders won the NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship, which had been vacated when <b>Fuller</b> <b>and</b> LeDuc split, and defended the title against <b>Fuller</b> <b>and</b> various partners. On 11 September 1982, the Sheepherders lost to <b>Fuller</b> <b>and</b> Jimmy Golden and were [...] "run out" [...] of the territory.|$|R
5|$|By 1924, {{there was}} {{distinct}} pressure on {{space in the}} halls of residence, and it was clear that more rooms were needed. The existing halls were <b>full</b> <b>and</b> so South Stoneham and South Hill were extended by covering their outbuildings.|$|E

5|$|The D± signals used by low, <b>full,</b> <b>and</b> {{high speed}} are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain twice as many wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E

Despite the inclement weather, 15,000-seat Kidd Field was approximately half <b>full,</b> <b>and</b> bowl officials estimated the crowd at around 10,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The true {{and only}} {{practicable}} object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, {{not of the}} minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a <b>full</b> <b>and</b> methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.|$|E

5|$|What may be {{revealed}} by Hori's {{attack on the}} way in which some Ramesside scribes felt obliged to demonstrate their greater or lesser acquaintance with ancient literature is the conception that these venerable works were meant to be known in <b>full</b> <b>and</b> not to be misused as quarries for popular sayings mined deliberately from the past.

5|$|A 2006 {{poll found}} that {{association}} football {{was the most popular}} sport in the UK. In England 320football clubs are affiliated to The Football Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs to regional or district associations. The FA, founded in 1863, and the Football League, founded in 1888, were both the first of their kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78 <b>full</b> <b>and</b> associate clubs and nearly 6,000 registered clubs {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Scottish Football Association. Two Welsh clubs play in England's Football League, one in the Premier league, and others at non-league level, whilst the Welsh Football League contains 20 semi-professional clubs.

5|$|An NBA player {{playing in}} Europe could earn {{as little as}} $50,000–$75,000 per month, while the average NBA annual salary was $5.8 million with the minimum around $500,000.

In October after the cancellation of regular season games, it was not anticipated that many additional NBA players would be signed overseas; leagues had started playing, their rosters were <b>full,</b> <b>and</b> new players could disrupt the teams.|$|E

5|$|At the game, {{bisexual}} drama teacher Andrew LeGustambos {{attempts to}} grab the attention of both Larry and Miracle, but the whole school stands in shock as Stuart arrives with two <b>full</b> <b>and</b> augmented breasts; the pills he had taken were actually librarian Helen Klench's female hormone replacements. Nonetheless, the school loses the game. Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch. Helen arrives to inform them {{that they did not}} need to win the game after all; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures.

5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the <b>full</b> <b>and</b> final sequence was developed.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every <b>full</b> <b>and</b> new moon.
