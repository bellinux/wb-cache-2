The ban was lifted in April 2005, and reapplied to beef in June 2005 when a second case of BSE was discovered. This ban was conditionally lifted in January 2006, with imports limited to <b>deboned</b> <b>beef</b> from cattle under 30 months old.|$|E
40|$|The {{study showed}} that meat surimi with a 1. 3 % fat content could be {{prepared}} from mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>beef.</b> 	The process used in the laboratory to prepare the meat surimi was a relatively simple process requiring few unit operations, unit operations which are already used for the manufacture of fish surimi. 	It is therefore expected that the meat industry would have few problems in preparing meat surimi from mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>beef</b> {{given the fact that}} the technology has already been demonstrated for the commercial production of fish surimi. 	The key processing steps are firstly the preparation of a mechanically deboned slurry with cold water to assist in the centrifugal removal of the "free" fat present in mechanically deboned meat. The centrifugal separation also removes the sarcoplasmic proteins which could be used for the production of meat flavours, soup stock and possibly pharmaceuticals. 	The second crucial step in the process is a sieving operation of the myofibrillar/collagen slurry to remove the collagen and "bound" fat from the myofibrillar protein. 	The subsequent collagen free myofibrillar protein could be concentrated by either further centrifugation or by pressing. The study also showed that most alkali washes had no significant impact on the fat removal efficiencies of the process, with the possible exception of sodium carbonate, compared to the use of fresh, potable water. It was further demonstrated that it was unnecessary to increase the pH of the wash water beyond a pH of 7. 0 as no additional fat separation efficiencies were obtained at the higher pH's. The neutral pH requirements of the,process would reduce chemical costs, and possibly also limit equipment wear compared to htgh wash treatments of pH 9. 0 advocated by other researchers. The low pH requirements of the process could also be expected to minimise protein damage which can occur, if held for extended periods at the higher pH's of 9. 0 or higher. The present study has only demonstrated the feasibility of producing meat surimi from mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>beef.</b> Other uses for the sarcoplasmic and collagen fractions should be established and then a financial feasibility of the whole process should be carried out to establish whether the outlined process is commercially feasible...|$|E

Carcasses were ranked according to three conformation classes (good minus = score 10; good = score 11; good plus = score 12), and three weight classes (heavy = 229. 4 kg, intermediate = 205. 0 kg, and light = 184. 0 kg, ranging from 222. 9 to 250. 4, 201. 5 to 209. 0, and 170. 0 to 190. 3 kg, respectively). Carcass cold shrinkage was not affected by conformation, but it was significantly lower in heavy (1. 83 %) than in intermediate (2. 53 %) and in light carcasses (2. 30 %), which were not different among each other. Carcass flank percentage was not affected by conformation, but it was significantly higher in heavy (13. 93 %) and intermediate carcasses (13. 87 %) as compared to light carcasses (13. 07 %). <b>Deboned</b> <b>beef</b> cuts (78. 08 %) of carcasses of steers, bone (16. 57 %), and trimmings (5. 23 %) yields and losses due to deboning (0. 12 %) were not significantly affected by carcass weight.

40|$|Iron {{bioavailability}} of diets containing oxidized {{turkey and}} oxidized beef meat {{was investigated in}} two experiments. In both vi studies male, weanling rats were made anemic by consumption of a low iron diet and bleeding. The experimental diets were prepared so that meat was {{the only source of}} iron. Hemoglobin regeneration served as the basis for measuring iron utilization. In experiment 1, lyophilized, uncooked turkey meat was allowed to oxidize at 20 - 22 °C for 0, 48, 96, 144, 216, or 264 hours and then fed to the rats. The length of oxidation time of the turkey meat did not significantly affect the growth of the rats or the bioavailability of the meat iron. In experiment 2, lyophilized, uncooked beef was allowed to oxidize at 20 - 22 °C for 14 days. Anemic rats were fed diets composed of basal, basal + iron, basal + iron + formaldehyde, 100 % fresh beef, 75 % fresh 25 % oxidized beef, 50 % fresh- 50 % oxidized beef, 25 % fresh- 75 % oxidized, 100 % oxidized beef and 100 % fresh beef + formaldehyde. Rats fed severely oxidized beef diets had decreased body weight, enlarged livers and depressed hematinic responses. Formaldehyde did not significantly affect iron utilization in rats fed basal diets, but depressed liver iron storage in rats fed fresh beef. A third experiment to further compare the chemical properties of uncooked, lyophilized hand deboned and mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>beef</b> and turkey meat was performed. Analysis by the Thiobarbituric Acid Method, Formaldehyde Value, and Iodine Number indicated increased sophistication of testing methods for lyophilized meats needs to be developed. Although the Thiobarbituric Acid Method was successfully used in Experiment 1, unreliable results were obtained using this method in Experiment 3. It is assumed that this variability in results is due to using the Thiobarbituric Acid Method with a dry system. The problems encountered with the Formaldehyde Value included contamination of the water supply with aldehydes and unreliable reagent. The Iodine Number was unreliable used on meat samples. Possibly the fat could be extracted from the meat under cool nitrogen to prevent further oxidation of the fat. Then the iodine number could be determined on the extracted fat...|$|E
40|$|Access to {{international}} and regional markets for beef {{has been an}} on-going problem for southern African countries for many decades because the South African Territories (SAT) serotypes of {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) viruses are endemic to wildlife populations in the southern African region. This makes establishment of FMD-free zones, essential for accessing high-value beef markets difficult, expensive and impractical for many locations in southern Africa. For that reason commercialization of livestock production in the region has been inhibited. The creation of FMD-free zones which requires use of artificial or natural boundaries and in southern Africa it has been the construction of veterinary cordon fences (VCFs) to separate animal populations of different FMD status which has proven successful in some countries (such as Botswana, Namibia & South Africa) but not in others for a variety of reasons, i. e. the current model has only been possible for a small proportion of cattle producers in southern Africa. This means that apart from the damaging effects that some VCFs have had or have on the environment generally and wildlife conservation in particular, only roughly 15 % of the cattle population in the mainland countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are raised in FMD-free zones. For balanced rural development of the SADC Region, where cattle are culturally and economically vital to the indigenous inhabitants and wildlife conservation and associated economic activities are important contributors to regional gross domestic product, it is essential to improve access to regional and international markets for beef and other animal products produced in locations outside FMD-free zones. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has introduced a partially non-geographic FMD standard for trade in <b>deboned</b> <b>beef</b> (viz. Terrestrial Animal Health Code Article 8. 8. 22) that potentially overcomes this problem; however, Article 8. 8. 22 contains at least one killer requirement that makes its implementation impossible. The issues associated with this problem have been identified in this study and possible solutions proposed. An attempt was made to gauge acceptance by SADC Member States but the responses to the questionnaire used were inadequate to reach a reliable conclusion in this respect. It was concluded that taking technical, logistical and financial constraints into account, non-geographic approaches represent the best opportunity that SADC countries have of expanding access to regional and international markets. Moreover, it is suggested that non-geographic approaches could be integrated into the Standard Methods and Procedures in Animal Health (SMP-AH) Programme once adopted by SADC, thereby strengthening the capacity of the Region s competent authorities. SMP-AH Programme is at a proposal stage and has not been officially launched in SADC. The SMP AH Programme proposes to harmonize activities of animal health authorities of SADC Member States in respect of selected diseases that impact trade and/or human health.

40|$|ICTs can now {{be found}} in the most {{unlikely}} places. In Botswana´s southern Kweneng and Kgatleng districts, they are even to {{be found in the}} stomachs of more than 135, 000 cattle. The cattle are participants in an initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture called the Livestock Identification Trace-back System (LITS), which aims to ensure that cattle in Botswana can be individually identified and traced throughout their lives. The system has been introduced to enable Botswana to comply with new regulatory procedures required by the European Union, which accounts for 80 to 90 % of Botswana´s beef exports. The regulations, imposed following the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Europe, stipulate that all imports of <b>deboned</b> <b>beef</b> must be traceable from the packing plant back to the individual farms in the country of origin. Thus, exporting countries must set up and maintain a database on the production, distribution, processing and sale of meat products. LITS employs radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to capture data on individual cattle, which is transmitted directly, error-free, to a central database. The database enables Botswana´s meat export agency to obtain EU certification for its beef exports (see elsewhere in this issue), and is a key repository of information for livestock farmers, as well as for state veterinary services and health authorities. LITS is being implemented by AST Botswana and Inala Identification and Control (South Africa). The first phase, completed in 2001, involved the development of the database and the identification of all cattle in two pilot districts. In the second phase the system is being extended, and will eventually be the world´s largest livestock tracking, monitoring and management system using RFID technology, involving an estimated 3 million head of cattle. RFID technology At the core of the system is a bolus containing a transponder that is, with the aid of an applicator, inserted into each animal´s rumen. Each bolus carries a unique ID number and other data that can be read by fixed or portable readers and relayed to the database. Fixed readers, placed at over 300 strategic locations, scan the ID numbers and relay information on, for example, new registrations and disease treatments to 46 district offices. Extension officers are equipped with hand-held readers that allow them to collect data on cattle in their ´crushes´ or kraals. The convenience, speed and accuracy of the LITS system have brought many benefits for Botswana´s livestock farmers, veterinary officers and health authorities. It can be used to locate lost or stolen cattle, and to monitor and manage disease outbreaks. The stomach bolus is safe for the animals, there are few field losses, criminal tampering is not possible, and it is easy to read because it is always in the same place. Also, the bolus is retrieved at the slaughterhouse and can be recycled, keeping costs low. It is a vast improvement on passive livestock identification systems such as ear tags, which require animals to be checked manually until the correct one is found. Locating a dozen cattle that require treatment from a herd of 200 used to be very time consuming. Now, all the animals simply file between two RFID readers, and a control gate automatically guides the required cattle into an isolation pen. New ways of working LITS has encouraged everyone involved in livestock management to be more thorough and to be creative in finding new ways of working and monitoring performance. Veterinary officers, for example, can now: rapidly isolate animals for treatment; update health records at the point of treatment; track weight gain in selected animals; correlate feeding programmes with yield; select specific bulls for breeding programmes; and track animal family trees. Livestock are not only valuable assets, they are also the start of a food supply chain with serious consequences in terms of health and profitability if the risks are not properly managed. RFID technology can make a significant contribution to the auditing of livestock lifecycles for many purposes, ranging from improving yield and optimizing feeding regimes, to ensuring conformance with EU regulations. The LITS initiative has demonstrated the direct and immediate benefits that can be achieved through the application of established and emerging technologies. In Botswana the system is helping to ensure the long-term security of its beef export market and offers an additional marketing edge, enabling the country to compete worldwide for new export orders. The same principles are now being used to assist sheep and ostrich farmers in South Africa. mailto:tinus@inala. co. za Tinus Burger is a member of the LITS implementation team.
