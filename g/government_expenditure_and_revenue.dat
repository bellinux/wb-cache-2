40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{relationship}} among fiscal variables (net lending, <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> <b>revenue)</b> and economic growth in Sub-Saharan African countries. Design/methodology/approach – Using yearly data for the period between 1980 and 2011 in 15 Economic Communities Of West African States (ECOWAS) countries, the relationship among fiscal variables, economic growth and trade is investigated, through various econometric techniques. Findings – <b>Government</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> <b>revenue</b> show pro-cyclical effects in West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and ECOWAS countries, while fiscal balance has a pro-cyclical nature for WAEMU during the years 1999 - 2011. Moreover, a weak long-run relationship between <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> <b>revenue</b> emerge, but only in the case of West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) countries. Granger causality analysis showed mixed results for WAEMU countries, while for four out of six WAMZ countries (Gambia, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone) the “tax-and-spend” hypothesis holds, since government revenue would drive the expenditure. Finally, in the last three decades, cyclical component of economic growth has reduced its fluctuations, both for WAEMU and WAMZ member States.

40|$|State {{and local}} {{expenditure}} and tax revenue respond {{less to the}} business cycle than do federal spending and revenue, thereby reducing the countercyclicality of total <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> <b>revenue.</b> This paper considers forces responsible for the cyclical pattern of state expenditure and revenue. Annual fluctuations in state personal income are associated with small changes in state spending and significant changes in tax receipts; receipt of federal grants is associated with greater state spending. Tax collections, {{and to a lesser}} degree expenditure, of larger states are more closely associated with annual income fluctuations than are the tax collections and expenditure of smaller states. These state size differences may proxy for other state characteristics, such as {{the extent to which a}} state faces interstate competition for mobile businesses and individuals, and the quality of state government. The spending and tax revenue of states with less mobile populations closely track income fluctuations, as does spending in states where convictions of public officials for federal corruption crimes are more common. In small states, and in states with more mobile populations and better corruption records, <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>and</b> <b>revenue</b> appear to rise and fall less with income, and in that respect more closely resemble the federal government...|$|E
