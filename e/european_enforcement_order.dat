For my {{rigorous}} thesis I {{chose the}} topic, the <b>European</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>order</b> and the European payment order, which is mainly focused on two regulations : the Regulation (EC) No 805 / 2004 of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council of 21 April 2004 creating a <b>European</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>Order</b> for uncontested claims (thereafter only as a "REEO") and the Regulation (EC) No 1896 / 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 creating the European order for payment procedure (thereafter only as a "REPO).

40|$|The essay {{analyzes}} the EC Regulation no. 861 / 2007 on the European Small Claims Procedure. After having outlined genesis, {{purpose and scope}} of the Regulation, the essay focuses on the relationships between the uniform rules laid down by it and the national procedural rules to be applied within the procedure so as to determine what is the space left to national law both to integrate the Regulation and to achieve the correct carrying out of the procedure before the national courts. Hence, the analysis touches upon the enforcement of the judgment as the most innovative feature of the Regulation with respect to the other Regulations adopted in the civil and commercial matter. Some of these Regulations come up for filling the gaps of the Regulation no. 861 / 2007, especially as to the jurisdiction and to the service of the acts. In the same perspective of the co-ordination with other Regulations, the essay looks into the relationships between the European Small Claims Procedure and the <b>European</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>Order</b> as well as the Order for Payment Procedure.

40|$|The EU {{judicial}} cooperation in civil matters system was developed following {{the needs of}} member states to achieve a common goal, which {{is to create a}} space of mutual recognition of judgements and distribute the juridical effects of the order created under one jurisdiction thru out the entire European space. One of the main pillars of this system is the creation of European Enforcement Orders, judgements or other titles enforceable in a member state without prior recognition of declaration of enforceability. This system has been developed other the years, starting with the <b>European</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>Order</b> for uncontested claims, continuing with the European Order for Payment procedure and European Small Claims procedure, and reaching its peak in Regulation (EU) 1215 / 2012. By virtue of this Regulation, entered into force in January 2015, a judgment given in a Member State which is enforceable in that Member State shall be enforceable in the other Member States without any declaration of enforceability being required (art. 39).

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is {{regulation}} (EC) No. 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters. The provisions of Regulation is aiming the improvement and simplification of the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements within {{the territory of the}} EU. According to the title of regulation this tesis is diveded in several parts explaining the key elements of developing the other maxime of the EU-free movement of judgements. First part includes the general fundamentals for determination of jurisdiction in cases with transborder element which is essential for aplication of this regulation as a part of legislation on international private law. Thanks to the nearly identical wording of Brussels I Regulation and Convention dealing with the same matter from the year 1968, all legal opinions of European Court of Justice related to that Convention can be invoked nowdays. Second part and third part turn to recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements in order to ensure the situation when "the declaration that a judgement is enforceable should be issued virtually automatically after purely formal checks of the documents supplied, without there being any possibility for the court to raise of its own motion on any of the ground for non-enforcement provided by this Regulation". The last part contents future trend in this sphere which can be seen from application of other regulation (<b>European</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>order,</b> European order for payment procedure) giving rise to rapid and simple mechanism in specific cases. Especially it treats of cancellation special exequator proceeding which should be undertaken to achieve that foreign judgement would be enforceable...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and Stockholm programmes have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the <b>European</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>order</b> for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for refusal of recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State of enforcement. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|E
