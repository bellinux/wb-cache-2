40|$|Magnetorheological {{elastomers}} (MREs) {{are composed}} of magnetizable particles (iron particles) and a soft rubber-like matrix. Their mechanical properties, including modulus and damping capability, can be controlled by an external magnetic field. The damping properties of MREs, which {{play an important role}} in applications, depend mainly on particle content. This paper aims to investigate MRE’s damping capabilities by studying two categories of cis-polybutadiene rubber-based MREs: isotropic and structured MREs. Both isotropic and structured MRE samples with various <b>iron</b> <b>particle</b> contents (60, 70, 80 and 85 wt%) were fabricated and their damping properties were measured by using a modified dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and a universal testing machine.

The loss factors of structured MREs are lower than those of isotropic MREs when the <b>iron</b> <b>particle</b> contents are the same. Furthermore, dynamic testing was conducted to study the effect of strain amplitude, frequency and magnetic field on the loss factor of MREs.

In this study, characterization of nanoscale <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> and their corro-sion products was conducted using SEM-EDX, XRD, BET surface area analyzer and Laser Zee Meter.

Measurements of zeta potential revealed that the nanoscale <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> have a zero point of charge at pH 4. 4.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether <b>iron</b> oxide <b>particles</b> targeted to oxidation-specific epitopes image atherosclerotic lesions. BackgroundOxidized low-density lipoprotein plays a major role in atherosclerotic plaque progression and destabilization. Prior studies indicate that gadolinium micelles labeled with oxidation-specific antibodies allow for in vivo detection of vulnerable plaques with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, issues related to biotransformation/retention of gadolinium might limit clinical translation. Iron oxides are recognized as safe and effective contrast agents for MRI. Because the efficacy of passively targeted <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> remains variable, it was hypothesized that <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> targeted to oxidation-specific epitopes might increase the utility of this platform. MethodsLipid-coated ultra-small superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> (LUSPIOs) (< 20 nm) and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> (< 40 nm) were conjugated with antibodies targeted to either malondialdehyde-lysine or oxidized phospholipid epitopes. All formulations were characterized, and their in vivo efficacy evaluated in apolipoprotein E deficient mice 24 h after bolus administration of a 3. 9 -mg Fe/kg dose with MRI. In vivo imaging data were correlated with the presence of oxidation-specific epitopes with immunohistochemistry. ResultsMRI of atherosclerotic lesions, as manifested by signal loss, was observed after administration of targeted LUSPIOs. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of malondialdehyde-epitopes and <b>iron</b> <b>particles.</b> Limited signal attenuation was observed for untargeted LUSPIOs. Additionally, no significant arterial wall uptake was observed for targeted or untargeted lipid-coated superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> oxide <b>particles,</b> due to their limited ability to penetrate the vessel wall. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that LUSPIOs targeted to oxidation-specific epitopes image atherosclerotic lesions and suggests a clinically translatable platform for the detection of atherosclerotic plaque...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} the rheological and magnetorheological {{properties of}} different polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based magnetorheological elastomers (MRE) are presented and discussed. In order {{to investigate the}} mobility of the <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> {{with respect to the}} rheological characteristics, the <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> were silanized with vinyltrimethoxysilane to enable a reaction between the modified particle and the cross-linking agent of the silicone elastomer. In addition, the vinyl-functionalized particles were further modified by the coupling of the superficial vinyl groups with a long-chain hydride terminated PDMS, which enables a reaction pathway with the vinyl terminated PDMS. On the other hand, the <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> were treated with surfactants such as fatty acids, calcium and aluminum soaps, respectively, prior to vulcanization in order to increase the mobility of the <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> in the elastomeric matrix. It was found, that both, the modification with the long-chain hydride terminated PDMS as well as the treatment with surfactants lead to an increase of the storage modulus G', the loss modulus G '' and the loss factor tan delta in the magnetic field. It is concluded that both modifications, the coupling with long-chain hydride terminated PDMS as well as the treatment with surfactants, provide a greater mobility of the <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> and hence a greater friction represented by the increase of the loss factor tan d. Consequently it is assumed that untreated <b>iron</b> <b>particles</b> are less mobile in the rubber matrix due to covalent bonding with the silicone components, most likely due to the reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the metal surface with the silane groups of the cross-linking agent...|$|R

Exposure to 6 ppm SO 2 decreased the mucociliary transport rate along the base of the nasal septum. The minimum force required to move an <b>iron</b> <b>particle</b> along this area of mucous membrane by use of a magnetic field in vivo increased significantly after SO 2 exposure, while the minimum force required to move an <b>iron</b> <b>particle</b> on a pool of mucus collected from the same chicken and tested in vitro showed no change after SO 2 exposure. The elastic recoil distance of mucus was measured both in vivo and in vitro.
