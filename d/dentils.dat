5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with <b>dentils</b> and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E
5|$|The arch {{was built}} {{as part of}} the Temple Mount's massive western {{retaining}} wall, which forms its eastern support. The voussoirs spring from a row of impost blocks which were cut to produce a dentil pattern. There have been some theories which speculate that the <b>dentils</b> were employed as part of a system used to shore up timber forms used during construction. However, this was a common decorative element employed in the region at the time, and archaeologists have noted that in this region of limited forests it is much more likely that packed earth, rather than expensive timbers, was used to support the form on which the arch was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and <b>dentils</b> evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E
50|$|Above {{the third}} {{story is a}} full entablature with gouge work and medallions topped by a broad <b>dentilled</b> and modllioned cornice.

25|$|The {{houses are}} three-story brownstones, {{some of which}} have been painted. Their raised rusticated basements all have segmental-arched windows and stoops leading to the main entrance. The stoops lead to double-doored main entrances flanked by narrow parlor windows. At the flat rooflines are {{galvanized}} iron cornices with <b>dentils</b> and angular brackets.|$|E
25|$|This {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Greek Revival building style and utilizes flat stone lentils and sills on the windows. The {{building is}} topped by <b>dentils</b> near its roof line. Also known as Crothers & Crew Building. In the early 1990s the building was restored by Russell Francios for use as an architectural office. During this renovation the third floor was converted into a contemporary apartment and studio.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper body}} is an {{elaborate}} entablature with garlands, <b>dentils,</b> and a projecting, bracketed upper cornice. On top {{there is a}} balustered railing filling the space between three broken pediments, {{the one on the}} corner curved, with medallions on their centers. The medallions on the facades contain stained glass inserts, and the one on the corner a clock. First-floor openings are arched, those on the second are rectangular. The first-floor windows are covered by bulging cages of fine cast iron bars; those on the second floor are balustered. The entire ensemble is topped by a copper roof in a Mansard configuration.|$|E
50|$|A {{feature of}} the Southern Colonial is the {{extensive}} use of molding inside and out. <b>Dentil</b> molding is commonly used to delineate {{the end of a}} rafter. In classical architecture, a <b>dentil</b> is a repeating ornament typically used where the cornice projects. In Roman architecture, the <b>dentil</b> delineates the end of a rafter. The main door in the front center of the southern colonial is typically adorned overhead with symmetrical pediments placed above the header, which rests on capital-crowned pilasters, with a frieze situated in between, just below the header. Crown molding is extensively used in the interior. French windows are usually used.|$|R

50|$|The third {{story has}} a carving {{of the city}} of Albany's coat of arms in the center, topped by a broken arch {{pediment}} with <b>dentilled</b> cornice. It is flanked by two 12-light windows with sills and <b>dentilled</b> cornices supported by a scroll bracket on the side next to the coat of arms. Recessed panels are above and below both.|$|R
25|$|The banded {{sandstone}} plinth of {{the memorial}} has square planned piers projecting {{slightly from the}} corners which continue the decorative banding and are surmounted by pyramidal pinnacles. This section of the memorial features AIF badges, and a marble plaque, which in leaded lettering lists the 122 local soldiers who fell in the First World War. Resting on this section is the recessed sandstone shaft of the memorial, the entablature of which is supported at each corner on four polished granite columns with Corinthian capitals. The shaft has a carved wreath, carved lettering The Honoured Dead and Roman fasces on each corner. The entablature comprises a simply moulded architrave, a more elaborate cornice with <b>dentils</b> and a recessed frieze on which the dates 1914 - 1918 are carved in relief. Surmounting the entablature are three sandstone steps on which rest a carved sandstone Celtic cross.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower is}} of three stages. The lower stages might {{be part of}} an 11th-century {{previously}} unbuttressed tower, and contains at its west side an early 15th-century chamfered reveal window opening with pointed arch surrounded by a hood mould with label stops in human form. The inset Perpendicular window is of three lights of panel tracery below, and six above. The panels are headed with trefoils, the lower within ogee heads. A church clock is just below the belfry stage. Between the window and clock is a hooded slit window, a repeat slit window is on the north and south sides. The Belfry stage was added in the 13th century and is defined at its base by a string course with repeating <b>dentils.</b> Central to each side of the belfry stage is a chamfered window opening with a plain hood mould following a semi-circular head. Within the opening are louvered and pointed twin-lights, these separated by a central octagonal shaft with a trefoil opening above in the north and south windows. The roof line is defined by a further string course with repeated grotesque bosses, and pairs of gargoyle drains on each side. An embattled roof parapet with crocketed corner pinnacles sits above. The tower is partially clasped at the north and south by the church aisles, and on the north side by an ashlar three-stepped angled buttress against the lower stages.|$|E
25|$|Further churchyard grave markers are to {{the murdered}} parish constable Henry Trigg; to Thomas Beard (died 1800?); and to Mary Ann Griffin (died 1899 aged 34), wife of Lewis Phillips of Berden Hall. The Beard stone {{contains}} a serpentine moulding at {{each side of the}} top meeting a central circular moulded device, defining three engraved fields, and all with carved pictorial details, the central an angel holding an anchor. An overgrown slab running from the stone contains a similar circular engraved device. The Griffin stone is chamfered-arch topped with inset floral carving, semi-circular side columns topped with floriate capitals, and inlaid inscriptions. Near to the Griffin stone is a plinth tomb with moulded base, and overhanging top with <b>dentils</b> below and a pyramid top. It is to members of the Roberts family, one of whom was Roland Brandram Roberts of Kirimetiya Estate, Ceylon (died 1910 aged 46), who was cremated at Golders Green, with his ashes interred in Berden graveyard. Two marble and granite sarcophagus-style tombs {{are to the}} north of the church; one to George Seabrook (died 1885); the other Thomas Seabrook (died 1847) and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1871). George and Thomas Seabrook were of Berden Priory. A further headstone is to Brigadier Sir Francis Smith Reid and his wife. Reid was a senior British Army officer during and after the Second World War, and Secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons.|$|E

25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as the window sill for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with <b>dentils</b> and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E
500|$|Waller Hall {{was built}} in the Renaissance style of architecture. This red brick {{building}} was designed in the same proportions as a Greek cross. Bishop Janes was responsible for proposing this use of the cross shape for the building. Each of the two wings is [...] long and [...] wide with aedicule porches on the west, east, and north ends of the building. Originally, the building was [...] tall as measured {{from the base of the}} building to the top of the dome. The distance from the eaves of the structure to the base is [...] The basement of the building is [...] high and the first floor [...] high. The foundation is made of stone and the roof has composition shingles. Both the second and third floors are [...] tall. The hall has a cupola topping the structure. Other details include pilasters, <b>dentils,</b> and brick corbelling on the exterior and circular stairways on the interior.|$|E
2500|$|Near the icehouse {{is a small}} tabby {{building}}, {{thought to}} have been used as a gardener's shed and/or a smokehouse. [...] The building has a single door and no windows. [...] The roof is slightly bell-cast, clad with cypress shingles, and topped with a wood finial; a board decorated with large serrated <b>dentils</b> runs around the building below the eaves.|$|E
50|$|The 2-1/2 story wood {{frame house}} was built in 1868, {{and is one of}} the only {{bracketed}} Italianate houses to survive in East Cambridge. It has a front-facing gable whose cornice includes <b>dentil</b> moulding and brackets, and whose fully pedimented gable end has a round-arch window in the tympanum area. The main roof cornice also has <b>dentil</b> moulding and paired brackets, and the front windows have slightly projecting lintel caps.|$|R

2500|$|The {{architrave}} of the Ionic Order {{is sometimes}} undecorated, {{but more often}} rises in three outwardly-stepped bands like overlapping timber planks. The frieze, which runs in a continuous band, is separated from the other members by rows of small projecting blocks. They {{are referred to as}} <b>dentils,</b> meaning [...] "teeth", but their origin is clearly in narrow wooden slats which supported the roof of a timber structure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{upper level}} of the arch (the attic) was {{composed}} {{of a series of}} Corinthian columns and pilasters dividing the space into three rectangular openings. Each of the outer openings was crowned with an Ionic architrave capped with <b>dentils</b> and a projecting geison, in the manner of the lower level. [...] The central opening, however, was flanked by antae with engaged Corinthian half-columns that supported a projecting triangular pediment, which rested above the <b>dentils,</b> geison, and sima that joined to those of the two wings. [...] At the peak of the pediment, there was a small vegetal acroterion. [...] The central opening of the upper level was originally closed off by a thin screen of stone, c. 7cm thick. Only the slots for its mounting are now preserved. [...] The design of this central aediculum-like, niche of the upper level is similar to the architecture of the scaenae frons (façade of ancient stage buildings) and highly evocative of the representations of aedicula in wall painting of the 2nd Pompeian style.|$|E
2500|$|In Romanesque {{architecture}} a corbel is {{a structural}} piece of stone jutting from a wall {{to carry a}} [...] weight, a type of bracket. The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels deeply keyed inside a wall support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic times. A modillion is an ornate bracket, a corbel, underneath a cornice and supporting it, more elaborate than <b>dentils</b> (literally translated as small teeth), they were carved classically under a Corinthian or a Composite cornice, but may support any type of eaves cornice.|$|E

50|$|The Amos Stearns House is a {{historic}} house at 1081 Trapelo Road in Waltham, Massachusetts. Built c. 1845, this -story wood-frame former farmhouse {{is a reminder of}} Trapelo Road's agricultural past. It has well-kept Greek Revival styling, including corner pilasters and an entablature with <b>dentil</b> moulding. A single-story porch wraps across the front and along one side; it has a similar entablature with <b>dentil</b> work. The house stands on property that was in the Stearns family from 1782 to 1941.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. [...] It is a two-story cross-gable main section with a two-story rear-gabled wing, built of {{load-bearing}} brick masonry walls. Italianate aspects include its scrolled brackets, limestone sills supported by brackets, brick <b>dentil</b> molding below the cornice, wood <b>dentil</b> molding above. It was built on a limestone ashlar foundation. The front facade's main feature is a one-story porch with a flat roof, single and triple columns, and scrolled brackets.|$|R
2500|$|In 1908, the {{original}} tower was demolished {{and a new}} reinforced three-story late Gothic Revival concrete tower, 20 feet 6inches wide and 32 feet 8inches high was constructed in its place. [...] The concrete construction of the tower was chosen specifically to provide {{the maximum amount of}} stability and durability in the event of high winds. [...] The tower has a crenelated top and a cornice containing <b>dentils.</b> [...] The windows are double-hung sash with a shallow recessed arch over the windows on the first and second floors.|$|E
2500|$|A short {{distance}} from these two buildings, {{near the site of}} the original Bleak Hall house, is another tabby building, thought to have been used as a barn during the Colonial period and subsequently used as an equipment shed. [...] The building's high gable roof, oriented north-south, is clad in cypress shingles. [...] A wooden spire topped with a pendant rises from each gable end. [...] Barge boards decorated with <b>dentils</b> cover the gable eaves; boards decorated with serrations run below the east and west eaves. [...] There are doors on the north and south sides.|$|E
2500|$|The single arched {{passageway}} of {{the lower}} level is 6.5m wide and was supported by pilasters crowned with Corinthian capitals. [...] Similar, but taller, pilasters flank the outer corners {{of the lower}} level. [...] The space between the outer pilasters and the arched opening was filled in with squared stones with drafted edges to emphasize the design. [...] On {{either side of the}} central passageway was a Corinthian column on a rectangular, raised base projecting {{from the center of the}} wall. [...] The lower level was crowned with an Ionic architrave capped with <b>dentils</b> and a projecting geison.|$|E
