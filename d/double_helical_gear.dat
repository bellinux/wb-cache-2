50|$|A {{herringbone}} gear, {{a specific}} type of <b>double</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gear,</b> is a special type of gear that is a side to side (not face to face) combination of two helical gears of opposite hands. From the top, each helical groove of this gear looks like the letter V, and many together form a herringbone pattern (resembling the bones of a fish such as a herring). Unlike helical gears, herringbone gears do not produce an additional axial load.|$|E
50|$|Double {{helical gears}} and {{herringbone}} gears are similar, {{but the difference}} is that herringbone gears do not have a groove in the middle like double helical gears do. Double helical gears overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single helical gears by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A <b>double</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored helical gears joined together. This arrangement cancels out the net axial thrust, since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, double helical gears are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|E

40|$|LectureTwo {{multistage}} barrel type pumps {{were installed}} in {{a nuclear power plant}} in reactor charge application. The pumps are driven by a 600 HP (447 kW) four-pole induction motor through <b>double</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> increasers. The overall vibration amplitude of the pump casing and the shaft were determined to be acceptable. However, one of the pumps was found with shaft repetitive cracking failures (MTBF = 7. 3 years) initiated away from the key-way stress concentration area, under the later stage impellers, in a zone where fretting was occurring. Several attempts pursued by the plant and their supplier, over the years, did not find the root cause of this shaft cracking problem, in spite of the good troubleshooting procedures and careful installation practices pursued. Therefore, an exceptionally comprehensive root cause investigation was implemented, with specialty vibration testing at its core. Thorough vibration testing combining spectral and timetransient vibration testing on the pump casing and shaft, Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) testing of the impeller and pump casing, and Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) testing revealed the dynamic behavior of the pump rotor and the entire pump system. The results identified unsuspected excessive axial shuttling of the pump shaft at the motor running speed frequency due to axial run-out of the helical gear set. Based on the test results and supported by non-linear FEA analysis, the authors identified the root cause of the crack initiation phase of the shaft failure. An additional transient FEA based fracture mechanics analysis approach was able to predict that the stresses in the shaft, underneath the impeller, were able to encourage initiation and propagation of the crack. This lecture demonstrates the effectiveness in machinery root cause investigations of thorough vibration testing including ODS, EMA, and FEA rather than traditional troubleshooting approaches, which had not detected a gear/pump inter-related problem, and would not have provided such clear visual evidence for decision makers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The two gears of the <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} {{is close to}} each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line of the <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth. Thus, the decrease in the driving gears’ number of module and can further increase the reduction gear ratio. For heavily-loaded planetary gear reducer, it’s quite obvious in the miniaturizing and high torque superiority. This paper also used certain winch’s speed reducer as example to explain that the change of the pressure angle can reduce contact stress by 3 %~ 40 % and also enhances the torque ability by 3 %~ 40 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the Advanced Rotorcraft Transmission program were to achieve a 25 percent weight reduction, a 10 dB noise reduction, and a 5, 000 hour mean time between removals (MTBR). A three engine Army Cargo Aircraft (ACA) of 85, 000 pounds gross weight {{was used as the}} baseline. Preliminary designs were conducted of split path and split torque transmissions to evaluate weight, reliability, and noise. A split path gearbox was determined to be 23 percent lighter, greater than 10 dB quieter, and almost four times more reliable than the baseline two stage planetary design. Detail design studies were conducted of the chosen split path configuration, and drawings were produced of a 1 / 2 size gearbox consisting of a single engine path of the split path section. Fabrication and testing was then conducted on the 1 / 2 size gearbox.

40|$|A gear is a {{rotating}} machine part having cut tooth, which mesh with another toothed part {{in order to}} transmit torque. Gears are mainly type like spur <b>gears,</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gears,</b> <b>double</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gears,</b> bevel gears, crown gears, hypoid gears, worm gears, rack and pinion, epicyclic gears etc. The application of these gears fled from tiny wrist watches to huge machinery equipment gears from vital elements of mechanism in many machines such as automobile, aerospace industry, rolling mills, hoisting and transmitting machinery, marine engines, and the like. Parallel and co-planer shaft connected by gears are known as spur gear. Spur gear have straight tooth and are parallel to the axis of the wheel. Spur gears are {{most common type of}} gears. A pair of spur gear tooth in action is generally subjected to two types of cyclic stress: contact stress and bending stress including bending fatigue. Both stress may not attain their maximum values at the same point of contact fatigue.
