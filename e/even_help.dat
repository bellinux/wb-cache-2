5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may <b>even</b> <b>help</b> to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and <b>even</b> <b>help</b> Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing Prussia to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was already set against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and Prussia to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that Prussia cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution of 3 May changed Polish state so much that Prussia does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and with rare candor told Potocki that Prussia did not support the constitution, but could not say so initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now will not <b>even</b> <b>help</b> as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future.|$|E

25|$|There is {{mounting}} {{evidence to show}} that a transition to a sustainable economy, if done wisely, may not harm economic growth significantly, in fact it could <b>even</b> <b>help</b> it. Recent research by ex-Wuppertal Institute member Joachim Spangenberg, working with neo-classical economists, shows that the transition, if focused on improving resource productivity, leads to higher economic growth than business as usual, {{while at the same time}} reducing pressures on the environment and enhancing employment.|$|E
25|$|At Yale, he {{was best}} known for writing The Antitrust Paradox, a book in which he argued that {{consumers}} often benefited from corporate mergers, and that many then-current readings of the antitrust laws were economically irrational and hurt consumers. He posited that {{the primary focus of}} antitrust laws should be on consumer welfare rather than ensuring competition, as fostering competition of companies within an industry has a natural built-in tendency to allow, and <b>even</b> <b>help,</b> many poorly run companies with methodologies and practices that are both inefficient and expensive to continue in business simply for the sake of competition, to the detriment of both consumers and society. Bork's writings on antitrust law—with those of Richard Posner and other law and economics and Chicago School thinkers—were influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, marine life helps determine {{the very nature}} of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially food fish), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's respiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's climate. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms <b>even</b> <b>help</b> create new land.|$|E

25|$|Growth {{retardation}} may occur, as {{height gain}} may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration {{and severity of}} illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may <b>even</b> <b>help</b> to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.|$|E

500|$|Observing {{that the}} ARU was defenseless, AFL {{officials}} viewed {{the plight of}} the rival organization as an opportunity to bolster the railway brotherhoods, which the AFL was courting, and instructed all AFL affiliates to withhold help. In spite of what Haywood perceived as [...] "treachery" [...] and [...] "double-cross" [...] by the AFL leadership — the ARU members had put their own organization at risk for others, but the AFL refused to <b>even</b> <b>help</b> them try to end the strike in a draw — the power of workers crossing their trade lines and jurisdictional boundaries to join together in a fight against capital greatly impressed him.

500|$|Trescothick {{was unable}} to avoid a {{recurrence}} of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same [...] "stress related illness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released {{a statement to the}} media stating [...] "Marcus admitted {{a couple of days ago}} that he wasn't 100% so that's fair enough. I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may <b>even</b> <b>help</b> him with this particular form of illness. I think over the next two or three years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket." [...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic {{ground in the}} animation field with Toy Story, and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps Antz in numerous ways." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "A Bug's Life, like Toy Story, develops protagonists we can root for, and places them {{in the midst of a}} fast-moving, energetic adventure." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Will A Bug's Life suffer by coming out so soon after Antz? Not any more than one thriller hurts the chances for the next one. Antz may <b>even</b> <b>help</b> business for A Bug's Life by demonstrating how many dramatic and comedic possibilities can be found in an anthill." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "What A Bug's Life demonstrates is that when it comes to bugs, the most fun ones to hang out with hang exclusively with the gang at Pixar." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A Bug's Life is one of the great movies – a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation. Pixar Animation Studios has raised the genre to an astonishing new level".|$|E

2500|$|The {{more serious}} {{criticism}} of American DG {{work in the}} region is that it can lead to more harm than good. [...] "Dishonest" [...] democratization involving superficial political liberalization can serve as a facade for continued authoritarianism and repression of civil society, and <b>even</b> <b>help</b> reinforce and stabilize autocratic regimes. By praising disingenuous reforms, the United States runs the risk of further entrenching authoritarianism in the region.|$|E
2500|$|Barton {{achieved}} widespread {{recognition by}} delivering lectures {{around the country}} about her war experiences in 1865–1868. During this time she met Susan B. Anthony and began a long association with the woman's suffrage movement. She also became acquainted with Frederick Douglass and became an activist for civil rights. [...] After her country wide tour she was both mentally and physically exhausted and under doctor's orders to go somewhere that would take her far from her current work. She closed the Missing Soldiers Office in 1868 and traveled to Europe. In 1869, during her trip to Geneva, Switzerland, Barton {{was introduced to the}} Red Cross and Dr. Appia; who later would invite her to be the representative for the American branch of the Red Cross and <b>even</b> <b>help</b> her find financial beneficiaries {{for the start of the}} American Red Cross.
