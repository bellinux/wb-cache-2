40|$|Authors: Zhang Yaru & Tian Li Tutor: Petra Andersson Title: Risk {{management}} in using VMI system [...] - Researching between Chinese and Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies Background & problem discussion: Due to potential of {{supply chain management}} is enormous to improve productivity, customer service and cost reduction, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) {{is one of the}} supply chain management strategies, by improving the effectively of supply chain to get the competitive advantage for companies. In the Swedish and Chinese <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies have a common agreement about using VMI system in order to reduce operating costs. Some articles believe VMI system has strong potential to be extended to the upstream nodes of the supply chain. However, in using VMI process, there are some risks such as capacity shortages, quality problems, breakdowns, ect. This thesis will be identified the risk of using VMI system in upstream of <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> company and mitigate their risk problems. Research question: What are the differences of risk managing in using VMI system between Chinese and Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies? RQ 1 : Which are the risk factors in Chinese and Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies when using VMI system? RQ 2 : How do Swedish and Chinese <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies manage the risk in using VMI? Purpose: The goal {{of this paper is to}} find out the risks of using VMI system and analyze the risk managing approaches that are utilized in Chinese and Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies. By illustrating theoretical data about VMI system and supply chain risk management and empirical data of three Chinese and one Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies, author would like to develop an analysis model from four dimensions of VMI system and basically supply chain risk management model to identify risk factors in using VMI system and figure out the difference of risk managing method between Chinese and Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies when they use VMI system. Method: This thesis adopted the positivism perspective and the qualitative research. The survey was used in this thesis and focused on based on empirical data such as interviews to answer an open-ended “How” issues. In addition, the analysis is based on primary data from interview Swedish company as well as secondary data from books, articles and internet such as the Chinese company's website. Conclusions: The results of the study show that risk {{management in}} using VMI system in three Chinese <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> companies (Haier Logistics Co., Ltd, Hisense Electric Co. and Midea Air-conditioning) and one Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> company (Electrolux Laundry System Sweden AB) as well as based on theoretical and empirical data to create an analysis model, which is the integration between four dimensions of VMI system and the basic supply chain risk management model, to assist the analysis of research questions. Through analysis, authors identify seven risk factors: 1. Uncertain production lead time; 2. Long delivery lead time; 3. Confidence crisis; 4. Forecasting level is not high; 5. Less control the decision making; 6. Low information technology system and cooperation; 7. Lack of safety stock. Authors also illustrate the method of managing risk in using VMI system from four dimensions in Chinese and Swedish <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> case companies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – To analyse {{the role}} of after-sales {{services}} in manufacturing contexts, and the related after-sales performance measurement systems. Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory case study research was performed in the automotive, <b>household</b> <b>appliance,</b> IT and consumer electronics industries. The sample {{is made up of}} 48 firms with after-sales operations in Italy. Findings – The role attributed to after-sales activities in the IT and consumer electronics and <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> industries shows an orientation to improve company image, customer satisfaction and retention (marketing focus). A different situation characterises the companies studied in the automotive industry. In most firms, however, measurement systems are quite simple and short-term oriented, especially in the IT and consumer electronics and <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> industries. The measurement of non-financial performance emphasises effectiveness rather than efficiency, and the automotive industry, on the whole, presents more advanced measurement systems, together with more integrated strategic management of after-sales. The <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> industry, on the other hand, due to the significant presence of SMEs, is characterised by less sophisticated performance measurement systems. Originality/value – Provides a representation of current empirical practices in after-sales role and performance measurement, a topic insufficiently covered by conceptual and empirical researc...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of {{returned}} product disposition strategies on organizational performance by collecting and analysing data from the <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> industry in Egypt. In addition, this paper also tests the effect of resource allocation as a moderator variable for the relations between disposition strategies and organizational performance. The proposed research model describes the impact of returned product disposition strategies on organizational performance and the effect of resource allocation as a moderator variable for the relations between disposition strategies and organizational performance. The proposed research model and hypotheses were tested using correlation analyses, regression analyses and structural equation modelling based on data collected from 108 companies in the Egyptian <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> industry. According to the results of the study, disposition strategies are positively associated with organizational performance. Moreover, resource allocation moderates the relation between disposition strategies and organizational performance. The data used in this study were collected from 108 companies in the Egyptian <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> industry. However, the generalization of the study results may be limited by the size of the sample. This study provides a useful working model in the <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> industry.

40|$|ABSTRACT Residential sectors consume {{one-fifth of}} global energy that all sectors have {{actively}} {{invested in the}} enhancement of residential energy efficiency. User behaviors could affect residential energy efficiency that it {{is regarded as a}} foresighted research to change unsustainable behaviors with product design. This study aims to discuss the psycho-social determinants in individual energy-saving behaviors and ensure the product design strategies and methods of the mapping determinants to reduce the difference between sustainable design intention and real product operation. With the mode for goal-directed behaviors to study the determinants in <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> energy-saving behaviors, personal desire could directly affect energy-saving Behavioral Intention and individual Perceived Behavioral Control, Positive Anticipated Emotion, Attitude, and Frequency of Past Behavior would indirectly affect energy-saving behavioral intention through personal desire. The design strategies of ego-information, ego-feedback, and ego-selectivity are the best <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> intervention design strategies in energy-saving behaviors. Based on the research results, a product designer could establish the mapping relation matrix between product design intervention strategy as the tactic, and psycho-social determinants in energy-saving behaviors as the objective to design the more practicable <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> for sustainable behaviors. *Address for Correspondenc...|$|R
