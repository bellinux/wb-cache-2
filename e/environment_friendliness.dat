40|$|Agent technology, a new {{paradigm}} in software engineering, has received attention from research and industry since 1990 s. However, {{it is still not}} used widely to date because it requires expertise on both programming and agent technology; gaps among requirements, agent design, and agent deployment also pose more difficulties. Goal Net methodology attempts to solve these issues with a goal-oriented approach that resembles human behaviours, and an agent designer that supports agent development using this philosophy. However, there are limitations on existing Goal Net Designer, the design and modelling component of the agent designer. Those limitations, including limited access, difficult deployment, inflexibility in user operations, design workflows against typical Goal Net methodology workflows, and lack of data protection, have inhibited widespread adoption of Goal Net methodology. Motivated by this, this book focuses on improvements on Goal Net Designer. In this project, Goal Net Designer is completely re-implemented using new technology with optimised software architecture and design. It allows access from all major desktop operating systems, as well as in web environment via all modern browsers. Enhancements such as refined workflows, model validation tool, access control, team collaboration tool, and link to compiler make Goal Net Designer a fully functional and powerful Integrated Development <b>Environment.</b> User <b>friendliness</b> and usability are greatly enhanced by simplifying user's actions to accomplish their tasks. User behaviour logging and quantitative feedback channel are also included to allow Goal Net Designer to continuously evolve with the power of big data analytics in future.

Author {{wanted to know if}} leaders who deal with county’s reputation management and development saw the county as students. Also wanted to give an overview county’s desired image and its differences between the actual images. The thesis is divided to four chapters, from the first one consists theoretical overview of different author’s definitions of image, the image formation process and its importance to a region. Second part of the thesis consists the questions of this study and more precise description of the study object. There are also exteriorized general distinctive features and problems of Põlva County which probably are related to development of the image. Third part of the thesis consist of the study method where is described the methods of the study (semantic differentiation, questionnaire and interview) and selection of interviewees and respondents. The fourth chapter is results of the study which gives an overview of the images of Põlva County in different target groups and brought forth significant differences between groups. Fifth part of thesis consists of discussion and conclusions of the study. In result of the study came out that leaders of the county see Põlva County different from target group in adjective “safe” where students see county less safe. In general the image of Põlva County in all target groups is positive (excepted fast) and average intensity. Polar adjectives of semantic differentiation coincide in all study groups significant attributes own, friendly, colorful, safe and clean. Respondents associate county primarily with emotional evaluative factor and less with power factor. Most of the respondents evaluate opinions about Põlva County among Estonians and Põlva County’s habitants positive or neutral. 59 % of students evaluate opinions of county among Estonians positive and 33 % neutral. 48 % of leaders of Põlva County evaluate opinion among Estonian positive and 74 % opinion among local people positive. Respondents share their own opinion about county and their evaluation to other people opinions. Evaluations to county’s image among Põlva gymnasium and Põlva high school students differ statistically significantly in the dimensions “open-closed” and “unattractive-attractive”. Students of Põlva high school see Põlva County significantly less open and attractive. The image of Põlva County among students of Põlva gymnasium is more clear, positive and strong than among students of Põlva high school. Leaders and students of gymnasium see Põlva County very similarly. Students who leave the county after graduating but will come back see Põlva County more positive than those students who don’t know if they would come back. Also the image of county is more positive and clear among those students who evaluate their information owning about county at least sufficient.

Due to the low fuel cost, <b>environment</b> <b>friendliness,</b> and the fast response generating capacity of the gas-fired generator [2], an increasing proportion of the total power production is generated by gas-fired generators. According to the World Energy Outlook 2010 [3], the worldwide demand for natural gas in the power sector in 2008 was 4303 TWh, and this amount is projected to rise to 7600 TWh by 2035, leading to the ever-increasing synergies between the gas network and electricity network. More importantly, with the development of distributed renewable resources and district energy demand [4], the interconnections between the gas network and electricity network extend from the gas-fired generators to various types of connectivity nodes, such as distributed heating and cooling loads [5], combined heating and power [6]. For the highly interdependency between the two energy supply networks, the natural gas transmission could have influence on the power transmission from the perspectives of economics and security, and vice versa [7, 8].

The integration is towards a higher energy efficiency as well as <b>environment</b> <b>friendliness.</b> Fossil fuels, specifically coal, will continue as the prime source of energy for a considerable future. However Carbon-dioxide emissions from coal based plants has serious „climate change ‟ effects. In this paper the Carbon-dioxide produced from the coal is utilized for production of ureain several well integrated and power-dominated polygeneration schemes. Power generation isby combined gas-steam power cycle. Other utilities of the polygeneration are utility heat and in some cases production of sulphuric acid. The utility heat obtained during urea production is proposed to be utilized by either heating the feed water in the steam cycle or by producing process steam. Different alternative schemes with similar utility outputs are discussed for relative advantages and disadvantages. Conceptualized schemes are not only CO 2 neutral though using coal but also compact and efficient with respect to same utility outputs in separate plants. Schematics show that depending upon one upstream process (say, gasification), downstream processes (say, carbon capture or urea production) may be changed according to their compatibility and state points may also vary for individual processes. Different utilities will also vary accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Environmental pollution, inconveniences {{and health}} hazards due to {{conventional}} application of cutting fluids essentially required for cooling and lubrication {{have been a}} great concern of the industries and the modern societies. Further they are also ineffective in controlling the high cutting temperature and rapid tool wear. One of the possible and potential techniques to overcome such problem is application of cryogenic cooling particularly by liquid nitrogen specially where the cutting temperature is a major constraint in achieving high productivity and job quality. The present work deals with experimental investigation in the role of cryogenic cooling by liquid nitrogen jets on tool wear, dimensional deviation and surface finish in turning of C- 60 steel at industrial speed-feed combination by uncoated carbide inserts (SNMG and SNMM) of different geometric configurations. The results have been compared with dry and wet machining. The results of the present work indicate substantial reduction in tool wear, which enhanced the tool life, dimensional accuracy and surface finish. This may be mainly attributed to reduction in cutting zone temperature and favourable change in the chip-tool interaction. Further it was evident that machining with soluble oil cooling failed to provide any significant improvement in tool life, rather surface finish deteriorated. Furthermore, it provides <b>environment</b> <b>friendliness</b> and improves the machinability characteristics...|$|E
