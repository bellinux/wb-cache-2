50|$|Penguins have {{an average}} sense of hearing for birds; this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies. Their eyes are adapted for {{underwater}} vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air {{it has been suggested}} that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis.Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the <b>heat</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} effect of two {{different}} physical therapy interventions in patients with stable coronary heart disease and non-cardiac chest pain. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was carried out at a university hospital in Norway. A total of 30 patients with known and stable coronary heart disease and self-reported persistent chest pain reproduced by palpation of intercostal trigger points were participating in the study. The intervention was deep friction massage and <b>heat</b> <b>pack</b> versus <b>heat</b> <b>pack</b> only. The primary outcome was pain intensity after the intervention period and 3 months after the last treatment session, measured by Visual Analogue Scale, 0 to 100. Secondary outcome was health-related quality of life. Results: Treatment with deep friction massage and <b>heat</b> <b>pack</b> gave significant pain reduction compared to <b>heat</b> <b>pack</b> only (– 17. 6, 95 % confidence interval: – 30. 5, – 4. 7; p < 0. 01), and the reduction was persistent at 3 months’ follow-up (– 15. 2, 95 % confidence interval: – 28. 5, – 1. 8; p = 0. 03).

The abdominal skin was cooled or heated {{with a cold}} or <b>heat</b> <b>pack.</b> Thermal stimulation of the spinal cord was performed by per fusing a thermode in the peridural space with cold or hot water. LPS-pyrogen was administered intravenously. Sulpyrine was given intravenously during {{the first or second}} phase of LPS-pyrogen induced fever. The rectal temperature, the hypothalamic temperature, the ear skin temperature, respiratory rate, EMG, oxygen consumption and cortical EEG were recorded. Blood flow of the common carotid artery (F.

By heating of the skin and spinal cord and sulpyrine administration, the change reverse to the above was observed. Both the F. C.

40|$|ABSTRACT The use of hot pack is {{a common}} {{superficial}} thermotherapy strategy {{and one of its}} benefits is the increase of muscle flexibility. However, {{there is a lack of}} information about the effects of the <b>heat</b> <b>pack</b> alone, without being used in association with other therapeutic interventions, in the flexibility of the lumbar region. The aim of this study was to compare the effects generated by the application of three different pack on the flexibility of the lower backs of healthy students. Three sessions of 15 minutes of superficial heat through a hot pack (moist heat pack-MHP, seed pack-SP or gel pack-GP) were applied to the lower back. Pack and lower back temperatures and erythema were registered every 5 minutes. A Schober test was performed before the first session and after the third session. After 15 minutes of treatment, pack temperature was higher in the SP group. At the same time, lumbar temperature was lower in the GP group. The heat treatment also increased erythema in the lower back for all three groups. There was a significant increase in intragroup flexibility as assessed by the Schober Test for all groups. There are significant differences in the effect generated between the three types of pack on the flexibility of the lower back. The MHP was able to transfer more heat to the lumbar area and provided a more pronounced increase in the flexibility of lower back tissues...|$|E

40|$|In {{co-operation}} with {{an industrial}} manufacturer of brake systems (Mayr-Antriebstechnik) DLR has investigated new designs of Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) {{for their use}} in high performance emergency brake systems in fields of mechanical engineering and conveying. These electromagnetic spring applied brakes for braking or holding loads, operate as important safety elements {{in case of a}} power failure or an emergency "OFF" situation. The brake system consists of a rotating and two stationary brake disks similar to the <b>heat</b> <b>pack</b> of aircraft brakes. Increasing drive and higher circumferential velocities in modern power transmission necessitate new concepts for emergency brake systems. Conventional emergency brakes with metallic disks and organic friction linings are inapplicable for extreme power input due to the insufficient thermal stability of these braking materials. The use of Carbon/Carbon composites (C/C) for high performance and extremely weight sensitive brake systems is state-of-the-art for aircraft and racing cars. However, C/C composites show high wear rates and an instability of their coefficient of friction caused by humidity and temperature. Long manufacturing times, multiple reinfiltration steps and expensive raw materials lead to very high prices for the finished C/C brake disks. These disadvantages have prevented their application in commercial brake systems like vehicles or mechanical engineering components. By using CMC brake disks, these technical disadvantages of C/C can be avoided and the efficiency and the lifetime of emergency brake systems can be increased. These so called C/C-SiC composites offer high coefficients of friction and low wear rates even at temperatures above 1000 °C. Due to the high friction energy and the resulting high temperatures while braking, the conventional construction of the emergency brake system was modified and adapted to the new C/C-SiC braking material. In various screening tests, different C/C-SiC qualities were tested to get the best compromise of friction and wear behaviour. Presently, emergency brake systems equipped with these new materials are being tested in field trials. In summary, the paper presents the successful development of new C/C-SiC composite materials for a commercial application by substituting conventional materials and the adaption of the brake system to the new requirements, resulting in an advanced braking system of improved tribological characteristics for high performance applications...|$|E
