As part of the elaborate scheme, Doctor Hurt, who is well aware that Batman is Bruce Wayne, sends a wealthy criminal named Jezebel Jet to pose as a love interest for Bruce Wayne in order to weaken his mental state.

And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone.

Parents generally hold teachers in high regard, with most agreeing their children’s teachers are very capable. 	 	 	 	Australian parents’ perceptions of their child’s knowledge and skills are the largest predictor of all NAPLAN scores; indicating that parents are fundamentally concerned about their children’s subject knowledge and ability to apply it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> test <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> NAPLAN. 	  	  	 ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} is described that tests theoretical predictions on how C-lines incident obliquely on a surface behave on reflection. C-lines <b>in</b> <b>a</b> polarised wave are the analogues of the optical vortices carried by a complex scalar wave, {{which is the}} usual model for describing light and other electromagnetic waves. The centre of a laser beam that carries a (degenerate) C-line is shifted on reflection by the well-known Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects, but the C-line itself splits into two, {{both of which are}} shifted longitudinally and laterally; their shifts are {{different from that of the}} beam centre. To maximise the effect to be measured, internal reflection <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass prism close to the critical angle was used. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> simple <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> this two recently published independent theories of C-line reflection overlap and it is shown that their predictions are identical. The measured differences in the lateral shifts of the two reflected C-lines are compared with theoretical expectations over a range of incidence angles. Comment: 9 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe β-amyloid peptide (Aβ or A 4) is {{produced}} by proteolytic cleavage from amyloid precursor protein (APP). The progressive cerebral deposition of this peptide {{is one of the}} most important features of Alzheimer's disease. From the study of normal and transfected cells, two APP processing pathways have been proposed as physiological alternatives. One of these can produce Aβ or amyloidogenic peptides, whereas the second does not. However, it is not completely clear how APPs are post-translationally modified, proteolytically processed and metabolized in the brain. We report here that APPs also exist as proteoglycan, chondroitin-sulfate (ChS). We have identified in normal rat brain a complex pool of 8 to 130 kDa ChS-core proteins. The main portion of these proteoglycan (PGs) APPs contains complete amyloidogenic sequence, suggesting a novel proteolytic processing of APP from the amino-terminal to the transmembrane region. This population appears augmented after brain damage. These findings may have significant implications in understanding the initial deposition and kinetics of amyloid aggregation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pathological <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
