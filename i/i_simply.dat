25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

500|$|Gordimer uses {{quotation}} dashes to punctuate her {{dialogue in}} Burger's Daughter instead of traditional quotation marks. She {{told an interviewer}} in 1980 that readers have complained that this sometimes {{makes it difficult to}} identify the speaker, but she added [...] "I don't care. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> cannot stand he-said/she-said anymore. And if I can't make readers know who’s speaking from the tone of voice, the turns of phrase, well, then I've failed." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his work}} on Tea & Sympathy, Fanning noted less of a {{collaborative}} song style, referring to his inability to play guitar solos as causing different elements to become a focus of the songs. In an interview, he said, [...] "I wasn't relying on solos to be big features because <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> can't play them." [...] Fanning explained that the shorter length of songs was due to him not having [...] "four other people" [...] to back him up when producing independently.|$|E
500|$|Contrary to his {{statements}} to Patton, Eisenhower never seriously considered removing the general from {{duty in the}} European Theater. Writing of the incident before the media attention, he said, [...] "If this thing ever gets out, they'll be howling for Patton's scalp, {{and that will be}} the end of Georgie's service in this war. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> cannot let that happen. Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] Still, following the capture of Messina in August 1943, Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months.|$|E

And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|The video caused [...] "a veritable stir in {{the music}} world" [...] because [...] "Boutonnat cast [...] {{as a kind of}} provocative Lolita figure". As she wears a {{transparent}} nightgown in the music video, some French television channels censored it. It was first aired on the French television programme Clip Clap in a shortened version. In an interview, Farmer deplored the censorship, saying: [...] " [...] has shocked many people. I find it pretty stupid.

500|$|His {{performance}} {{earned him}} another Best Actor Academy Award nomination, 17 {{years after his}} first. Reviews were strong, and the film {{is considered one of}} the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was [...] "the most professional actor I've ever known. He was always 'real'. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> forgot we were making a picture. His eyes would actually fill up when we were working on a tender scene. And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Visitors to Seeon {{included}} Prince Felix Yusupov, {{husband of}} Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who wrote, [...] "I claim categorically {{that she is}} not Anastasia Nicolaievna, but just an adventuress, a sick hysteric and a frightful playactress. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, I am convinced that you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." [...] Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.|$|E
500|$|The Badmotorfinger logo {{consists}} of a jagged, cyclone-like design. In {{the center of the}} logo is a triangle with the album's title, containing a spark plug. The album's cover art was illustrated by guitarist Mark Dancey from the Sub Pop band Big Chief. Thayil suggested the title Badmotorfinger as a joke on the Montrose song [...] "Bad Motor Scooter". Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort of {{off the top of my}} head. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> like it because it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too... It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|E

500|$|Fanning {{worked with}} {{producer}} Tchad Blake and {{was funded by}} record label Dew Process. Sessions for the album began in February 2005 when Fanning and several other musicians recorded tracks at Blake's Brisbane studio. Four of these—"Not Finished Just Yet", [...] "Believe", [...] "Wash Me Clean", and [...] "Hope & Validation"—appeared on the album after being mixed by Blake. The other tracks were recorded and mixed at Real World Studios near Bath, England. In Bath, Fanning worked with musicians including Jerry Marotta, Keith Duffy, and John Bedggood. While writing Fanning listened to music of guitarists Lightning Hopkins, Tom Petty, and singer-songwriter Gillian Welch, who all influenced his work. [...] "I'd love to play guitar like that, but <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> don't have the skill to do it", said Fanning of Hopkins' work.|$|E
500|$|Pascu parted with Divertis in 2007. At the time, he {{indicated}} that {{he could no longer}} handle their tight schedule. The break was not total, though, since Pascu continued to appear on Animat Planet. In a 2007 interview, reflecting on that show's impact, he stated, [...] "I'm not much of a fan of political humor. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> like the impromptu kind of humor [...] If [...] happens to be political, it is because that is {{what we have to do}} in this series." [...] In 2012, he asserted that his break with political humor was definitive, and against the consensus in Divertis—in 2007, Pascu noted there was already a disagreement between him and Toni Grecu. Shortly after his departure, a conflict between Grecu and the other Divertis actors broke Divertis into competing halves.|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, Evans {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} have a fairly significant part in the making of the album, stating [...] "I don't know at this point exactly how many songs will be on the CD, but I'm sure we'll have about four or five different-sized orchestras or bands. It'll turn into a giant panic, I can assure you. That's just how this business is." [...] Later that month, Gaga, after her performance with Bennett at the final inaugural ball of President Obama's second inauguration, announced the album formally through her Twitter. [...] "And here's me and my handsome date, <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> cannot wait for our album together, he's my darling!"

[...] "The decision has been the toughest I've ever made {{but it is the}} right one to make at this point in my life," [...] Lindgren said. [...] "I feel that <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry." [...] Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik Åkesson replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained [...] "Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth." ...|$|E
500|$|Ornstein soon {{moved in}} a very {{different}} direction. He began imagining and then writing works with new sounds, dissonant and startling. Ornstein himself was unsettled by the earliest of these compositions: [...] "I really doubted my sanity at first. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> said, what is that? It was so completely removed from any experience I ever had." [...] On March 27, 1914, in London, he gave his first public performance of works then called [...] "futurist", now known as modernist. In addition to a Busoni arrangement of three Bach choral preludes and several pieces by Schoenberg, Ornstein played a number of his own compositions. The concert caused a major stir. One newspaper described Ornstein's work as [...] "the sum of Schoenberg and Scriabine [...] squared." [...] Others were less analytical: [...] "We have never suffered from such insufferable hideousness, expressed in terms of so-called music." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the morning}} of September 18, Eric Burdon arrived at the Samarkand {{sometime}} before the ambulance crew and found that Hendrix was already dead. Burdon immediately became concerned that police would find drugs at the apartment, and as he was collecting incriminating evidence, he found the poem that Hendrix had written hours earlier, [...] "The Story of Life". Burdon, {{who said he had}} previously discussed suicide and death with Hendrix, assumed the poem was a suicide note. Under this assumption, he made comments to the press regarding his belief that Hendrix had committed suicide that he has since recanted: [...] "I made false statements... <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> didn't understand what the situation was. I misread the note... I thought it was a goodbye". Dannemann said Hendrix told her: [...] "I want you to keep this [...] forever [...] I don't want you to forget anything that is written. It's a story about you and me".|$|E
