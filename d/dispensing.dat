5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout {{is the most}} common method of <b>dispensing</b> in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the <b>dispensing</b> tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|A beer {{tower is}} a beer <b>dispensing</b> device, usually found in bars and pubs, that {{consists}} of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel.|$|E

5|$|An American design, , {{authorized}} in 1905 {{and laid}} down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, , were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, <b>dispensing</b> with Dreadnoughts wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.|$|E
5|$|Henry allowed Catherine {{almost no}} {{political}} influence as queen. Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal. Henry gave the Château of Chenonceau, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, {{who took her}} place at the centre of power, <b>dispensing</b> patronage and accepting favours.|$|E
5|$|In Japan the {{practice}} of keeping horned rhinoceros beetles (Dynastinae) and stag beetles (Lucanidae) is particularly popular amongst young boys.

50|$|In America, in 2009, further {{advanced}} counters were designed {{that included the}} ability to <b>dispense</b> hands-free - a feature that many operators had desired. This allowed pharmacies to automate their most commonly <b>dispensed</b> medications via calibrated cassettes. Thirty of a pharmacy’s common medications would now be <b>dispensed</b> automatically. Another new model doubled that throughput via an enclosed robotic mechanism. Robotics had been employed in pharmacies since the mid-1990s, but later machines <b>dispense</b> and label filled patient vials in a comparatively tiny space (about nine square feet of floor space). These newer technologies allowed pharmacy staff to confidently <b>dispense</b> hundreds of prescriptions per day and {{still be able to}} manage the many functions of a busy community pharmacy.|$|R
50|$|Some {{brand name}} {{medicines}} on the blacklist can be <b>dispensed</b> against prescriptions for generic drugs (if the approved generic {{name is not}} itself included in the blacklist). For example, Calpol can be <b>dispensed</b> for a prescription for paracetamol suspension, but it is generally cheaper to <b>dispense</b> the generic form, and {{it is at the}} pharmacy's discretion to do otherwise.|$|R
5|$|Together {{with the}} north and south wall, the {{entrance}} of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for <b>dispensing</b> holy water.|$|E
5|$|After the English Reformation, the North saw several Catholic uprisings, {{including}} the Lincolnshire Rising, Bigod's Rebellion in Cumberland and Westmorland, and largest of all, the Yorkshire-based Pilgrimage of Grace, all against Henry VIII. His daughter Elizabeth I faced another Catholic rebellion, the Rising of the North. The region {{would become the}} centre of recusancy as prominent Catholic families in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire refused to convert to Protestantism. Royal power over the region was exercised through the Council of the North at King's Manor, York, {{which was founded in}} 1484 by Richard III. The Council existed intermittently for the next two centuries – its final incarnation was created {{in the aftermath of the}} Pilgrimage of Grace and was chiefly an institution for providing order and <b>dispensing</b> justice.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of <b>dispensing</b> capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

5|$|James II took {{advantage}} of the suppression of the rebellion to consolidate his power. He asked Parliament to repeal the Test Act and the Habeas Corpus Act, used his <b>dispensing</b> power to appoint Roman Catholics to senior posts, and raised the strength of the standing army. Parliament opposed many of these moves, and on 20 November 1685 James dismissed it. In 1688, when the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart heralded a Catholic succession, James II was overthrown in a coup d'état by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution at the invitation of the disaffected Protestant Establishment.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the vital}} {{instruments}} which facilitated long distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden. Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE, could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way. The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads {{to control the}} long distance trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the Arabian Peninsula. Caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods, the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators. With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes– <b>dispensing</b> innovations of civilizations– began to rise.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{controversy}} of Sampson's administration {{was over the}} selection of the state's highway commissioner. The Highway Department employed over ten thousand people and spent nearly 45% of the state's budget. Legislators' votes could often be bought with promises of new road construction in their districts. Thus, the department became a primary vehicle for <b>dispensing</b> patronage to political supporters. Sampson's predecessor, Governor Fields, had chosen retired congressman and Democratic political boss Ben Johnson to head the department, and Sampson had agreed to retain him in exchange for his support against Beckham. However, Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not be left {{in the hands of a}} Democrat, and he removed Johnson from office in December 1929.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{present a}} brief {{synopsis}} of {{trends in the}} number of prescriptions and retail costs of outpatient drugs <b>dispensed</b> in the US between 1998 and 2003. Methods: Data were extracted from IMS Health, the National Prescription Audit Plus(TM) and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index(TM) databases. Results: In 1998, 2. 7 billion outpatient prescriptions were <b>dispensed</b> versus 3. 6 billion in 2003. This equates to a 33. 3 % increase over the 6 -year period. Of the top 20 most <b>dispensed</b> drugs by volume, 40 % were launched in the 1990 s or 2000 s. Retail costs for the total market of <b>dispensed</b> outpatient prescription drugs were $US 96. 1 billion in 1998 and $US 196 billion in 2003, a 104 % increase. Of the top 20 most <b>dispensed</b> drugs by retail cost, all were tradename drugs and were launched in the 1990 s or 2000 s. Conclusions: These data indicate a large increase in the US over a short time period in <b>dispensed</b> outpatient prescriptions and their associated retail costs.

5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also <b>dispensing</b> with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E
5|$|Edward was {{responsible}} for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials. It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in <b>dispensing</b> justice, but {{he appears to have}} involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322. Edward made extensive use of Roman civil law during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning the established principles of the English Common Law. Edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although just how widely they did so is unclear. Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local gentry; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.|$|E
