50|$|Lanolin (from Latin lāna, ‘wool’, and oleum, ‘oil’), {{also called}} wool wax or wool grease, is a wax {{secreted}} by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many pharmacopoeias {{have referred to}} lanolin as wool fat (adeps lanae); however, as lanolin lacks glycerides (<b>glycerol</b> <b>esters),</b> {{it is not a}} true fat. Lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead. Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin. There is an inverse correlation between fiber diameter and wool wax content.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhthalates are {{the most}} {{important}} plasticizers used in the polymer industry. However, their fossil origin and the results of recent tests showing their potential negative effect on human health have encouraged the polymer industry to turn toward non-phthalate plasticizers.

This paper presents the performance of eight <b>esters</b> derived from <b>glycerol</b> as plasticizers for poly(vinyl chloride), including tests to evaluate their compatibility.

30|$|A {{herbaceous}} plant, Linum usitatissimum, linseed (also called flax) produces seeds {{which are}} oval and flattened in shape, 4 – 6 [*]cm long, pale to dark brown and shiny.

40|$|AbstractProcessing of {{exogenous}} <b>glycerol</b> <b>esters</b> is {{an initial}} step in energy derivation for many bacterial cells. Lipid-rich environments settled {{by a variety}} of organisms exert strong evolutionary pressure for establishing enzymatic pathways involved in lipid metabolism. However, a certain number of enzymes involved in this process remain unknown since they do not share detectable sequence similarity with any known protein domains. Using distant homology detection and fold recognition we predict that bacterial transmembrane proteins belonging to the uncharacterized domain of unknown function 2319 (DUF 2319) family possess the alpha/beta hydrolase fold domain together with the catalytic triad critical for hydrolysis. A detailed analysis of sequence/structure features and genomic context indicates that DUF 2319 proteins may be involved in lipid metabolism. Therefore, these enzymes are likely to serve as extracellular lipases...|$|R

40|$|The {{earliest}} cells {{may have}} {{consisted of a}} self-replicating genetic polymer encapsulated within a self-replicating membrane vesicle. Here, we show that vesicles composed of simple single-chain amphiphiles such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and fatty-acid <b>glycerol</b> <b>esters</b> are extremely thermostable and retain internal RNA and DNA oligonucleotides at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 100 °C. The strands of encapsulated double-stranded DNA can be separated by denaturation at high temperature while being retained within vesicles, implying that strand separation in primitive protocells could have been mediated by thermal fluctuations without the loss of genetic material from the protocell. At elevated temperatures, complex charged molecules such as nucleotides cross fatty-acid-based membranes very rapidly, suggesting that high temperature excursions may have facilitated nutrient uptake before the evolution of advanced membrane transporters.
