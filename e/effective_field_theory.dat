25|$|In principle, {{the physics}} within a nucleus {{can be derived}} entirely from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In {{practice}} however, current computational and mathematical approaches for solving QCD in low-energy systems such as the nuclei are extremely limited.

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{approach}} is to develop effective field theories for a consistent description of nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces.

40|$|<b>Effective</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> {{have been}} a very popular tool in quantum physics for almost two decades. And there are good reasons for this. I will argue that <b>effective</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> share many of the {{advantages}} of both fundamental theories and phenomenological models, while avoiding their respective shortcomings. They are, for example, flexible enough to cover a wide range of phenomena, and concrete enough to provide a detailed story of the specific mechanisms at work at a given energy scale. So will all of physics eventually converge on <b>effective</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories?</b> This paper argues that good scientific research can be characterised by a fruitful interaction between fundamental theories, phenomenological models and <b>effective</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> All of them have their appropriate functions in the research process, and all of them are indispensable. They complement each other and hang together in a coherent way which I shall characterise in some detail. To illustrate all this I will present a case study from nuclear and particle physics. The resulting view about scientific theorising is inherently pluralistic, and has implications for the debates about reductionism an...|$|R
