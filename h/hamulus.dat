2500|$|The {{carpal tunnel}} is an {{anatomical}} compartment {{located at the}} base of the palm. Nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel that is surrounded on three sides by the carpal bones that form an arch. The median nerve provides feeling or sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the ring finger. At the level of the wrist, the median nerve supplies the muscles {{at the base of}} the thumb that allow it to abduct, move away from the other four fingers, as well as move out of the plane of the palm. The carpal tunnel is located at the middle third of the base of the palm, bounded by the bony prominence of the scaphoid tubercle and trapezium {{at the base of the}} thumb, and the hamate hook that can be palpated along the axis of the ring finger. From the anatomical position, the carpal tunnel is bordered on the anterior surface by the transverse carpal ligament, also known as the flexor retinaculum. The flexor retinaculum is a strong, fibrous band that attaches to the pisiform and the <b>hamulus</b> of the hamate. The proximal boundary is the distal wrist skin crease, and the distal boundary is approximated by a line known as Kaplan's cardinal line. [...] This line uses surface landmarks, and is drawn between the apex of the skin fold between the thumb and index finger to the palpated hamate hook.|$|E

40|$|Wing <b>hamuli</b> in stingless bee are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} unique characteristics and could be used as the features in taxonomy and identification of species. The number of wing <b>hamuli</b> differs from species to species. Wing <b>hamuli</b> {{can be found on the}} hind wing, which link the fore wing of the stingless bee for a distant foraging. In this experiment, nine Indo-Malayan stingless bee species were collected from a specialized collection center in Sekayu, Terengganu, Malaysia (Indo- Malayan Meliponine Respository Sekayu) and stingless bee farm in Jalan Kebun, Selangor. Uncoated fresh samples were introduced into the low-vacuum chamber of the SEM and observed for their wing <b>hamuli</b> on both the right and left wing. Observation under the SEM shows clearer <b>hamuli</b> morphology as compared to stereomicroscopy. Result shows the number of wing <b>hamuli</b> on left and right wing of certain stingless bees are not similar. Samples of Geniotrigona thoracica exhibits variation wing <b>hamuli.</b> Some has 8 <b>hamuli</b> on the left wing and 9 on the right wing or 10 <b>hamuli</b> on left and 9 <b>hamuli</b> on the light or both wings have 8 <b>hamuli.</b> There are also variation in Homotrigona aliceae wing <b>hamuli.</b> Some has 7 or 8 <b>hamuli</b> on both wings or 8 <b>hamuli</b> on right and 7 on the left. On the other hand, Homotrigona fimbriata shows both with either 8 or 7 <b>hamuli.</b> Most of Tetrigona apicalis shows 7 <b>hamuli</b> on both wings except, one sample with 8 <b>hamuli</b> on the left and 7 on the right.

40|$|Significant {{differences}} between countries {{were found in}} the distribution of the number of <b>hamuli</b> within Apis andreniformis, A. florea, A. cerana and A. koschevnikovi. The mean <b>hamuli</b> numbers for Apis mellifera intermissa differed significantly among localities in Algeria. Significant differences in intercolonial variability between countries were found within A. cerana. There was no significant infraspecific variability within A. andreniformis, A. florea, A. koschevnikovi and A. m. intermissa. Significant differences in the mean number of <b>hamuli</b> occur between A. m. intermissa and A. andreniformis, A. florea and A. cerana; also between A. cerana/A. koschevnikovi and A. andreniformis and A. florea. Significant differences {{were found in the}} distribution and variability of the number of <b>hamuli</b> between species (populations). The mean numbers of <b>hamuli</b> for A. andreniformis differed from those of A. florea. Both these population means differed from those of A. cerana, A. koschevnikovi and A. m. intermissa. No {{significant differences were found between}} A. cerana and A. koschevnikovi. When the analysis included data for A. dorsata, A. nigrocincta, A. m. carnica, A. m. caucasica and A. m. ligustica, the results showed significant differences in <b>hamuli</b> numbers between A. andreniformis/A. florea and A. cerana/A. koschevnikovi/A. nigrocincta and A. m. intermissa/A. m. carnica/A. m. caucasica/A. m. ligustica. <b>Hamuli</b> numbers in A. dorsata significantly differed from those of other populations except A. m. intermissa. These results show that <b>hamuli</b> numbers are useful in the classification of honeybee populations.

40|$|In {{species of}} the monogenean {{helminth}} Gyrodactylus, the opisthaptor is the main organ of attachment to the host. The opisthaptor comprises two large centrally positioned hooks or <b>hamuli</b> and sixteen peripherally distributed marginal hooks. This paper describes the functional morphology and the mechanism and sequence of attachment in this species. Information on the attachment process was gathered from observations of live gyrodactylids, from transmission electron microscopy, from scanning electron microscopy of skeletal elements, and by histochemical and X-ray elemental analysis of hook chemical composition. The marginal hooks provide the principal force of attachment whilst the <b>hamuli</b> are not actively employed {{in the process of}} attachment. Instead, the <b>hamuli</b> provide a system preventing accidental dislodgement and assist the action of the marginal hooks. Attachment is achieved by the alternating action of two systems of muscles attached respectively to the <b>hamuli</b> and to the marginal hooks. Relaxation or contraction of the muscles connected to the <b>hamuli</b> manoeuvres the <b>hamuli</b> over the extremities of the accessory ventral bar and allows them to pivot around their longitudinal axis, effectively raising or lowering the opisthaptoral dome. Under reduced opisthaptoral tension, the independent gaffing activity of the marginal hooks ensures a secure attachment to the host's epidermis. Repositioning of the <b>hamuli</b> then raises the opisthaptoral dome to tension the peripheral marginal hooks. The sequence of attachment is complete when all the muscles associated with the hooks {{are in a state of}} relaxation but are held securely and under tension by the surrounding, stretched, opisthaptoral dome...|$|R

40|$|The {{elemental}} compositions of the <b>hamuli,</b> marginal {{hooks and}} ventral bars were examined following their {{release from the}} opisthaptor of the monogenean parasites Gyrodactylus salaris, G. caledoniensis and G. colemanensis. Their compositions were determined using X-ray elemental analysis on an analytical scanning electron microscope, and the variation between each species investigated. <b>Hamuli</b> and marginal hooks exhibited a major peak for sulphur, whilst the ventral bar had high peaks of both sulphur and calcium. The high sulphur content {{and structure of the}} <b>hamuli</b> suggest they are composed of a keratin-like protein, while the nature of the ventral bar is less clear. The <b>hamuli</b> of G. colemanensis were differentiated from those of G. caledoniensis by virtue of their calcium fraction. Low levels of several other elements, including vanadium, were also detected in some sclerites. The composition of the hooks of Gyrodactylus and their relationship to the sclerites of monopisthocotyleans and polyopisthocotyleans is commented upon...|$|R

This is the fifth polystome species known from Turkey and the third species in Pelobates.
