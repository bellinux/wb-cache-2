5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> in {{the film}} The Bridge by Brett Hanover, where two young women looking for a laugh tell a Scientology {{volunteer}} they learned about the organization from South Park. The volunteer answers that she hasn't seen the episode in question, and the two women later leave {{during the middle of}} an orientation video.|$|E
5|$|After {{a poorly}} {{received}} test screening, in which Lynch believes he had mixed the soundtrack at {{too high a}} volume, the director cut twenty minutes of footage from the film, bringing its length to 89 minutes. Among the cut footage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> featuring Coulson as the infant's midwife, another of a man torturing two women—one again played by Coulson—with a car battery, and one of Spencer toying with a dead cat.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{video was}} shot for the song's remix. It too {{was directed by}} Carey, and was shot in black and white. The shot of Carey in a beret that would become the cover for this single <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from the video. The video features cameo appearances by Da Brat and Xscape. It begins with Carey and the duo spending time recording the song in Carey's in-home studio. In the video, Carey is wearing a large white, straw hat and features long golden hair. As the trio finishes the song, scenes of Carey by her pool are shown, with cameos made by her dog, Jack. Brat and Xscape are seen poolside with Carey, playing cards and drinking beer, as the trio further bond and laugh. Towards {{the end of the}} video, scenes of the trio in the studio are shows, and intermingled with snippets of Carey walking inside her mansion, shared with then husband Tommy Mottola. The video ends with Carey and Brat bonding by the studio and pool.|$|E

60|$|In {{a moment}} the vessel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of bustle; the men swarmed up the rigging, urged to the {{greatest}} exertions {{not only by the}} voices of their officers but by the appearance of the heavens. The frigate behind held on three or four minutes longer, then her sheets were let fly, and immediately she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of wild confusion.|$|R

5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos. Drunken Barnaby <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of {{a drunken}} man being carried {{away from an}} inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career. The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed {{that it would not be}} her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated that it would not be one of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con that it would not be Homer, although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E
5|$|The Agni's Philosophy tech demo {{was running}} at 60 frames per second, used 1.8 GB of texture data per frame, and pushed ten million polygons per frame, with {{approximately}} 300,000 to 400,000 polygons for each character model. The entire {{city in the}} demo was tessellated. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> where 100,000 illuminated firefly-like insects appear on screen, each one a full polygon mesh model with body and wings, which proceed to merge to generate a summoned monster. Production for the demo began in June 2011, and was initially produced as pre-rendered CGI animation by Visual Works before Square Enix attempted to reproduce it entirely in real-time with the Luminous Studio engine, using the same assets as the CGI version.|$|E

25|$|In {{an episode}} of Frasier, Frasier gives his dad an AIBO ERS-210 to keep him company while he is visiting Roz in Wisconsin. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> with Eddie {{interacting}} with the AIBO, while Martin Crane complains to Sony {{about not being able}} to get it to work.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} devised and written by Mark Tavener, and logically follows the series In the Red, In the Balance, In the Chair, and In the End {{which he wrote}} with Peter Baynham. In some of these, Prentiss and McCabe (again played by Fry and Bird) are {{elevated}} members of the BBC, before getting kicked out. Indeed, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> on the last page of the novel In the Red, in which the newly appointed {{director general of the}} BBC gives them the sack.|$|E
25|$|Among the DVD's special {{features}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> that {{was cut from}} the film where Mumble meets a blue whale and an albatross. The albatross was Steve Irwin's first voice role in the film before he voiced the elephant seal in the final cut. The scene was finished and included on the DVD in Irwin's memory. This scene is done in Irwin's classic documentary style, with the albatross telling the viewer all about the other characters in the scene, and the impact people are having on their environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} an ancient synagogue, Zippori Synagogue, have been {{uncovered}} in the lower section of the city. Measuring 20.7 meters by 8 meters wide, it was located {{at the edge of}} the town. The mosaic floor is divided into seven parts. Near the entrance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> showing the angels visiting Sarah. The next section shows the binding of Isaac. There is a large Zodiac with the names of the months written in Hebrew. Helios sits in the middle, in his sun chariot. The last section shows two lions flanking a wreath, their paws resting on the head of an ox.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} section there is a {{representation}} of Jesus {{in the house of}} Caiaphus. Seventy two judges try Jesus with Pontius Pilate on the side in the balcony. On the north side, Pilate appears again but the Jewish judges stay outside the Roman magistrate's house because they are observing Passover. The south side presents Pilate presenting Jesus and Barabbas and asking to choose who to let go. On the east side <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> with Jesus being flogged while tied to a post. On the south wall there is a Neoclassical altarpiece of stone with gold leaf. This contains an image of Christ tied to a post and bearing the marks of being flogged. This is called the Señor de la Columna.|$|E
25|$|To {{the right}} of the massacre, stands the image Jesus and the Four Evangelists. This carving {{introduces}} the next relief panel depicting the Crucifixion. In the center on the panel Jesus hangs upon the cross traditionally shown with his head falling to the side and modestly covered in a loin cloth. A new addition that Nicola made to the crucified Savior is the joining of Christ’s feet upon the cross with one nail. This had not been seen before the 13th century. Surrounding Jesus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of onlookers and mourners. To the left of Christ stands the image of Mary physically grieving. Her stance and emotion is another motif of the 13th century as it became common to depict the Virgin as swooning. This panel is also a good example of Nicolas understanding of depth with the foreground figures being the largest.|$|E

25|$|While Don Quixote is {{unconscious}} in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, {{the parish}} curate {{and the local}} barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of high comedy: If the books are so bad for morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel La Galatea is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance Felixmarte de Hyrcania is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the library, later telling Don Quixote {{that it was the}} action of a wizard (encantador).|$|E
25|$|The covered bowl is {{a vessel}} of {{particular}} interest. It is the earliest {{object in the}} hoard, {{and the only one}} whose general area of manufacture within the Roman Empire is known for certain. It belongs to a type that is known to have been manufactured in Gaul in the 3rd century AD. It has a narrow horizontal flange set below the upright rim and decorated with scroll patterns inlaid in niello, and a small nielloed rosette within the centre base. It has a high, domed lid that fits neatly over the vertical rim and has been decorated in a very different style, with two friezes of low-relief decoration. The upper zone consists of conventional foliate ornament, while the lower <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of centaurs attacking various wild animals, separated by Bacchic masks. The small raised rim {{at the top of the}} lid would have sufficed for handling it, but set within it is a 'knob' in the form of a silver-gilt statuette of a young, seated triton blowing a conch shell. This figure may well be a secondary addition to the lid; and the lid, in 4th century style, is certainly a secondary addition to the bowl.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous reliefs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> with six men at Hung-i Nauruzi. In the middle of the figure, the main {{character}} is in frontal view in Parthian costume. To the right are three other men, though slightly smaller carved into the stone. On the left is a rider on a horse. The figure is shown in profile. Behind the rider is followed by another man, again in profile. The stylistic difference between the Hellenistic style portrayed in more riders and reproduced in the Parthian style in other characters led to the assumption that the four men were later carved into the rock on the right side. The rider probably represents a king, and has been identified as Mithridates I, who conquered Elymais in 140/139 BC when Parthian art was still largely Hellenistic. Accordingly, the relief is celebrating his victory. This interpretation has however been rejected and for the theory the rider is a local ruler of the Elymais. Other reliefs often show groups of men, single men, and also the figure of Heracles. Generally older reliefs are Hellenistic while newer are more Iranian-Parthian by fashion.|$|E

25|$|The Tamamushi Shrine is {{a common}} example of {{painting}} that derived from Baekje and provides important evidence for the Korean peninsula's and the Chinese mainland's strong cultural transfer to the Japanese islands. The shrine is named for the many wings of the tamamushi beetle that once adorned it but have since deteriorated. The paintings that cover building and dais are of Jataka tales, bodhisattvas, the Four Heavenly Kings, and other buddhist iconography. The front panels of the building show the Four Guardian Kings clad in armor with long flowing scarves. On the side doors are bodhisattvas holding lotus blossoms and forming a mudra. On the back is represented a sacred landscape with heights topped with pagodas. The dais shows on its front relics, seated monks making offerings, and apsara. On the back is depicted Mount Sumeru. The right side shows {{a scene from the}} Nirvana Sutra, where the Buddha offers his life in return for more of the sacred teachings, before being caught in his plummet by Indra. On the left panel of the dais <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from the Golden Light Sutra of a bodhisattva removing his upper garments before casting himself from a cliff to feed a hungry tigress and her cubs.|$|E
500|$|In {{the film}} 28 Days Later, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> where Sgt.
