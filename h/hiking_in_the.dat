5|$|After tricking {{his wife}} Marge {{into believing that}} {{the model for the}} Burly paper towel {{corporation}} Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E
5|$|As Hondo {{began to}} regenerate, Mauritius and Réunion were placed under {{a state of}} alert. Residents in Réunion were advised to stay up to date with the latest {{warnings}} on the storm, not go <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains, ensure their disaster kit is fully stocked, {{stay away from the}} shore, and know the locations of the nearest shelters. Initially, residents in Madagascar feared that Hondo would make landfall in the country after being struck by Cyclone Ivan on February16. However, the storm turn towards the southwest, away from Madagascar. On February23 ex-Hondo tracked just offshore Mauritius before passing directly over Réunion, just short of moderate tropical storm status. Sustained winds of 50km/h (31mph) with gusts up to 76km/h (47mph) were recorded on Mauritius while sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts up to 99km/h (61mph) were recorded on Réunion. The highest rainfall total was recorded at Takamaka, totaling to 750mm (29.5in). Up to 760,000 people were affected on Réunion and overall damage was minimal.|$|E

FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate and after closer examination of the bones, the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination. Mulder, believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights, heads out to the scene of the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner (Jim Beaver) to perform more tests.|$|E
5|$|Robert Stebbins {{was born}} on March 31, 1915, in Chico, California, to parents Cyril Adelbert and Louise Stebbins (née Beck). His father, born in Wisconsin of English descent, was an {{instructor}} at Chico State Normal School who had also published on birds and agriculture, stressing the importance of gardening in education. The oldest of seven children, young Robert grew up learning about local birds and exploring the wildlife of Northern California. His mother, born in Switzerland and educated at the Normal School, instilled a sense of artistry in Robert, painting pictures for Robert and his siblings in her spare time. When Stebbins was seven, {{his family moved to}} the San Francisco Bay Area, where his father worked on agricultural curriculum for children and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. Around the age of nine, his family moved to Southern California, living first in Pomona, then in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. Stebbins spent time <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby Santa Monica Mountains, exploring the wildlife and amassing a collection of bird and mammal specimens which he prepared and mounted himself. Stebbins attended North Hollywood High School, where his father taught hygiene and agriculture. Robert graduated in 1933. He discovered his artistic talents around sixteen years old. His early work consisted of cartoons: he drew illustrations on classmates' clothing and contributed cartoons to youth magazines, winning several awards.|$|E

25|$|When {{he became}} pope in 1978 {{at the age}} of 58, John Paul II was an avid sportsman.

The media contrasted the new pope's athleticism and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been Pope Pius XI (1922–1939), who was an avid mountaineer. An Irish Independent article in the 1980s labelled John Paul II the keep-fit pope.|$|E

25|$|Voelker {{spent much}} of his time fishing near Ishpeming when he was not writing. He kept his car stocked with fishing poles and other supplies, and for seven or eight months of the year, he was out fishing or <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods. He was said to have fished five or six days a week for 20 years, {{according}} to one close friend. He was also known for his skills as a card player, specifically cribbage. Many readers attempted to locate Frenchman's Pond based on the descriptions from his books. Voelker did many things to discourage them from finding it, including leaving debris in the road to the pond, although he did take some people with him to the pond. Frenchman's Pond is still owned by his daughter Grace and his grandson Adam.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, on April 30, 1936, Carothers {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences, a very high honor. Carothers was the first {{industrial}} organic chemist to receive this honor. Yet by June 1936, in spite of this honor which validated his contributions to science, Carothers could not shake the depression that prevented him from working. In early June he was admitted involuntarily to the Philadelphia Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, a prestigious mental hospital, where his psychiatrist was Dr. Kenneth Appel. One month later he was given permission to leave the institute to go <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tyrolean Alps with friends. The plan was for him to day hike with Dr. Roger Adams and Dr. John Flack for two weeks. After they left, he stayed on, hiking by himself, without sending word to anyone, even his wife. On September 14, he suddenly appeared at her desk at the Experimental Station. From that point on Carothers was not expected to perform any real work at the Experimental Station. He would often go in and visit. He began living in Whiskey Acres again, after his wife had agreed with Dr. Appel that she was not strong enough to watch over Carothers.|$|E
500|$|The Appalachian Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Pacific Crest Trail form what {{is known}} as the Triple Crown of long-distance <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.

500|$|<b>In</b> 1969 <b>the</b> Glens Natural Area {{was named}} a National Natural Landmark, {{and it became a}} Pennsylvania State Park Natural Area in 1993, which {{guarantees}} it [...] "will be protected and maintained in a natural state". In 1996 heavy rains washed out two bridges on the Falls Trail; because of the difficulty of transporting materials on the trail, an Army National Guard helicopter dropped 36-foot (11m) poles into the glens to rebuild <b>the</b> bridges <b>in</b> early 1997. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ganoga Glen section of the park for the first time. That same year local fire companies trained to rescue people injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them treacherous. In 1998 a four-year project to [...] "repair and improve the Falls Trail" [...] began, with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize the trail, fix steps, reduce erosion, and repair some bridges. In 2001, John Young <b>in</b> <b>Hike</b> Pennsylvania: An Atlas of Pennsylvania's Greatest Hiking Adventures wrote of the Falls Trail: [...] "This is not only <b>the</b> most magnificent <b>hike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, but it ranks up there with <b>the</b> top <b>hikes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East." [...] The readers of Backpacker magazine chose the Falls Trail as <b>the</b> best <b>hike</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania in 2009, and as one of <b>the</b> best <b>hikes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast <b>in</b> 2010.|$|R

500|$|There {{are over}} [...] of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park.

Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1920s, Marshall grew {{interested}} in promoting Adirondack recreation. In 1922, {{he became one}} of the charter members of the Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK), an organization devoted to the building and maintenance of trails and the teaching of <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park. In 1922, he prepared a 38-page guidebook, entitled The High Peaks of the Adirondacks. Based on his pioneering experiences on the peaks, the guide recommends that [...] "it's a great thing these days to leave civilization for a while and return to nature." [...] Marshall provided a brief description of each peak and arranged them in order of [...] "niceness of view and all around pleasure in view and climb." ...|$|E
50|$|Festivals and fairs {{are a part}} of the Pashtoon culture. The most {{important}} festivals are the two Eids (Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr).

30|$|We take {{advantage}} of a natural experiment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage setting in Russia to study the employment consequences of large <b>hikes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage. <b>In</b> September 2007, <b>the</b> Russian government raised the federal minimum wage from 1100 to 2300 Rubles and simultaneously gave the regions the power to set their own minima above <b>the</b> federal threshold. <b>In</b> studying <b>the</b> effect of this reform, we follow the approach proposed by David Card and compare changes in employment rates and other labor market outcomes before and after the hike across regions with different shares of affected workers. We find some evidence of adverse effects of <b>the</b> 2007 <b>hike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage on employment. They are mostly visible in lower employment rates among the youth, as well as the increased informalization of employment.|$|R
500|$|Five years later, in 1994, when Kostova was <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Appalachian Mountains {{with her}} husband, {{she had a}} {{flashback}} to those storytelling moments with her father and asked herself [...] "what if the father were spinning his Dracula tales to his entranced daughter and Dracula were listening in? What if Dracula were still alive?" [...] She immediately scratched out seven pages of notes into her writer's notebook. Two days later, she started work on the novel.

500|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two {{increased}} towards {{the latter half of}} the 1870s. In 1877, Marsh received a letter from Arthur Lakes, a schoolteacher in Golden, Colorado. Lakes had been <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains near the town of Morrison with his friend, H. C. Beckwith, looking for fossilized leaves in the Dakota sandstone. Instead, the pair found large bones embedded in the rock. Lakes wrote that the bones were [...] "apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some gigantic saurian." [...] While Lakes sent Marsh some 1,500 pounds of bone, he also sent Cope some of the specimens. Marsh published his finds first, and having been paid $100 for the finds Lakes wrote to Cope that the samples should be forwarded to Marsh. Cope was offended by the slight. Meanwhile, Cope received bones from school superintendent O.W. Lucas in March 1877 from Canon City; the remains were of a dinosaur even bigger than Lakes' that Marsh had described.|$|E
