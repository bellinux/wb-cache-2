As the year 3000 begins, Farnsworth hires the three as the crew of his ship. Fry inquires at what <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is,</b> and learns that he will be a delivery boy. Fry, ironically, cheers at his new job.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E

25|$|Following the openers is the No. 3 or one-drop batsman. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to {{take over}} from the openers and {{typically}} play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up {{one end of the}} batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batsmen find it difficult to settle down and it helps to have a settled batsman at the other end. The best batsman of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect him from the difficulties of batting against the best bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow him to play a long innings.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rest}} of the adults in town and a visiting {{television}} crew film a reenactment for America's Most Wanted, a tree falls on the power line causing the power to go out. All of the adults are now stuck in a building until the storm settles. The group hastily resort to cannibalism to survive. The power also goes out back at the hospital, and a plan is enacted to restore it. Dr. Doctor suggests that they split into two teams: team A, consisting of everyone in the room except Kenny, and team B, consisting of Kenny. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to reconnect the generator, while team A give advice to Kenny via walkie-talkie.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, {{most of whom are}} young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to treat patients and that beds must be allocated to the ones {{who are most likely to}} survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.|$|E
25|$|A stoic {{officer who}} had worked for a long time within SSSP. Although {{appearing}} as a human with short hair and glasses, he is in fact an alien in disguise. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to report to SSSP of any events and is usually dwelling around the Alien City for informations from police informant Jack. He has a rather strained relationship with Shinjiro, doubted if the youth is fit enough to become an Ultraman. He also views Ultraman nothing more as an enforcer-like figure that instantly killed his opponents, which is not shared by the boy. Moroboshi later dons his own Ultraman Suit and revealed his alien heritage to Shinjiro when they pursue Seiji Hokuto. His name is in fact based on Dan Moroboshi from Ultra Seven.|$|E

She feels shocked that society hides these injured soldiers away. During Sarah's experience, Prior is examined by a medical board. Prior fears that they suspect he is faking illness and want to send him back to war. While away, Rivers meets with some old friends, Ruth and Henry Head, who discuss Sassoon. Rivers suggests that Sassoon has the freedom to disagree with the war. However, Rivers affirms that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to make Sassoon return to military duty. At {{the end of their}} conversation Head offers Rivers a job in London, which Rivers is unsure if he should take out of fear of not fulfilling his duties.|$|E

25|$|Otto Grunf is a {{naturalized}} German-born inventor. He is {{a former}} Luftstreitkräfte mechanic who fought in the First World War, and he defected from the German army after his mechanical incompetence caused the airplane of the Red Baron to crash. He moved to America and changed his last name from Grunt to Grunf to avoid detection, and is mentioned to also serve in Second World War. He serves as the inventor, fabricator and the mechanic of the TNT group. Running gag in the series is his incompetence: he usually designs various Rube Goldberg machines that end up in failure, fails to properly service or change the vehicles or weaponry (driving a 1910s era car that usually explodes while attempting to start it or brandishing an 1880s revolver), or invents things that already exist (he claims to have invented the skateboard, which he named Skate-Grunf). Despite his heroic-like behavior and staunch belief in bravery (as seen by quotes stamped on his T-shirts), {{he is a very}} cowardly man, constantly running from danger. He usually dresses in a World War I-era flying ace uniform with goggles. He is very loyal and devoted to Number One and never is on his odds. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> usually to drive Number One around New York (in other words, push his wheelchair around).|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} batting in {{partnership}} {{becomes even more}} vital once only one recognised quality batsman remains. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> then to shepherd the tail-end batsmen, while attempting to eke out as many runs as possible, or simply to survive {{as long as possible}} when merely attempting to save the game. This usually involves attempting to minimise risk, by exposing the lesser batsmen to as little bowling as possible. To do this, boundaries and twos are preferred while singles are avoided in the early parts of an over (although this allows the fielding captain to set his field further back into a more defensive position, often tempting the batsman with an easy single) but because the bowling end changes {{at the end of an}} over, it is necessary to score a single (or much more rarely, three runs) to counteract this. While a single on the sixth and final ball of the over would be ideal, the field is usually set closer to make this harder and the batsman may prefer to rotate the strike on the fifth or even fourth ball, hoping that the tail-ender can survive for a delivery or two, rather than risking either having to take a dangerous run on the last ball (with the attendant risk of a run out) or not being able to get a single at all, leaving the tail-ender stranded on strike for the start of the next over (hence allowing up to six balls to be bowled at him).|$|E
500|$|The Earth-human {{head of the}} hospital's Psychology department, <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> {{to ensure}} that the hospital's diverse species work {{together}} as harmoniously, efficiently and safely as circumstances allow, and particularly to save the staff from being driven insane by over-use of Educator tapes. Since he is a very acute observer of behavior and often uses sarcasm [...] "to shrink heads, not swell them", he is sometimes called a [...] "latter-day Torquemada".|$|E
50|$|He {{ended his}} studies there in 1925 because he {{disagreed}} with his modernist oriented instructors. Instead, {{he was offered}} a teaching position there; <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to teach Marxist philosophy to artists.|$|R

500|$|The episode also {{features}} several callback references to previous episodes. Oscar saying [...] "Whazzup!" [...] {{serves as a}} reference to a scene from [...] "Pilot" [...] between Michael, Dwight, and Jim. Jim's description in his final talking head of <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> a direct quote from his first talking head in [...] "Pilot". Dwight hires Devon back after Creed quits, a reference to [...] "Halloween", when Creed convinced Michael to fire Devon. Pam sits at reception one final time and answers the phone, saying [...] "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam." [...] This is a reference to Pam's former role as office receptionist and a common phrase that she said during the early seasons. Pam's painting of the office building, introduced in [...] "Business School", plays a prominent role in the final scene.|$|E
500|$|Peter Capaldi {{was cast}} as the Twelfth Doctor in 2013, and made his first {{appearance}} in the 2013 Christmas special [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] (with an uncredited cameo appearance in the anniversary special [...] "The Day of the Doctor"). Capaldi's Doctor addresses this in the episode [...] "The Girl Who Died," [...] when the Doctor finally remembers that he shares a face with a man he was persuaded to save in Pompeii, despite his initial reluctance to alter that timeline. He surmises that he subconsciously chose this face for his current regeneration {{as a reminder that}} <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to save lives. [...] Capaldi also played John Frobisher throughout , the third series in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, although no similar connection has been made on-screen to this character.|$|E
500|$|Barton Fink uses several stylistic {{conventions}} {{to accentuate}} the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated {{many times in the}} film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to [...] "plumb the depths" [...] while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements– [...] combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence– [...] create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that [...] "the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling".|$|E

500|$|Milhouse's father, Kirk, gives {{a speech}} to the kids at Springfield Elementary about his {{occupation}} of assistant flyer distributor. Due to how boring the speech was, Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel take Lisa's advice and visit the Springfield Writer's Forum to find a better speaker. They find Jeff Jenkins, creator of a popular TV cartoon, Danger Dog. He comes to the school to give a presentation on Danger Dog, including showing them a sneak preview for the next Easter special, and fascinates the kids by telling them about the cartoon industry. Much to Skinner's horror, Jenkins tells the students how easy <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> and how he never needed to work hard to get his job. Later, every kid in school creates their own comic book, all of which are actually rip-off versions of Danger Dog. Bart also creates his own comic Danger Dude (which is actually a dog) and tries to sell it to Comic Book Guy, who criticizes his work. Stan Lee enters Comic Book Guy's store and tells Bart that his comic is bad, but that he should keep trying to [...] "find his own voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Ganatra, it was {{interesting}} watching Roshan Seth's and Carol Kane's conflicting acting styles. [...] "Seth comes from the British school of theater acting and believes that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to deliver a consistent performance. Kane comes from the American school, where improvisation rules and a certain performance may not be duplicated. Seth wanted lots of rehearsals; Kane thought too much practice would make her performance stale." [...] Nevertheless, the two actors very much enjoyed working together.|$|E
