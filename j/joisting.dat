5000|$|<b>Joists</b> {{can have}} {{different}} joints on either ends {{such as being}} tenoned on one end and lodged on the other end.A reduction in the under-side of cogged joist-ends may be square, sloped or curved. Typically <b>joists</b> do not tie the beams together, but sometimes they are pinned or designed to hold under tension. <b>Joists</b> {{on the ground floor}} were sometimes a pole (pole <b>joist,</b> half-round <b>joist,</b> log <b>joist.</b> A round timber with one flat surface) and in barns long <b>joists</b> were sometimes supported on a sleeper (a timber not joined to but supporting other beams). <b>Joists</b> left out of an area form an opening called a [...] "well" [...] as in a stairwell or chimney-well. The <b>joists</b> forming the well are the heading <b>joist</b> (header) and trimming <b>joist</b> (trimmer). Trimmers take the name of the feature such as hearth trimmer, stair trimmer, etc.|$|R
50|$|The floor <b>joist</b> framing layout looks {{similar to}} the ceiling <b>joist</b> layout. However, where the ceiling <b>joists</b> may consist of 2x6s, 2x8s, 2x10s and 2x12s, the floor <b>joist</b> layout will {{typically}} show 2x12 <b>joists</b> only. In some cases, where loads and spans dictate, and deeper floor <b>joist</b> system may be required. Deeper floor systems include wood I-joists and open web trusses.|$|R
5000|$|Without firecut <b>joists,</b> the burnt <b>joists</b> {{would fail}} and {{the ends of}} the <b>joists</b> would rotate as the <b>joist</b> {{deflected}} downwards. The rotation would damage the masonry wall at the connection point and possibly pull the wall inwards.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} design an OWSJ, engineers consider the <b>joist</b> span between bearing points, <b>joist</b> spacing, slope, live loads, dead loads, collateral loads, seismic loads, wind uplift, deflection criteria and maximum <b>joist</b> depth allowed. Many steel <b>joist</b> manufacturers supply economical load tables {{in order to}} allow designers to select the most efficient <b>joist</b> sizes for their projects.|$|R
5000|$|In {{traditional}} timber framing {{there may}} be a single set of <b>joists</b> which carry both a floor and ceiling called a single floor (single <b>joist</b> floor, single framed floor) or two sets of <b>joists,</b> one carrying the floor and another carrying the ceiling called a double floor (double framed floor). The term binding <b>joist</b> is sometimes used to describe beams at floor level running perpendicular to the ridge of a gable roof and joined to the intermediate posts. <b>Joists</b> which land on a binding <b>joist</b> are called bridging <b>joists.</b> A large beam in the ceiling of a room carrying <b>joists</b> is a summer beam. A ceiling <b>joist</b> may be installed flush with the bottom of the beam or sometimes below the beam. <b>Joists</b> left exposed and visible from below are called [...] "naked flooring" [...] or [...] "articulated" [...] (a modern U.S. term) and were typically planed smooth (wrought) and sometimes chamfered or beaded.|$|R
50|$|In {{the framing}} of a deck or building, a rim <b>joist</b> {{is the final}} <b>joist</b> that caps {{the end of the}} row of <b>joists</b> that support a floor or ceiling. A rim <b>joist</b> makes up the end of the box that {{comprises}} the floor system.|$|R
50|$|Stanley Macomber {{designed}} the open-web steel <b>joist</b> in 1921 {{while working for}} Massillon's Central Steel Company. Macomber left Central Steel and founded the Massillon Steel <b>Joist</b> Co. in 1923. His open-web steel <b>joist,</b> patented in 1924, {{was known as the}} Massillon Steel <b>Joist.</b> Macomber's invention was a revolutionary assembly of steel <b>joists</b> with a top slab used to support of floors, ceilings and roofs. The basis of Macomber's steel <b>joist</b> design is still used today. Stanley Macomber was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame in 2011.|$|R
50|$|<b>Joists</b> must {{exhibit the}} {{strength}} to support the anticipated load {{over a long period}} of time. In more developed countries such as the United States, the fabrication and installation of all framing members including <b>joists</b> must meet building code standards. Considering the cross section of a typical <b>joist,</b> the overall depth of the <b>joist</b> is critical in establishing a safe and stable floor or ceiling system. The wider the spacing between the <b>joists,</b> the deeper the <b>joist</b> will need to be to limit stress and deflection under load. Lateral support called dwang, blocking, or strutting increases its stability, preventing the <b>joist</b> from buckling under load. There are approved formulas for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden floor <b>joist</b> for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the <b>joist</b> depth required for a 14‑foot span is 9 inches. Many steel <b>joist</b> manufacturers supply load tables in order to allow designers to select the proper <b>joist</b> sizes for their projects.|$|R
50|$|The ceiling <b>joist</b> layout shows all of {{the ceiling}} <b>joists</b> over the rooms (typically over {{the second floor of}} a 2-story house, or over the first floor of a 1-story house). The size of the <b>joists</b> will vary {{depending}} on the spacing of the <b>joists,</b> as well as the span. Whether or not the <b>joists</b> are designed for attic storage loads will also affect the size of the members.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{dimensional}} lumber <b>joists</b> {{have their}} limitations {{due to the}} limits of what farmed lumber can provide. Engineered wood products such as I-joists gain strength from expanding the overall depth of the <b>joist,</b> as well as by providing high-quality engineered wood for both the bottom and the top chords of the <b>joist.</b> A common saying regarding structural design is that [...] "deeper is cheaper", referring to the more cost-effective design of a given structure by using deeper but more expensive <b>joists,</b> because fewer <b>joists</b> are needed and longer spans are achieved, which more than makes up for the added cost of deeper <b>joists.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Joists</b> {{are either}} made of wood, {{engineered}} wood, or steel, {{each of which}} have unique characteristics. Typically, wood <b>joists</b> have the cross section of a plank with the longer faces positioned vertically. However, engineered wood <b>joists</b> may have a cross section resembling the Roman capital letter [...] "I"; these <b>joists</b> {{are referred to as}} I-joists. Steel <b>joists</b> can take on various shapes, resembling the Roman capital letters [...] "C", [...] "I", [...] "L" [...] and [...] "S".|$|R
5000|$|The {{space between}} <b>joists</b> or rafters, a <b>joist</b> bay or rafter bay.|$|R
50|$|The CJ-Series <b>Joists</b> {{are capable}} of {{supporting}} larger floor or roof loadings due to the attachment of the concrete slab to the top chord of the composite <b>joist.</b> Shear connection between the concrete slab and steel <b>joist</b> is typically made by the welding of shear studs thru the steel deck to the underlying CJ-Series Composite Steel <b>Joist.</b>|$|R
50|$|Common {{mistakes}} made with installing I-joists include cutting or chiseling the flange, improperly sized <b>joist</b> hangers, improper nailing and wrong-sized nails. The rim <b>joist</b> depth must match the I-joist size. Mismatches can strain the <b>joist.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{building}} subfloor the <b>joists</b> {{must always}} {{bear on the}} ledge for all it support. The use of steel stap tie to connect opposite <b>joist</b> when {{the top of the}} <b>joists</b> and beam are flush.|$|R
50|$|KCS-Series <b>joists</b> (K-Series Constant Shear) are {{designed}} {{in accordance with}} the Standard Specification for K-Series <b>Joists.</b>|$|R
50|$|K-Series <b>Joists</b> are {{standardized}} regarding depths, spans, and load-carrying capacities. There are 63 separate designations in the Load Tables, representing <b>joist</b> depths from {{10 inches}} (254 mm) through 30 inches (762 mm) in 2 inch (51 mm) increments and spans through 60 feet (18,288 mm). Standard K-Series <b>Joists</b> have a 2 1/2 inch (64 mm) end bearing depth so that, {{regardless of the}} overall <b>joist</b> depths, {{the tops of the}} <b>joists</b> lie in the same plane. Seat depths deeper than 2 ½” (64 mm) can also be specified.|$|R
50|$|Shortened <b>joists</b> {{are said}} to be crippled. The term rim <b>joist</b> is rare before the 1940s in America; it forms the edge of a floor. The {{outermost}} <b>joist</b> in half timber construction may be of a more durable species than the interior <b>joists.</b> In a barn, loose poles above the drive floor are called a scaffold. Between the <b>joists,</b> the area called a joist-bay, and above the ceiling in some old houses is material called pugging, which was used to deaden sound, insulate, and resist the spread of fire.|$|R
40|$|Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) floor {{systems are}} {{generally}} made of conventional lipped channel section (LCS) <b>joists</b> and lined using fire resistive gypsum boards. Although {{the use of}} LSF floor systems has significantly increased {{in the construction of}} fire rated buildings, it is limited to those made of LCS <b>joists.</b> Since the fire resistance ratings (FRR) for steel sections other than LCS <b>joists</b> are not available, engineers are reluctant to use innovative steel <b>joists</b> in LSF floor systems exposed to fire conditions. To overcome these limitations, a new LSF floor system recently developed using a welded hollow flange channel (HFC) section as <b>joists</b> was investigated using both experimental and numerical studies under standard fire conditions. Both these studies demonstrated higher fire resistance ratings in comparison to those made of LCS <b>joists.</b> However, they were limited to one welded HFC <b>joist</b> section. Hence a detailed parametric study of LSF floor systems made of HFC <b>joists</b> was undertaken to investigate the effects of <b>joist</b> sizes and shapes, steel types and service openings on the FRR using the validated finite element models. This paper presents the details of this finite element analysis based parametric study and the load ratio versus time curves. These results can be used in designing the LSF floors made of HFC <b>joists</b> with varying sizes for different industry applications without the use of expensive fire tests...|$|R
50|$|In timber framing {{a single}} floor is a floor framed with single set of <b>joists.</b> A double floor is {{generally}} used for longer spans and <b>joists,</b> called bridging beams or <b>joists,</b> {{are supported by}} other beams called binding beams: the two layers of timbers providing the name double floor. In a double floor there may be two sets of <b>joists,</b> one for the floor above {{and one for the}} ceiling below.|$|R

5000|$|In light-frame construction, a trimmer is a timber {{or metal}} beam (<b>joist)</b> {{used to create}} an opening around a stairwell, skylight, chimney, and the like. Trimmers are {{installed}} parallel to the primary floor or ceiling <b>joists</b> and support headers, which run perpendicular to the primary <b>joists.</b>|$|R
40|$|Tests {{conducted}} on {{oriented strand board}} (OSB) webbed wood I-joists with web openings revealed that the typical failure mode was that the OSB fractured from tension zones around an opening, with cracks developing diagonally toward the <b>joist</b> flanges. The <b>joist</b> collapsed when the cracks reached the flanges. Finite-element models were developed using ABAQUS to simulate <b>joist</b> behavior. Material nonlinearity, crack propagation, and <b>joist</b> failure were dealt with by a user-defined subroutine. Good correlation was obtained between the test and the analytical results. The finite-element models were then used to investigate the effect of opening size and location {{on the behavior of}} <b>joists.</b> The lower bound and the upper bound of the load bearing capacity of <b>joists</b> with openings were found by finite- element modeling and were empirically expressed by polynomials...|$|R
5000|$|Floors in wood-frame {{homes are}} usually {{constructed}} with <b>joists</b> centered {{no more than}} 16 in apart, according to most building codes. Heavy floors, such as those made of stone, require more closely spaced <b>joists.</b> If the span between load-bearing walls is too long for <b>joists</b> to safely support, then a heavy crossbeam (thick or laminated wood, or a metal I-beam or H-beam) may be used. A [...] "subfloor" [...] of plywood or waferboard is then laid over the <b>joists.</b>|$|R
50|$|In floors {{supported}} by <b>joists,</b> utilities are {{run through the}} floor by drilling small holes through the <b>joists</b> to serve as conduits. Where the floor is over the basement or crawlspace, utilities may instead be run under the <b>joists,</b> making the installation less expensive. Also, ducts for air conditioning (central heating and cooling) are large and cannot cross through <b>joists</b> or beams; thus, ducts are typically {{at or near the}} plenum, or come directly from underneath (or from an attic).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Joists</b> may join {{to their}} {{supporting}} beams in many ways: <b>joists</b> resting {{on top of}} the supporting beams are said to be [...] "lodged"; dropped in using a butt cog joint (a type of lap joint), half-dovetail butt cog, or a half-dovetail lap joint. <b>Joists</b> may also be tenoned in during the raising with a soffit tenon or a tusk tenon (possibly with a housing). <b>Joists</b> can also be joined by being slipped into mortises after the beams are in place such as a chase mortise (pulley mortise), L-mortise, or [...] "short joist". Also, in some Dutch-American work, ground level <b>joists</b> are placed on a foundation and then a sill placed {{on top of the}} <b>joists</b> such as what timber frame builder Jack Sobon called an [...] "inverted sill" [...] or with a [...] "plank sill".|$|R
50|$|In {{architecture}} and in structural engineering, a <b>joist</b> {{is one of}} a series of horizontal members supporting a ceiling or floor. <b>Joists</b> are supported by foundations, wall framing, or beams. <b>Joists</b> are often laid out in repetitive patterns, much like the ribs of a human body. The intent of the use of this type of framing is to span over an open space below the members. When incorporated into a floor framing system, the <b>joists</b> also serve to provide stiffness to the subfloor sheathing, allowing it to function as a horizontal diaphragm. <b>Joists</b> are often doubled or tripled, placed side by side, where conditions warrant, such as where wall partitions require support.|$|R
50|$|Robb Engineering gained notoriety {{during the}} 1990s after being blamed as {{the maker of}} faulty open web steel <b>joists.</b> Poor welds {{weakened}} the <b>joists.</b> In some cases the roof <b>joists</b> have experienced catastrophic failure, resulting in at least 1 roof collapse. With the collapse of 3 <b>joists</b> in 3 separate buildings confirmed, an inspection of all governmental structures was conducted in eastern Canada surveying how many of Robb Engineering's <b>joists</b> were being used. Inspections costing into the millions of dollars, found that several thousand government buildings, in several provinces across eastern Canada, were involved. An unknown number of private buildings could also be involved, however no statistical information was recorded reflecting this data.|$|R

50|$|The {{upper floors}} with the {{exception}} of the toilet and service wet areas are made out of timber boarding supported on timber floor <b>joist.</b> Timber floorboards are thin horizontal structural members laid horizontally on the floor <b>joist</b> and joined to one another by the traditional tongue and groove method. The timber floor <b>joists</b> and floorboards used to be exposed and constitute the ceiling of the room below. The floorboards are now covered with concrete for fire safety reasons. The floor <b>joists</b> are beveled and moulded.|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled floor <b>joists</b> in LSF {{floor panels}} are {{protected}} by gypsum plasterboards and are subjected to a non-uniform temperature distribution across their cross-section in fires. Fire tests {{have shown that the}} failure of floor panels was governed by the section moment capacity of <b>joists</b> governed by local buckling effects. This research was aimed at developing simple design rules to predict the failure times (fire resistance) of LSF floors made of lipped channel section <b>joists</b> exposed to standard fires. The use of ambient temperature section modulus led to over-estimation of the moment capacity as the mechanical properties of steel varied across the <b>joist</b> cross-section while deteriorating with increasing <b>joist</b> temperatures in fires. New simplified fire design rules were proposed to determine the section moment capacities of <b>joists</b> at elevated temperatures based on the current cold-formed steel design specifications. Their accuracy was verified using finite element analysis and fire test results...|$|R
50|$|Given {{the absence}} of {{diagonal}} bracing or shear walls, {{the stability of the}} structure depends on the joints. In traditional houses transverse and longitudinal rigidity is achieved by passing the horizontal <b>joists</b> through the piles, in close proximity, one above the other. Wedges are used to lock the <b>joists</b> in position. Nowadays this labour-intensive technique is no longer used and <b>joists</b> are no longer passed through the piles; instead the <b>joists</b> consist of two identical beams that are placed to each side of the piles, to which they are fixed by screws or nails.|$|R
40|$|The uplift {{resistance}} of K-series open web steel <b>joist</b> seats {{was determined by}} physical testing of twenty-eight specimens to failure. The experimental data obtained from the physical testing was evaluated along with the mechanical properties of the steel material used in fabricating the <b>joist</b> seat test specimens. A simple analytical model was developed based on the experimental results using yield-line theory, which adequately predicts the ultimate uplift capacity of the <b>joist</b> seat. This ultimate strength model was modified to create simple AISC-ASD and AISC-LRFD design equations {{to be used in}} the analysis of K-series <b>joist</b> seats for uplift. Both the AISC-ASD and the AISC-LRFD design equations consider the following variables: <b>Joist</b> seat yield strength (nominally 50 ksi), anchorage weld length, seat length, and seat angle thickness...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{construction}} of masonry buildings, a fire cut or fireman's cut is a diagonal cut along {{the end of a}} <b>joist</b> or beam where it enters a masonry wall. If the <b>joist</b> burns through somewhere along its length, damage to the wall is prevented as the fire cut allows the <b>joist</b> to fail and leave the masonry wall standing.|$|R
40|$|The work herein {{presented}} {{is aimed}} to {{the estimation of}} the contribution of floor <b>joists</b> acting as an "equivalent beam" in RC buildings designed for gravity loads where the deck has often no beams in the direction parallel to the warping of the floor <b>joists.</b> Regarding this issue a simplified theoretical model has been preliminarily developed. This model accounts for the ratio between the torsional stiffness of transverse beams supporting the floor <b>joists</b> and the flexural stiffness of the floor <b>joists.</b> The relation obtained {{has been applied to}} compute the number of collaborating <b>joists</b> defining the equivalent beam for a sample of single-story and multi-storey buildings with different geometrical characteristics. Successively, by means of a wide comparison between the lateral stiffness of a structural model based on the "equivalent beam" and the 3 D structural model including all the <b>joists,</b> a correction factor is proposed to improve the accuracy of the formulation based on the simplified theoretical model...|$|R
