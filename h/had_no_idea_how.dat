5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E
5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders {{wondered if the}} company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company planned {{to use them to}} develop their first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to develop a video game at that time.|$|E

25|$|Schmeling {{spent the}} first three rounds using his jab, while sneaking his right cross behind his jab. Louis was stunned by his rival's style. In the fourth round, a {{snapping}} right landed on Louis' chin, and Louis {{was sent to the}} canvas {{for the first time in}} his twenty eight professional fights. As the fight progressed, stunned fans and critics alike watched Schmeling continue to use this style effectively, and Louis apparently <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to solve the puzzle.|$|E

25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio. He {{explained}} under interrogation that he had eloped with his girlfriend and denied that the handkerchief was his. He was administered a polygraph test, which he passed, and was later cleared. The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> it could possibly have ended up in Chicago and the presence of the handkerchief was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E
25|$|Cyberpunk {{themes are}} widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where cosplay is popular {{and not only}} {{teenagers}} display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's Neuromancer, whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although {{at the time of}} writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the mid 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.|$|E
25|$|The Carroll Brothers {{were also}} {{consultants}} {{to the many}} record companies who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to market hip hop music. Vincent Carroll, the magazine's creator-publisher, {{went on to become}} a huge source for marketing and promoting the culture of hip hop, starting Blow-Up Media, the first hip hop marketing firm with offices in NYC's Tribeca district. At the age of 21, Vincent employed a staff of 15 and assisted in launching some of the culture's biggest and brightest stars (the Fugees, Nelly, the Outzidaz, feat. Eminem and many more). Later other publications spawned up including: Hip Hop Connection, XXL, Scratch, The Source and Vibe. Many individual cities have also produced their own local hip hop newsletters, while hip hop magazines with national distribution are found in a few other countries. The 21st century also ushered in the rise of online media, and hip hop fan sites now offer comprehensive hip hop coverage on a daily basis.|$|E

25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, who was never one to know the full ins and outs of the music business, would have probably <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do not worry about the slaves; they are happy with their lot in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E
25|$|Asimov unsuccessfully {{tried to}} end the series with Second Foundation. However, because of the {{predicted}} thousand years until {{the rise of the}} next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, Asimov gave in after a 30-year hiatus, and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: Foundation's Edge. This was followed shortly thereafter by Foundation and Earth. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. However, this concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, It's Been a Good Life), he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to continue after Foundation and Earth, so he started writing the prequels.|$|E

25|$|Darkseid - The primary {{antagonist}} working {{behind the}} scenes of Zero Hour, he is first seen at the end of Happy Hour confronting the Joker, who is at that point presumed dead by everyone on the combined Marvel/DC reality in which the videos normally take place. In episode five part one of Zero Hour the scene featuring Darkseid's first appearance in the series was expanded, as part of the backstory to the events of the Zero Hour videos. He is at first shown to be unaware of his fictional nature, and is told of it by the Joker. Lex Luthor originally planned to trick the heroes into travelling to Apokolips to battle Darkseid as part of a plan to seize control of Stan's Place, the dimensional nexus which links seemingly all comic book universes within the videos, but scrapped the plan because Darkseid was unaware of his status as a fictional character and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> Darkseid would react if told the truth. Darkseid plans to use a device to 'reboot' the universe the videos take place in, intending to become the sole ruler of the 'new' reality and nearly succeeds, until Deadpool reveals that he is still in a world of fiction, as he is personally aware {{of the nature of the}} YouTube videos— and apparently aware of RandomGuy as well, as Darkseid is forcefed all of Deadpool's knowledge due to his ability to breach the fourth wall. As a result, Darkseid appears to suffer a mental breakdown and collapses. His current status within the universe of the videos after the end of Zero Hour is unknown.|$|E
