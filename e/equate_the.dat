5|$|Holm (1992) {{considers}} Egil's saga to <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> Kylfings {{with the}} Finnic Karelians. In the 14th century, when the Swedish kings began to direct their attention northwards and encourage Swedish colonization in Norrbotten, there were regulations that the Birkarls and the Saami peoples {{were not to}} be interrupted in their traditional activities. A large part of the Karelians were under Novgorod which was included in what Icelandic sources called Kylfingaland, and thus the Kylfings could have been Baltic Finnish tribes under Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{associate}} the boar and lion {{heads to the}} avatars Varaha and Narasimha, others associate with the Chaturvyuhas, however the latter is heavily disputed. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes the Chaturvyuhas - Vasudeva (Krishna), Samkarshana (Balarama), Pradyumna, Aniruddha - four manifestations of Vishnu. Though the text does not explicitly <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> two forms. Many modern indologists as well as Pancharatra followers associate both of them based on the association of Chaturvyuhas with gunas (qualities) in the Vishnudharmottara Purana and the Pancharatra texts. The gunas are in turn associated with Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The human face is Vasudeva, who symbolizes strength/power (bala); the lion is Samkarshana, who is knowledge/wisdom (jnana) personified; the demonic form is Pradyumna, who is prosperity/sovereignty (aishvarya) and the boar is Aniruddha, the Lord of energy (shakti).|$|E

25|$|Different {{theories}} {{regarding the}} number and ancestry of Sweyn's wives (or wife) have been advanced (see Sigrid the Haughty and Gunhild). But since Adam is the only source to <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> identity of Cnut's and Olof Skötkonung's mother, this is often seen as an error on Adam's part, and it is often assumed that Sweyn had two wives, the first being Cnut's mother, and the second being the former Queen of Sweden.

Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803.|$|E

Irish historian Thomas Keightley argued that the German kobold and the Scandinavian nis predate the Irish fairy and the Scottish brownie and influenced the beliefs in those entities, but American folklorist Richard Mercer Dorson has discounted this argument as reflecting Keightley's bias toward Gotho-Germanic ideas over Celtic ones.|$|E
25|$|Ontotheology {{means the}} {{ontology}} of God and/or {{the theology of}} being. While the term was first used by Immanuel Kant, it has only come into broader philosophical parlance with the significance it took for Martin Heidegger's later thought. While, for Heidegger, the term is used to critique the whole tradition of 'Western metaphysics', much recent scholarship has sought to question whether 'ontotheology' developed {{at a certain point}} in the metaphysical tradition, with many seeking to <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> development of 'ontotheological' thinking with the development of modernity, and Duns Scotus often being cited as the first 'ontotheologian'.|$|E
25|$|The Sangam {{literature}} Paṭṭiṉappālai, mentions Eelattu-unavu (food from Eelam). One of {{the prominent}} Sangam Tamil poets {{is known as}} Eelattu Poothanthevanar meaning Poothan-thevan (proper name) hailing from Eelam. (Akanaṉūṟu: 88, 231, 307; Kuṟuntokai: 189, 360, 343; Naṟṟiṇai: 88, 366) The Tamil inscriptions from the Pallava & Chola period dating from 9th century CE link the word with toddy, toddy tapper's quarters (Eelat-cheri), tax on toddy tapping (Eelap-poodchi), a class of toddy tappers (Eelath-chanran). Eelavar is a caste of toddy tappers found in the southern parts of Kerala. The Tamil lexicons Thivaakaram, Pingkalam and Choodaamani, dating from c. 8th century CE, <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> word with the Sinhala language and with gold. Eela-kaasu and Eela-karung-kaasu are refers to coinages found in the medieval inscriptions of Tamil Nadu.|$|E

25|$|Some {{authorities}} also <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> town named Menapia (or Manapia) as Wexford town – others {{place it}} further {{north along the}} east coast, roughly near Wicklow town. A river called the Modonnu(s), whose estuary is near Menapia, is often {{said to be the}} Slaney – others think it is the Avoka river. It is because the Slaney is the only major river in the south-east that many as a result think that it is the Modonnu(s) river, thereby making Menapia equal to Wexford town (this theory only seems to work if Hook Head is made the Sacred Cape). Most authorities seem to agree that Menapia is not Wexford, but is a town located further north along the coast. However, this is not certain.|$|E
25|$|However, most major-market 21st-century {{productions}} {{have taken}} a safe route, with revivals of familiar fare, such as Fiddler on the Roof, A Chorus Line, South Pacific, Gypsy, Hair, West Side Story and Grease, or with adaptations of other proven material, such as literature (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Wicked and Fun Home), hoping that the shows would have a built-in audience as a result. This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (The Producers, Spamalot, Hairspray, Legally Blonde, The Color Purple, Xanadu, Billy Elliot, Shrek, Waitress, and Groundhog Day). Some critics {{have argued that the}} reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as Mary Poppins and The Little Mermaid), <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.|$|E
25|$|Tibet {{was clearly}} {{subordinate}} to the Qing {{by the end of}} the 18th century. But with the arrival of the 19th century, especially with the weakening of the Qing dynasty itself in the later half of the 19th century, Qing authority over Tibet gradually weakened to the point of being minuscule, or merely symbolic. Chinese historians argue that the ambans presence was an expression of Chinese sovereignty, while those favouring Tibetan independence claims tend to <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> ambans with ambassadors. The relationship between Tibet and (Qing) China was that of patron and priest and was not based on the subordination of one to the other, according to the 13th Dalai Lama. (The 13th Dalai Lama was deposed in 1904, reinstated in 1908 and deposed again in 1910 by the Qing government, but these pronouncements were not taken seriously in Lhasa.) However, in the 1860s the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the Qing Empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the games}} were completed, very few media outlets gave it attention, believing the Game Boy was a dead console; {{a general lack of}} {{interest}} of merchandising convinced Tajiri that Nintendo would reject the games. The Pokémon games were not expected to do well, but sales steadily increased until the series found itself among Nintendo's top franchises. Rumors of a hidden Pokémon creature named Mew, which could only be obtained by exploiting programming errors, increased interest in the game. Tajiri had included Mew in the game in order to promote trading and interaction between players, but Nintendo was not aware of the creature upon release. The franchise helped Nintendo's waning sales. Tajiri deliberately toned down violence in his games. In this vein, he designed Pokémon creatures to faint rather than die upon their defeat, as he believed it was unhealthy for children to <b>equate</b> <b>the</b> concept of death with losing a game. After the completion and release of Red and Blue in Japan, Tajiri later worked on 1997's Bushi Seiryūden: Futari no Yūsha. Tajiri continues {{to be involved in the}} more modern Pokémon titles as well. In the most recent incarnations, he supervised the process from start to finish and approved all the text. While developing games, Tajiri works irregular hours, often laboring 24 hours at a time and resting 12 hours.|$|E

Tharoor's explanation that [...] "cattle class" [...] was a well-established phrase for economy class travel, and that it attacked the airlines and not the passengers, was ignored in the outcry.
