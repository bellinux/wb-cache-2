25|$|Limestone Lad, {{began the}} next season by making his debut in a <b>flat</b> <b>race,</b> {{finishing}} third in a two-mile maiden race at Navan and then finished second to the mare Liss A Paoraigh in the Lismullen Hurdle at the same track on 3 November. A week later he won the Brown Lad Hurdle again at Naas, leading {{all the way and}} winning by six lengths when conceding more than twenty pounds to his five opponents. Seven days later he attempted to record his second win in the Morgiana Hurdle and started third favourite behind Ned Kelly who was unbeaten in seven races over hurdles including the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle, and Youlneverwalkalone who had won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle in 2000. Limestone Lad led until overtaken by Ned Kelly at the second last but rallied to regain the lead on the running and won by half a length. On 7 December, the gelding, ridden by Paul Carberry won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle for the second time, making all the running to win from Liss A Paoraigh, Ned Kelly and Bannow Bay. After the race, Michael Bowe named the Stayer's Hurdle at Cheltenham as his horse's main target but said that he would consider a run in the Champion Hurdle if the ground was soft. He ran twice more {{before the end of the}} year, winning a minor event at Navan from the Willie Mullins-trained Catch Ball and then finishing second to Bannow Bay in the Christmas Hurdle.|$|E

500|$|The {{second meeting}} between Fantastic Light and Galileo was {{scheduled}} for the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September and was highly anticipated. This time Dettori rode Fantastic Light more positively {{as part of an}} agreed Godolphin plan, sending him past the Ballydoyle pacemaker to take the lead two furlongs out. Michael Kinane immediately brought Galileo to challenge and the two horses raced alongside each other {{all the way to the}} line. Galileo appeared to gain a slight advantage, but Fantastic Light, stayed on strongly under pressure to regain the lead and win by a head in a [...] "thrilling" [...] contest. The British Horseracing Authority described the event as [...] "one of the greatest races witnessed throughout the current decade", whilst readers of the Racing Post placed it seventh (the third highest for a <b>flat</b> <b>race)</b> in their list of the 100 Greatest Races.|$|E
2500|$|In January Limestone Lad won the Bank of Ireland Hurdle for {{the third}} time, beating Commanche Court by ten lengths whilst conceding sixteen pounds to the runner-up. Plans to contest the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham had to be {{abandoned}} after the gelding injured muscles in his back in a paddock accident later that month. Michael Bowen said [...] "I'm devastated that we might not make it. I'm sorry {{for all the people}} in the locality who have booked trips to the Festival". On 7 April, Limestone Lad returned in a two-mile <b>flat</b> <b>race</b> at the Curragh and finished third behind Ned Kelly and Beef or Salmon. Eighteen days later, he started 4/6 favourite for the Champion Stayers Hurdle at Punchestown. He took the lead from the start and drew away from his opponents from the fourth last to win by six lengths from the Ted Walsh-trained Bob Justice. On his final appearance of the season he finished second to Holy Orders in a <b>flat</b> <b>race</b> at Navan in May.|$|E

2500|$|Limestone Lad {{began his}} final season when he {{finished}} unplaced in a <b>flat</b> <b>race</b> at the Curragh in October. On 3 November he won the Lismullen Hurdle, reversing the previous year's form to beat Liss A Paoraigh by two lengths after leading from the start. Ten days later he confirmed his superiority over Liss A Paoraigh as he recorded his third win in the Morgiana Hurdle, beating the mare by eleven lengths. On 1 December Limestone Lad was matched against his old rival Ned Kelly {{as well as the}} Herald Champion Novice Hurdle winner Scottish Memories in the Hatton's Grace Hurdle. Ridden by Barry Geraghty, he led from the start, went clear of his rivals approaching the last and won the race for the third time, beating Scottish Memories by eight lengths despite being eased down in the closing stages. Two weeks later he won the Giltspur Scientific Hurdle at Navan, conceding fifteen pounds to Liss A Paoraigh and winning by six lengths. After the victory, which was loudly cheered by the crowd, Michael Bowe said that the horse was [...] "better than ever". On 26 December, Limestone Lad faced Bannow Bay again as he attempted to repeat his 1999 success in the Christmas Hurdle. Ridden by Carberry he made all the running, went clear at the second last and won by nine lengths from Boss Doyle, with Bannow Bay two and a half lengths back in third.|$|E
60|$|They were of {{different}} periods, some old, some newer. I {{put them together}} in series, as well as I could, {{by the nature of}} the surroundings. The most recent of all were my father's early attempts at instantaneous electric photography--the attempts which led up at last to his automatic machine, the acmegraph, that produced all unconsciously the picture of the murder. Some of these comparatively recent proofs represented men running and horses trotting: but the best of all, tied together with a bit of tape, clearly belonged to a single set, and must have been taken at the same time at an athletic meeting. There was one of a <b>flat</b> <b>race,</b> viewed from a little in front, with the limbs of the runners in seemingly ridiculous attitudes, so instantaneous and therefore so grotesquely rigid were they. There was another of a high jump, seen from one side at the very moment of clearing the pole, so that the figure poised solid in mid-air as motionless as a statue. And there was a third, equally successful, of a man throwing the hammer, in which the hammer, in the same way, seemed to hang suspended of itself like Mahomet's coffin between earth and heaven.|$|E
