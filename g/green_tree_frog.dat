5|$|The {{plant growth}} around the hammock base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks {{is an ideal}} habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and {{amphibians}} (such as the American <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> Hyla cinerea), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls (Strix varia), woodpeckers, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades minks (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi).|$|E
25|$|Reptiles include dugite (Pseudonaja affinis), the {{southern}} blind snake (Ramphotyphlops australis), king's skink (Egernia kingii), bobtail (Tiliqua rugosa), marbled gecko (Christinus marmoratus), west coast ctenotus (Ctenotus fallens) and Burton's legless lizard (Lialis burtonis). There are three species of frogs: the moaning frog (Heleioporus eyrei), the western <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Litoria moorei) and the sign-bearing froglet (Crinia insignifera).|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{species are}} of high priority {{as most of}} their habitats are in the Woronora Plateau: broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides), Littlejohn’s tree frog (Litoria littlejohni), spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), large-footed myotis (Myotis macropus), east-coast free-tailed bat (Mormopterus norfolkensis), <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Litoria caerulea), grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and the southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus). These species suffer {{from a variety of}} threats, chiefly habitat loss. The park is considered to be critical to the regional conservation of the beautiful firetail (Stagonopleura bella), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), Rosenberg’s goanna (Varanus rosenbergi), and the eastern three-lined skink (Bassiana duperreyi).|$|E

50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are little}} {{troubled by the}} {{presence}} of man and often live in close association with humans. They sometimes stray inside houses and are found in such places as sinks and toilets. They can also be found on outside windowsills at night, eating insects attracted to the light, and they may gather under outdoor lighting for the same reason. They sometimes occupy tanks (cisterns), downpipes (downspouts), and gutters, as these have high humidity and are usually cooler than the external environment. They may be drawn to the downpipes and tanks during the mating season because the fixtures amplify their calls. <b>Green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> seem to have homing abilities, being able to return to locations from which they were caught from a considerable distance after being displaced.|$|R

They are often found in the canopy of trees near water bodies but also occupy terrestrial habitats well away from water.
