60|$|A man, then, {{that must}} be {{eternally}} saved is to be considered, (a.) As an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> wrath. (b.) As an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> God. An <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> wrath he is in himself by sin; an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> God he is by grace through Christ. (Eph 2:3, Gal 4:7) Now, as an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> wrath he is redeemed, and as an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> God he is preserved; as an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> wrath he is redeemed by blood, and as an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> God he is preserved by this intercession. Christ by his death, then, puts me, I being reconciled to God thereby, into a justified state, and God accepts me to grace and favour through him. But this doth not hinder but that, all this notwithstanding, there re, that would frustrate me of the end to which I am designed by this reconciliation to God, by redemption through grace; and from the accomplishing of this design I am saved by the blessed intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ.|$|R

The decision came too late for Deering; he had died the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Dukedom was {{inherited}} only in {{the male}} line. As the 3rd Duke had three daughters but no son, the title became extinct.

In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius.

5|$|During the 1860s and 1870s Verdi paid great {{attention}} to his estate around Busseto, purchasing additional land, dealing with unsatisfactory (in one case, embezzling) stewards, installing irrigation, and coping with variable harvests and economic slumps. In 1867, both Verdi's father Carlo, {{with whom he had}} restored good relations, and his early patron and father-in-law Antonio Barezzi, died. Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo's great-niece Filomena Maria Verdi, then seven years old, as their own child.

5|$|In {{matters of}} character, Epaminondas was above reproach {{in the eyes}} of the ancient historians who {{recorded}} his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last <b>heirs</b> <b>of</b> the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.|$|E
5|$|It is {{essential}} that Shraddha be performed by the sonusually the eldestor male relative of the paternal branch of the family, limited to the preceding three generations. However, on Sarvapitri amavasya or matamaha, the daughter's son can offer Shraddha for the maternal side of his family if a male heir is absent in his mother's family. Some castes only perform the shraddha for one generation. Prior to performing the rite, the male should have experienced a sacred thread ceremony. Since the ceremony is considered inauspicious due to its association with death, the royal family of Kutch, the king or <b>heirs</b> <b>of</b> the throne are prohibited from conducting Shraddha.|$|E

5|$|Mehmed II and {{his successors}} {{continued}} to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until {{the demise of}} the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century following World War 1.

Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also considered themselves the <b>heirs</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{were further}} damaged by a schism between the Catholic West and Orthodox East {{that led to}} the Byzantine Greeks being labeled as heretics in the West.
