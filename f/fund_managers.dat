40|$|Using {{original}} survey {{data collected by}} the authors in 2005 we investigate the determinants of Turkish fund managers' performance {{as measured by the}} number of clients that a <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> has, the number of investment <b>funds</b> that the <b>manager</b> is responsible for {{and the size of the}} manager's portfolio. All three measures of Turkish <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> performance systematically vary with <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> characteristics.

40|$|We {{develop an}} optimal {{incentive}} {{contract for the}} <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> with career concerns. Drawing upon the framework of Gibbons and Murphy (1992), we restructure the performance of <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> with emphasis on the multiplicative effect of previous effort on the latter period, and derive the positive cross-period linkage of <b>fund</b> <b>manager’s</b> efforts. In particular, our study derives that a greater first-period’s effort by the <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> will induce more second-period effort and greater compensation in either fixed or variable (performance-related) portion of the payment. Though the total performance related pay might increase {{as the result of}} greater effort in the previous period, we show that the pay-performance sensitivity in the second period will decline. Moreover, the initial wealth increase will motivate the <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> to exert more effort and induce better performance, but decrease the pay-performance sensitivity in the second period.

25|$|The {{amount of}} time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies {{depending}} on the level of interest among investors, which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question. Firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily, often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds, or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest. Other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer, with managers of less popular fund types (such as US and European venture <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in the current climate) finding the fundraising process more tough. It is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital, although the majority of <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months.|$|E
