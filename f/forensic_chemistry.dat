500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advancements in <b>forensic</b> <b>chemistry</b> came in 1955 with the invention of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) by Fred McLafferty and Roland Gohlke. [...] The coupling of a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer allowed for the identification {{of a wide range of}} substances. [...] GC-MS analysis is widely considered the [...] "gold standard" [...] for forensic analysis due to its sensitivity and versatility along with its ability to quantify the amount of substance present. The increase in the sensitivity of instrumentation has advanced to the point that minute impurities within compounds can be detected potentially allowing investigators to trace chemicals to a specific batch and lot from a manufacturer.|$|E
500|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>chemistry</b> is the {{application}} of chemistry and its subfield, forensic toxicology, in a legal setting. [...] A forensic chemist can assist {{in the identification of}} unknown materials found at a crime scene. [...] Specialists in this field have a wide array of methods and instruments to help identify unknown substances. [...] These include high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thin layer chromatography. [...] The range of different methods is important due to the destructive nature of some instruments and the number of possible unknown substances that can be found at a scene. Forensic chemists prefer using nondestructive methods first, to preserve evidence and to determine which destructive methods will produce the best results.|$|E

500|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{performs the}} same function as liquid chromatography, {{but it is}} used for volatile mixtures. [...] In <b>forensic</b> <b>chemistry,</b> the most common GC instruments use mass spectrometry as their detector. [...] GC-MS {{can be used in}} investigations of arson, poisoning, and explosions to determine exactly what was used. [...] In theory, GC-MS instruments can detect substances whose concentrations are in the femtogram (...) range. [...] However, in practice, due to signal-to-noise ratios and other limiting factors, such as the age of the individual parts of the instrument, the practical detection limit for GC-MS is in the picogram (...) range. [...] GC-MS is also capable of quantifying the substances it detects; chemists can use this information to determine the effect the substance would have on an individual. [...] GC-MS instruments need around 1,000 times more of the substance to quantify the amount than they need simply to detect it; the limit of quantification is typically in the nanogram (...) range.|$|E
500|$|Throughout history, {{a variety}} of poisons {{have been used to}} commit murder, {{including}} arsenic, nightshade, hemlock, strychnine, and curare. [...] Until the early 19th century, there were no methods to accurately determine if a particular chemical was present, and poisoners were rarely punished for their crimes. [...] In 1836, one of the first major contributions to <b>forensic</b> <b>chemistry</b> was introduced by British chemist James Marsh. [...] He created the Marsh test for arsenic detection, which was subsequently used successfully in a murder trial. [...] It was also during this time that forensic toxicology began to be recognized as a distinct field. [...] Mathieu Orfila, the [...] "father of toxicology", made great advancements to the field during the early 19th century. [...] A pioneer in the development of forensic microscopy, Orfila contributed to the advancement of this method for the detection of blood and semen. [...] Orfila was also the first chemist to successfully classify different chemicals into categories such as corrosives, narcotics, and astringents.|$|E
500|$|The {{two main}} {{standalone}} spectroscopy techniques for <b>forensic</b> <b>chemistry</b> are FTIR and AA spectroscopy. [...] FTIR is a nondestructive process that uses infrared light {{to identify a}} substance. [...] The attenuated total reflectance sampling technique {{eliminates the need for}} substances to be prepared before analysis. [...] The combination of nondestructiveness and zero preparation makes ATR FTIR analysis a quick and easy first step in the analysis of unknown substances. [...] To facilitate the positive identification of the substance, FTIR instruments are loaded with databases that can be searched for known spectra that match the unknown's spectra. [...] FTIR analysis of mixtures, while not impossible, presents specific difficulties due to the cumulative nature of the response. [...] When analyzing an unknown that contains more than one substance, the resulting spectra will be a combination of the individual spectra of each component. [...] While common mixtures have known spectra on file, novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve, making FTIR an unacceptable means of identification. [...] However, the instrument can be used to determine the general chemical structures present, allowing forensic chemists to determine the best method for analysis with other instruments. [...] For example, a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3,030 and 2,950 wavenumbers (cm−1).|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} genetic instability and degradation in archived histology samples from cancerous tumors and to investigate the validity of short tandem repeat (STR) typing of these samples and its potential effect on human identification. Methods Two hundred and twenty eight slides of archival pathology tissues from 13 different types of malignant tumors were compared with healthy tissues from the same individuals. DNA analysis was performed using standard techniques for forensic STR analysis, PowerPlex® 16 and Identifiler® on 2 distinct sample sets. Genetic instability was assessed by comparing reference tissues with cancerous tissues derived from the same individual. Loss of heterozygosity, a ≥ 50 % reduction in heterozygosity ratio between healthy and diseased samples, and microsatellite instability, {{the presence of an}} additional allele not present in reference tissue, were assessed. The quality of profiles obtained with respect to completeness among the archived samples and degradation using the 2 platforms were also compared. Results Profiles obtained using the Identifiler® system were generally more complete, but showed 3 -fold higher levels of instability (86 %) than those obtained using PowerPlex ® 16 (27 %). Instances of genetic instability were distributed throughout all loci in both multiplex STR systems. Conclusion After having compared 2 widely used <b>forensic</b> <b>chemistries,</b> we suggest individual validation of each kit for use with samples likely to exhibit instability combined with fixation induced degradation or artifact. A “one size fits all” approach for interpretation of these samples among commercially available multiplexes is not recommended...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Today {{a number}} of {{applications}} in scientific fields (such as medical industry, astronomy, physics, <b>chemistry,</b> <b>forensics,</b> remote sensing, manufacturing, defense) rely upon images to store, display, and provide information about the world around us. The challenge to scientists, engineers and business people is to quickly extract valuable information from raw image data. The primary purpose of our work (within CRESCO Project) - i. e. converting images of a nuclear fusion plasma coming from the experiments (shots) of Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (FTU) into information by ENEA-GRID infrastructures – is related to such issue. In particular, we use IDL (Interactive Data Language) in order to quickly access image data and to process them.

A number of bone fragments included surface stains of various discolorations. The purpose of this interdisciplinary study combining a <b>forensic</b> anthropology- <b>chemistry</b> substrate was to determine which metal(s), if any, and under what circumstances may have caused the staining on the bone surfaces. To determine this, a Collision/Reaction Cell Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometry (CRC ICP-MS) method with microwave accelerated sample digestion was developed and validated for the quantification of metals in bone. The concentrations of Na, Mg, Al, K, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Sn, Ba, Pb and U in the stained bone samples were compared to concentrations in unstained bone fragments and sediment samples from the same contextual archaeological association. The sample analyses and comparisons showed that 14 of the 15 stained bone samples analyzed contained significantly higher concentrations of various metals. Of the seven metals readily available during Classical antiquity (Au, Cu, Ag, Pb, Sn, Fe and Hg), four were detected at significantly high concentrations (Cu, Sn, Fe and Pb) in some samples, Ag was tested for but not detected in any sample while Au and Hg were not tested for. The metals that occurred most often at significantly high concentrations were Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mg and Fe...|$|R
