25|$|A <b>genetic</b> <b>discrimination</b> is {{possible}} but difficult, {{since there are}} only a few genetic characteristics that differentiate dingoes from other domestic dogs. A couple of years ago, some scientists from the University of New South Wales developed a relatively reliable method with 20 genetic “fingerprints” using DNA from skin and blood samples to determine the “purity” of a dingo. If one of these “fingerprints” would be found, this would indicate that the examined dog is possibly a hybrid and not a “pure” dingo. The reference group for this test was a group of captive dingoes, thought to cover the whole range of the dingo population. Samples that lay outside of this range would be regarded as hybrids. With increasing development this method might be possible to use on hair and scat samples and provide more exact results.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of molecular markers {{is one of}} the most useful methods for molecular breeding and marker-based molecular associated selections. Even though there is less information on the reference genome, molecular markers are indispensable tools for determination of genetic variation and identification of species with high levels of accuracy and reproducibility. The demand for molecular approaches for marker-based breeding and <b>genetic</b> <b>discriminations</b> in Panax species has greatly increased in recent times and has been successfully applied for various purposes. However, owing to the existence of diverse molecular techniques and differences in their principles and applications, there should be careful consideration while selecting appropriate marker types. In this review, we outline the recent status of different molecular marker applications in ginseng research and industrial fields. In addition, we discuss the basic principles, requirements, and advantages and disadvantages of the most widely used molecular markers, including restriction fragment length polymorphism, random amplified polymorphic DNA, sequence tag sites, simple sequence repeats, and single nucleotide polymorphisms...|$|R

500|$|Testing {{before the}} onset of {{symptoms}} is a life-changing event and a very personal decision. The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions. Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested. Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment. A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result. Irrespective of the result, stress levels {{have been found to be}} lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result. Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected. Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it. In one study <b>genetic</b> <b>discrimination</b> was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations. [...] Genetic counseling in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process. Because of the implications of this test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington's.|$|E

50|$|Genetic {{testing is}} the {{analysis}} of human genes, proteins, and certain metabolites, in order to detect inherited disease-related propensities.

2500|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>discrimination</b> is discriminating on {{the basis}} of {{information}} obtained from an individual's genome. Genetic non-discrimination laws have been enacted in some US states and at the federal level, by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The GINA legislation prevents discrimination by health insurers and employers, but does not apply to life insurance or long-term care insurance. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 strengthened the GINA protections by prohibiting health insurance companies from denying coverage because of patient's [...] "pre-existing conditions" [...] and removing insurance issuers ability to adjust premium costs based on certain factors such as genetic diseases. Given the ethical concerns about pre-symptomatic genetic testing of minors, it is likely that personal genomics will first be applied to adults who can provide consent to undergo such testing, although genome sequencing is already proving valuable for children if any symptoms are present.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It {{is evident}} that human genetic {{variation}} is associated with many if not all human diseases including the more prevalent chronic diseases. As a result, genetics is becoming integrated into health care in all medical specialties, including oral medicine and its specialties. At the level of public health, genetic information will become increasingly important in research, policy, and program development. As application of genome technologies moves from the research laboratory to the clinical setting, a complex array of challenges will face dental clinicians {{in their efforts to}} use genetic information to improve health care and prevent disease on an individual, family, and community level. The broader social, ethical, and legal implications raised by the clinical use of genomic information have not received the same attention as did recent gene identification aspects of the Human Genome Project. The goal of this review is to foster attention and dialogue within the dental community of the ethical and social issues emerging from the availability of genetic information.

40|$|Access to life {{insurance}} {{is subject to}} health discrimination. Whether this discrimination should {{take into account the}} results of predictive genetic tests is a topic of public debate. This paper draws from the deliberations of the Edinburgh (Scotland) Citizens' Jury on Genetic Test Results and Life Insurance to evaluate the capacity of one participatory research method to inform debates on genetics and insurance. We show that through a process of knowledge-building, cross-examination and deliberation, 'lay' jurors are able to assimilate complex information, engage in subtle argument and arrive at well-reasoned, clearly warranted conclusions. The Citizens' Jury approach has a further key advantage: it embraces the formation and articulation of normative ideas. It brings public understandings of how things ought to be into an arena dominated by 'expert' opinion. These normative indicators, which in this case relate to fairness and trust, are often overlooked by policy makers. However, they are key to democratic decision-taking and relevant for health promotion. Citizens' Jury Life insurance Health <b>discrimination</b> <b>Genetic</b> testing Public policy...|$|R

We aimed to build clinically useful equations estimating the risk of later obesity in newborns, as a first step towards focused early prevention against the global obesity epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed the lifetime Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC 1986) (N = 4, 032) to draw predictive equations for childhood and adolescent obesity from traditional risk factors (parental BMI, birth weight, maternal gestational weight gain, behaviour and social indicators), and a genetic score built from 39 BMI/obesity-associated polymorphisms. We performed validation analyses in a retrospective cohort of 1, 503 Italian children and in a prospective cohort of 1, 032 U. S. children. RESULTS: In the NFBC 1986, the cumulative accuracy of traditional risk factors predicting childhood obesity, adolescent obesity, and childhood obesity persistent into adolescence was good: AUROC = 0 · 78 [0 · 74 - 0. 82], 0 · 75 [0 · 71 - 0 · 79] and 0 · 85 [0 · 80 - 0 · 90] respectively (all p 3 ̆c 0 · 001).

2500|$|Many of {{the risks}} {{associated}} with genetic testing involve the emotional, social, or financial consequences of the test results. People may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty about their results. The potential negative impact of genetic testing has led to an increasing recognition of a [...] "right not to know". In some cases, genetic testing creates tension within a family because the results can reveal information about other family members in addition to the person who is tested. The possibility of <b>genetic</b> <b>discrimination</b> in employment or insurance is also a concern. Some individuals avoid genetic testing out of fear it will affect their ability to purchase insurance or find a job. Health insurers do not currently require applicants for coverage to undergo genetic testing, and when insurers encounter genetic information, it is subject to the same confidentiality protections as any other sensitive health information. In the United States, the use of genetic information is governed by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) (see discussion below in the section on government regulation).|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} virulent Escherichia coli isolated from different poultry species and poultry farm workers using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) genotyping. Materials and Methods: Fecal swabs from different poultry species (n= 150) and poultry farm workers (n= 15) were analyzed for E. coli and screened for virulence genes (stx 1, stx 2, eaeA, and hlyA) by multiplex PCR. Virulent E. coli was serotyped based on their "O" antigen and then genotyped using ERIC-PCR. Results: A total of 134 E. coli isolates (122 / 150 from poultry and 12 / 15 from farm workers) were recovered. Virulence genes were detected in a total of 12 isolates. Serological typing of the 12 virulent E. coli revealed nine different serotypes (O 2, O 49, O 60, O 63, O 83, O 101, O 120, UT, and Rough). ERIC-PCR genotyping allowed discrimination of 12 virulent E. coli isolates into 11 ERIC-PCR genotypes. The numerical index of discrimination was 0. 999. Conclusion: Our findings provide information about the wide <b>genetic</b> diversity and <b>discrimination</b> of virulent E. coli in apparently healthy poultry and poultry farm workers of Andhra Pradesh (India) based on their genotype...|$|R

The telomeric border of LOH mapped to a 1 Mbp region of elevated recombination. Whole genome analysis of SNP data indicated that site-restricted LOH also occurred across multiple additional genomic locations. These data indicate that 11 q 21. 1 – 11 q 23. 3, and potentially other regions of this cell line are sites of intrinsic cell-specific instability leading to LOH after irradiation.

This thesis recorded the distribution of C. jejuni and C. coli isolates in a hospital environment during 1997 / 98. 105 clinical isolates of Campylobacter were examined using flaA and gmhA PCR-RFLP analysis. Isolates were collected from 84 patients who presented at Christchurch Public Hospital or from the South Canterbury region. Males accounted for 63. 1 % of the sample. The largest number of cases {{was reported in the}} age group 20 - 29 years. flaA specific primers were applied to all samples with 83. 8 % generating a 1. 7 kb amplicon. RFLP analysis using DdeI provided 17 different flaA profiles, with flaA 6 being the most common type identified in this study. 82. 9 % of the sample generated a distinguishable profile. This technique provided a D value of 92 % (D = Simpson's index of diversity). gmhA primers were also applied to this sample, with 71. 4 % generating either a 900 bp, 1. 6 kb or multiple band profile. 62. 9 % of the sample provided a distinguishable RFLP profile. gmhA 1 was the most commonly observed profile. This technique provided a D value of 74 %. When combining these two <b>genetic</b> markers, <b>discrimination</b> was increased. 59 % (n= 62) of the isolates had provided both flaA and gmhA profiles. These isolates were distributed into 22 different classifications. MLEE analysis was applied to the largest flaA group in an attempt to further assess relationships. This analysis allowed flaA 6 to be subdivided into a further five groups, therefore increasing strain discrimination. PCR-RFLP procedures were highly reproducible, robust, discriminative and rapid to perform. However 17. 1 % and 37. 1 % were untypeable by flaA and gmhA respectively. 20 environmental (sheep) isolates from Massey University were also examined using flaA and gmhA PCR-RFLP analysis. Four flaA types and two gmhA types were observed amongst these isolates. The flaA and gmhA types had been previously observed in the clinical isolates, therefore suggesting that no strain was specific to a particular environment.

40|$|Background: DNA barcoding {{is a novel}} {{method of}} species {{identification}} based on nucleotide diversity of conserved sequences. The establishment and refining of plant DNA barcoding systems is more challenging due to high genetic diversity among different species. Therefore, targeting the conserved nuclear transcribed regions would be more reliable for plant scientists to reveal <b>genetic</b> diversity, species <b>discrimination</b> and phylogeny. Methods: In this study, we amplified and sequenced the chloroplast DNA regions (matk+rbcl) of Solanum nigrum, Euphorbia helioscopia and Dalbergia sissoo to study the functional annotation, homology modeling and sequence analysis to allow a more efficient utilization of these sequences among different plant species. These three species represent three families; Solanaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae respectively. Biological sequence homology and divergence of amplified sequences was studied using Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST). Results: Both primers (matk+rbcl) showed good amplification in three species. The sequenced regions reveled conserved genome information for future identification of different medicinal plants belonging to these species. The amplified conserved barcodes revealed different levels of biological homology after sequence analysis. The results clearly showed {{that the use of}} these conserved DNA sequences as barcode primers would be an accurate way for species identification and discrimination.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on genetic privacy, especially since 1995 and the first proposal for national genetic privacy legislation. Since that time, a majority of states have passed some form of genetic privacy legislation, and efforts to pass federal legislation are ongoing. Such new laws, however, remain untested in the courts and their effects are unclear. If they fail to provide additional protections against discrimination for most people, their most significant impact may be {{in their ability to}} either diminish or enhance the power of genetic information and to influence the way individuals view themselves and others. How does “genetic exceptionalism”—the idea that genetic information is different from other types of medical information—relate to “genetic essentialism”—the idea that we are to a large extent shaped by our genes? Anthropological views on genetics and person-hood bring a new perspective to this ongoing debate. Implications for counseling practices are also explored.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus group {{includes}} antibiotic-resistant, opportunistic mycobacteria {{that are responsible}} for sporadic cases and outbreaks of cutaneous, pulmonary and disseminated infections. However, because of their close <b>genetic</b> relationships, accurate <b>discrimination</b> between the various strains of these mycobacteria remains difficult. In this report, we describe the development of a multispacer sequence typing (MST) analysis for the simultaneous identification and typing of M. abscessus mycobacteria. We also compared MST with the reference multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) typing method. RESULTS: Based on the M. abscessus CIP 104536 T genome, eight intergenic spacers were selected, PCR amplified and sequenced in 21 M. abscessus isolates and analysed in 48 available M. abscessus genomes. MST and MLSA grouped 37 M. abscessus organisms into 12 and nine types, respectively; four formerly "M. bolletii" organisms and M. abscessus M 139 into three and four types, respectively; and 27 formerly "M. massiliense" organisms grouped into nine and five types, respectively. The Hunter-Gaston index was off 0. 912 for MST and of 0. 903 for MLSA. The MST-derived tree was similar to that based on MLSA and rpoB gene sequencing and yielded three main clusters comprising each the type strain of the respective M. abscessus sub-species. Two isolates exhibited discordant MLSA- and rpoB gene sequence-derived position, one isolate exhibited discordant MST- and rpoB gene sequence-derived position and one isolate exhibited discordant MST- and MLSA-derived position. MST spacer n[degree sign] 2 sequencing alone allowed for the accurate identification of the different isolates at the sub-species level.
