Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|Originally titled [...] "A Matter of Breeding", {{director}} Corey Allen {{said the}} episode intended {{to move away}} from the [...] "squeaky clean" [...] plots of [...] [...] After the franchise's creator Gene Roddenberry banned disagreements between characters in The Next Generation, this became one of the main elements that the producers wanted to include in the new series. [...] In the episode, this was shown by O'Brien releasing Tosk, but originally, during the teaser segment at the beginning, it was intended to show dabo girl Miss Sarda [...] propositioning Commander Sisko. [...] "We had long conversations on that and ultimately came down on the conservative side, but we'd never even <b>had</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> conference on TNG", Allen explained. Executive producer Michael Piller wrote the episode with writer Jill Sherman Donner, who had previous credits on television shows such as Magnum P.I.|$|E
500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we really have a sister-brother thing going on. I've never <b>had</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E

500|$|Another common {{criticism}} of Wintour's editorship focuses on Vogues {{increasing use of}} celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a Vogue-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour {{is said to have}} personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von Fürstenberg. [...] "I don't think Vreeland <b>had</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> concentration," [...] says WWD publisher Patrick McCarthy. [...] "She wouldn't have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." [...] By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in Vogue but more general-interest magazines like People and Us, which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. [...] "The end result is that Anna can control {{it all the way to}} the selling floor," [...] says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for Vogue. All complied.|$|E

2500|$|Since his {{departure}} Greg {{has become an}} iconic villain on the soap. His romance with Caroline {{has been described as}} one of Shortland Streets most memorable couples. Writer, Rachel Lang, thought Balme was perfect for the role, stating:"I was at the bank and there was this guy over at the counter and I thought, 'ooh he looks dodgy', he <b>had</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> look about him, he's quite a chameleon." [...] A reviewer of the soap stated in 2000 that Greg should be brought back because he made the show addictive with his [...] "badboy" [...] ways. Balmes portrayal was so realistic, a pharmacist refused him service whilst he was on the show fearing he was drug seeking. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. His final scene with Caroline has been voted by fans as one of the show's most iconic moments.|$|E

There is hardly any major aspect of campaigning {{that does not}} engage their attention. For example, they assist in recruiting qualified candidates; they establish [...] "leadership PACs" [...] to raise and distribute funds to House candidates of their party; they try to persuade partisan colleagues not to retire or run for other offices so as to hold down the number of open seats the party would need to defend; they coordinate their campaign activities with congressional and national party campaign committees; they encourage outside groups to back their candidates; they travel {{around the country to}} speak on behalf of party candidates; and they encourage incumbent colleagues to make significant financial contributions to the party's campaign committee.

2500|$|In November, IGN held {{a second}} online chat with Zeschuk, Falkner, {{programmer}} Marc Audy, lead tester Karl Schreiner, and tester Derrick Collins. Zeschuk stated Sony had recently {{looked at the}} game and been very impressed; [...] "They felt the gameplay improvements we've made (overall better balancing and reworking parts of every level), combined with the difficulty levels and slick controls really make MDK2: Armageddon for PS2 the definitive version of the game." [...] Speaking of his earlier problems with video memory, Faulkner said [...] "the video memory situation has improved dramatically since last time. The problem {{was that there was}} too little video memory to fit all our textures, and the machine can't use a texture unless it's specifically in video memory. What we've found since then is that the PS2 has enough bus bandwidth to transfer each texture from main memory to video memory as it's needed. That's on the order of hundreds of MB per second. We hadn't anticipated that the PS2 <b>had</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> brute horsepower on its bus. We had to reorient our thinking after that. So now we have almost more texture memory than we know what to do with." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1948, Scott was {{reportedly}} divorced from Russian Prince Stass Reed. In 1953, Scott was briefly engaged to architect John C. Lindsey, {{who later became}} Diana Lynn's first husband before Mortimer Hall. Despite the Confidential article, Scott remained active on the Hollywood dating circuit, but the allegations continued to haunt her. A friend, David Patrick Columbia, noted: [...] "One night driving her home from a party we’d been to, she remarked apropos of nothing we’d been talking about, 'and you know David, I am not a lesbian.'" [...] Scott herself tended toward secrecy about her personal relationships and publicly disparaged former dates who told all to the press. Once their date appears in the press, [...] "...the man goes off [...] date list... 'I think,' said Miss Scott, 'that gentlemen don't tell.'" [...] In 1948, Burt Lancaster said of Scott: [...] "Becoming her close friend... is 'a long stretch at hard labor.'" [...] In the period between 1945 and the 1970s, the press reported Scott dating Van Johnson, James Mason, Helmut Dantine, plastic surgeon Gregory Pollock, Richard Quine, William Dozier, Philip Cochran, Herb Caen, Peter Lawford, Anson Bond of the clothing store chain family, Seymour Bayer of the pharmaceutical family, Marquess of Milford Haven, race-track owner Gerald [...] "Jerry" [...] Herzfeld, and Eddie Sutherland, among others. Burt Bacharach dated Scott during his breakup with Angie Dickinson. According to Bacharach: [...] "She personified what I love about a woman, which is not too feminine but a little bit masculine. Just the strength and the coolness and the separation from the frilly woman who is always touching you and wanting something... I think Diane Keaton <b>had</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> quality." ...|$|E

The youth with the little black moustache and the Greek, large eyes, was his mate, the conductor. This was their run, from Oristano to Nuoro--a course of ninety miles or more.
