40|$|AbstractThe gene {{encoding}} a chlorophyll d-binding light-harvesting protein, pcbA from Acaryochloris marina (now {{called as}} accessory Chlorophyll Binding Protein CBPII) {{marked with a}} His-tag was transformed into the genome of Synechocystis PCC 6803. Protein gel electrophoresis and western blotting confirmed that this foreign chlorophyll d-binding protein CBPII was expressed and integrated into the thylakoid membrane and bound with chlorophyll a, the only type of chlorophyll present in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Native electrophoresis suggested that CBPII interacts with photosystem II of Synechocystis PCC 6803. Surprisingly, spectral analyses showed that the phycobiliproteins were suppressed in the transformed Synechocystis pcbA+, with a lower ratio of phycobilins to chlorophyll a. These results {{suggest that there are}} competitive interactions between the external antenna system of phycobiliproteins and the <b>integral</b> <b>antenna</b> system of chlorophyll-bound protein complexes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} stabilization role of carotenoids in {{the formation}} of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes is investigated theoretically. The π–π stacking and CH-π interactions between β-carotenes and their surrounding chlorophylls (and/or aromatic residues) in Photosystem I (PS 1) from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus were studied by means of the supermolecular approach {{at the level of the}} second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation method. PS 1 features a core <b>integral</b> <b>antenna</b> system consisting of 22 β-carotenes intertwined with 90 chlorophyll molecules. The binding environments of all 22 β-carotenes were systematically analyzed. For 21 out of the 22 cases, one or more chlorophyll molecules exist within van der Waals’ contacts of the β-carotene molecule. The calculated strengths of π–π stacking interactions between the conjugated core of β-carotene and the aromatic tetrapyrrole rings of chlorophyll are substantial, ranging from − 3. 54 kcal/mol for the perpendicular-positioned BCR 4004 …CHL 1217 pair to − 16. 01 kcal/mol for the parallel-oriented BCR 4007 …CHL 1122 pair. A strong dependence of the π–π stacking interaction energies on the intermolecular configurations of the two interacting π-planes is observed. The parallel-oriented β-carotene and chlorophyll pair is energetically much more stable than the perpendicular-positioned pair. The larger the extent of π–π overlapping, the stronger the interaction strength. In many cases, the β-ring ends of β-carotene molecules are found to interact with the tetrapyrrole rings of chlorophyll via CH-π interactions. For the latter interactions, the calculated interaction strengths vary from − 7. 03 to − 11. 03 kcal/mol, depending on the intermolecular configuration. This work leads to the conclusion that π–π stacking and CH-π interactions between β-carotene and their surrounding chlorophylls and aromatic residues play an essential role in binding β-carotenes in PS 1 from S. elongatus. Consequently, the molecular basis of the structural stabilization function of carotenoids in formation of the photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes is established...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Fast {{integral}} equation algorithms {{such as the}} adaptive integral method (AIM) have been demonstrated to reduce memory and execution time associated with moment-method solutions for arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional (3 -D) geometries. In this paper, we examine the efficiency of AIM in modeling planar structures that contain small and intricate details {{as is the case}} with spirals and slot antennas. Such geometries require high tessellation due to the inclusion of very small features resulting in a large number of unknowns. AIM with its capability to translate the original grid to an equivalent sparser uniform grid is uniquely suited for the analysis of such geometries. In the latter part of the paper, we demonstrate the application of AIM in connection with a finite-element boundary-integral formulation for cavity-backed <b>antennas.</b> Index Terms—Adaptive <b>integral</b> method, <b>antennas,</b> fast <b>integral</b> equation solvers, scattering.

40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} problem of the symmetrical linear antenna driven by a two-wire line is presented. Then symmetrical linear antenna and the feeder line are treated as a unique boundary-value problem leading to a system of two simultaneous <b>integral</b> equations containing <b>antenna</b> and line currents as unknown sub-integral functions. The integral equations are approximately solved by the so-called point-matching method. Due to the mutual coupling between the antenna and the line, a new conveniently defined apparent driving-point admittance is to be introduced. The method is applied on several types of linear antennas: Centre driven symmetrical dipole antenna, Centre-driven V-antenna, Cage antenna, H-antenna and System of two parallel non-staggered dipoles antennas, positioned in the air over semi-conducting ground. Then theoretical results for admittances were compared with the experiments and remarkably good overall agreement has been found. On the contrary, a comparison with the corresponding theoretical results obtained with the idealized delta-function generator revealed remarkable discrepancies...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{contributions}} due to reflection, {{the determination of}} the turbulence refractive index structure constant may be affected. For pure scattering from turbulence in the inertial subrange, the radar echo power can be used to calculate the refractive index structure constant. The radar power is determined by a convolution <b>integral.</b> If the <b>antenna</b> beam is swung to sufficiently large off-zenith angles (12. 5 deg) so that a quasi-isotropic response from the tail ends of the Gaussian angular distribution can be anticipated, the evaluation of the convolution integral depends only on the known antenna pattern of the radar. This procedure, swinging the radar beam to attenuate the reflected component, may be called angular or direction filtering. The tilted antenna also may be pick up reflected components from near the zenith through the sidelobes. This can be tested by the evaluation of the correlation function. This method applies a time domain filtering of the intensity time series but needs a very careful selection of the high pass filters...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} of dielectric-covered slotted waveguide arrays are of great interest in many military and civil applications, because of their low-profile, high efficiency and high power handling capabilities. Regarding the efficient and accurate analysis of such <b>antennas,</b> <b>integral</b> equation (IE) based methods that utilize the method of moments (MoM) or a hybrid combination of MoM with an appropriate Green's function (referred to as MoM/Green's function technique) are widely used. For the hybrid MoM/Green's function technique, appropriate dyadic Green's function representations for the waveguide interior and the exterior stratified media are required. However, {{in the case of}} a cylindrically conformal dielectric-covered slotted waveguide array, which may be desired due to aerodynamic and/or radar cross section (RCS) concerns, the abovementioned IE-based analysis that utilize a hybrid MoM/Green's function technique becomes a greater challenge due to the difficulties in the evaluation of the entries of MoM impedance/admittance matrices, especially for the terms related to cylindrically stratified media. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a numerical and experimental {{analysis of a}} wire bow-tie antenna situated horizontally near a lossy ground. The antenna is basically an array of identical wire dipoles having a common feed point and equal angular separation between two neighboring wires. This antenna is par-ticularly suitable for ultrawide-band applications as it possesses a wideband property and allows a simple realization of resistive loading. It also provides a possibility to easily vary the antenna flare angle {{for the purpose of}} antenna matching or to adjust its footprint. In this work a theoretical model of the antenna is developed and verified experimentally. The wires are modeled as a tape-like structure by triangular patches and the antenna is analyzed using a mixed-potential integral equation formulation. Moreover, time-domain solutions are computed using the Fourier transformation, and a time-window technique is employed to calculate the antenna characteristic impedance. Using the model a comprehensive analysis of the antenna performance is carried out.

40|$|Abstract: The {{computation}} of exclusive QCD jet observables {{at higher}} orders requires {{a method for}} the subtraction of infrared singular configurations arising from multiple radiation of real partons. We present a subtraction scheme relevant for NNLO perturbative calculations in e + e − → jets. The building blocks of the scheme are antenna functions derived from the matrix elements for tree-level 1 → 3 and 1 → 4 and one-loop 1 → 3 processes. By construction, these building blocks have the correct infrared behaviour when one or two particles are unresolved. At the same time, their <b>integral</b> over the <b>antenna</b> phase space is straightforward. As {{an example of how}} to use the scheme we compute the NNLO contributions to the subleading colour QED-like contribution to e + e − → 3 jets. To illustrate the application of NNLO antenna subtraction for different colour structures, we construct the integrated forms of the subtraction terms needed for the five-parton and fourparton contributions to e + e − → 3 jets at NNLO in all colour factors, and show that their infrared poles cancel analytically with the infrared poles of the two-loop virtual correction to this observable...|$|R
