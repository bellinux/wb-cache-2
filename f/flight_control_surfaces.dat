5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. <b>Flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|They {{were also}} able to {{determine}} all of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> including the elevators, ailerons and rudder, were functioning properly {{at the point of}} the crash, and there were no faults in the flight control system. The flaps were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for take-off. The propeller blades of No. 4 engine on the far right side of the aircraftwere reversedminus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive pitch (also standard for take-off).|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} day in {{preparations}} for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The {{rest of the crew}} worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to run through a series of landing simulations.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1996, the NTSB {{issued a}} formal Safety Recommendation (A-96-120), which {{requested}} the FAA to require all airlines to provide simulator training for flight crews, which would {{enable them to}} recognize and recover from [...] "unusual attitudes and upset maneuvers, including upsets that occur while the aircraft is being <b>controlled</b> by automatic <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> systems, and unusual attitudes that result from <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> malfunctions and uncommanded <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> movements." ...|$|R
5|$|During {{test flights}} of the Su-27Ms, {{which began in}} 1988, {{engineers}} discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> at low speeds. The decision was therefore made to install thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country's Far East and was {{being used as a}} radar test bed. Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight cleared. Therefore the aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the pitch axis, and can deflect together or differentially.|$|E

50|$|In aviation, the {{maneuvering}} {{speed of}} an aircraft is an airspeed limitation {{selected by the}} designer of the aircraft. At speeds close to, and faster than, the maneuvering speed, full deflection of any <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> should not be attempted {{because of the risk}} of damage to the aircraft structure.|$|R
50|$|Grid fins (or lattice fins) are {{a type of}} <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> used on {{rockets and}} bombs, {{sometimes}} in place of more conventional <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as planar fins. They have been used since the 1970s in various Soviet ballistic missile designs such as the SS-12 Scaleboard, SS-20 Saber, SS-21 Scarab, SS-23 Spider, and SS-25 Sickle, {{as well as the}} N-1 (the intended rocket for the Soviet moon program).|$|R
50|$|An aileron (French for 'little wing' or 'fin') is a hinged <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> usually forming {{part of the}} {{trailing}} edge of each wing of a fixed-wing aircraft. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in roll (or movement around the aircraft's longitudinal axis), which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the lift vector. Movement around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'.|$|R
25|$|A {{conventional}} {{fixed-wing aircraft}} {{flight control system}} consists of <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.|$|E
25|$|Because the X-15 {{also had}} to be {{controlled}} {{in an environment where}} there was too little air for aerodynamic <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> it had a reaction control system (RCS) that used rocket thrusters. There were two different X-15 pilot control setups: one used three joysticks; the other, one joystick.|$|E
25|$|Airframe {{construction}} of the time was typically all-metal duraluminum with <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> covered with fabric. Favored engines were Jacobs, Wright and Pratt-Whitney in the 230 to 450 Horsepower range, per side. The one constant in the aviation industry {{at the time was}} escalating cost, which has continued to today.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{fly-by-wire}} {{systems can}} respond flexibly to changing aerodynamic conditions, by tailoring <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> movements so that aircraft response to control inputs {{is appropriate to}} flight conditions. Electronic systems require less maintenance, whereas mechanical and hydraulic systems require lubrication, tension adjustments, leak checks, fluid changes, etc. Placing circuitry between pilot and aircraft can enhance safety. For example, the control system can try to prevent a stall, or it can stop the pilot from over stressing the airframe.|$|R
40|$|Integration of {{propulsion}} and <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> {{systems will}} provide significant performance improvements for supersonic transport airplanes. Increased engine thrust and reduced fuel consumption {{can be obtained}} by controlling engine stall margin as a function of flight and engine operating conditions. Improved inlet pressure recovery and decreased inlet drag can result from inlet control system integration. Using propulsion system forces and moments to augment the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system and airplane stability can reduce the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and tail size, weight, and drag. Special control modes may also be desirable for minimizing community noise and for emergency procedures.

25|$|The flying boom is a rigid, {{telescoping}} {{tube with}} movable <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> that a boom operator on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into a receptacle {{on the receiving}} aircraft. All boom-equipped tankers (e.g. KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender) have a single boom, and can refuel one aircraft at a time with this mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 13 was {{the final}} full day in space for the STS-135 crew. They spent the day {{checking}} out Atlantis′s <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and hot-firing its reaction control system (RCS) jets, making sure everything was ready for deorbit. Mission managers cleared Atlantis for re-entry after reviewing results of the late inspection survey of the shuttle's heat shield, performed by the crew on the flight day 12.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the late}} {{inspection}} of Endeavours heat shield, the Mission Management Team officially cleared the orbiter for re-entry.

25|$|Later in the day, {{the crew}} {{finished}} their final preparations for Atlantis’s planned landing. Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley practiced landing procedures {{with a video}} game-like simulator, the Portable Inflight Landing Operations Trainer (PILOT). At 6:15 UTC, Ferguson, Hurley and Walheim powered {{up one of the}} APUs to conduct OPS-8 activities. This process verified the functionality of Atlantiss <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> actuating the rudder, speed brakes, wing and tail body flaps which guided the shuttle through the atmosphere.

25|$|The Alpha Jet {{is a light}} {{twin-engine}} aircraft equipped with an intentionally simple airframe despite the performance delivered. Both the leading edges and air intakes are fixed; while the aerodynamic shape of the aircraft, which was developed {{with the aid of}} computer aided design (CAD), conforms with the area rule. Fully powered controls are used, comprising a dual-hydraulic systems and load-factor limited dynamic feel system arrangement attached to conventional <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The cockpit is pressurised for greater comfort during training. The Alpha Jet is designed to accommodate ten-minute turn around times with minimal ground equipment, using features such as pressurised single-point refueling, ladder-less entering/egress of the cockpit, and a ten-hour endurance of the liquid oxygen system.|$|E
25|$|Drawing on {{experience}} from the Panavia Tornado, the AMX {{is equipped with}} a hybrid flight control system; a fly-by-wire control system is employed to operate <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> such as the spoilers, rudder and variable incidence tailplane, while the ailerons and elevators are actuated via a dual-redundant hydraulic system. Manual reversion is provided for the ailerons, elevator and rudder to allow the aircraft to be flown even in the event of complete hydraulic failure; either control system can act independent of one another. The wing is fitted with both leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps and overwing spoilers ahead of the flaps. The spoilers can function as airbrakes and to negate lift; improving take-off and landing performance as well as manoeuvrability during flight.|$|E
50|$|Maxaret, the world's first ABS braking system, {{was invented}} in Coventry by Dunlop in the early 1950s for aircraft; John Boyd Dunlop was a Scottish vet who had first {{produced}} the first pneumatic tyres in 1889. Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, grandson of Matthew Boulton, and born in the area, invented the aileron, an important <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> in 1868, decades before the first actual flight. Triumph Engineering was a famous motorbike firm in Meriden. About {{a quarter of all}} British WWI planes were built in Coventry. The Jensen Interceptor FF was the first production four-wheel-drive car in the world, designed by Major Tony Rolt, and built at their factory in West Bromwich.|$|R
40|$|Flutter {{testing is}} aimed at demonstrating that the {{aircraft}} flight envelope is flutter free.

25|$|Initially, the {{structure}} of the Hurricane's cantilever wing consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness. The wing was described by aviation publication Flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars, after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and rear spars. Hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the inner end of the wings. The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its leading edge. The majority of the <b>Flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as the Frise-type ailerons, also had fabric coverings.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{adopted an}} atypical tail-first configuration; this approach {{had the effect}} of greatly reducing trim-drag while also generating increased lift at slower speeds. Longitudinal control was provided by the nose-mounted tail plane via trailing edge elevators, lateral control was enacted by ailerons located on the wing's trailing edge, and directional control was achieved by a conventional rudder. All four of the primary <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were actutated by a quadruple-redundant electro-hydraulic control unit, designed by Boulton Paul. Fly-by-wire electrical controls and automatic control systems were also to be employed on the type. The undercarriage, designed by Dowty Group, used an arrangement of a single centre-fuselage main unit complete with four wheels, a nose unit with two wheels, and a pair of outriggers located on the engine nacelles.|$|E
25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> they {{have to take into account}} the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{throttle}} control laws {{to provide adequate}} flying qualities for <b>flight</b> path <b>control</b> {{in the event of}} a total loss of conventional <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> use was evaluated. The results are based on a simulation evaluation by transport research pilots of a B- 720 transport with visual display.

40|$|International audienceThis chapter aims {{to detect}} oscillatory {{failures}} affecting a <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> (FCS) –specifically an aileron– of an aircraft.

The chosen principle for diagnosis is based on testing the adequacy of available measures in a control system (CS) servo-loop toward its model. Two kinds of failures must be detected, which are identified as “liquid failure” and “solid failure” as a disturbing signal is superimposed on or replaces the control signal. The chapter tackles the problem of fault detection and isolation (FDI) by the test of standard deviation. This problem is treated by a correlation test between several residuals. The quantitative analysis of residues (rb(t), rs(t) and rl(t)) confirms visual study and shows how the recognition is automatically processed from a numerical point of view...|$|R
