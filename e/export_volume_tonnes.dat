Recent analysis finds that the real TWI exchange rate has a sizeable effect on export volumes; the low measured elasticity of <b>export</b> <b>volumes</b> needs to be considered in light of the large cyclical movements in the TWI exchange rate. We also find that export sectors respond differently to the same exchange rate movement, with <b>exports</b> of services <b>volumes</b> (which include tourism) more exchange rate sensitive than <b>export</b> <b>volumes</b> from the agricultural sector. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} suggests that import and <b>export</b> <b>volume</b> elasticities are markedly lower in oil-exporting Middle East and Central Asian countries than in non-oil countries in the region. A key implication of this finding is that a real appreciation of the exchange rate in oil-exporting countries would achieve little in terms of expenditure switching: an appreciation does not boost imports and non-oil exports constitute only a small share of GDP and total trade in these countries. Therefore, while a real appreciation lowers the current account surplus of oil-exporting countries through valuation effects, the contribution to lowering global imbalances may be more limited.
