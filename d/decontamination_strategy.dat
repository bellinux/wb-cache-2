40|$|More {{than two}} decades after its discovery, {{contaminant}} microbial DNA in PCR reagents continues to impact the sensitivity and integrity of broad-range PCR diagnostic techniques. This is particularly relevant to their use {{in the setting of}} human sepsis, where a successful diagnostic on blood samples needs to combine universal bacterial detection with sensitivity to 1 - 2 genome copies, because low levels of a broad range of bacteria are implicated. We investigated the efficacy of ethidium monoazide (EMA) and propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment as emerging methods for the decontamination of PCR reagents. Both treatments were able to inactivate contaminating microbial DNA but only at concentrations that considerably affected assay sensitivity. Increasing amplicon length improved EMA/PMA decontamination efficiency but at the cost of assay sensitivity. The same was true for UV exposure as an alternative <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategy,</b> likely due to damage sustained by oligonucleotide primers which were a significant source of contamination. However, a simple combination strategy with UV-treated PCR reagents paired with EMA-treated primers produced an assay capable of two genome copy detection and a < 5 % contamination rate. This <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategy</b> could have important utility in developing improved pan-bacterial assays for rapid diagnosis of low pathogen burden conditions such as in the blood of patients with suspected blood stream infection...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the decontamination problem in a hypercube network of size n. The nodes of the network {{are assumed to be}} contaminated {{and they have to be}} decontaminated by a sufficient number of agents. An agent is a mobile entity that asynchronously moves along the network links and decontaminates all the nodes it touches. A decontaminated node that is not occupied by an agent is re-contaminated if it has a contaminated neighbor. We consider some variations of the model based on the capabilities of mobile agents: locality, where the agents can only access local information; visibility, where they can “see” the state of their neighbors; and cloning, where they can create copies of them- selves. We also consider synchronicity as an alternative system requirement. For each model, we design a <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategy</b> and we make several observations. For agents with locality, our strategy is based on the use of a coordinator that leads the other agents. Our strategy results in an optimal number of agents, Theta(n/√ log n), and requires O(n log n) moves and O(n log n) time steps. For agents with visibility, we assume that the agents can move autonomously. In this setting, our <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategy</b> achieves an optimal time complexity (log n time steps), but the number of agents increases to n. Finally, we show that when the agents have the capability to clone combined with either visibility or synchronicity, we can reduce the move complexity—which becomes optimal— at the expense of an increase in the number of agents...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategies</b> in the special decontamination areas in Fukushima in regard to external radiation dose. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to relate the predicted external dose in the affected areas to the number of potential inhabitants and the land use in the areas. A comprehensive review of the costs of various decontamination methods was conducted as part of the analysis. The results indicate that aerial decontamination in the special decontamination areas in Fukushima would be effective for reducing the air dose rate to the target level {{in a short period of}} time in some but not all of the areas. In a standard scenario, analysis of cost and effectiveness suggests that decontamination costs for agricultural areas account for approximately 80 % of the total decontamination cost, of which approximately 60 % is associated with storage. In addition, the costs of decontamination per person per unit area are estimated to vary greatly. Appropriate selection of decontamination methods may significantly decrease decontamination costs, allowing more meaningful decontamination in terms of the limited budget. Our analysis can help in examining the prioritization of decontamination areas from the viewpoints of cost and effectiveness in reducing the external dose. <b>Decontamination</b> <b>strategies</b> should be determined according to air dose rates and future land-use plans...|$|R

Efficacy testing of decontamination products in a controlled environment is needed to ensure that effective methods are used to decontaminate domestic and workplace settings. An experimental room supplied with materials used in office furnishings (i. e., wood laminate, painted metal, and vinyl tile) was used with controlled dry aerosol releases of endospores of Bacillus atrophaeus (“Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger,” also referred to as BG), a Bacillus anthracis surrogate. Studies were performed using two test products, a foam decontaminant and chlorine dioxide gas. Surface samples were collected pre- and posttreatment with three sampling methods and analyzed by culture and quantitative PCR (QPCR). Additional aerosol releases with environmental background present on the surface materials were also conducted to determine if there was any interference with decontamination or sample analysis. Culture results indicated that 105 to 106 CFU per sample were present on surfaces before decontamination. After decontamination with the foam, no culturable B. atrophaeus spores were detected. After decontamination with chlorine dioxide gas, no culturable B. atrophaeus was detected in 24 of 27 samples (89 %). However, QPCR analysis showed that B. atrophaeus DNA was still present after decontamination with both methods. Environmental background material had no apparent effect on decontamination, but inhibition of the QPCR assay was observed.

The effect of pulsed light (PL) on surface decontamination (natural and inoculated microorganisms), physical (colour, texture and weight) and nutritional quality (ascorbic acid and major carotenoids) was investigated in red-ripe tomatoes during 15 days of storage at 20 • C. The application of PL treatments at fluences of 2. 68 and 5. 36 J/cm 2 reduced microbial loads during storage of whole tomatoes. One log 10 reduction on the microflora present in both skin and peduncle scar parts of the tomato was obtained with a fluence of 4 J/cm 2. Fluences of 2. 2 J/cm 2 allowed a 2. 3 log 10 reduction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inoculated onto the tomato surface. Softening, increased loss of weight, and wrinkles on the tomato surface appeared after 3 days on PL treated tomato fruit. Ascorbic acid levels remained unchanged during storage. Total lycopene, ␣-carotene and ␤-carotene contents and lycopene isomerisation percent were higher in tomato extracts prepared with fresh tomato fruit treated with a high PL dose of 30 J/cm 2.

40|$|Fluoride is a {{potentially}} toxic ion {{that occurs in}} aquifers both naturally {{and as a result}} of anthropogenic activity. Sometimes remediation of the aquifer is required. One potential aquifer <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategy</b> is an "interception-sorption trench"-one of a number of "reactive wall" technologies. This remediation strategy relies upon natural hydraulic gradients to transport the fluoride through the aquifer to the interception-sorption trench where it partitions onto a strong sorbent-alumina. In this paper, the focus is on the development and calibration of ail equilibrium-based geochemical model that will be employed in the development of a quantitative reactive transport model, which in turn will be used for the design of ail interception-sorption trench. The geochemical model described here takes into account a variety of ions likely to be present in a sandy aquifer, chemical activities, and the surface charge on the alumina. The model is calibrated over a wide pH range and for high initial fluoride concentrations using experimental results obtained from batch tests. It is found that pH dependent equilibrium constants are needed to capture the behavior of the experimentally observed fluoride sorption. The presence of sodium sulfate in Solution is investigated, and it is found that sodium significantly interferes with the sorption of fluoride onto alumina under alkaline conditions. The geochemical model indicates that under acidic conditions, the alumina may release potentially large and unacceptable concentrations of aluminum into the aquifer. As a way of managing this potential problem, it is proposed that aluminum concentrations in the pore fluid may be mitigated by the inclusion of tree bark within the interception-sorption trench...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Clostridium difficile is {{a global}} {{nosocomial}} pathogen associated with increased morbidity and mortality particularly {{with the emergence of}} the hypervirulent strains. C. difficile is ubiquitously present in the environment due to contamination by the excreta of humans and animals. In the hospital environment C. difficile can be isolated from about 30 % patients receiving antibiotics or those who are hospitalized. C. difficile spores are not only resistant to antibiotics, but they can also resist the harsh environmental conditions for longer times and thereby facilitate the spread of C. difficile infection (CDI). The primary mode of transmission of the disease is via the feco-oral route as symptomatic patients shed a large number of the pathogen resulting in contamination of the environmental surfaces. CDI occurs in patients with certain risk factors and who acquire the pathogen by ingestion or via contaminated equipments. In a hospital setting, outbreaks can occur in hospitals, nursing homes, and other extended-care facilities due to C. difficile. Therefore strategies to reduce the contamination of C. difficile in the environment will be of prime importance to every health care facility. In this review, the environmental reservoirs of C. difficile, the transmission and the risk factors of CDI are briefly described and the <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategies</b> for containing the pathogen are elaborated...|$|R

Recalls associated with chicken contamination are responsible for considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. Many decontamination steps are currently in place to {{reduce the likelihood of}} contaminated products reaching the consumer, but despite these safeguards, contamination events are still uncomfortably frequent. Irradiation is a safe and effective means of ensuring the safety of both ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat poultry but is not utilized in the United States. This is due, in part, to certain irradiation dose-dependent quality characteristic defects associated with irradiated chicken. Irradiation decreases the shelf life of poultry by increasing the rate of lipid oxidation leading to rancid off-flavors and off-odors and causes discoloration of the muscle tissue whereby the muscle appears pink even after cooking. These irradiation-induced defects, the capital costs associated with installing the equipment needed for irradiation treatments, along with a general reluctance on the part of U.

While the motors rapidly move in a contaminated solution, the adsorption of POPs efficiently takes place in a very short time. Characterization of the micromotors both from the materials and from the motion point of view was performed. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 5 -chloro- 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenol (triclosan) were chosen as model POPs and the removal of the contaminants was efficiently achieved. The rGO-coated micromotors demonstrated superior adsorbent properties with respect to their concomitant GO-coated micromotors, static rGO-coated particles and dynamic silica micromotors counterparts. The extent of decontamination was studied over the number of micromotors, whose magnetic properties were used for their collection from environmental samples. The adsorption properties were maintained for 4 cycles of micromotors reuse. The new rGO-coated SiO functional material-based micromotors showed outstanding capabilities towards the removal of POPs and their further disposition, opening up new possibilities for efficient environmental remediation of these hazardous compounds.

40|$|The aim in {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of a quaternary ammonium chloride (QAC) surfactant in reducing surface staphylococcal contamination in a routinely operating medical ward occupied by patients who had tested positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The QAC being tested is an antibacterial film that is sprayed onto a surface and can remain active for up to 8 h. A field experimental study was designed with the QAC plus daily hypochlorite cleaning as the experimental group and hypochlorite cleaning alone as the control group. The method of swabbing on moistened surfaces was used for sampling. It was found that 83 % and 77 % of the bedside surfaces of MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients respectively were contaminated with staphylococci at 08 : 00 hours, and that the staphylococcal concentrations increased by 80 % at 1200 h over a 4 -hour period with routine ward and clinical activities. Irrespective of the MRSA status of the patients, high-touch surfaces around the bed-units within the studied medical ward were heavily contaminated (ranged 1 to 276 cfu/cm 2 amongst the sites with positive culture) with staphylococcal bacteria including MRSA, despite the implementation of daily hypochlorite wiping. However, the contamination rate dropped significantly from 78 % to 11 % after the application of the QAC polymer.

GerAC, GerKC, and GerD were significantly less abundant in the membrane fractions obtained from superdormant spores than those derived from dormant spores. The amounts of YpeB, GerD, PrkC, GerAC, and GerKC recovered in membrane fractions decreased significantly during germination. Lipoproteins, as a protein class, decreased during spore germination, while YpeB appeared to be specifically degraded. Some protein abundance differences between membrane fractions of dormant and superdormant spores resemble protein changes that take place during germination, suggesting that the superdormant spore isolation procedure may have resulted in early, non-committal germination-associated changes. In addition to low levels of germinant receptor proteins, a deficiency in the GerD lipoprotein may contribute to heterogeneity of spore germination rates. Understandin...|$|R

However, over the past century, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi has warranted the investigation of alternative antimicrobials and <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategies.</b> Recently, a new class of antimicrobial has come into view and appears to offer promise in our ongoing defense against pathogenic microbes. These compounds, known as p-phenylene ethynylenes, fundamentally differ from traditional antibiotics in that they are “light-activated” and deal broad-spectrum damage in a detergent-like manner. Despite the promise of these compounds, there was—up until recently—good reason to believe that they were simply not suitable for use outside of the laboratory. A series of studies, described herein, was conducted to address these legitimate concerns. First, the compatibility of oligomers with surfactant was investigated, and found to confer numerous biocidal benefits. Similar oligomers were found to be sporicidal and fungicidal. Polymers were also investigated, and were found to be well-suited for attachment onto glass surfaces.

Analysis of the H 2 O 2 -mediated film dissolution processes via open circuit potentiometry, alpha counting and SEM/EDX imaging has shown that in near-neutral solutions of pH 6. 1 and at [H 2 O 2] 0. 1 mol dm(- 3) the uranium oxide film, again in analogy to common corrosion processes, behaves as if in a transpassive state and begins to dissolve. This transition from passive to transpassive behaviour in the effect of peroxide concentration on UO 2 films has not hitherto been observed or explored, either in terms of corrosion processes or otherwise. Through consideration of thermodynamic solubility product and complex formation constant data, we attribute the transition to the formation of soluble uranyl-peroxide complexes under mildly alkaline, high [H 2 O 2] conditions - a conclusion that has implications for the design of both acid minimal, metal ion oxidant-free <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategies</b> with low secondary waste arisings, and single step processes for spent nuclear fuel dissolution such as the Carbonate-based Oxidative Leaching (COL) process.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Farmácia (Química Farmacêutica e Terapêutica), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2015 The {{increasing}} awareness on {{the environmental}} problems, led to an increasing demand of “greener” processes in the several fields of science, focusing mainly in solvent-free processes. We find two good examples in both forensic toxicology and natural compounds extraction fields, where solvents are still widely used. In {{the last twenty years}} hair has gained great relevance as a toxicological sample, namely in the field of drugs of abuse. Although this matrix allows the detection of such compounds after weeks, months and even years (in same cases), it requires a precleaning step (decontamination) in order to ensure the absence of drugs at the hair surface. Despite the existence of several decontamination strategies, none ensures the absence of drug at the hair surface. On the other, in the field of the extraction of natural compounds, it has been observed a rising demand for more selective, environmentally friendly, and cheaper extraction techniques that can be industrially applied. In these contexts, the non-volatility of ionic liquids (ILs) makes them almost ideal systems for the sorption of compounds. In literature it is possible to find already some applications of these liquids, namely in the adsorption of dioxins. We hereby present the development of new technologies for the selective removal of volatile compounds, applied to forensic toxicology (hair testing, using ILs) and to natural aromas (essential oils, without using ILs). We started to apply the ILs to the decontamination of hair samples containing opiates at the surface. More than forty ILs were screened (100 ºC, 96 h) and the liquid 1 - ethanol- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [C 2 OHMIM][BF 4], showed very promising results (extraction efficiency > 80 %). In order to reduce the extraction time to less than 24 h, the process was optimized by means of Design of Experiment (DOE), and the final experimental conditions were 120 ºC, 16 h and a water content of 44 % (w/w). The method was then compared with Cairns method (a common and very time-consuming <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategy)</b> and the results showed that the developed method yielded, in average, slightly better results (% difference ~ 5 %). The method was then applied to both cocaine and cannabinoids. In the case of cocaine, the temperature led to the spontaneous hydrolysis of cocaine into its metabolite benzoylecgonine (BZE). Unfortunately, {{we were not able to}} remove BZE from the hair surface and no explanation for this phenomenon was found. As for the cannabinoids, the ILs screening revealed a great affinity to these compound (extraction efficiency > 90 %). Once more the liquid [C 2 OHMIM][BF 4] was chosen and the method was optimized for the cannabinoids extraction, and its final conditions were 100 ºC and 13 h. When compared with the Cairns decontamination, our method showed higher extraction efficiency. The developed decontamination procedure was then rationalized in order to fully understand the phenomenon. A three steps model was assumed: transport of the drugs to IL gas-liquid interface, adsorption onto the liquid free surface and absorption into the bulk liquid. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) experiments, as well as surface tension measurements were performed to evaluate the proposed model. The results confirmed that the water vapor enhances the transport of the drugs (due to solubilization). Additionally, using Kamlet-Taft parameters to characterize the polarity of ILs, we concluded that the cations with the highest acidity and lowest basicity parameters are the most efficient in the removal of the drugs from hair. The second part of the work involved the development of a new technology to selectively extract volatile compounds from botanicals. Using Eucalyptus globulus leafs as a model, a new extraction technique based on the vapor pressures was developed. In this particular case we found no need to use ILs. The method was optimized by mean of DOE and the optimum conditions were: 50 ºC, a nitrogen flow rate of 0. 15 l/min, during 2. 36 h. The vapor should be condensed at - 10 ºC. Under these conditions the extraction yield was of 6. 11 % (w/w). The method was further applied to both Lavandula dentata and Rosmarinus officinalis. The results showed not only the removal of the more volatile compounds (as expected), but also high extraction yields (7. 23 % and 4. 28 %, respectively).

40|$|A {{new kind}} of magnetically {{separable}} composite consisting of maghemite grains and cerium oxide nanocrystalline surface layer (CeO 2 /γ-Fe 2 O 3) was successfully used as so called “reactive sorbent” to decompose certain dangerous organophosphate compounds, including the organophosphorus pesticide parathion methyl and the chemical warfare agents soman and VX. The phosphatase-mimetic behaviour of the sorbent was also demonstrated. A reversed-mode co-precipitation of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + salts with aqueous ammonia was used to prepare the magnetite core, with the subsequent precipitation of cerous carbonate on the surfaces of the magnetite grains (again in the reversed mode) and its conversion to cerium oxide by calcination {{in the presence of}} air. The magnetite was converted to maghemite during calcination. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) confirmed the presence of the nanocrystalline layer of CeO 2 on the sorbent surface. The CeO 2 /γ-Fe 2 O 3 composite materials prepared at the optimum temperatures of 300 – 400 °C exhibited the highest degradation efficiency and simultaneously retained good magnetic properties. Very high degradation rates (reaction half-lives of approximately ten minutes or less) were achieved at ambient temperature, with the degree of conversion approaching 100 %. The facile separability of the sorbents using, for example, permanent magnets may enable their versatile use in various <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategies.</b> Web of Science 26275574...|$|R
30|$|Biological {{decontamination}} methods present possible {{advantages to}} chemical processes {{because they are}} less likely to be detrimental to the environment and are assumed to be more cost-effective (Guan et al. 2011). Methods involving the use of fungi that secrete non-selective, ligninolytic enzymes are among the most promising biological <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategies</b> studied thus far (Kim et al. 2017). Motomura et al. (2003) isolated an unidentified enzyme from Pleurotus ostreatus that reduced the fluorescence of AFB 1 and attributed this to the disruption of its lactone ring that plays an important role in carcinogenicity. Alberts et al. (2009) later showed that supernatant from P. ostreatus degraded AFB 1 by up to 76 % and that degradation efficiency was strongly correlated with the activity level of pure laccase. Wang et al. (2011) and Yehia (2014) used manganese peroxidases from Phanerochaete sordida and P. ostreatus, respectively, to degrade AFB 1 in ex situ experiments. In a microcosm study, Das et al. (2014) demonstrated enhanced degradation of AFB 1 in rice straw by P. ostreatus in the presence of certain surfactants and metal salts, and identified several potential breakdown products. Two strains of P. ostreatus were also used to degrade AFB 1 in a co-cultivation experiment with Aspergillus flavus on rice straw revealing that one strain demonstrated superior degradation efficiency (Das et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) affects 1020 of mechanically ventilated {{patients and}} {{is associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality and high costs. Early diagnosis is crucial for rapid appropriate antimicrobial therapy to be instituted, but debate remains as to the optimal diagnostic strategy. Noninvasive clinical-based diagnosis is rapid but {{may not be as}} accurate as invasive techniques. Increased use of biomarkers and advances in genomics and proteomics may help speed up diagnosis. Management of VAP relies principally on appropriate antimicrobial therapy, which should be selected according to individual patient factors, such as previous antibacterial therapy and length of hospitalization or mechanical ventilation, and local infection and resistance patterns. In addition, once bacterial culture and sensitivity results are available, broad-spectrum therapy should be de-escalated to provide a more specific, narrower-spectrum cover. Optimum duration of antibacterial therapy is difficult to define and should be tailored to clinical response. Biomarker levels may be useful to monitor response to therapy. With the high morbidity and mortality, prevention of VAP is important and several strategies have been shown to reduce the rates of VAP in mechanically ventilated patients, including using noninvasive ventilation where possible, and semi-recumbent positioning. Other potentially beneficial preventive techniques include subglottal suctioning, oral <b>decontamination</b> <b>strategies</b> and antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes, although further study is needed to confirm the cost effectiveness of these strategies. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

The aim {{of the current study}} was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} three nonthermal light technologies (NUV-Vis, continuous UV, and HILP) on their ability to inactivate Escherichia coli K 12 and Listeria innocua. E. coli K 12 was selected as a representative microorganism for the enterohaemorrhagic foodborne pathogen E. coli O 157 :H 7 and L. innocua as a surrogate microorganism for the common foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. The liquid matrix used for the disinfection experiments was a liquid matrix (MRD solution). The results of the present study show that the HILP treatment inactivated both E. coli and L. innocuamore rapidly and effectively than either continuous UV-C or NUV-vis treatment. With HILP at 2. 5 cm from the lamp, E. coli and L. innocua populations were reduced by 3. 07 and 3. 77 log 10 CFU/mL, respectively, after a 5 sec treatment time, and were shown to be below the limit of detection (< 0. 22 log 10 CFU/mL) following 30 sec exposure to HILP (106. 2 J/cm 2).

40|$|Dental-unit {{water systems}} (DUWS) harbor {{bacterial}} biofilms, which {{may serve as}} a haven for pathogens. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the microbial load of water from DUWS in general dental practices and the biofouling of DUWS tubing. Water and tube samples were taken from 55 dental surgeries in southwestern England. Contamination was determined by viable counts on environmentally selective, clinically selective, and pathogen-selective media, and biofouling was determined by using microscopic and image analysis techniques. Microbial loading ranged from 500 to 105 CFU · ml− 1; in 95 % of DUWS water samples, it exceeded European Union drinking water guidelines and in 83 % it exceeded American Dental Association DUWS standards. Among visible bacteria, 68 % were viable by BacLight staining, but only 5 % of this “viable by BacLight” fraction produced colonies on agar plates. Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., Candida spp., and Pseudomonas spp. were detected in one, five, two, and nine different surgeries, respectively. Presumptive oral streptococci and Fusobacterium spp. were detected in four and one surgeries, respectively, suggesting back siphonage and failure of antiretraction devices. Hepatitis B virus was never detected. <b>Decontamination</b> <b>strategies</b> (5 of 55 surgeries) significantly reduced biofilm coverage but significantly increased microbial numbers in the water phase (in both cases, P < 0. 05). Microbial loads were not significantly different in DUWS fed with soft, hard, deionized, or distilled water or in different DUWS (main, tank, or bottle fed). Microbiologically, no DUWS can be considered “cleaner” than others. DUWS deliver water to patients with microbial levels exceeding those considered safe for drinking water...|$|R
