The effect of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> on in vitro plant regeneration was studied and thereafter a suitable tissue culture protocol for 5 locally adapted Kenyan sweet potato cultivars Mugande, SPK 004, Kemb 10, Japon tresmesino and Zapallo established. Embryogenic calli was induced directly and indirectly from sweet potato leaf explants and auxiliary buds cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2, 4 -D (0, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg L - 1). Absisic acid was added to induce embryo maturation and when the hormone levels were reduced these embryos began to differentiate into shoots before whole plants were regenerated. For each treatment the number and days taken to form shoots, roots and plants that were regenerated were counted and used as a selection index of an efficient sweet potato regeneration protocol for the locally adaptable Kenyan cultivars. The test cultivar had a significant (p≤ 0. 05) effect on both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>embryogenesis.</b> The use of <b>indirect</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> was beneficial for the local Kenyan sweet potato cultivars as more calli formed hence ensuring higher plant regeneration and increased mass propagation of in vitro plants while direct embryogenesis took a shorter time to form shoots and roots but fewer plants were regenerated...|$|E

The seedlings formed somatic embryos and nonembryogenic and embryogenic callus {{in vitro}} {{in a time}} period of approximately two to three weeks. Embryogenesis and callus formation were monitored with respect to origin, structure, and development. Ten days after germination globular structures appeared in close vicinity of and on the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Somatic embryos formed either directly on the SAM region of the seedling or indirectly on embryogenic callus that developed at the SAM zone. Globular structures developed along the vascular tissue of the cotyledons as well, but only incidentally they formed embryos. Upon deterioration, the cotyledons formed callus. Regular subculture of the embryogenic callus gave rise to high numbers of somatic embryos. Such primary somatic embryos, grown on callus, originated from meristematic cell clusters located {{under the surface of}} the callus. Embryos at the globular and heart-shape stage were mostly hidden within the callus. Embryos at torpedo stage appeared at the surface of the callus because their axis elongated. Secondary somatic embryos frequently formed directly on primary ones.

40|$|Embryogenesis is a {{morphogenic process}} {{which leads to}} the {{production}} of a bipolar structure containing a root-shoot axis with a closed independent vascular system - the embryo. Three types of embryogenesis are considered based on the plant material from which the embryo derives: zygotic (zygote), somatic (somatic tissues) and gametic (microspores and ovules). Somatic and gametic embryogenesis to be considered as "true-to-type" should mimic the embryonic developmental stages of zygotic embryogenesis. Although real suspensor-like cells are often not present in somatic embryogenesis, the similarity between zygotic and somatic embryogenesis is remarkable from the globular to the early cotyledon stages. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro, in callus, cell suspension cultures, and protoplast cultures (<b>indirect</b> <b>embryogenesis),</b> or directly from cells of organized structures such as leaves or zygotic embryos (direct embryogenesis). As an approach for plantlet regeneration, somatic embryogenesis has several advantages over organogenesis providing useful systems to obtain large-scale clonal propagation and artificial seeds, and for clonal propagation of transgenic plants. For these reasons, the control of plant regeneration by somatic is, at present, one of the major goals of agrobiotechnology. The lack of knowledge of the factors controlling somatic embryogenesis, the asynchrony of somatic embryo development, and low true-to-type embryonic efficiency, are responsible for its reduced commercial application and, they simultaneously, have been the driving force of the fundamental research studies performed in the last decades. Although some basic knowledge of the process of somatic embryogenesis in dicotyledonous species has been achieved through the Daucus carota experimental model system, knowledge of the factors responsible for inducing the process and the meaning of embryogenic competence is still lacking. The complexity of the process and the lack of a good experimental model system are frequently suggested as being responsible for the lack of progress achieved [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

However, later several cercals and forage grasses have been successfully regenerated from tissue culture yet lack of multiplication procedures have long been a serious problem in sugarcane breeding programme. Moreover, in Pakistan, environmental conditions do not favour flower production in sugarcane, hence variability resulting from sexual crossing mayor may not provide sufficient room to permit greater chanees of improvement in important characters of the crop. However. for such crop. for the last 30 years, occurrence of uncontrolled variation during in vitro callus regeneration i. e., somaclonal variations proved to be quite promising. Therefore. in the present study, attempts were made to develop protocols for the induction of somaclonal variation through callogenesis, organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis in sugarcane. Later on, such somaclonal variants were characterized on the basis of morphological. biochemical and molecular markers. Present study highlighted the response of different explants i. e., apical meristem, pith parenchyma and young innermost Leaves for callus formation. Among them, young leaf explants showed more capability to initiate and proliferate callus. Role of various concentrations of 2, 4 -D supplemented in MS medium was also optimized. For all ex plants most of the callus formation took place at 3. 0 mg/I. Effect of kinetin and 2, 4 -D for call 1 ls initiation was also cheeked. No role of kinetin for callus induction alone or in combination with 2, 4 - 0 was found. Attempts were also made to optimize the temperature and light/dark conditions for callus formation. The optimum temperature for callus growth was observed to be the 28 Â°C Dark conditions were round best for callus initiation and proliferation. However. maximum regeneration was achieved in light condition. In the present study, attempts were also made to regenerate plants through direct and <b>indirect</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis.</b> MS medium supplemented with 1. 52. 0 mg/I 2, 4 -D and 200 mg/I casein hydrolysate was found the best medium for direct somatic embryogenesis.

40|$|Protocols {{for direct}} and <b>indirect</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis</b> from aerial stem explants of ginger have been developed. Aerial stem explants of two ginger {{varieties}} were cultured on different concentrations of 2, 4 -D induced callus. An in vitro aerial stem produced hard, nodular and yellowish callus (Type I) and an in planta aerial stem {{gave rise to}} soft, sticky callus with pale white color (Type II). The proliferated Type II calli were subject to stress for 40 – 60 days without subculturing. The desiccated calli produced white friable calli which turned embryogenic and then produced somatic embryos in a medium containing 2 mg L– 1 benzyl amino purine. The mature, club-shaped somatic embryos were germinated on a medium containing benzyl amino purine and a – naphthalene acetic acid in different concentrations. Type I callus of neither variety turned embryogenic but produced roots in all the cultures. Direct somatic embryogenesis was observed from the in planta aerial stem and leaf base explants {{with the use of}} thidiazuron alone or in combination with indole, 3 -butyric acid.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundYacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) is a {{root crop}} {{native to the}} Andean region. Low sexual {{reproductive}} capacity is a major constraint facing the genetic breeding of this crop. Biotechnological techniques offer alternative ways to widen genetic variability. We investigated somaclonal variation in regenerants of yacon derived from in vitro somatic embryogenesis using simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis and flow cytometry. ResultsTwenty tested ISSR primers provided a total of 7848 bands in 60 in vitro regenerants and control plant. The number of bands for each primer varied from 3 to 10, and an average of 6. 95 bands was obtained per ISSR primer. Eight primers were polymorphic and generated 10 polymorphic bands with 7. 19 % mean polymorphism. ISSR analysis revealed genetic variability in 6 plants under study. These regenerants had Jaccard's distances 0. 104, 0. 020, 0. 040, 0. 106, 0. 163 and 0. 040. Flow cytometric analysis did not reveal changes of relative nuclear DNA content in regenerants suggesting that the plants obtained via somatic embryogenesis had maintained stable octoploid levels.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{direct and}} indirect formation of somatic embryogenesis in Brassica oleracea var. botrytis (cauliflower), a very important vegetable crop worldwide. Direct somatic embryogenesis, which is rather rare, was achieved in culture of 2 -week-old hypocotyl explants of Brassica oleracea var. botrytis On MS medium supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 0. 5; 1. 0; and 1. 5 mg/l kinetin. Initial induction of embryogenic callus was achieved on MS supplemented with very low concentrations of 2, 4 -D (0. 05 mg/l and 0. 1 mg/l). <b>Indirect</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis</b> from leaf sections was obtained on MS supplemented with 0. 05 or 0. 1 mg/l 2, 4 -D. We examined various stages of somatic embryos (globular, heart, torpedo, cotyledonary). More embryos per explant were produced through the indirect pathway (23 - 25) than through the direct pathway (14 - 19). The number of embryos produced was nigh. There is a potential for recurrent, repeated or secondary somatic embryogenesis, possibly an unlimited source for mass propagation and ideal for synthetic seed production in this species.

30|$|Of all the B. oleracea vegetables, {{cauliflower}} {{seems to}} be the least amenable to genetic transformation. It is particularly troublesome due to its economic importance. B. oleracea var. botrytis is grown in nearly 100 countries worldwide and suffers from the lack of disease and pest tolerance, and in consequence from decreasing quality and crop yield. Cauliflower is known to contain high amounts of vitamins C, K, A and B 9, fiber and flavonoids, which results in its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and anticancer activities (Metwali and Al-Maghrabi 2012). Similarly to other Brassica plants, cauliflower was regenerated under in vitro conditions via different pathways and from different explants: direct and <b>indirect</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis</b> from hypocotyl and leaf explants (Leroy et al. 2000; Siong et al. 2011) or organogenic shoot regeneration from hypocotyl, cotyledon or root explants (Pavlović et al. 2010). Like in the case of other cole crops, organogenesis is the most popular method for the cauliflower tissue culture (Shahid et al. 2010). Requirements for the cauliflower tissue culture are simple, but strongly diverse. The literature data suggest that the hypocotyl of cauliflower {{seems to be}} an explant of choice for the studies on regeneration, pointing at its amenability to in vitro handling (Brown and Wang 2004).|$|R

Using tissue blot immunoassay to determine the presence of SCYLV, leaf samples of sugarcane variety N 32 taken from a propagation plot at Mount Edgecombe all tested positive. In this study, two methods of tissue culture were used {{in an attempt to}} eradicate SCYLV from N 32. In the first method, meristems were excised and cultured on a medium containing 1 mg kinetin/litre, which caused the direct production of shoots (organogenesis). Although a moderate number of shoots were produced from the cultured meristems, the virus remained. The second method involved culturing immature leaf-roll discs on media containing 0. 6 and 3 mg 2, 4 -D/litre for the production of callus (<b>indirect</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis).</b> An average of 58. 8 plants per stalk were produced from discs cultured on the medium containing 0. 6 mg 2, 4 -D/litre, whereas 31. 5 plants per stalk were produced from the medium containing 3 mg 2, 4 -D/litre. Of the 202 plants regenerated, one plant tested positive for SCYLV.

Studies to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates in somatic embryogenesis were conducted using calli from 'Ponkan' mandarin (Citrus reticulata, Blanco), 'Cravo' mandarin (C. reticulata), 'Itaboraí' sweet orange (C. sinensis L. Osbeck.), 'Valencia' sweet orange (C. sinensis) and 'Kinnow' mandarin (C. nobilis Loureiro x C. deliciosa Tenore). The culture medium used was MT supplemented with sucrose, galactose, glucose, maltose or lactose with the following concentrations of 18, 37, 75, 110, and 150 mM. The culture medium used for the maturation of somatic embryos had 0, 15, 29, 44, 58 and 73 mM of sucrose, in presence or absence of 0. 5 g L - 1 of activated charcoal. Seventy-three mM of sucrose with 0. 1 mg L - 1 of GA 3 in the presence or absence 0. 5 g L - 1 of activated charcoal was also tested.

The composition and distribution of n-alkanes in flax tissues collected at different developmental stages were studied by GC and GC-MS. During induction and development of callus from hypocotyl tissues {{a decrease in the}} percentage of total lipids was observed. In all types of tissue sampled - hypocotyl segments used as primary explants, hypocotyl segments with differentiating calli at the cut ends, embryogenic and non-embryogenic calli and somatic embryos - a skewed-normal distribution of n-alkanes with a low mass range (C 13 -C 21) were found. The highest content of n-alkanes occurred in the primary hypocotyl explants and {{in the early stages of}} callus development. Longer carbon chain n-alkanes were observed only in the mature or differentiated tissues of hypocotyls and somatic embryos. Although the n-alkane contents decreased with time, in somatic embryos and calli, a significantly lower n-alkane content was observed in embryogenic calli when compared to non-embryogenic calli independent of the time in culture.
