40|$|Calotropis procera Ã uma planta laticÃfera, pertencente Ã famÃlia Apocynaceae. ProteÃnas de defesa foram descritas no lÃtex com atividade contra insetos fitÃfagos e fungos fitopatogÃnicos. A fraÃÃo proteica do lÃtex tambÃm apresenta atividades farmacolÃgicas, dentre tais efeito citotÃxico seletivo em cÃlulas carcinogÃnicas. A partir da fraÃÃo proteica efetiva sobre cÃlulas neoplÃsicas, o trabalho teve por meta central identificar proteÃna(s) citotÃxica(s) e proceder a sua caracterizaÃÃo bioquÃmica, biolÃgica e suas perspectivas biotecnolÃgicas. As proteÃnas solÃveis do lÃtex (PL) foram fracionadas em matriz de troca iÃnica e a fraÃÃo proteica detentora da citotoxicidade foi refracionada em outra matriz de troca iÃnica (Mono-Q) acoplada a sistema de mÃdia pressÃo. P 4 foi identificado como a fraÃÃo citotÃxica, apresentando uma IC 50 de 2, 2, 1, 2 e 2, 9 Âg/mL para as linhagens celulares HCT- 116, Ovcar- 8 e SF- 295, respectivamente. A anÃlise proteÃmica da fraÃÃo citotÃxica por eletroforese bidimensional permitiu identificar 15 spots, contendo proteÃnas Ãcidas (pI entre 4 e 6) e com massa {{molecular}} aparente de 30 kDa. Quando avaliados por espectrometria de massas todos esses spots foram identificados como quitinases e apresentaram massa intacta de 27, 4 kDa. A amostra reagiu positivamente ao reagente de Schiff, sugerindo glicosilaÃÃes. O teor de carboidratos foi estimado em 12, 8 %. A sequÃncia amino terminal obtida (1 QPVMNLEYPRYLNDINDYRDDNNYD 28) revelou 50 % de similaridade com quitinases de Solanum lycopersicum, Oryza sativa, Nicotiana tomentosiformes dentre outras. As enzimas apresentaram forte atividade quitinolÃtica, com pH Ãtimo variando entre 5 - 6 e temperatura Ãtima de 25 ÂC. A atividade quitinolÃtica foi reduzida quando tratada com concentraÃÃes crescentes de DTT (3, 10 e 30 mM) o que sugere a presenÃa de pontes dissulfeto estabilizadoras da enzima. AnÃlises por dicroÃsmo circular indicam a presenÃa majoritÃria de alfa-hÃlices na estrutura e que as isoformas se mostraram pouco resistentes a variaÃÃes de temperatura e pH. Imagens de alta resoluÃÃo geradas por microscopia de forÃa atÃmica sugeriram homogeneidade na amostra e um arranjo hexamÃrico foi evidenciado. As quitinases nÃo inibiram o crescimento micelial dos fungos fitopatogÃnicos Fusarium oxysporum e Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, mas reduziram a germinaÃÃo de esporos de C. gloeosporioides. Em consonÃncia as quitinases nÃo induziram estresse oxidativo nos esporos, mas causaram leves alteraÃÃes na permeabilidade membranar dos esporos avaliados. As quitinases laticÃferas (0, 1 % m/m) apresentaram forte efeito deletÃrio sobre o inseto fitÃfago Callosobruchus maculatus. Os efeitos produziram 57 % de reduÃÃo na sobrevivÃncia larval, reduÃÃo do peso de larvas (7, 8 mg Â 0, 2 / 4, 0 Â 0, 8) e emergÃncia de insetos adultos (50 %), alÃm de prolongar de 28 para 33 dias o tempo mÃdio de desenvolvimento de insetos adultos. As quitinases (2 mg/Kg, e. v.) apresentaram forte atividade anti-inflamatÃria, reduzindo em 95 % a infiltraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos na cavidade peritoneal em ensaio de inflamaÃÃo induzido por carragenina em camundongos. Este efeito foi revertido por L-NAME e Aminoguanidina, dois inibidores da enzima Ãxido nÃtrico sintase, indicando o possÃvel envolvimento do Ãxido nÃtrico no efeito observado. Esta aÃÃo foi associada Ã reduÃÃo dos nÃveis das citocinas prÃ-inflamatÃrias TNF-&# 945; e IL- 1 na cavidade peritoneal e do aumento dos nÃveis sÃricos das citocinas prÃ-inflamatÃrias TNF-&# 945;, IL- 6 e IL- 1. Ã concluÃdo que vÃrias isoformas de quitinases coexistem no lÃtex de C. procera. Estas proteÃnas atuam possivelmente na defesa contra insetos, mas tÃm pouca aÃÃo contra fungos. As quitinases laticÃferas foram identificadas como as proteÃnas citotÃxicas do lÃtex sobre cÃlulas neoplÃsicas e ainda foram capazes de modular os nÃveis de citocinas prÃ-inflamatÃrias e sÃntese de Ãxido nÃtrico em modelo de inflamaÃÃo aguda. As quitinases do lÃtex de C. procera representam interessantes molÃculas para prospecÃÃo biotecnolÃgica em defesa vegetal e farmacologia. Calotropis procera is a latificer {{plant in}} the Apocynaceae family. Defensive proteins with activity against phytophagous insects and phytopathogenic fungi in latex have been described. Latexâs proteic fraction also performs pharmacological activities, such as selective cytotoxic effect in carcinogenic cells. From the proteic fraction effective against neoplastic cells, this work had the goal to identify and further characterize cytotoxic protein(s) biochemically, biologically, and evaluate their biotechnological prospects. Soluble proteins in latex (LP) have been fractioned in ion-exchange matrix, and the fraction capable of cytotoxicity was further fractioned in another ion-exchange matrix (Mono-Q) coupled to a medium-pressure system. P 4 was identified as cytotoxic fraction, showing an IC 50 of 2. 2, 1. 2 and 2. 9 mg/mL for the cell lines HCT- 116, Ovcar- 8 and SF- 295, respectively. Proteomic analysis of the cytotoxic fraction by two-dimensional electrophoresis allowed 15 spots to be identified, comprising acid proteins (pI among 4 and 6) with 30 kDa apparent molecular weight. All spots were identified as chitinases when evaluated by mass spectrometry, and showed intact mass of 27. 4 kDa. The sample reacted positively to the Schiff reagent, suggesting <b>glycosilations.</b> The carbohydrate content was estimated at 12. 8 %. The amino-terminal sequence obtained (1 QPVMNLEYPRYLNDINDYRDDNNYD 28) revealed 50 % similarity with Solanum lycopersicum, Oryza sativa and Nicotiana tomentosiformes chitinases, among others. The enzymes showed strong chitinolytic activity, with optimal pH varying between 5 - 6 and optimal temperature of 25 ÂC. The chitinolytic activity was diminished when treated with increasing concentrations of DTT (3, 10 and 30 mM), which suggests the presence of disulfide bonds stabilizing the enzyme. Circular dichroism analyses indicate a larger presence of alpha helices in the structure and that the isoforms has low resistance to pH and temperature variation. High-resolution images generated through atomic force microscopy suggested sample homogeneity and a hexameric configuration. The chitinases did not inhibit mycelial growth of phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, however reduced the germination C. gloeosporioides spores. In consonancy the chitinases did not induce spore oxidative stress, but caused a slight change in membrane permeability of the evaluated spores. Laticifer chitinases (0. 1 % w/w) showed a strong deleterious effect on the phytophagous insect Callosobruchus maculatus. Effects produced a 57 % survival reduction, larval weight reduction (7. 8 mg Â 0. 2 / 4. 0 Â 0. 8), adult insets emergence reduction (50 %), in addition to prolonging the mean maturation time from 28 to 33 days. The chitinases (2 mg/Kg, i. v.) showed a strong anti-inflammatory activity, reducing 95 % of neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneal cavity in mouse in an inflammation induced by carrageenan assay. L-NAME and Aminoguanidine, two inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, reversed this effect, possibly indicating involvement of nitric oxide in the effects observed. This action was associated to a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&# 945; and IL- 1 levels within the peritoneal cavity and increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&# 945;, IL- 6 and IL- 1. The conclusion is reached that many isoforms of chitinases coexist in C. procera latex. These proteins act possibly in defense against insects, though low action against fungi is shown. Laticifer chitinases were identified as latex proteins cytotoxic on neoplastic cells and they have even been able to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and nitric oxide in an acute inflammation model. C. procera laticifer chitinases represent interesting molecules for biotechnology prospection in plant defense and pharmacology...|$|R

An indirect search for a protein structure {{to be used as}} a template for 3 D modelling has been performed on the basis of the similarity, generally exhibited by coronaviruses, of their genomic organisation. The crystal structure of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin B appeared to be structurally adaptable to human and canine coronavirus spike protein sequences and it was successfully used to model the two subunits of SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. In facts, all the possible cystine bridges, ten and four disulphide bridges respectively in the S 1 and S 2 subunits, can be formed in the two proposed models, since always the corresponding cysteine C atoms are found at a maximum distance of 10 Å. Furthermore, only three out of the total fourteen predicted <b>glycosilation</b> sites of S 1 exhibit low surface accessibility and all of the five possible <b>glycosilation</b> sites result to be exposed in S 2.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) affects all {{the process}} of spermatogenesis. Chronic hyperglycemia in DM increases the expression of receptor for advanced <b>glycosilation</b> end products (RAGE) {{that is responsible for}} the activation of signal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase 3. Active caspase 3 {{plays an important role in}} cell apoptosis. Soybean (Glycin max) is reported to have antihyperglycemic and antiadvanced <b>glycosilation</b> end products (antiAGE) and antioxidants activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of soybean powder suspension on the expression of RAGE and active caspase 3 of diabetic rats’ sperm. This was an experimental study with post test only control group design using 30 male Sprague Dawley rats, aged 11 - 12 weeks old and weighed 200 - 250 g. The rats were divided into five groups with six rats in each group. Group 1 was non diabetic rats and  Group 2 was diabetic rats that were given aquadest. Group 3 - 5 were diabetic rats that were given a soybean powder suspension at dose of 400; 800 and 1600 mg/kg body weight (BW) /day, respectively. Diabetic rats were made by induction of a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 60 mg/kg BW. Soybean powder suspension was ingested for four weeks after 14 days STZ induction. Blood glucose levels were monitored before and three days after STZ induction and four weeks after suspension ingestion. The expression of RAGE and active caspase- 3 were analyzed using immunohistochemistry method four weeks after suspension ingestion. The results showed that soybean powder suspension ingestion significantly decreased blood glucose level of diabetic rats toward normality (p< 0. 05). However, the expression of RAGE and active caspase- 3 in diabetic rats’ sperm were not significantly lower than those after suspension ingestion. In conclusion, soybean powder suspension does not significantly affect the expression of RAGE and active caspase- 3 in diabetic rats’ sperm...|$|E
40|$|Early <b>glycosilation</b> {{products}} induce glomerular hyperfiltration {{in normal}} rats. The effects of early <b>glycosilation</b> products (Amadori Products, AP) were investigated in male Munich-Wistar rats to establish whether AP {{play a role}} in the pathogenesis of glomerular hyperfiltration of early diabetic nephropathy. To mimic such a condition, normal rats were transfused with blood containing in vitro glycated serum (Group GLYC) to achieve plasma levels of Amadori products similar to those measured in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Rats transfused with normal blood were used as control (Group CON). Glomerular hemodynamics was evaluated in basal condition (B) and during acute hyperglycemia (HG). Blood transfusion did not alter basal hemodynamics. In Group CON, HG determined a rise of single nephron GFR (41. 4 ± 3. 2 vs. 32. 1 ± 1. 8 nl/min, P < 0. 005), secondary to the increase of afferent effective filtration pressure (EFPa, + 19 % vs. B, P < 0. 01). Rats of Group GLYC, in B, had values of SNGFR higher than those of Group CON B (46. 8 ± 3 nl/min, P < 0. 05, ANOVA). This increase was mediated by a significant reduction of glomerular afferent arteriole (Ra, - 38 % vs. Group CON B, P < 0. 05), a rise in hydrostatic gradient pressure in glomerular capillaries (ΔP, + 17 %, P < 0. 05) and of EFPa (+ 31 %, P < 0. 05). During HG, a further increase of SNGFR (58. 3 ± 2. 6, P < 0. 005 vs. all groups) was detected in rats of Group GLYC, due to a significant rise in glomerular plasma flow (P < 0. 05 vs. CON B and CON HG), in P (P < 0. 05 vs. all the groups) and EFPa (P < 0. 05 vs. all the other groups). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that glomerular hyperfiltration can be reproduced in normal rats by increasing the plasma concentration of Amadori Products to the values observed in diabetic rats. The pattern of modifications in glomerular hemodynamics resembles that commonly described in diabetic hyperfiltering rats...|$|E

Network representations are ideally suited to investigate the complex interconnections between the individual components of a biological system underlying complex diseases. Here we investigate the patterns of correlations of an array of 29 metabolites identified and quantified in the plasma of 864 healthy blood donors and use a systems biology approach to define metabolite probabilistic networks specific for low and high latent cardiovascular risk. We adapted methods based on the likelihood of correlation and methods from information theory and combined them with resampling techniques. Our results show that plasma metabolite networks can be defined that associate with latent cardiovascular disease risk. The analysis of the networks supports our previous finding of a possible association between cardiovascular risk and impaired mitochondrial activity and highlights post-translational modifications (<b>glycosilation</b> and oxidation) of lipoproteins as a possible target-mechanism for early detection of latent cardiovascular risk...|$|E

Four buffaloes, two of which showing high cheese yield and two with low cheese yield selected {{from a group of}} 135 subjects were chosen for the proteomic analyses. Six main spots in 2 D gels were recognized as alpha s 1 -, alpha s 2 -, beta- and k-casein, alpha-lactoalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin. The main visible differences in the 2 D gels between buffaloes with high vs. low cheese yield were found in the appearance of the four k-casein spots (spots numbers: 20, 19, 16, 18) which differ in the number of phosphorilation and <b>glycosilation.</b> The area and the intensity of the four spots were calculated by using Melanie II (Bio-Rad) software. Samples with high cheese yield showed higher value of the by-products: area x intensity of spot 16, correspondent to k-casein with one phosphorilation site, and lower values of spots 19 and 20, of k-casein with more than one phosphorilation site and glycosilated...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to graft a sugar moiety onto polyfunctional natural {{phenolic}} compounds. This should enhance their water solubility. The choice of an adequate sugar such as mannose could provide cellular recognition. The synthesis route was first tested on cinnamyl alcohol which is structurally close to the base pattern of natural phenolic compounds. Two compounds are tested to catalyse the <b>glycosilation</b> between cinnamyl alcohol and D-mannose. The first one is an enzyme, the -glucosidase from almond, and the second one is a mineral acid catalyst immobilized on silica. Results show that -glucosidase is able to synthetize cinnamyl mannoside from mannose and cinnamyl alcohol. Furthermore, enzyme-catalyzed route lead to only one product and is so more specific than the chemical route where several products are observed. The obtaining of one product with a unique structure is interesting for the fundamental study of structure-function relationships (Interaction of the product with model membranes by Isothermal Titration Calorymetry and with the Langmuir Trough technique). In a future work, the reaction will be tested with more complex molecules (for example coniferyl alcohol) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathways}} {{leading to}} autoimmunity remain enigmatic despite numerous lines of experimental inquiry and epidemiological evidence. The mechanisms {{leading to the}} initiation and perpetuation of specific diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or multiple sclerosis (MS) remain largely enigmatic, although it is established {{that a combination of}} genetic predisposition and environmental stimulation is required. The growing number of genome-wide association studies and the largely incomplete concordance for autoimmune diseases in monozygotic twins concur to support the role of the environment (including infectious agents and chemicals) in the breakdown of tolerance leading to autoimmunity through different mechanisms. In the present article we illustrate the current hypotheses related to an environmental impact on the onset of PBC and MS as two representative conditions investigated with complementary approaches. Indeed, while a role of post-translational antigen modifications has been proposed for MS, this field remain unexplored in PBC where, conversely, most evidence is gathered from geoepidemiology and experimental data on xenobiotics or infectious agents.

40|$|The {{expression}} of proteoglycans (PGs) in the mammalian {{central nervous system}} (CNS) appears to be strictly regulated both during development and after damage to the mammalian CNS. Recently, we have isolated from membranes of injured adult brain a neurite outgrowth-inhibitory proteoglycan (IMP), the activity {{of which could be}} specifically counteracted by a monoclonal antibody (mAB) against the PG. We described in this report the characterization of perinatal membrane proteoglycan (PMP), a heparan-sulfate/chondroitin-sulfate- containing PG expressed during brain development. Its maximal expression was observed around postnatal day 3, decreasing strongly in normal adult tissue. This PG was purified and characterized using mABs generated against IMP. The comparison of PMP and IMP properties indicates that the two PGs are highly related and share expression patterns, biochemical characteristics, and the ability to inhibit neurite initiation in culture. However, IMP and PMP displayed a distinct effect on neurite elongation, which may be explained by their differences in <b>glycosilation</b> pattern.

Although the hybrids possessed a number of copies of the human u-PA and u-PAR genes {{comparable to that of}} HT 1080 cells, they had levels of human u-PA mRNA and u-PAR mRNA significantly lower than HT 1080 cells. Accordingly, the levels of u-PA and u-PAR were lower in the hybrids than in HT 1080 cells. However, the hybrid cells surprisingly had a 2 - to 6 -fold higher u-PA-binding capacity than HT 1080 cells. Some hybrid cells expressed <b>glycosilation</b> variants of u-PAR. In addition, in the hybrids, that express very low levels of u-PA, u-PAR was predominantly in the ligand-binding, three-domain form, whereas HT 1080 cells, that have a high u-PA level, possessed higher levels of the cleaved, two-domain form of u-PAR devoid of ligand-binding activity. This indicates that the u-PA-binding capacity is controlled not only by u-PAR expression but also depends on receptor affinity and cleavage by u-PA or plasmin...|$|E

All these factors are often intricated and source of delayed wound healing. Insight in the pathophysiology of the diabetic foot provides a comprehensive basis for a protocol of primary and secondary preventive care.

Legumin was found to be composed of 29 disulphide-linked subunit pairs with different molecular weight and/or isoelectric point. Western blot analysis of legumin of several mutants revealed molecular polymorphism based on a corresponding gene family. Three different alpha-major legumin patterns were found, and inheritance studies showed that the 34. 3 -kD legumin polypeptide is the product of one locus, Lg- 1 -alpha, which is the first legumin genetic locus described in Vicia faba. Vicilin was found to be composed of as many as 59 subunits distributed in a molecular weight range of 65. 7 to 42. 8 kD (major polypeptides) and 37. 2 to 15. 2 kD (minor polypeptides), with different isoelectric points.

Aberrant <b>glycosilation,</b> typical of tumor cells, represents a key event in the induction of invasion and metastasis. Sialidases remove sialic acid residues from sialoconjugates and, in mammals, these enzymes have been proved {{to be involved in}} several cellular phenomena, including cell proliferation and differentiation, membrane function, and malignant transformation. Herein we show that only the lysosomal sialidase Neu 1 and the plasma membrane-associated sialidase Neu 3 are expressed in CFU-E erythroid precursors and K 562 erythroleukemic cells. Tumour cells show much higher expression levels than CFU-E cells and, during differentiation, the content of the two enzymes progressively decreases. The sialoglycoconjugate pattern is different in the two cell types. In fact, the differentiating erythroid precursors show an increase of the typical erythrocyte sphingolipids, whereas K 562 cells treated with butyrate show a marked increase of GD 1 a, GM 2, PE, and ceramide. Finally, during differentiation the sialoglycoprotein content of erythroid cells shows a marked increase, and in K 562 cells the process induces the synthesis of some sialoglycoprotein typical of the erythroid membrane. Overall, these results point out the great differences in sialoglycoconjugate and sialidase patterns exhibited by normal and tumour cells...|$|E

So, serology using highly specific antigens of T. solium, either semi-purified native or recombinant antigens, is essential for confirming NCC cases. There is some debate about the usefulness of CSF and serum for immunodiagnosis. When NCC cases with a solitary cyst or with calcified lesions are examined, serology is not always sensitive to differentiating such cases. Malignant brain tumor is most commonly suspected in Japan and is often treated surgically as an urgent task, if the clinicians have no experience of NCC cases. Only histopathological specimens are expected to show direct evidence of T. solium cysticercosis. Morphology is not always sufficient for identification of the Taenia species, even if the majority of cysticerci in the human brain {{are expected to be}} T. solium. Crucial confirmation is based on molecular identification. In this review, these four issues are briefly summarized. <b>glycosilation</b> (Scheel et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2005; Sako et al, 2000, 2006). In this review, such serological wor...|$|E
40|$|Glycomacropeptide is a glycosilated {{fraction}} of bovine kappa-casein that remains soluble when milk is clotted by rennin. Determinations of milk sialic acid content are useful because its concentration reflects {{the amount of}} free GMP of milk. In normal milk these amounts are very low, 12 to 16 times lower than in sweet whey. Therefore, its determination may be applied to verify possible frauds with whey addictions, since it works as a fingerprint. With the description of a new spectrophotometric method for determination of free GMP (ANSM) occurred a simplification of procedures, being faster than others (HPLC method), without loss of accuracy. However, due to variations of <b>glycosilation</b> in kappa-casein between animals, during the lactation period, due to mastitis and yet due to proteolysis on milk, {{it was necessary to}} know these variations to interpret correctly the analytical results. It was analyzed 1, 703 samples of producer's raw milk and 1, 189 samples of processed milk (HTST and UHT). The results showed that normal milk from herd (producer's milk) have only small amounts of free GMP, with A 470 nm = 0. 232 ± 0. 088 or 3. 89 ± 1. 25 mg of sialic acid/L. The upper limit of this distribution was A = 0. 496; thus every bigger value may represent a problem, being outside of normal distribution...|$|E
40|$|In the kidney, dystroglycan (DG) {{has been}} shown to cover the basolateral and apical {{membranes}} of the podocyte. a-DG is heavily glycosilated, which is important for its binding to laminin and agrin in the glomerular basement membrane. Furthermore, a-DG is negatively charged, which maintains the filtration slit open. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to degrade and depolymerize carbohydrates, and {{to play a role in}} several glomerular diseases. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of ROS on the <b>glycosilation</b> of glomerular a-DG. By using specific antibodies directed against the core protein or glyco-epitopes of a-DG, this was studied in a solid-phase assay, in situ on kidney sections, and in vivo in adriamycin nephropathy. A ligand overlay assay was used to study binding of a-DG to its ligands. Exposure to ROS leads to a loss of carbohydrate epitopes on a-DG both in vitro and on kidney sections. In the in vitro assays, a decreased binding of deglycosilated a-DG to laminin and agrin was found. In adriamycin nephropathy, where radicals play a role, we observed a loss of a-DG carbohydrate epitopes. We conclude that deglycosilation of glomerular a-DG by ROS leads to disruption of the agrin–DG complex, which in vivo may lead to the detachment of podocytes. Furthermore, loss of negative charge in the filtration slit may lead to foot process effacement of podocytes...|$|E

The research was done to identify and characterize the GH gene of Pangasionodon hypophthalmus. There were several activities performed in identifying the GH gene: RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and DNA fragment isolation. The characterizations were done using the nucleotide sequencing engine ABIPRISM 3100.  The results were then analyzed using BLASTN/P and GENETYX version 7 program.  The full-length GH gene of P. hypophthalmus was 1151 bp in length, coding for an open reading frame (ORF) of 603 bp. The 5 ’ and 3 ’ untranslated regions of the GH gene were 22 bp and 526 bp long, respectively. The GH gene of P. hypophthalmus had some common characteristics that are owned by GH genes, such as single tryptophan residue (W) on the 104 th amino acid, 5 cysteine residues (C) on the amino acid 71,  135, 173, 190, and 198 and a motif of Asn-Xaa-Thr on C terminus which is the potential location for N-linked <b>glycosilation.</b> Polyadenylation signal (aataaa) was on the 14 bp at the upstream of polyadenylation location. Growth hormone of P. hypophthalmus consisted of over 200 amino acids from GH cDNA deduction.

40|$|Different {{expression}} {{systems have}} been developed, and are commercially available, aiming at producing recombinant proteins from different organisms, ranging from bacteria to man. However, in same cases, the solubility and stability of the produced protein can be a problem, especially for eukaryotic proteins, which need post translational modifications to be biologically active. In the present work, different strategies were tested to increase the solubility of a human carbohydrate binding domain (CBD), present in laforin phosphatase. Namely, different expression systems, different hosts and fermentation conditions, the presence of additives and detergents during lyses, were used. The DNA coding sequence was cloned by PCR into three prokaryotic expression systems: pET 29 a, pET 25 b; and two eukaryotic systems: pGAPZaC and pPICZaC. The CBD was expressed at high level in pET system. In pET 29 a the CBD protein was obtained in inclusion bodies. In pET 25 b, {{a small amount of}} soluble protein was obtained in the presence of 0, 6 M of arginine, in the lyses buffer. Although a functional recombinant protein was obtained, it was not stable in solution, aggregating easily. On the other hand, the utilisation of two expression systems of Pichia pastoris led to the production of soluble and stable CBD in extra cellular medium; however, this CBD was obtained at low expression level and its activity was not confirmed. <b>Glycosilation</b> of the expressed protein may explain the increased stability, at the expense of reduced functionality.

40|$|AbstractThe Leishmania cell surface {{virulence}} factor gp 63 is a protease {{family that}} {{plays an important}} role in the survival of the parasite protozoon into the host macrophages. We have cloned and characterised the gp 63 gene from L. infantum. The sequence analysis of the gene indicates the existence of a high degree of conservation with the other old world species L. major and L. donovani. The similarity is lower with new world species with the exception of L. chagasi which shows a strikingly high percentage of identity (99 – 100 %). In L. infantum the gp 63 gene expresses two polypeptides of 58 and 60 kDa, respectively, which show a similar proteolytic activity. The 60 kDa polypeptide is expressed during the whole life cycle of the promastigote form of the parasite with a moderate increase at the stationary phase of growth while the 58 kDa product, although slightly present in the logarithmic phase, notable increases its expression during the highly infectious stationary phase. RNA analysis showed that the presence in L. chagasi of these two polypeptides correlates with two RNA molecules and with the degree of parasite infectivity, whereas in the case of L. infantum a single 3 kb messenger RNA is detected through the whole promastigote life cycle. Our data indicate that in L. infantum, the differences in gene expression of the gp 63 protease family according to parasite phase of growth seem to be due to a differential pattern of <b>glycosilation</b> of the polypeptides which correlates with the different infective forms of the promastigote form of the parasite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Myostatin (MSTN) is {{a member}} of the {{transforming}} growth factor-β superfamily that negatively regulates growth of skeletal muscle tissue. The gene encoding for the MSTN peptide is a consolidate candidate for the enhancement of productivity in terrestrial livestock. This gene potentially represents an important target for growth improvement of cultured finfish. Results Here we report molecular characterization, tissue expression and sequence variability of the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) MSTN- 1 gene. The barramundi MSTN- 1 was encoded by three exons 379, 371 and 381 bp in length and translated into a 376 -amino acid peptide. Intron 1 and 2 were 412 and 819 bp in length and presented typical GT [...] . AG splicing sites. The upstream region contained cis -regulatory elements such as TATA-box and E-boxes. A first assessment of sequence variability suggested that higher mutation rates are found in the 5 ' flanking region with several SNP's present in this species. A putative micro RNA target site has also been observed in the 3 'UTR (untranslated region) and is highly conserved across teleost fish. The deduced amino acid sequence was conserved across vertebrates and exhibited characteristic conserved putative functional residues including a cleavage motif of proteolysis (RXXR), nine cysteines and two <b>glycosilation</b> sites. A qualitative analysis of the barramundi MSTN- 1 expression pattern revealed that, in adult fish, transcripts are differentially expressed in various tissues other than skeletal muscles including gill, heart, kidney, intestine, liver, spleen, eye, gonad and brain. Conclusion Our findings provide valuable insights such as sequence variation and genomic information which will aid the further investigation of the barramundi MSTN- 1 gene in association with growth. The finding for the first time in finfish MSTN of a miRNA target site in the 3 'UTR provides an opportunity for the identification of regulatory mutations on the expression of this gene. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Diabetes is {{well known}} risk factor for {{thrombotic}} events. The association between diabetes and venous thromboembolism is still matter of debate. However, during diabetes an acquired thrombophilia is present and {{is due to the}} non-enzymatic <b>glycosilation</b> of clotting inhibitors as antithrombin thus leading to hypercoagulable state. A possibile relationship between the presence of FVL gene variant in type 1 or type 2 diabetes has been hypothysed by several reports in the Literature with non-univocal findings. Patients and methods Retrospectively we analysed nearly 7000 patients referred to our Thrombosis Center for venous thromboembolism (VTE) then we selected 115 patients underwent to the screening for inherited thrombophilia. All selected patients were divided in 2 groups: the first group (group A) included 64 patients with previous VTE and carriers of factor V Leiden, while the second group (group B) included 51 patients with previous VTE and evetually carriers of thrombophilic defects other than factor V Leiden. Patients of group B acted as control group. 75 g oral glucose tolerance Test (OGTT) recommended by WHO was perfomed to all subjects in the study in order to screen subjects with glucose reduced tolerance or subjects with inducible diabetes. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA 6 [URL] with Student t test for unpaired data, with χ 2 test or with Fisher exact test where appropriated; differences were considered to be significant if p Results We did not find sifferences between glycaemia at baseline and after OGTT between patients with VTE carriers of FVL compared to non-carriers of FVL. We found a relevant increase in the prevalence of IGT and diabetes between patients with VTE carriers of FVL compared to non-carriers of FVL although this increase did not raise statistical significance. Discussion our data pointed out an interesting aspect of the linking between FVL gene variant, diabetes and atherothrombosis and other vascular complications, although data on larger population are needed; this aspect may be another relevant topic of research based because also a link between the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis and atherothrombosis has been recently reported in the Literature. </p...|$|E
40|$|Periodontal {{inflammation}} is a periodontal {{disorder of}} high prevalence in the population. Chronic periodontitis {{is associated with}} the accumulation of plaque and calculus as local factors, and systemic factors such an diabetes mellitus (DM) and HIV infection. Cytokine, especially IL- 1 β as inflammatory mediator for periodontal disease, may directly stimulated iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) expression and NO (nitric oxide) production by β-cells, resulting in NO-mediated β-cell damage. The leucotoxin and proteases produced by periodontal pathogens will induce chemotactic and phagocytotic defect; therefore causing decreased PMN phagocytotic function. Hyperglicemia which occurs in diabetic patients increases calcium influx to the cell, resulting in the increased cytosol’s calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) level and; therefore, resulting in dysfunction of PMN and impaired PMN phagocytotic function. Advanced <b>glycosilation</b> endproduct in NIDDM binds to monocytes resulting in the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1, TNFα) and produces activation of macrophages and osteoclasts. Hyperglicemia activates diacyl glycerol (DAG) -protein kinase C (PKC), thus increasing PGE 2 and cytokine expression that induce inflammation and periodontal tissue destruction processes. Studies on the effect of scaling to remove calculus disposition on blood glucose control and cellular immune response in DM patient has never been carried out. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the effect of scaling as non-surgical periodontal therapy on immune response (IL- 1 β level and PMN phagocytotic function) and blood glucose level of type 2 diabetic patients. Subjects were diabetic patients, 60 controlled-DM (CDM) and 60 uncontrolled-DM (UCDM), in Metabolic-Endocrinology Clinic of Ciptomangunkusumo Hospital, aged 40 - 60 years. The subjects were divided into treatment (scaling) and control group, and cellular immune response and diabetic status, before and 6 weeks after treatment were evaluated. Statistical analysis (t test) were done using Stata 7. 0 software, to compare the parameters before and after scaling in CDM and UCMD subjects. The results showed that scaling decreased IL- 1 β level and increased phagocytotic function significantly (P 0. 05), except for the decrease in HbA 1 c level in uncontrolled DM (P= 0. 00).

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) is {{a network of}} macromolecules which, together with cells, forms the various tissues of all metazoan organisms. Cartilage, in contrast to most other tissues, contains relatively few cells {{in proportion to the}} volume occupied by ECM. Part of this work involves investigation of cartilage ECM for expression and secretion of proteins that are considered to be the defining components of a specialized ECM known as a basement membrane (BM). We show that indeed all the four defining components of BMs, laminins, type IV collagen, perlecan and nidogens are expressed in cartilage. Furthermore, we show that these proteins localise to the chondrcyte pericellular matrix, where we suggest they form the functional equivalent of a basement membrane. Perlecan, as stated previously, is one of the cardinal components of BMs. Fibulin, another protein found both in basement membranes and cartilage, has previously been found to be involved in organization of the cartilage ECM. A further aim of this work was therefore to investigate any role that perlecan plays in cartilage ECM organization. we show that a specific <b>glycosilation</b> variant of perlecan potently stimulates collagen fibril formation. We further show that stimulation can be accomplished by the specific Chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain of perlecan, independently of the core protein. Investigation of the CS chain composition reveals that it is enriched in a specific high sulfation disaccharide (CS-E) and we postulate that this high sulfation CS-chain is necessary for collagen fibril formation stimulation. We also continue to investigate the mechanism by which stimulation is accomplished and show that stimulation is accomplished through a non-crossbridging mechanism that cannot be inhibited by an excess of non-stimulatory glycosaminoglycan. Heparin, which shares biological characteristics with the high sulfation CS-E, also stimulates fibril formation. The efficacy of heparin is however significantly higher and further differences include the ability of heparin fragments as small as heptamers to stimulate fibril formation while CS-E fragments appear to lose their stimulatory traits upon even partial digestion. In conclusion we show that basement membrane components are present in cartilage ECM and that they may serve roles both as BM functional equivalents as well as organizational roles during ECM formation...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Apolipoprotein A 1 (ApoA-I) is {{the major}} {{component}} of HDL and play crucial roles in all steps of RTC. ApoA-I is susceptible to oxidation which contribute to reduce its cardioprotective effects. It {{has been reported that}} hypoclorite can affect ApoA-I structure and the ability of this lipoprotein to promote ABCA 1 -dependent cholesterol efflux. The effects of Superoxide, a potent oxidant produced in blood vessel, on ApoA-I structure and function have never been reported. The aims of this work was to asses if the ApoA-I function to stimulate the cholesterol esterifying enzime (LCAT) was impaired by incubation with superoxide. Furthermore the Apo-A-I funtion to bind Haptoglobin, (Hpt) a plasma glicoprotein, was tested after incubation by superoxide. METHODS: The superoxide production was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 734 nm of a reaction mixture containing several concentration (10 50 100 µM) of KO 2 and ABTS 450 µM and kept at 31 °C. The binding experiments were performed by ELISA with coated ApoA-I, several concentration of KO 2 (10 50 100 µM) was added, after Hpt in solution and anti-Hpt antibodies was used for detection of bound Hpt. Standard LCAT assay were carried out as published 1. ApoA-I-containing liposomes was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence and absence of superoxide. RESULTS: After affinity chromatography, in ELISA experiments, Hpt from patients binds less efficiently Hb than Hpt from controls. In particular, significant differences were found for samples with 0. 1, 0. 2 or 0. 3 µM Hpt (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, when the same proteins were analyzed for their ability to influence LCAT activity, there are evidence that Hpt from healthy donor bind much better ApoA 1 then psoriatic Hpt. The differences between the two Hpt pools in inhibiting LCAT suggest that the protein purified from patients has not the same structure of normal protein. This difference might depend on lower ability of Hpt from patients to limit ApoA 1 stimulation of stimulating LCAT activity. DISCUSSION: Here we provide evidence that plasma, in psoriasis, contains different Hpt forms from those circulating in normal condition which might impair the protein function in Hb binding and LCAT regulation. Besides it is possible that Hpt, in psoriasis, exposes different glycan code than normal condition that alters structure and function of it. Nevertheless further analysis of psoriatic Hpt <b>glycosilation</b> is required to support this hypothesis. 1. Chen CH et al., (1982) J Lipid Res. 23, 680 - 691...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{immune system}} {{comprises}} three main layers. Recognition of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) initiates the first layer of immune response, known as MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI). However successful pathogens utilize virulent strategies, such as effector proteins, to suppress MTI and facilitate their growth, resulting into effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS). In response to ETS, plants acquire resistance proteins (R proteins) {{to monitor the}} presence of the pathogen effector proteins, leading to stronger immune response, known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). During the plant immune response, large-scale transcriptional reprogramming is activated by numerous transcription (co) factors. The Arabidopsis TGA factors {{have been shown to be}} required for resistance to disease. In the present study, the biological functions of clade I TGA factors (TGA 1 and TGA 4) during plant immune responses were investigated in depth. My results demonstrate that the Arabidopsis TGA 1 and TGA 4 are positive regulators in disease resistance against various types of pathogens. Multiple mutant alleles and overexpression lines of clade I TGA factors were identified and analyzed to confirm the previous finding that clade I TGA factors positively contribute to ETS against a virulent race of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and further discover their positive role in ETS against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. In addition, clade I TGA factors were shown to play important roles in MTI-mediated disease resistance against P. syringae pv. tomato hrcC-, and ETI-mediated disease resistance against P. s. t. AvrRpt 2. Furthermore, clade I TGA factors are required for non-host resistance against P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448 a, wich relies on both MTI and ETI. Loss of resistance in mutants of clade I TGA factors was shown to be associated with defects in cell wall-based defence responses, including callose deposition, apoplastic oxidative burst and extracellular PR- 1 protein accumulation. Interestingly, transcript levels of PR- 1, callose synthase and other genes encoding defence proteins accumulated at, or above, wild type levels in the mutants. Furthermore, the double mutant is more sensitive to the <b>glycosilation</b> inhibitor, tunicamycin, indicative of a compromised endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. These results suggest that clade I TGA factors control defence-related secretion events that are required for cell wall-associated defence responses. Analysis of the non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (npr 1 - 1) mutant and an tga 1 - 1 tga 4 - 1 npr 1 - 1 triple mutant indicate that clade I TGA factors act substantially independent of NPR 1 during plant immune responses. Moreover, mutation of clade I TGA factors also results in developmental changes, including curly leaves and late flowering. Together, these results demonstrate that TGA 1 and TGA 4 factors play a unique role in mediating both defence responses and developmental processes...|$|E
