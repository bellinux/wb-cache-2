5|$|Malawi {{has taken}} many steps towards slowing {{the spread of}} HIV/AIDS, such as {{increasing}} access to condoms and improving testing services and treatment options. Many of these efforts have been funded by international donors including the World Bank, the Global Fund, the World Health Organization, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS). The World Bank has lent $407.9 million to Malawi, the Global <b>Fund</b> <b>has</b> agreed to give $390 million, and PEPFAR has donated $25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns.|$|E

5|$|There are 1,100 RNLI {{fundraising}} branches {{throughout the}} regions {{served by the}} Institution, many far from the sea, which may support a particular station, or a project such as a new lifeboat. The Institution estimated their volunteer network at 31,500 in 2014. The largest regular contributor is The Communications and Public Service Lifeboat Fund (known simply as 'The Lifeboat Fund') established in 1886 for civil servants to support the RNLI collectively; the <b>Fund</b> <b>has</b> provided the Institution with 52 lifeboats {{as well as other}} support.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky <b>Fund</b> <b>has</b> paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the park, {{as defined by the}} World Wildlife <b>Fund,</b> <b>has</b> a human {{population}} of 22,882, mostly ethnic Bantus and, despite being named a minority in Cameroon's constitution of 18 January 1996, Baka Pygmies. These include the Djem, Bangando, Bakwele and Zime tribes. Non-indigenous employees of logging companies and traders make up a sizeable amount of the population. The population density of the region is about five people per square kilometer, concentrated along the main Yokadouma-Moloundou road. The villages around the park are mostly homogeneous as there are few non-natives, most of whom work as civil servants or traders.|$|E
40|$|Mutual Funds {{around the}} world have {{attracted}} trillions of dollars and millions of investors. Given the importance of the industry, performance evaluation of mutual <b>funds</b> <b>has</b> become the most commonly discussed topic in finance. Mutual <b>Funds</b> in Pakistan <b>have</b> recently become the centre of attraction for both practitioners and academics since the mutual <b>fund</b> industry <b>has</b> recently started to develop, and it has been hardly four to five years since most of the open-ended <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> been introduced. The assets under management of open-ended <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> swelled from PKR 25 billion in 1997 to PKR 340 billion in 2008. This paper attempts to examine the performance of newly introduced and rapidly growing open-ended funds in Pakistan, though some <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> been in existence for long. The study uses pioneering models of Mutual Fund performance proposed by Sharpe (1966), Treynor (1965) and Jensen (1967). The results of the evaluation indicate the performance of the funds being quite negative. But the performance evaluation also reveals some positive characteristics of the <b>funds</b> which <b>have</b> been discussed in the paper. Naturally, since most of the <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> hardly completed around three to four years of their operation, {{it is too early to}} conclude whether the overall performance of the industry is good or bad...|$|R

Despite being owned by the IFC, the AMC has investment decision autonomy and is charged with a fiduciary responsibility to the four individual funds under its management. It also aims to mobilize additional capital for IFC investments as it can make certain types of investments which the IFC cannot. , the AMC managed the IFC Capitalization Fund (Equity) Fund, L.P., the IFC Capitalization (Subordinated Debt) Fund, L.P., the IFC African, Latin American, and Caribbean Fund, L.P., and the Africa Capitalization Fund, Ltd.

The Clan Maclachlan Society {{consists}} of eight branches around the world, including Australia, Britain & Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The Lachlan Trust is a registered Scottish charitable organisation which takes donations to preserve the heritage of Clan Maclachlan. The trust, in part with Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund, helped raise £100,000 {{for the preservation of}} Kilmorie Chapel, the traditional burying place of the chiefs. The project was completed in 2006, as a memorial to the twenty-fourth chief (the present chief's mother). Further funding from Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery <b>Fund</b> <b>has</b> since been approved for the conservation of the old castle and {{the construction of a new}} footbridge over the River Lachlan. Work began in the spring of 2013 with the erection of scaffolding around the west corner of the old castle.
