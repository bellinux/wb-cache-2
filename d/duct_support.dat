40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the venom}} apparatus intima in representatives of 38 genera of the problematic braconid wasp subfamily Rogadinae and other cyclostome braconids was investigated and a preliminary phylogenetic {{analysis for the}} group was performed with the information obtained. Despite {{the limited number of}} characters, the data suggest several relationships at various taxonomic levels. The venom apparatus in the Clinocentrini and the Stiropiini is relatively unmodified and similar to that found in other genera previously placed within a broader concept of the Rogadinae (e. g. genera of Lysitermini, Pentatermini, Tetratermini, Hormiini) and also to that of the Betylobraconinae. The presence of a cone of filaments located inside the secondary venom duct near to its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom duct is proposed as a synapomorphy for the tribe Rogadini to the exclusion of Stiropiini, Clinocentrini and Yeliconini. Other features of the secondary venom duct and its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom <b>duct</b> <b>support</b> a number of relationships between the genera of the Rogadini and also within the large genus Aleiodes. A clade containing 15 Rogadini genera (Bathoteca, Bathotecoides, Bulborogas, Canalirogas, Colastomion, Conspinaria, Cystomastacoides, Macrostomion, Megarhogas, Myocron, Pholichora, Rectivena, Rogas, Spinaria and Triraphis) is supported by the presence of a thickened and short secondary venom duct, whereas the different members of Aleiodes (excluding members of the subgenus Heterogamus) and Cordylorhogas are distinguished by having a recessed secondary venom duct with well-defined and numerous internal filaments. New World Rogas species exhibit a unique venom apparatus and may not be closely related to the Old World ones. Features of the venom apparatus of the enigmatic genus Telengaia and the exothecine genera Shawiana and Colastes suggest that the Telengainae and Exothecinae are both closely related to the Braconinae, Gnamptodontinae, and possibly to the Opiinae and Alysiinae. An unsculptured venom reservoir was found in one specimen of the type species of Avga, A. choaspes, which is consistent with it occupying either a very basal position within the cyclostome braconids or belonging to a recently recognized ‘Gondwanan’ clade that also includes the Aphidiina...|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{epithelial}} {{cells of the}} male reproductive tract have been suggested {{to be involved in}} apocrine secretion. However, this method of secretion has not been fully accepted, nor is it well understood. In the present study, apocrine secretion was examined in the mouse epididymis and rat and human vas deferens. Throughout these regions of the duct, the apex of the epithelial principal cells often shows protrusions extending towards the lumen of the duct, referred to as apical blebs (ABs). Of different shapes and sizes, ABs appear to form at the apex of principal cells, and morphological and immunocytochemical evidence suggests that ABs detach from the cell surface whereupon they eventually undergo fragmentation in the lumen. ABs contain selective organelles suggesting a segregation of their contents. Numerous polysomes suggest the synthesis of nonglycosylated proteins which upon the fragmentation of ABs in the lumen could act directly or indirectly on sperm. The presence of spherical vesicles of various sizes (20 [...] 200 mn) within ABs as well as within the lumen of the <b>duct</b> <b>supports</b> AB fragmentation in the lumen and {{may play a role in}} modifying the sperm surface.

40|$|Introduction. Reconstruction by {{proximal}} gastrojejunostomy, and distal biliary and pancreatic anastomoses is infrequently used after resection of {{the head}} of the pancreas because of fear of fistulas and cholangitis. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is being performed more frequently for cystic malignant and premalignant lesions. Because of this {{there is a need for}} endoscopic visualization and biopsy of the residual pancreatic duct, since multi-centricity is characteristic of some of these malignancies. Since endoscopic access of the bile duct and pancreatic duct is difficult and unsuccessful in 50 – 70 % after B II or Roux Y reconstruction, we prospectively studied the merit and complications (early and late) of proximal gastrojejunal (PGJ) reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenal resection. Material and Methods. Thirty nine consecutive, non-radomized patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and PGJ reconstruction over 14 mos. There were 21 males and 18 females. Results. 7 patients with IPMN have undergone repeat CT scanning for surveillance, with 3 requiring repeat EUS and ERCP. There were no technical difficulties accessing the pancreas or the pancreatic <b>duct,</b> <b>supporting</b> the PGJ reconstruction. Conclusion. Proximal gastrojejunal reconstruction following pancreaticoduodenal resection may be safely done with similar morbidity to traditional pancreaticojejunal reconstructions. PGJ reconstruction may be of greater value when direct visual access to the bile duct or pancreatic duct is necessary, and should be considered when doing resection for mucinous cysts or IPMN {{of the head}} of the pancreas...|$|R

The lobules are held together by a fine dense irregular fibroelastic connective tissue layer which extends into the structure of the liver, by accompanying the vessels (veins and arteries), ducts and nerves through the hepatic portal, as a fibrous capsule called Glisson's capsule. The whole surface of the liver is covered in a serous coat derived from peritoneum and this has an inner fibrous coat (Glisson's capsule) to which it is firmly adhered.

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} {{and size}} distributions of collagen fibrils in Glisson's sheath were investigated in the rat liver to analyse the mechanical environment around the fibrils and their possible cells of origin. Glisson's sheath {{was found to}} contain 2 populations of collagen fibrils with different diameters and distinct localisations, namely fibroblast-associated and bile epithelium-associated. Fibroblast-associated collagen was composed of fibrils arranged in bundles and constituted {{the majority of the}} collagen in Glisson's sheath. Bile epithelium-associated collagen was represented by small dispersed groups of fibrils just beneath the basement membrane of the bile duct. The basement membrane of the bile duct was frequently reduplicated into a few or as many as 10 layers of laminae densae, with scattered collagen fibrils between these laminae. The diameters of the fibrils of both groups of collagen increased in relation to the calibre of the bile duct, whereas at any given place in Glisson's sheath bile epithelium-associated collagen fibrils had a smaller diameter compared with those of the fibroblast-associated fibrils. The increment in fibril diameter along the bile duct is considered to be correlated with the increase in mechanical stress acting on Glisson's sheath. The difference in diameter between the 2 populations as well as the incorporation of fibrils between the laminae densae of the basement membrane of the bile <b>duct</b> <b>supports</b> the view that the bile epithelium-associated collagen is produced by the epithelial cells of the bile duct, thus having a different origin from that of fibroblast-associated collagen. These findings provide the first evidence that the epithelial cells of the interlobular bile duct produce fibril-forming collagen. Furthermore, it is suggested that cholestasis stimulates the epithelial cells of interlobular bile duct to increased synthesis of fibril-forming collagen that is also produced by these cells under physiological conditions...|$|R

In this paper a linearized model of this process is examined for low Mach number swirling flow in a duct of infinite extent. It is shown that the amplitude of the scattered acoustic pressure waves is proportional to the product of the characteristic swirl velocity and the perturbation velocity of the vorticity wave. The sound produced in this way may therefore be of more significance than that generated by vorticity fluctuations in the absence of swirl, for which the acoustic pressure is proportional to the square of the perturbation velocity.
