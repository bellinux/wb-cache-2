25|$|<b>Frozen</b> <b>fog</b> (also {{known as}} ice fog) is {{any kind of}} fog where the {{droplets}} have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally this requires temperatures at or below , making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Barrow, Alaska. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.|$|E

6000|$|I discovered, too, {{that a great}} pleasure, an {{enjoyment}} {{which the}} horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down [...] "ing" [...] and holm till they blended with the <b>frozen</b> <b>fog</b> of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.|$|E
50|$|The final {{was due to}} {{be played}} on Saturday, 21 November 1925 but was {{postponed}} due to bad weather, in this case fog. The weather during that short period was atrocious and in fact Wigan had 5 matches postponed due to either a waterlogged pitch, a <b>frozen</b> pitch, <b>fog</b> or other bad weather in the four-week period from early November to early December. The final was eventually played on Wednesday 9 December 1925 and Swinton beat Wigan by 15-11. The match was played at the Cliff, Broughton, Salford. The attendance was 15,000 and receipts £1,116.|$|R

40|$|Synthetic Vision Systems and Enhanced Flight Vision System (SVS/EFVS) {{technologies}} {{have the potential}} to provide additional margins of safety for aircrew performance and enable operational improvements for low visibility operations in the terminal area environment. Simulation and flight tests were jointly sponsored by NASA's Aviation Safety Program, Vehicle Systems Safety Technology project and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate potential safety and operational benefits of SVS/EFVS technologies in low visibility Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. The flight tests were conducted by a team of Honeywell, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel with the goal of obtaining pilot-in-the-loop test data for flight validation, verification, and demonstration of selected SVS/EFVS operational and system-level performance capabilities. Nine test flights were flown in Gulfstream's G 450 flight test aircraft outfitted with the SVS/EFVS technologies under low visibility instrument meteorological conditions. Evaluation pilots flew 108 approaches in low visibility weather conditions (600 feet to 3600 feet reported visibility) under different obscurants (mist, fog, drizzle fog, <b>frozen</b> <b>fog)</b> and sky cover (broken, overcast). Flight test videos were evaluated at three different altitudes (decision altitude, 100 feet radar altitude, and touchdown) to determine the visual advantage afforded to the pilot using the EFVS/Forward-Looking InfraRed (FLIR) imagery compared to natural vision. Results indicate the EFVS provided a visual advantage of two to three times over that of the out-the-window (OTW) view. The EFVS allowed pilots to view the runway environment, specifically runway lights, before {{they would be able to}} OTW with natural vision...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of German reactor safety {{research}} the thermal-hydraulic behaviour in accumulators was investigated experimentally and analytically for transient injection. The paper includes the description of two test facilities used for separate effect experiments for the discharge flow of accumulators. Results derived from experiments at a glass facility show the dependency of the nitrogen release processes in the water on the depressurization rate during negative pressure transients and a delay of release. This release delay caused oversaturated solutions and this effect {{has to be taken}} into account for the modelling of accumulators. It was not observed coalescence of nitrogen bubbles during rising but the appearance of humid nitrogen above the liquid level. At the test facility TRACEI separate effect experiments were carried out for the investigation of the heat and mass transfer to the nitrogen cushion, the release of nitrogen out of saturated pressurized water and the multidimensional distribution of the gas temperature. The measured data in the nitrogen cushion show different conditions of humid nitrogen such as unsaturated and saturated humid nitrogen, the occurrence of water droplets in terms of fog and <b>frozen</b> <b>fog.</b> Intensive distributions of temperature and humidity above the liquid level were detected during fast pressure gradients, hence high depressurization rates. Post test calculations were accomplished with the ATHLET-Code Mod. 1. 2 Cycle B for selected TRACEI separate effect experiments. The comparison of calculated results and experimental data shows well calculated liquid level decreasing and a good agreement of the pressure transient even if the friction pressure loss coefficients of the connection pipe between the accumulator simulator and the venting vessel were adapted. Deviations between simulations and experiments arised in calculating the cushion gas temperature. In order to improve the simulation quality it was suggested to calculate the enthalpy, the density, and accordingly the specific volume and the volumetric gas fraction, respectively the volumetric water fraction, by a model of humid nitrogen bearing analogy to the model of humid air in consideration of the basic equations used in the ATHLET-code. The modelling for releasing of solved nitrogen in the water nodes contains a source term of volumetric gas release rate subjected to pressure and depressurization rate and approaches for the determination of bubble rising velocities of the nitrogen bubbles in water.
