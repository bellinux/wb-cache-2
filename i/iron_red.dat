60|$|To remedy this difficulty, it {{is found}} best to heat nails {{intended}} for clinching before driving them. By heating the <b>iron</b> <b>red</b> hot, the metal seems to expand to its original condition of ductile iron, and it loses the extreme hardness and stiffness which was given to it by the force and compression of the nail-making machine.|$|E

60|$|We {{heard the}} roar of it, and {{presently}} it came flying into sight, going at what {{seemed to me to}} be a prodigious speed. Whence it had come, or how far, we had no means of knowing. Only by some miracle of luck could it have gone any distance. But now we were to see the terrific end of its career. A train of coal trucks stood motionless upon the line. We held our breath as the express roared along the same track. The crash was horrible. Engine and carriages piled themselves into a hill of splintered wood and twisted <b>iron.</b> <b>Red</b> spurts of flame flickered up from the wreckage until it was all ablaze.

50|$|Iron is {{commonly}} used as a colorant in its <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> oxide form as (Fe2O3). Red iron oxide {{is commonly}} used to produce earthy reds and browns. It is the metal responsible for making earthenwares <b>red.</b> <b>Iron</b> is also another tricky colorant because {{of its ability to}} yield different colors under different circumstances. At low percentages (.5-1%) and in the presence of potassium, iron will become light blue or light blue-green in reduction (as is seen in traditional celadons). In the presence of barium, iron may become yellow green. When used in combination with calcium, <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> oxide can become pale yellow or amber in oxidation or green in reduction. Common percentages for <b>red</b> <b>iron</b> oxide range from (4 up to 10%).|$|R
30|$|For the {{depiction}} of draperies and skies, the master obtained subtle color designs by employing a stratified system with underlying layers that were allowed to dry before subsequent layers were applied. In particular for the draperies, passages of translucent glazes were superimposed on strongly pigmented underpainting in order to temper the color tone of the latter and/or to modulate forms and deep shadows. In the case of dark red and blue colored draperies, loose impastos of bright paint were added to evoke the highlights. For instance, the underpainting of red draperies was composed of vermilion mixed with lead white, sometimes with small addition of <b>iron</b> <b>reds,</b> red lakes and/or calcium-based fillers (calcite and gypsum) to further modify the vivid color of vermilion. Next, transparent glazes were employed in areas of shadow, based on red lake {{with the addition of}} a carbon-based black. Finally, impastoed highlights containing vermilion mixed with lead white and red lake were applied.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Diabetes-related {{metabolic}} abnormality may aggravate {{the adverse effects}} of iron overload on cardiovascular health. However, {{little is known about}} whether iron consump-tion affects coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We prospectively assessed the associations of long-term intakes of dietary <b>iron</b> and <b>red</b> meat with CHD risk among 6, 161 women who reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. RESULTS — During 54, 455 person-years of follow-up from 1980 through 2000, we docu-mented 550 incident cases of CHD. After adjustment for age and BMI, high intakes of both heme <b>iron</b> and <b>red</b> meat were associated with a significantly increased risk of fatal CHD (P for trend 0. 003 and 0. 018), coronary revascularization (P for trend 0. 02 and 0. 06), and total CHD (P for trend 0. 0009 and 0. 007). Women with the highest intake of heme iron had 50 % (6 – 94 %) increased risk of total CHD compared with those with the lowest intake. Further adjustment for other lifestyle and dietary factors did not appreciably change the associations. The positive association between heme <b>iron</b> and <b>red</b> meat intakes and CHD was more evident among post-menopausal women compared with premenopausal women...|$|R

50|$|The {{colors in}} the cliffs are created by the large amounts of {{minerals}} in the rock. The cliffs are composed of the Munising Formation of 500-million-year-old Cambrian Period sandstone. The Munising Formation sits atop Precambrian sandstone of the Jacobsville Formation. The mottled red Jacobsville Formation is the oldest rock in the park. On top of the Munising Formation is the younger Au Train Formation from the Ordovician Period. The Au Train Formation is a hard sandstone and acts as a cap over the other layers. Streaks {{on the face of}} the cliffs come from the groundwater leaching out of the rock. With it come <b>iron</b> (<b>red),</b> manganese (black-white), limonite (yellow-brown), copper (pink-green), and other minerals. As the water evaporates, these minerals leave streaks of color.|$|E
