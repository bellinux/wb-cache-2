5000|$|... "Cut It" [...] debuted {{at number}} 94 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart dated March 12, 2016 and {{eventually}} peaked at number 35, becoming O.T.

[...] "Cut It" [...] was certified Platinum by the RIAA on November 17, 2016.|$|R
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the commander suddenly caught <b>Dolph's</b> attention. He was short and swarthy, with crisped black hair; blind of one eye, and lame of one leg--the very commander {{that he had seen}} in his dream! Surprised and aroused, he considered the scene more attentively, and recalled still further traces of his dream: the {{appearance of}} the vessel, of the river, and of a variety of other objects, accorded with the imperfect images vaguely rising to recollection.|$|R
6000|$|It {{required}} some preparation before <b>Dolph's</b> return {{could be}} made known to his mother, the poor soul having bewailed him as lost; and her spirits having been sorely broken down {{by a number of}} comforters, who daily cheered her with stories of ghosts, and of people carried away by the devil. He found her confined to her bed, with the other member of the Heyliger family, the good dame's cat, purring beside her, but sadly singed, and utterly despoiled of those whiskers which were the glory of her physiognomy. The poor woman threw her arms about <b>Dolph's</b> neck: [...] "My boy! my boy! art thou still alive?" [...] For a time she seemed to have forgotten all her losses and troubles, in her joy at his return. Even the sage grimalkin showed indubitable signs of joy, at the return of the youngster. She saw, perhaps, that they were a forlorn and undone family, and felt a touch of that kindliness which fellow-sufferers only know. But, in truth, cats are a slandered people; they have more affection in them than the world commonly gives them credit for.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his first}} tour, Overton volunteered for a second tour in Korea in a fighter unit. For this tour, Overton joined the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Suwon Air Base. For the first several weeks in this assignment, Overton saw little action.

He flew an F-86 Sabre, tail number 50-631, nicknamed <b>Dolph's</b> Devil and Angel in Disguise.|$|R
60|$|<b>Dolph's</b> first {{care was}} to repair to his mother's house; {{for he was}} {{continually}} goaded {{by the idea of}} the uneasiness she must experience on his account. He was puzzling his brains, as he went along, to think how he should account for his absence, without betraying the secrets of the haunted house. In the midst of these cogitations, he entered the street in which his mother's house was situated, when he was thunderstruck at beholding it a heap of ruins.|$|R
60|$|For {{once in his}} life, one of his idle accomplishments was of use to him. The many truant hours {{which he}} had devoted to {{sporting}} in the Hudson, had made him an expert swimmer, yet, {{with all his strength}} and skill, he found great difficulty in reaching the shore. His disappearance from the deck had not been noticed by the crew, who were all occupied by their own danger. The sloop was driven along with inconceivable rapidity. She had hard work to weather a long promontory on the eastern shore, round which the river turned, and which completely shut her from <b>Dolph's</b> view.|$|R
5|$|Brendli played {{football}} in {{middle and high}} schoolat Patchogue Medford highschool. Brendli is good friends with his former Spirit Squad teammate Nick Nemeth (better known as <b>Dolph</b> Ziggler), and the two lived together in Florida until 2008.

60|$|He {{was soon}} {{up to his}} ears in medical studies, being employed, morning, noon, and night, in rolling pills, {{filtering}} tinctures, or pounding the pestle and mortar, {{in one corner of}} the laboratory; while the doctor would take his seat in another corner, when he had nothing else to do, or expected visitors, and, arrayed in his morning-gown and velvet cap, would pore over the contents of some folio volume. It is true, that the regular thumping of <b>Dolph's</b> pestle, or, perhaps, the drowsy buzzing of the summer flies, would now and then lull the little man into a slumber; but then his spectacles were always wide awake, and studiously regarding the book.|$|R
5|$|Norman <b>Dolph's</b> {{original}} acetate {{recording of}} the Scepter Studios material contains several recordings {{that would make it}} onto the final album, though many are different mixes of those recordings and three are different takes entirely. The acetate was cut on April 25, 1966, shortly after the recording sessions. It would resurface decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 at a flea market in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored. The album was again placed for auction on eBay and was successfully sold on December 16, 2006 for $25,200.|$|R
60|$|As <b>Dolph's</b> {{companion}} passed on, {{he received}} a tranquil nod from the burghers, and a friendly word from their wives; all calling him familiarly {{by the name of}} Antony; for it was the custom in this strong-hold of the patriarchs, where they had all grown up together from childhood, to call every one by the Christian name. The Heer did not pause to have his usual jokes with them, for he was impatient to reach his home. At length they arrived at his mansion. It was of some magnitude, in the Dutch style, with large iron figures on the gables, that gave the date of its erection, and showed that it had been built in the earliest times of the settlement.|$|R
5|$|In late 2010, Swagger began being {{accompanied}} to {{the ring}} by his mascot, the Swagger Soaring Eagle, who was portrayed by Chavo Guerrero. At , Swagger competed in a triple threat ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston and champion <b>Dolph</b> Ziggler, in which Ziggler retained.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the film}} first emerged under the working title of Local Hero in January 2013. Jean-Claude Van Damme was rumored to be co-starring {{alongside}} Jaa, {{but he could not}} commit due to scheduling issues; he was filming Swelter at the time. <b>Dolph</b> Lundgren was cast as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|The camp's director, Mr. Black, has {{licensed}} Krusty's {{name from}} the comedian. The campers {{find out that the}} camp is a dystopia. <b>Dolph,</b> Jimbo and Kearney, the camp counselors, take the children on death marches, feed them gruel and force them into making knockoff wallets for export.|$|E
6000|$|As {{he stood}} musing on these circumstances, the captain {{suddenly}} {{called out to}} him in Dutch, [...] "Step on board, young man, or you'll be left behind!" [...] He was startled by the sum mons; {{he saw that the}} sloop was cast loose, and was actually moving from the pier; it seemed as if he was actuated by some irresistible impulse; he sprang upon the deck, and the next moment the sloop was hurried off by the wind and tide. <b>Dolph's</b> thoughts and feelings were all in tumult and confusion. He had been strongly worked upon by the events that had recently befallen him, and could not but think that there was some connexion between his present situation and his last night's dream. He felt as if he was under supernatural influence; and he tried to assure himself with an old and favourite maxim of his, that [...] "one way or other, all would turn out for the best." [...] For a moment, the indignation of the doctor at his departure without leave, passed across his mind--but that was matter of little moment. Then he thought of the distress of his mother at his strange disappearance, and the idea gave him a sudden pang; he would have entreated to be put on shore; but he knew with such wind and tide the entreaty would have been in vain. Then, the inspiring love of novelty and adventure came rushing in full tide through his bosom; he felt himself launched strangely and suddenly on the world, and under full way to explore the regions of wonder that lay up this mighty river, and beyond those blue mountains that had bounded his horizon since childhood. While he was lost in this whirl of thought, the sails strained to the breeze; the shores seemed to hurry away behind him; and, before he perfectly recovered his self-possession, the sloop was ploughing her way past Spiking-devil and Yonkers, and the tallest chimney of the Manhattoes had faded from his sight.|$|R

5|$|At {{a science}} museum {{the family is}} visiting, Bart runs into Ralph Wiggum, {{who is in the}} process of being pushed into a giant ear by Kearney, Jimbo, Nelson, and <b>Dolph.</b> When Ralph is freed by a museum employee, Marge and Chief Wiggum are there to meet him. Marge observes that Ralph has a vivid {{imagination}} and learns that he has no friends to play with; she arranges a play-date for Ralph to spend time with a horrified Bart.|$|E
