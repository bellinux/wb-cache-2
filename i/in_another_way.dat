5|$|Nicolas Giraud {{was born}} in Greece to French parents; the name by which he is most {{commonly}} known, Nicolo, was {{given to him by}} Byron. Giraud may have been the brother-in-law of Giovanni Battista Lusieri, a Roman painter and broker for Lord Elgin. Demetrius Zograffo, Byron's guide in Greece, informed Byron that the 60-year-old Lusieri was unmarried, and was courting two women, each of whom believed that Lusieri was to marry her. Lusieri certainly had a close relationship with Giraud, so {{it is possible that the}} two were related <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>way,</b> perhaps as father and son. Byron met Giraud in Athens in January 1809, and the two were companions until Byron resumed his travels in March.|$|E

The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E

Similarly {{to the case of}} estrogenic activity, the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as s and male contraceptives (or, put <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>way,</b> increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility).|$|E
25|$|Saiedi {{also points}} to another {{translation}} and interpretation of the version in the Báb's letter: the Báb's use the word manahij (paths) in two ways; in one way {{it refers to the}} chapters of the Bayán, and <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> it refers to the entire Bayán and his laws. Saiedi states that the reference to manifesting the eight paths may refer to the distribution of the eight copies of the Bayán that the Báb had sent to Subh-i-Azal, to the eight individuals who are identified in the letter, when the Promised One appears.|$|E

Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered as religious persecution.

25|$|However, a massive-star {{system could}} be a {{progenitor}} of life <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> – the supernova explosion of the massive star in {{the central part of}} the system. This supernova will disperse heavier elements throughout its vicinity, created during the phase when the massive star has moved off of the main sequence, and the systems of the potential low-mass stars (which are still on the main sequence) within the former massive-star system may be enriched with the relatively large supply of the heavy elements so close to a supernova explosion. However, this states nothing about what types of planets would form as a result of the supernova material, or what their habitability potential would be.|$|E
25|$|Luxembourg, {{somewhat}} {{diminished in}} size (as the medieval lands had been slightly {{reduced by the}} French and Prussian heirs), was augmented <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> through the elevation {{to the status of}} grand duchy and placed under the rule of William I of the Netherlands. This {{was the first time that}} the duchy had a monarch who had no claim to the inheritance of the medieval patrimony. However, Luxembourg's military value to Prussia prevented it from becoming a full part of the Dutch kingdom. The fortress, ancestral seat of the medieval Luxembourgers, was garrisoned by Prussian forces, following Napoleon's defeat, and Luxembourg became a member of the German Confederation with Prussia responsible for its defence, and a state under the suzerainty of the Netherlands at the same time.|$|E
25|$|It is {{nonsensical}} and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only {{to allow it to}} end after a definite period of time. A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or to put it <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>way,</b> it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. There must be something inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E
