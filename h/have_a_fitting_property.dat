This study was designed to determine the ergonomic suitability of educational furniture in the lecture theaters at the University of Ibadan to serve as a case study. Sample of convenience was used to select participants for this study. The lecture theaters were selected based on their capacity, design, and dimension. A total of 240 students (120 males and 120 females) participated in this study. The ergonomic suitability of lecture theaters was determined by analyzing the mismatches between student anthropometric dimensions and furniture dimensions, and also by analyzing the design and orientation of the lecture theaters. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics of mean, standard deviation, range, and median. The results showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in height between males and females but no significant difference between other anthropometric variables measured. About 20 % of the participants <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> seat height, while seat height was unsuitable for the remaining 80. 4 %. On the other hand, 23. 3 % <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> seat depth, while it was unsuitable for 76. 7 % of the participants, and 99. 6 % of the participants had fitting desk clearance but 0. 4 % found it unsuitable. A total of 25. 8 % of the participants <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>fitting</b> desk height, while 74. 2 % of the students found it unsuitable. It was concluded that the furniture in the lecture theaters at the university studied was not ergonomically suitable for the students. Hence it is recommended that further studies, including more universities across a wide spectrum of society, should be performed to determine the effect of furniture on student health, and the need to adopt the use of adjustable furniture in lecture theaters to prevent health hazards that may occur secondary to the use of unsuitable furniture.

40|$|Oscillation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} phenomena in the chemical reaction systems in living cells. The general purpose simulation algorithms fail to take into account this special character and produce unsatisfying results. In order to enhance the accuracy of the integrator, the second-order derivative is incorporated in the scheme. The oscillatory feature of the solution is captured by the integrators with <b>an</b> exponential <b>fitting</b> <b>property.</b> Three practical exponentially fitted TDRK (EFTDRK) methods are derived. To test the effectiveness of the new EFTDRK methods, the two-gene system with cross-regulation and the circadian oscillation of the period protein in Drosophila are simulated. Each EFTDRK method has the best fitting frequency which minimizes the global error. The numerical results show that the new EFTDRK methods are more accurate and more efficient than their prototype TDRK methods or RK methods of the same order and the traditional exponentially fitted RK method in the literature...|$|R
