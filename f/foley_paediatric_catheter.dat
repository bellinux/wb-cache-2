40|$|During {{vascular}} surgical operations, {{there is}} a need for a simpler and more reliable method of temporary arterial occlusion than those currently employed, especially of heavily calcified arteries. A thermosensitive polymer, LeGoo (LG) (Pluromed, Woburn, MA), has been used successfully for temporary vascular occlusion. It has hitherto been injected by a cannula that has been introduced into the artery to be occluded, here henceforth called the “cannulation method. ” Injection into arterial ostia without cannulation, using an injection device that arrests blood flow during the injection, here henceforth called “a retrograde method” may enable temporary hemostasis when ostial stenoses render it impossible to inject LG using the cannulation method. The objective of the present study was to study the feasibility of a retrograde method and to compare it with the cannulation method in an in vitro model, incorporating a narrow orifice to simulate ostial stenosis, using tap water at 37 °C instead of blood. The retrograde method of LG injection, using a modified <b>paediatric</b> <b>Foley</b> <b>catheter,</b> turned out to be feasible to produce a durable LG plug more reliably, at higher water pressure and with less deep LG injection than with the cannulation method...|$|R
40|$|Background: Impaired {{implantation}} in {{assisted reproduction}} cycles with high serum estradiol (E 2) concentrations {{may be attributed}} to abnormal endometrial development. This study compared concentrations of endometrial proteins in uterine flushings of infertile patients between natural and stimulated cycles. Methods: Patients received a standard regimen of ovarian stimulation. Seven days after the LH surge in natural cycles or the hCG injection in stimulated cycles, uterine flushings were performed by slowly injecting and aspirating normal saline through a <b>paediatric</b> <b>Foley</b> <b>catheter.</b> Natural cycles were considered as group A whereas stimulated cycles with serum E 2 20 000 pmol/l were classified as groups B and C respectively. PP 14 and CA- 125 in uterine flushings were measured and expressed per total protein content. Results: Concentrations of the total protein, PP 14 and CA- 125 in the uterine flushings were similar among the three groups. PP 14 per total protein in the uterine flushings was significantly correlated with serum E 2 on the day of hCG (r = 0. 459; P = 0. 009) in natural cycles only but not in stimulated cycles. Conclusion: There {{was no significant difference between}} natural and stimulated cycles in concentrations of PP 14 and CA- 125 in uterine flushings performed in the mid-luteal phase. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In 1975, 15 balloon atrial septostomies {{were among}} 503 cardiac catheterisations {{performed}} at the Hospi-tal for Sick Children. Last year, 81 of 519 cardiac catheterisations were performed primarily for interventions. These included balloon and blade septostomy; balloon dilatation of pulmonary valves, aortic valves, recoarctations, and pulmonary arte-ries; myocardial biopsies; and embolisations. The <b>paediatric</b> <b>catheter</b> laboratory, which has been losing diagnostic practice to cross sectional echocardiography, now has a new raison d'etre.

40|$|Abstract The {{effectiveness}} of intrauterine insemination (IUI) combined with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) {{in the treatment}} of subfertility was investigated in the present study. For this purpose the prognostic factors associated with success of clomiphene citrate (CC) /human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) /IUI were identified in 811 treatment cycles. Furthermore, a long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) /HMG stimulation protocol was compared with a standard CC/HMG protocol. In addition, the usefulness of alternative insemination techniques including fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP) and intrafollicular insemination (IFI) was investigated. Finally, the obstetric and perinatal outcome of pregnancies after COH/IUI was examined and compared with those of matched spontaneous and in vitro fertilization(IVF) pregnancies. Female age, duration of infertility, aetiology of infertility, number of large preovulatory follicles and number of the treatment cycle were predictive as regards pregnancy after CC/HMG/IUI. The highest pregnancy rate (PR) was obtained in women of <  40 years of age with infertility duration ≤ 6 years, who did not suffer from endometriosis. A multifollicular ovarian response to CC/HMG resulted in better treatment success than a monofollicular response, indicating the necessity of COH combined with IUI. A significantly higher PR was achieved in the first treatment cycles compared with the others, and 97 % of the pregnancies were obtained in the first four treatment cycles. The PR per cycle did not differ significantly between a long GnRHa/HMG and a standard CC/HMG protocol, but the average medication expense of GnRHa/HMG stimulation was four times the cost of CC/HMG stimulation. Therefore, the routine use of a long GnRHa/HMG protocol in IUI treatment remains questionable. The FSP procedure was easy to perform by using a <b>paediatric</b> <b>Foley</b> <b>catheter.</b> The success rate in couples with either FSP or standard IUI did not differ significantly, although there was a trend towards a lower PR in the FSP group. The FSP technique should not replace the simpler and less time-consuming IUI technique in routine use. The IFI technique was also simple to perform and convenient for patients. However, only one normal singleton intrauterine pregnancy resulted in 50 IFI-treated women, indicating that IFI is inefficacious for treating subfertility. The IUI parturients differed from average Finnish parturients in respect to higher maternal age, more frequent primiparity and a higher incidence of multiple pregnancies. The use of antenatal care services was significantly lower in IUI singleton pregnancies compared with IVF singletons, although there were no more complications in IVF pregnancies. The hospitalization and Caesarean section rates were generally high in all pregnancies. The mean birthweight of IUI singletons was significantly lower than that in spontaneous pregnancies, but comparable to that in IVF pregnancies. However, the incidence of preterm birth, low birth weight and other variables describing the outcome of infants were similar in IUI, IVF and spontaneous pregnancies. In summary, the IUI procedure itself does not seem to affect adversely the obstetric and perinatal outcome of pregnancy, and patient characteristics and multiplicity may be more important in this respect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency and}} nature of complications in patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterisation and to assess the feasibility of a voluntary cooperative audit system. METHODS [...] 27 centres enrolled patients over a two year period. Each centre voluntarily reported numbers of patients catheterised every month. Complications were reported as they occurred. Feedback was provided {{in the form of}} newsletters and reports. RESULTS [...] 39, 795 procedures were registered, of which 33, 776 were diagnostic catheterisations in adults or adolescents, 1265 were <b>paediatric</b> <b>catheter</b> studies in patients under the age of 12 years, and 4754 were coronary angioplasties or balloon dilatation of valves. 83. 3 % of diagnostic catheter studies in adults were left heart studies with coronary arteriography. The overall complication rate for diagnostic studies was 0. 80 %, mortality rate 0. 12 %, emergency surgical intervention rate 0. 08 %. Complication rates varied between centres, but there was no correlation with case load. Different patterns of complication were associated with different technical approaches. CONCLUSIONS [...] Complication rates of diagnostic catheterisation are low but neither negligible nor irreducible. Voluntary audit of this kind has limitations, but it is useful and inexpensive...|$|R
