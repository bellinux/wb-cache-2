Then, the temperature measurements at this slope in the early morning has been utilized in order to study meteorological characteristcs of the <b>ground</b> <b>inversion.</b> Main results obtained in this study are summarized as follows; (1) The <b>ground</b> <b>inversion</b> at Nagasaki occures most frequently in November and December, when anticyclones are predominant.

40|$|This {{final report}} {{presents}} the results of the first meteorological field campaign in the nocturnal boundary layer over land with the recently developed measurement system HELIPOD. During the examination of HELIPOD's measurement characteristics and the determination of the turbulent energy fluxes after appropriate high pass filtering of the measured time series no systematic error in the turbulent fluxes could be found. The measurements in the nocturnal residual layer showed that HELIPOD detects the turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat without any measurable displacement from zero. In the strongly stably stratified <b>ground</b> <b>inversion</b> sensible heat fluxes of 0. 1 Wm"-" 2 and momentum fluxes less than 10 "-" 3 Nm"-" 2 were detected from HELIPOD data. The turbulent flow in the <b>ground</b> <b>inversion</b> was in 100 m height strongly intermittent in general and decoupled from the surface roughness. Its turbulence production subrange was located at wavelengths of only a few meters. The local scales of this flow were in good agreement with results from other field experiments. A spectral analysis of nearly continuous turbulence found only on one flight leg showed spectral gaps in the power spectra of the wind velocity components at wavelengths between 2 and 10 m. An interaction with gravity waves could be excluded. The corresponding wavenumbers k of the gaps were in good agreement with the wavenumber k_* calculated by a model of Weinstock (1980). In accordance with the theory two-dimensional turbulence changes at k_* to three-dimensional turbulence with the inertial subrange. A transition from a k"-" 5 "/" 3 to a k"-" 3 -law in the temperature spectra could be explained by the decay of turbulence on small scale due to the strong stratification. The observation of decaying turbulence and spectral gaps at wavelengths less than 10 m was owing due to the highly resolving sensor equipment of the HELIPOD. (orig.)

During the campaign airborne DLR’s E-SAR radar (operating at L- and X-band) and TKK’s HUTSCAT scatterometer (operating at X- and C-band) were operated over a boreal forest test site to retrieve tree height.

Numerical simulations indicate that, while horizontal arrays are hardly affected, direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation with vertical arrays becomes biased in presence of ground reflections and sound speed gradients. Turbulence leads to a huge variability in the estimates by reducing the ground effect. Ground effect can be exploited by combining classical source localization with an appropriate propagation model (<b>ground</b> effect <b>inversion).</b> Not only does this allow the source elevation and range to be determined with a single vertical array but also it allows separation of sources which can no longer be distinguished by far field localization methods.

Along with the transverse tarsal joint (i.e. talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joint), the subtalar joint transforms tibial rotation into forefoot supination and pronation. The axis of rotation in the joint is directed upward 42 degrees from the horizontal plane and 16 degrees medially from the midline of the foot. However, together, the subtalar facets form a screw or Archimedean spiral, right-handed in the right foot, about which subtalar motion occurs. So, during subtalar inversion, the calcaneus also rotates clockwise and translates forward along the axis of the screw. Average subtalar motion is 20-30 degrees inversion and 5-10 degrees eversion.

40|$|Dike {{intrusions}} often cause complex ground displacements {{that are}} not sufficiently explained by simple analytical models. We develop a method to find complex and realistic dike geometries and overpressures from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. This method {{is based on a}} combination of a boundary element method with realistic topography and a neighbourhood algorithm inversion. Dike model geometry is roughly a quadrangle with its top reaching the <b>ground.</b> The <b>inversion</b> has two stages: search and appraisal. The appraisal stage involves calculations of model marginal probability density functions using misfit values calculated during the search stage. The misfit function takes into account the variance and correlation of data noise. Synthetic tests show that a model is successfully retrieved within predicted narrow confidence intervals. We apply the method on InSAR data of the February 2000 flank eruption at Piton de la Fournaise and get a trapezoid dike dipping seaward (61. 0 ◦ – 67. 3 ◦) with its bottom passing 800 – 1000 m beneath the summit. A model with a basal slip plane does not better explain observed asymmetric displacements and thus this asymmetry is solely attributed to the dipping dike. The dike lies above a narrow band of pre-eruption seismicity, suggesting that lateral magma propagation occurred. Neglecting topography results in poor modeling at depth and in overestimations of overpressure (or opening), height (both about 30 %), and volume (about 20 %) ...|$|R

The algorithm {{makes use of}} multibaseline measurements to estimate the whole set of the OVoG structural parameters (e. g., crop height, differential extinction between eigenpolarizations, and ground-to-volume ratios) and is significantly robust against non-volumetric decorrelation contributions. The theoretical assessment points out that, in the dual-baseline case, the vegetation height hV can be estimated with a relative root-mean-square deviation (%RMSD) of 7. 8 % if the selected baselines fulfill the condition 1. 2 <; κzhV <; 2. 8 rad (κz is the vertical wavenumber). Furthermore, the variance of the estimates is inversely related {{to the number of}} baselines Nb. Compared with the dual-baseline case, the RMSD of the differential extinction is reduced by 45 % (from 1. 1 to 0. 6 dB/m) when Nb = 5 baselines are employed, whereas its mean bias is independent of Nb. The proposed scheme has been assessed using a set of repeat-pass F-SAR acquisitions at L-, C-, and X-band of an agricultural area in Germany. Using two baselines, the height of maize and rape fields is estimated with an average 10 % %RMSD if the inversion is carried out over L-band acquisitions. On the other hand, when X-band data are employed, one can obtain reliable estimates of wheat and barley height, with a %RMSD better than 24 %.

40|$|Wide-band fully polarimetric {{data from}} rice crops, {{collected}} at the EMSL, {{have been used to}} test the performance of the random volume over <b>ground</b> (RVoG) <b>inversion</b> scheme [1]. In addition, an adaptation of this algorithm [2, 3], suited for well-defined oriented vegetation, has been also applied to retrieve the height of rice plants and the underlying topography. Due to the short height of rice plants, about 75 cm, the dihedral-type scattering from the flooded ground-stem interac-tion is the predominant contribution to backscattering. This produces two effects: 1) the concentration of all the coherence data measured, 2) a lack of sensitivity to the vertical structure of rice plants for small vertical wavenumber values. The first consequence enables the retrieval of the ground topography just by observing the phase of any complex coherence value. In general, these estimates are very precise from 2 to 9 GHz. On the other hand, the second consequence reduces the applicability of small baselines and/or low frequencies to retrieve the vegetation height. In the experiments at the EMSL, height estimates with +/- 15 cm error can be obtained only from 7 GHz in case of using a baseline of 0. 25 degrees and from 5 GHz when the baseline is doubled. The obtained results provide useful information about some parameters of the configuration which are important for the design of future air- or space-borne missions, such as the working frequencies and the baseline requirements. In addition, dual and fully polarimetric configurations have been tested. In general, estimates provided by the first two Pauli components (HH+VV and HH-VV) are very close to the ones derived from the whole set of polarizations. ...|$|R

During the last decades, the scientific community has developed many different modeling tools to tackle the problem of air pollution.

The temperature lapse rate of the atmosphere is an important climatological parameter and is an actual measure of atmospheric thermal stability or instability. Prevailing Mixing Heights, Ventilation Index, Air Pollution Potential Index for determining the dilution capacity or the assimilative capacity of the atmosphere at any location can be derived based on lapse rate measurements. High resolution temperature profile data were obtained by slow ascent balloons (balloon borne minisonde ascents) at various places in India. The environmental lapse rate was monitored periodically during day and night times to estimate the diurnal variation of the lapse rate. The balloons were tracked by optical theodolite in order to obtain vertical wind profiles. The data obtained has been analyzed to determine mixing heights, its diurnal nature, <b>ground</b> based <b>inversion</b> depths, and elevated inversion heights. The Ventilation Coefficient and Air Pollution Potential Index was also determined. Mapping of these parameters for the entire country has been done. On the basis of these isoplots one can identify three different regions, viz. (i) Coastal (ii) Landlocked interior and (iii) Hilly / Mountainous. Dispersion modeling for air pollution emissions can be done for these delineated zones. Thus, national regulatory bodies and planners can ascertain the assimilative capacity of the atmosphere {{as a function of the}} climatology of the site...|$|R

An additional measurement was done at the A 1200 spectrometer at MSU. The excitation function above the 10 C+p threshold has been determined up to 5 MeV. A potential-model analysis revealed three resonance states at energies 1. 27 (+ 0. 18 - 0. 05) MeV (Gamma= 1. 44 +- 0. 2 MeV), 2. 01 (+ 0. 15 - 0. 05) MeV, (Gamma= 0. 84 +-$ 0. 2 MeV) and 3. 75 (+- 0. 05) MeV, (Gamma= 0. 60 +- 0. 05 MeV) with the spin-parity assignments I(pi) = 1 / 2 +, 1 / 2 - and 5 / 2 +, respectively. Hence, 11 N is shown to have a <b>ground</b> state parity <b>inversion</b> completely analogous to its mirror partner, 11 Be. A narrow resonance in the excitation function at 4. 33 (+- 0. 05) MeV was also observed and assigned spin-parity 3 / 2 -...|$|R

40|$|The linear spin- 1 / 2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet with exchanges J(1) and J(2) between {{first and}} second neighbors has a bond-order wave (BOW) phase that starts at the fluid-dimer {{transition}} at J(2) /J(1) = 0. 2411 and is particularly simple at J(2) /J(1) = 1 / 2. The BOW phase has a doubly degenerate singlet <b>ground</b> state, broken <b>inversion</b> symmetry, and a finite-energy gap E-m to the lowest-triplet state. The interval 0. 4 < J(2) /J(1) < 1. 0 has large E-m and small finite-size corrections. Exact solutions are presented up to N = 28 spins with either periodic or open boundary conditions and for thermodynamics up to N = 18. The elementary excitations of the BOW phase with large E-m are topological spin- 1 / 2 solitons that separate BOWs with opposite phase in a regular array of spins. The molar spin susceptibility chi(M) (T) is exponentially small for T << E-m and increases nearly linearly with T to a broad maximum. J(1) and J(2) spin chains approximate the magnetic properties of the BOW phase of Hubbard-type models and provide {{a starting point for}} modeling alkali-tetracyanoquinodimethane salts...|$|R
