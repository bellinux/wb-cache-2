5000|$|... (2010) On the Line : 53-day, 2400 km by bike, <b>foot,</b> <b>pack</b> raft, and kayak {{investigating}} the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines project, with Todd McGowan; ...|$|R
50|$|Located {{within the}} Grand Canyon, Supai is only {{accessible}} by <b>foot,</b> <b>pack</b> animal or helicopter. It {{is the only}} place in the United Stated where mules still carry the mail, most of which is food.|$|R
50|$|Boxing Day {{is one of}} {{the main}} days in the hunting {{calendar}} for hunts in the UK and US, with most hunts (both mounted foxhound or harrier <b>packs</b> and <b>foot</b> <b>packs</b> of beagles or bassets) holding meets, often in town or village centres.|$|R
50|$|The Harrier is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used hound by hunts in Ireland, with 166 harrier packs, 37 of them mounted packs and 129 of them <b>foot</b> <b>packs,</b> spread throughout the country. More commonly in Ireland it is used to hunt both foxes and hares, with some packs hunting mainly foxes.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>foot</b> <b>pack</b> {{consists of}} up to 40 beagles, marshaled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in {{whose job is to}} return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman {{on the day of the}} hunt.|$|R
25|$|Even as {{the country}} grew even larger with the {{admission}} of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio by 1803, {{the only means of}} transportation between these landlocked western states and their coastal neighbors was by <b>foot,</b> <b>pack</b> animal, or ship. Recognizing the success of Roman roads in unifying that empire, political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation.|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, strippers can be trayed or packed. Packed columns, {{and particularly}} when random packing is used, are usually favored for smaller columns with a diameter less than 2 <b>feet</b> and a <b>packed</b> height of {{not more than}} 20 <b>feet.</b> <b>Packed</b> columns can also be advantageous for corrosive fluids, high foaming fluids, when fluid velocity is high, and when particularly low pressure drop is desired. Trayed strippers are advantageous because of ease of design and scale up. Structured packing can be used similar to trays despite possibly being the same material as dumped (random) packing. Using structured packing is a common method to increase the capacity for separation or to replace damaged trays.|$|R
5000|$|To mask {{his injury}} {{from the other}} team, Gutiérrez and his {{roommates}} decided to move his bed from the top bunk {{down to the floor}} so he could sleep there instead of being forced to jump or climb up on a sprained ankle. In turn, Gutiérrez kept his <b>foot</b> <b>packed</b> in ice hidden underneath the blankets in hopes of keeping his injury a secret. Whether Team Gastelum found out about the injury or Gutiérrez was already targeted, he found out later in the episode that the ankle would be tested.|$|R
50|$|Buffalo Blizzard of 1977 January 28-February 1, 1977. There {{were several}} <b>feet</b> of <b>packed</b> snow {{already on the}} ground, and the {{blizzard}} brought with it enough snow to reach Buffalo’s record for the most snow in one season - 199.4 inches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{settlement}} is inaccessible by vehicle or along the coast, but a paved road down the cliff was {{under construction in}} the east, by 2009. This trail is accessible by <b>foot</b> or <b>pack</b> animal, and snakes down the 450 m cliff.|$|R
50|$|By the 1790s the Lehigh Coal Mining Company was {{shipping}} Anthracite coal from Summit Hill, Pennsylvania {{to cargo}} boats on the Lehigh River using pack trains {{in what may}} be the earliest commercial mining company in North America. Afterwards in 1818−1827 its new management built first the Lehigh Canal, then the Mauch Chunk & Summit Hill Railroad, North America's second oldest which used mule trains to return the five ton coal cars the four hour climb the nine miles back to the upper terminus. Mules rode the roller-coaster precursor on the down trip to the docks, stables and paddocks below. The same company, as did its many competitors made extensive use of sure <b>footed</b> <b>pack</b> mules and donkeys in coal mines, including in some cases measures to stable the animals below ground. These were often managed by 'mule boys', a pay-grade up and a step above a breaker boy in the society of the times.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was close}} on eleven {{when the great}} adventurer set out upon this momentous stage of his journey: the Polish Lancers leading, then the chasseurs of his Old Guard with their time-worn grey coats and heavy bear-skins; {{some of them were}} on <b>foot,</b> others <b>packed</b> closely {{together}} in wagons and carts which the enthusiastic agriculturists of La Mure had placed at the disposal of [...] "the Emperor." ...|$|R
50|$|Some packs in {{the first}} part of the 20th century used a heavier more old {{fashioned}} type of hound to hunt hares and were followed on foot. This continued to some extent up until the Second World War, while the last <b>pack</b> of <b>foot</b> harriers, the Windermere, which hunted in the Lake District disbanded in the early 1990s. Some <b>foot</b> harrier <b>packs</b> disbanded, but many changed over to beagles as suitable harrier bloodlines died out.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if we go}} on <b>foot</b> we must <b>pack</b> {{guns and}} grub--and there's my gold-dust. Fifty pounds or more! It's yours, Joan.... You'll need it all. You love pretty clothes and things. And now I'll get them for you or--or die." ...|$|R
50|$|The Sweetwater Mountains (highest peak Mount Patterson 11654 ft) {{is a small}} {{mountain}} range in northern Mono County, California and western Lyon County, Nevada, separating the West Walker River from the East Walker River. Most of the range is only accessible by four wheel drive vehicle, on <b>foot,</b> or <b>pack</b> animal. Most of the range is contained in the Toiyabe National Forest. The place name appears on the 1874 California Geologic Survey map of California and Nevada.|$|R
50|$|Another {{source of}} popular {{information}} is Cities of the Underworld, a documentary series which ran for three seasons on the History Channel, starting in 2007. This series roamed around the world, showing little-known underground structures in remote locales, {{as well as}} right under the <b>feet</b> of densely <b>packed</b> city-dwellers.|$|R
50|$|After {{abandoning the}} wagons, the party {{proceeded}} on <b>foot</b> with <b>pack</b> horses. The party was attacked several times, witnessed the fatal remains of other ambushes, and had their provisions and horses stolen. Nancy was quoted:We left our wagons and finished our journey on horse-back and drove our cattle. I carried my baby {{in front of}} me on the horse. At one place the Indians surrounded us, armed with their bows and arrows, but my husband leveled his gun at the chief and made him order his Indians out of arrow range.|$|R
60|$|The {{town was}} filled with gloomy stories of the trail. No one knew its condition. In fact, {{it had not been}} {{travelled}} in seventeen years, except by the Indians on <b>foot</b> with their <b>packs</b> of furs. The road party was ahead, but toiling hard and hurrying to open a way for us.|$|R
50|$|South of the fields, {{the park}} angles southeast, and becomes {{more of a}} deep, {{naturalized}} ravine with steep sides, with a heavily used footpath down the middle. Cedarvale ravine contains very sizable wetlands east of Bathurst Street in Forest Hill; {{the remainder of the}} natural portion is young regrowth forest (the ravine was largely clearcut during the construction of the Spadina Subway in the 1970s). The path is heavily used and remains passable even in winter, with <b>foot</b> traffic <b>packing</b> snow down despite the lack of plowing, especially after drainage works in 2006 fixed water pooling and subsequent ice buildup.|$|R
60|$|Even in feeding, {{when you}} are hot on their trail and steal forward expecting to see them every moment, {{it is the same}} {{exasperating}} story. They dig a hole through four <b>feet</b> of <b>packed</b> snow to nibble the reindeer lichen that grows everywhere on the barrens. Before it is half eaten they wander off to the next barren and dig a larger hole; then away to the woods for the gray-green hanging moss that grows on the spruces. Here is a fallen tree half covered with the rich food. Megaleep nibbles a bite or two, then wanders away and away in search of another tree like the one he has just left.|$|R
50|$|The use of long pikes and densely <b>packed</b> <b>foot</b> troops was not {{uncommon}} during the Middle Ages. The Flemish footmen at the Battle of Courtrai, for example, as shown above, met and overcame the French knights c. 1302, and the Scots occasionally used the technique against the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence. However, it was the Swiss that brought infantry and pike tactics to an extremely high standard.|$|R
50|$|Blair Gap, one of {{the gaps}} of the Allegheny is a water gap along the eastern face atop the Allegheny Ridge or Allegheny Front escarpment. Like other 'gaps of the Allegheny' the slopes of Blair Gap were {{amenable}} to <b>foot</b> travel, <b>pack</b> mules, and possibly wagons allowing Amerindians, and then, after about 1778-1780 settlers, to travel west into the relatively depopulated Ohio Country decades before the railroads were born and tied the country together with steel. Historically, the gap {{was used for the}} upper sections of the Allegheny Portage Railroad, which as was authorized by the enabling acts in 1824 of Pennsylvania's Main Line of Public Works as part of the Pennsylvania Canal System which originally envisioned linking Pittsburgh to Philadelphia by canals.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 36 - 38) The {{detailed design}} of a pilot plant distillation unit is presented in this project. Brass {{was selected as the}} primary material of construction for the required components. The pilot plant consists of the following :units: a 50 liter reboiler vessel, a 4 inch diameter by 4 <b>foot</b> long <b>packed</b> column, a 16 square foot condenser, a 20 liter receiver, and a steam heat reboiler having 3 square feet of heat transfer area. The column may be;packed with raschig rings or multi-turn helices as desired. The required utilities are: 50 p. s. i. g. steam, cooling water circulated at 30 p. s. i. g. with a temperature of 35 ??F, and a 110 v. AC supply...|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{permitted}} {{traffic to}} follow the Reuss to its headwaters and over the saddle at the top - a continental divide between the Rhine, which flows into the North Sea and the river Ticino towards Milan, which after leaving Switzerland flows into the Po and ultimately into the Adriatic Sea. It carried only <b>foot</b> traffic and <b>pack</b> animals until 1775, when the first carriage made the journey on an improved road.|$|R
60|$|That those {{throes of}} {{sickness}} ensued, I need not say. A short time after passing Ramsgate, Serjeant Lankin, {{who had been}} exceedingly gay and satirical--(in his calm way; he quotes Horace, my favorite bits as an author, to myself, and has a quiet snigger, and, so to speak, amontillado flavor, exceedingly pleasant)--Lankin, with a rueful and livid countenance, descended into his berth, in the which that six <b>foot</b> of serjeant <b>packed</b> himself I don't know how.|$|R
60|$|Again Hal's whip {{fell upon}} the dogs. They threw {{themselves}} against the breast-bands, dug their <b>feet</b> into the <b>packed</b> snow, got down low to it, and put forth all their strength. The sled held {{as though it were}} an anchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was whistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on her knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around his neck.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the horses}} that died on the White Pass trial gave out or were killed within a two-mile stretch of slope. [...] By 1897, 3200 pack horses had died on White Pass trail, and their bodies were left there. The bodies {{of the horses}} were often used as <b>footing</b> for other <b>pack</b> horses making {{their way through the}} trail. The horses that had fallen were not always dead, and {{suffered}} more under the hooves of others.|$|R
50|$|Irgachefe {{was part}} of the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II. Advancing from Yabelo, the British recaptured Irgachefe on 27 April 1941. However, the road further north was so bad that it took ten days to travel 80 km, making the {{transport}} of supplies almost impossible. As a result, two battalions returned to Yabelo with the motor transport vehicles, while one battalion continued the advance northward carrying the ammunition and food supplies by <b>foot</b> and mule <b>pack.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Let go!" [...] {{she burst}} out, furiously. And instinctively {{she began to}} {{struggle}} to free herself. Then they all took hold of her. Helen's dignity might never have been! A burning, choking rush of blood was her first acquaintance with the terrible passion of anger that was her inheritance from the Auchinclosses. She who had resolved never to lay herself open to indignity now fought like a tigress. The Mexicans, jabbering in their excitement, had all they could do, until they lifted her bodily from the porch. They handled {{her as if she}} had been a half-empty sack of corn. One holding each hand and <b>foot</b> they <b>packed</b> her, with dress disarranged and half torn off, down the path to the lane and down the lane to the road. There they stood upright and pushed her off her property.|$|R
50|$|Blair Gap, one of {{the gaps}} of the Allegheny is a water gap along the eastern face atop the Allegheny Ridge or Allegheny Front escarpment.

5000|$|Within {{a couple}} of years five of the {{original}} investors reorganized and refinanced the project, but since the Harvard telescope had been removed, and interest in Mt. Wilson had tailed off, they thought it better to downsize the project from a twelve-foot road to a four-foot road. By June 1891, after only five months work, a usable ten mile (16 km) trail was established. In July the new toll road was officially opened to the public and the toll fixed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors at 25 cents for hikers (...) and 50 cents for horseback. The new road was called the [...] "New Mt. Wilson Trail", and it soon became more popular than the old Sierra Madre trail. <b>Foot</b> and <b>pack</b> animal traffic became so heavy that in June 1893 the trail was widened to six feet, making two way travel much easier.|$|R
6000|$|Mose set his <b>foot</b> to the <b>pack</b> and [...] "pinched" [...] the hitch in front. Nothing {{remained}} now but the pick, shovel, {{and coffee}} can. The tools he crowded under the ropes on either side, tied the cans under the pack {{at the back}} and called Kintuck, [...] "Come on, boy." [...] The old horse with shining eyes drew near. Catching his mane, Mose swung to the saddle, Kintuck nipped the laden cayuse, and they were off while the next best man was still worrying over the hitch.|$|R
50|$|Anticipating a Pakistani {{attack on}} the glacier {{at the start of}} the spring thaw in 1984, a full Kumaon {{battalion}} led by Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) D.K. Khanna, marched on <b>foot</b> with full <b>packs</b> and equipment for weeks in the dead of the winter across Zoji La, through the world's toughest terrain, highest altitudes and most forbidding climate. Naik (later Subedar/Honorary Captain) Ram Mehar Singh was awarded the Shaurya Chakra for his gallant role during the move. This turned out to be a vital move that enabled Indian victory in Operation Meghdoot.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} twenty years, {{even as the}} {{population}} grew westward crossing the Appalachian Mountains with the admission of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio and then doubled in size by 1803, {{the only means of}} transportation between the interior lands and the coastal states remained on water, by canoe, boat (e.g. keelboat flatboat) and ship, or over land on <b>foot</b> and by <b>pack</b> animal. Recognizing the success of Roman roads in unifying that empire, political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation.|$|R
50|$|Such material-saving flat arches {{occur in}} ancient bridges of the Veneto region quite frequently, leading to {{suggestions}} {{of a local}} building school. One reason for this concentration {{may have been the}} particular topography of the coastal region, whose soft alluvial soils would not have been suitable for the massive semi-circular arches and piers characteristic for Roman bridge building. Moreover, the approaches of segmental arch bridges, with their lower crest, provided less of an obstacle to <b>foot</b> traffic and <b>pack</b> animals, an obvious advantage in the flat Venetian landscape.|$|R
