5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|The {{other key}} room was the Cabinet Room. Until {{the opening of}} the Battle of France, which began on 10 May 1940, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's war cabinet met at the War Rooms only once, in October 1939. Following Winston Churchill's {{appointment}} as Prime Minister, Churchill visited the Cabinet Room in May 1940 and declared: 'This is the room <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> will direct the war'. In total 115 Cabinet meetings were held at the Cabinet War Rooms, the last on 28 March 1945, when the German V-weapon bombing campaign came to an end.|$|E
25|$|The Director is an {{irritable}} {{and impatient}} man, his annoyance likely {{exacerbated by the}} fact that he has another appointment, “a caucus”, to attend and his time there is limited. He expresses concern with the overall appearance and demands that the coat and hat be removed leaving the man “shivering” in his “old grey pyjamas.” He has the man’s fists unclenched and then joined, the only suggestion of his Assistant’s that he pays any heed to; once arranged at breast-height he is satisfied. (Beckett explained to James Knowlson that when he was composing Catastrophe, “In my mind was Dupuytren’s contracture (<b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> suffer) which reduces hands to claws.”) The Director dismisses his Assistant’s proposal to have the man gagged (“This craze for explicitation!”) or to “show his face … just for an instant.” He also has her make notes to whiten all the exposed flesh.|$|E

Universal considered replacing him on screen with Tom Conway—as they subsequently did with the radio series—but instead decided to end the series, despite still having the rights {{for the next three}} years. In October 1946, shortly {{after the end of the}} series, Neill died of a heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Percy Shelley's death, Mary Shelley {{determined}} {{to write his}} biography. In a letter of 17 November 1822, she announced: [...] "I shall write his life—& thus occupy myself in the only manner <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> can derive consolation." [...] However, her father-in-law, Sir Timothy Shelley, effectively banned her from doing so. Mary began her fostering of Percy's poetic reputation in 1824 {{with the publication of}} his Posthumous Poems. In 1839, while she was working on the Lives, she prepared a new edition of his poetry, which became, in the words of literary scholar Susan J. Wolfson, [...] "the canonizing event" [...] in the history of her husband's reputation. The following year, Mary Shelley edited a volume of her husband's essays, letters, translations, and fragments, and throughout the 1830s, she introduced his poetry to a wider audience by publishing assorted works in the annual The Keepsake.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Lincoln's assassination, Lowell {{was asked}} to present a poem at Harvard in memory of {{graduates}} killed in the war. His poem, [...] "Commemoration Ode", cost him sleep and his appetite, but was delivered on July 21, 1865, after a 48-hour writing binge. Lowell had high hopes for his performance but was overshadowed by the other notables presenting works that day, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. [...] "I {{did not make the}} hit I expected", he wrote, [...] "and am ashamed at having been tempted again to think I could write poetry, a delusion <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> have been tolerably free these dozen years." [...] Despite his personal assessment, friends and other poets sent many letters to Lowell congratulating him. Emerson referred to his poem's [...] "high thought & sentiment" [...] and James Freeman Clarke noted its [...] "grandeur of tone". Lowell later expanded it with a strophe to Lincoln.|$|E

500|$|Lody {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} at {{a grocery store}} in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join {{the crew of the}} sailing ship Sirius as a cabin boy. He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, [...] "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> suffered in Italy on account of the bad water at Genoa." [...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight. As Lody put it, [...] "Consequently, my career as a seaman was closed as soon as I discovered that, and my doctor told me that I could not go any further." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1846, Joaquim Inácio sailed the Constituição to Devonport (then-known as Plymouth Dock) in the United Kingdom, {{where the}} ship was to undergo repairs. He paid a visit there to the elderly Thomas Cochrane, Marquis of Maranhão, who queried him {{regarding}} Brazil's state of affairs. Joaquim Inácio returned to Brazil in May 1847 and was assigned to bureaucratic tasks. In April 1848, he was stationed, again {{at the helm of}} the Constituição, in Bahia province. Later that year, the Praieira revolt erupted in the nearby province of Pernambuco. In early November, Joaquim Inácio assumed the command of the fleet protecting Recife, capital of Pernambuco. He sent many of his sailors ashore to aid in the town's defense. Recife was attacked by rebels on 2 February 1849. The insurgent attackers were defeated, and soon afterward the last rebellion of Brazil's imperial era came to an end. Joaquim Inácio, who fought in the streets with his men, later remarked: [...] "It was not a battle, but a diabolical hunt <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> have escaped by miracle." [...] He was awarded with a promotion to captain of sea and war on 14 March.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003, in The Atlantic magazine, {{interviewer}} Jennie Rothenberg Gritz quoted Goldhagen {{saying that}} [...] "moral issues" [...] are the [...] "principal substance" [...] of A Moral Reckoning, that his concern was a [...] "consideration of culpability and repair". In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, Goldhagen said that [...] "the book's real content" [...] is in [...] "setting forth general principles for moral repair <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> derive concrete proposals for the Church". Donald Dietrich, author of God and Humanity in Auschwitz: Jewish-Christian Relations and Sanctioned Murder, and a Boston College professor of Theology specializing in Holocaust studies, said that Goldhagen [...] "asks the Catholic Church a question: 'What must a religion of love and goodness do to confront its history of hatred and harm, to make amends with its victims, and to right itself so that it is no longer the source of hatred and harm that, whatever its past, it would no longer endorse?' He has attempted to analyze the moral culpability of Catholics and their leaders, to judge the actors, and to discern how today's Catholics can make material, political and moral restitution." ...|$|E

500|$|Kempelen would {{inform the}} player that the Turk {{would use the}} white pieces and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it {{threatened}} its opponent's queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move. Louis Dutens, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine [...] "by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent {{was not to be}} so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> had moved her". Kempelen {{made it a point to}} traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.|$|E

2500|$|The grand {{trunk road}} is {{mentioned}} {{in a number}} of literary works including those of Foster and Rudyard Kipling. Kipling described the road as: [...] "Look!

It is to me as a river <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> am withdrawn like a log after a flood. And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs straight, bearing without crowding India's traffic for fifteen hundred miles – such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two {{planned to}} live {{together}} after Edleston grew older, but the two parted and Byron would never see the boy again as Edleston died from consumption in 1811. As well as spending time with friends, Byron did join in {{with the rest of}} the community; however, he did not enjoy this time because, as he said, [...] "I could not share in the commonplace libertinism of the place and time without disgust.
