5|$|In India, {{there are}} efforts to 'grade up', or {{improve the quality}} of, the native desi sheep breed, by {{crossing}} it with Merino and other <b>high-quality</b> wool sheep. This is being done {{in an effort to}} produce a desi sheep that produces <b>high-quality</b> wool and mutton.|$|E
5|$|Oysters {{come from}} the Oléron-Marennes basin, while mussels {{come from the}} Bay of Aiguillon. <b>High-quality</b> produce comes from the region's hinterland, {{especially}} goat cheese. This region and in the Vendée is grazing ground for Parthenaise cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans. The region of Poitou-Charentes purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also made in the region along the Charente River. Limousin {{is home to the}} <b>high-quality</b> Limousin cattle, as well as high quality sheep. The woodlands offer game and <b>high-quality</b> mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from Périgord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvements}} {{beginning in}} the 17th century resulted in the enclosure of the commons and ultimately in the Victoria era the emergence of large and well-managed farms using a five-shift rotation system and producing <b>high-quality</b> beef cattle.|$|E
5|$|Because linear probing is {{especially}} sensitive to unevenly distributed hash values, {{it is important}} to combine it with a <b>high-quality</b> hash function that does not produce such irregularities.|$|E
5|$|Established by the University of Chester and Shropshire Council, the University Centre {{is focused}} on <b>high-quality</b> {{teaching}} and research, fostering entrepreneurship, contributing to the community and, ultimately, making a global impact.|$|E
5|$|Four {{streams in}} Juniata County are {{considered}} <b>high-quality</b> coldwater fisheries. There {{are also some}} Class A Wild Trout Waters in the northern and western parts of the county.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved to}} the East from California, {{as it was the}} center of <b>high-quality</b> playing. He began his {{competitive}} professional playing career in Brooklyn, New York, , at about 27 years of age.|$|E
5|$|<b>High-quality</b> fruits {{come from}} the Loire Valley and central France, {{including}} cherries grown for the liqueur Guignolet and the 'Belle Angevine' pears. The strawberries and melons are also of high quality. Fish are seen in the cuisine, often served with a beurre blanc sauce, as well as wild game, lamb, calves, Charolais cattle, Géline fowl, and <b>high-quality</b> goat cheeses. Young vegetables are used often in the cuisine, as are the specialty mushrooms of the region, champignons de Paris. Vinegars from Orléans are a specialty ingredient used as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{industry}} demanding purity (food, pharmaceutical, drinking water), <b>high-quality</b> {{hydrochloric acid}} {{is used to}} control the pH of process water streams. In less-demanding industry, technical quality hydrochloric acid suffices for neutralizing waste streams and swimming pool pH control.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is known}} for its <b>high-quality</b> cocoa and vanilla, much of which are exported. In the coastal areas of Madagascar or in upscale inland restaurants, vanilla may be used to prepare savory sauces for poultry.|$|E
5|$|The A82 has a {{wide variety}} of {{junctions}} along its length, ranging from <b>high-quality</b> grade-separated interchanges near Glasgow, to simple T-junctions in the Scottish Highlands.|$|E
5|$|They are well-suited for {{rough grazing}} land and will utilise coarse grasses other breeds would shun. They are able to {{maintain}} a good condition on less than ideal pasture, and produce <b>high-quality</b> beef on grass alone.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species of}} fish inhabit most of the tributaries of Catawissa Creek. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection {{considers}} eleven tributaries of the creek to be Coldwater Fisheries. Another is a Coldwater Fishery for part of its length and a <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery for the other part. An additional twelve tributaries are <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fisheries for their entire lengths. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission considers eleven tributaries to be Class A Wild Trout Waters. Five tributaries have been observed to be devoid of fish life, and one other is suspected to lack fish as well. Most of the remaining tributaries are inhabited by between one and fourteen {{species of fish}}.|$|E
5|$|Although the A303 as a {{whole is}} {{designed}} {{to be part of a}} route from London to Exeter, a popular alternative is to take the M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5. Although this is a <b>high-quality</b> motorway route throughout, it is a considerably further distance.|$|E
5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{had a short}} {{lifespan}} {{and limited}} third-party support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative, including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio and Shenmue, as well as <b>high-quality</b> ports from Sega's NAOMI arcade system board. The Dreamcast {{was also the first}} console to include a built-in modem for Internet support and online play.|$|E
5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as a <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds of {{all but two of}} its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, Sorber Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even higher than those of <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness Trout Streams in Wyoming County. Wild trout naturally reproduce throughout all of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named streams in the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Most hold this designation for brook trout only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow trout, either instead of or in addition to brook trout.|$|E
5|$|D mode {{is present}} in all graphite-like carbons and {{originates}} from structural defects. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} G/D modes is conventionally used to quantify the structural quality of carbon nanotubes. <b>High-quality</b> nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} {{in the area around}} the colliery caused by subsidence led to it becoming uneconomic despite its sitting on large reserves of <b>high-quality</b> coal, and it was closed in 1968. The site was cleared and is now occupied by the City of Manchester Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Despite not {{charting}} in any country, Folk Singer received critical acclaim; most reviewers praised its <b>high-quality</b> sound, {{especially on}} remastered versions, {{as well as}} the instrumentation. In 2003, the album was ranked number 280 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|During 1978 and 1979, for {{the album}}'s tenth anniversary, EMI reissued the album pressed on limited edition white vinyl in several countries. In 1981, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) issued a unique half-speed master {{variation}} of the album using the sound from the original master recording. The discs were pressed on <b>high-quality</b> virgin vinyl.|$|E
5|$|Few <b>high-quality</b> {{studies have}} been {{performed}} which demonstrate that stress causes or worsens acne. While the connection between acne and stress has been debated, some research indicates that increased severity is associated with high stress levels in certain contexts such as hormonal changes seen in premenstrual syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Flint {{and brown}} or yellow brick is used extensively, both for {{buildings}} within the conservation area and in associated {{structures such as}} boundary walls and pavements. Some kerbs are of granite, limestone and flint, while some <b>high-quality</b> Yorkstone paving slabs survive, along with some red-brick pavements.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{takeover}} of Dorking Coaches in the late 1990s, a coaching division was set up using the same name, under the management of former Traffic Manager John Gaff. It operated <b>high-quality</b> coaches, including three air-conditioned vehicles which joined the fleet in 2000, on coach hire and tour work.|$|E
5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much more durable than traditional woodcuts. The result was <b>high-quality</b> illustration at a low price.|$|E
5|$|<b>High-quality</b> {{hydrochloric}} acid {{is used in}} the regeneration of ion exchange resins. Cation exchange is widely used to remove ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ from aqueous solutions, producing demineralized water. The acid is used to rinse the cations from the resins. Na+ is replaced with H+ and Ca2+ with 2 H+.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Sega {{restructured}} {{its internal}} studios {{in preparation for}} the Saturn's launch. To ensure <b>high-quality</b> 3D games would be available early in the Saturn's life, and to create a more energetic working environment, developers from Sega's arcade division were asked to create console games. New teams, such as Panzer Dragoon developer Team Andromeda, were formed during this time.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-digital period, IBM offered Aldine, a font {{inspired}} by Bembo, as a font for the IBM Composer. This was an ultra-premium electric golfball typewriter system, intended for producing copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects, or for <b>high-quality</b> office documents. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, {{as it was}} displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, {{and then in the}} 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers.|$|E
5|$|Master thief Arsène Lupin III and his colleague, Daisuke Jigen, {{flee the}} Monte Carlo Casino with huge {{quantities}} of stolen money. They escape in Lupin's Fiat 500, but Lupin recognizes the bills as distinctively <b>high-quality</b> counterfeits. Deciding {{to seek out}} the source, they head to the Grand Duchy of Cagliostro, the alleged wellspring of the counterfeits.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery, as is its tributary Negro Hollow. Both Messers Run (from Lofty Reservoir downstream to Blue Head Reservoir) and Negro Hollow (between its headwaters and its mouth) are also considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters. A 1997 report advised against stocking Messers Run.|$|E
5|$|Paris and Île-de-France {{are central}} regions where almost {{anything}} from the country is available, as all train lines meet in the city. Over 9,000 restaurants exist in Paris and almost any cuisine can be obtained here. <b>High-quality</b> Michelin Guide-rated restaurants proliferate here.|$|E
5|$|Poultry is {{the second}} most widely eaten type of meat {{globally}} and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing <b>high-quality</b> protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked {{in order to reduce the}} risk of food poisoning.|$|E
5|$|She took {{a lively}} {{interest}} in affairs of state, {{and was a}} patroness of theatre, poetry and music. She subsidised George Frideric Handel with £200 a year. She sponsored <b>high-quality</b> medals as rewards for political or military achievements. They were produced at the Mint by Isaac Newton and John Croker. She knighted Newton when she visited Cambridge in 1705.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 NFL Draft was {{considered}} to be the worst draft class in many years, with only eight <b>high-quality</b> prospects, as compared to the normal 27 or 28. The popularity of the wishbone offense among college teams left the draft devoid of quarterback prospects. A drawing held the previous December gave the Buccaneers the rights to the first overall selection.|$|E
5|$|The Film Library {{also held}} <b>high-quality</b> {{original}} film sequences made for insertion into videotaped episodes. Some of these, {{such as those}} from Episodes 1–2 of The Daleks' Master Plan, survive to this day. Other junked sequences were mistakenly entered into a film library computer system, leading to an impression that they had existed for years afterward, and inaccurate speculation that the BBC was still destroying clips well into the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The Leuchtenberg Gallery was the {{collection}} of artworks of the Dukes of Leuchtenberg, on public display in Munich. The collection was widely known in 19th-century Europe, due to being {{open to the public}} and having a <b>high-quality</b> illustrated catalogue in different languages, and was {{considered one of the most}} important private collections of the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} for the flying {{sequences}} involved simply catapulting a crash test dummy out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman flying around. Both were discarded {{due to lack of}} movement. <b>High-quality,</b> realistic-looking animation was tried, with speed trails added to make the effect more convincing.|$|E
