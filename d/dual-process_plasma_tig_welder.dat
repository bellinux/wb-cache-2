5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 60s, Belletti moved his workshop into a larger space in Rodano, a town in the province of Milan and, thanks to a loan granted to him by Artigiancassa, invested in the purchase of a <b>TIG</b> <b>welder,</b> a welding technique still relatively unused in Italy in those years. The purchase of this equipment allowed him to specialize in TIG welding.|$|R
5000|$|The {{model maker}} must be highly skilled {{in the use}} of many machines, such as manual lathes, manual mills, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machines, lasers, wire EDM, water jet saws, <b>tig</b> <b>welders,</b> sheet metal {{fabrication}} tools and wood working tools. Fabrication processes model makers take part in are powder coating, shearing, punching, plating, folding, forming and anodizing. Some model makers also use increasingly automated processes, for example cutting parts directly with digital data from computer-aided design plans on a CNC mill or creating the parts through rapid prototyping. Hand tools used by a model maker are an exacto knife, tweezers, sprue cutter, tape, glue, paint, and paint brushes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Single-chip {{microcomputer}} MSP 430 F 44 is {{the core}} control chip of the multifunction TIG welding controller, MCU is produced by TI and 16 -bit flash type, the chip control system uses C 430 language to modular software programming, coordination with other subroutines by the main program module, through a simple interface conditioning circuitry on a <b>TIG</b> <b>welder</b> can achieve a variety of welding processes, the welding flexible demand is satisfied. One {{of the most important}} module of the welding current waveform generator module, the welding waveform parameters are automatically generated by two way, one is the welding methods, the other is the welding parameters, then judge the input signal of the welding gun, when the gun is pressed, the corresponding waveform output; the welding current waveform output can be achieved using this software, is displayed on the welding current waveform generator...|$|R
50|$|Welding power {{supplies}} may also use generators or alternators to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Modern designs are usually {{driven by an}} internal combustion engine but older machines may use an electric motor to drive an alternator or generator. In this configuration the utility power is converted first into mechanical energy then back into electrical energy to achieve the step-down effect similar to a transformer. Because {{the output of the}} generator can be direct current, or even a higher frequency AC, these older machines can produce DC from AC without any need for rectifiers of any type, or can also be used for implementing formerly-used variations on so-called heliarc (most often now called <b>TIG)</b> <b>welders,</b> where the need for a higher frequency add-on module box is avoided by the alternator simply producing higher frequency ac current directly.|$|R
40|$|Background: Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding and Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding {{are widely}} used for mild steel {{segments}} in basic metal industries. Pulmonary problems such as asthma, pulmonary inflammation, hyper-responsiveness of airways and higher susceptibility to infections are reported {{as the result of}} occupational exposure of welders to ozone and nitrogen oxides. Potent oxidizing agents like ozone and nitrogen oxides are also reported to be a precursor for respiratory problems and cause lipid peroxidation of membranes. Materials and Methods: A total of 43 nonsmoking MIG and <b>TIG</b> <b>welders</b> and 41 nonsmoking workers without appreciable exposure to any chemicals as the control population were chosen to participate in this study. Occupational exposure to ozone was monitored according to the validated methods. Malondialdehyde (MDA) of blood serum as a biomarker for lipid peroxidation was analyzed using Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Data obtained from this study were analyzed using t-test, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{the results of}} tests on 50 H 21 G 9 N 4 and H 9 S 2 valve steels with pad welded {{stellite}} layers are presented. Basic properties such as tribological and erosion resistance as well as high temperature oxidation resistance were determined. Testing conditions were accepted with certain simplification owing {{to the complexity of}} mechanical and thermal load exhaust valves and, therefore, they do not reflect real operating conditions accurately. Specimens with and without laser, <b>plasma</b> and <b>TIG</b> pad welded stellite layers were subject to tests. The conducted tests showed the highest tribological resistance of stellite layers under the conditions of dry friction in comparison with the material in the initial state as well as <b>plasma</b> and <b>TIG</b> pad welded stellite layers. The main mechanism of the abrasive wear of the surface layer is an adhesive wear by breaking the connections and adhesions that are being formed. The research on wear by abrasive erosion showed a smaller decrease in the mass of specimens with pad welded stellite layers in comparison with <b>plasma</b> and <b>TIG</b> pad welded stellite layers as well as the material in the initial form without the pad welded stellite layer. The resistance of stellite layers to high temperature oxidation was showed in the research on heat resistance. Moreover, it was found that pad welding does not have any significant influence on the heat resistance of stellite layers...|$|R
40|$|This work {{consists}} of a literature survey of a laser surface cladding in order to investigate techniques to improve the cladding rate for the process. The high local heat input caused by the high power density of the laser generates stresses and the process is consider as slow when large areas are processed. To avoid these disadvantages the laser cladding process velocity can be increased {{three or four times}} by use of preheated wire instead of the powder delivery system. If laser cladding is combined with <b>plasma,</b> <b>TIG,</b> MIG etc the process shows similar results. Another way to avoid the advantages is use of an additional power source, suitable for the laser cladding process. Induction heating is a good, easily adjusted and adaptable technique for this purpose. Investigation of two steels has shown {{that it is possible to}} produce crack free cladding layers by preheating the substrate by induction heating. Godkänd; 2000; 20080525 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|Tungsten {{inert gas}} (TIG) welding {{represents}} {{one of the most widely}} used metal joining processes in industry. It has been shown to generate a large majority of particles at the nanoscale and to have low mass emission rates when compared to other types of welding. Despite evidence that TIG fume particles may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), limited data is available for the time course changes of particle-associated oxidative stress in exposed <b>TIG</b> <b>welders.</b> Twenty non-smoking male welding apprentices were exposed to TIG welding fumes for 60  min under controlled, well-ventilated settings. Exhaled breathe condensate (EBC), blood and urine were collected before exposure, immediately after exposure, 1  h and 3  h post exposure. Volunteers participated in a control day to account for oxidative stress fluctuations due to circadian rhythm. Biological liquids were assessed for total reducing capacity, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) concentrations at each time point. A linear mixed model was used to assess within day and between day differences. Significant increases in the measured biomarkers were found at 3  h post exposure. At 3  h post exposure, we found a 24  % increase in plasma-H 2 O 2 concentrations ([95 %CI: 4  % to 46  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 01); a 91  % increase in urinary-H 2 O 2 ([2  % to 258  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 04); a 14  % increase in plasma- 8 -OHdG ([0  % to 31  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 049); and a 45  % increase in urinary- 8 -OHdG ([3  % to 105  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 03). Doubling particle number concentration (PNC) exposure was associated with a 22  % increase of plasma- 8 -OHdG at 3  h post exposure (p[*]=[*] 0. 01). A 60 -min exposure to TIG welding fume in a controlled, well-ventilated setting induced acute oxidative stress at 3  h post exposure in healthy, non-smoking apprentice welders not chronically exposed to welding fumes. As mass concentration of TIG welding fume particles is very low when compared to other types of welding, it is recommended that additional exposure metrics such as PNC are considered for occupational risk assessments. Our findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness of TIG welding fume toxicity, especially given the realities of welding workplaces that may lack ventilation; and beliefs among interviewed <b>welders</b> that <b>TIG</b> represents a cleaner and safer welding process...|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of laser light and an electrical arc into an amalgamated welding process has existed since the 1970s, but {{has only recently}} been used in industrial applications. There are three main types of hybrid welding process, depending on the arc used: <b>TIG,</b> <b>plasma</b> arc or MIG augmented laser welding. While TIG-augmented laser welding {{was the first to}} be researched, MIG is the first to go into industry and is commonly known as hybrid laser welding.|$|R
40|$|The {{activated}} flux coated wires {{are used}} to examine the effect of the fluxes on the weld penetration of the magnesium alloy. A series of emission spectroscopy of arc <b>plasma</b> for <b>TIG</b> welding for magnesium with normal wire and activated flux coated wire are developed. It is found that intensities of emission spectra of Mg I increase significantly when the flux wires are used. All the flux coated wire can increase the weld penetration of the TIG welding. The electron temperature and electron density of welding plasma are estimated. The result indicated that the electron temperature of arc plasma decrease when the flux coated wires are used; on the contrary, the electron density of the plasma got enhanced. It is believed that the current density increases with the electron density increase, {{which is one of the}} reasons that the penetration depth increase when the flux wires are used.

For experimental testing, material X 2 CrTi 12 (ferritic stainless steel) was chosen, welded by means of methods suitable for the material. Welding methods included <b>TIG,</b> <b>plasma,</b> and laser. Further possibilities of heat input are suggested, such as pulse welding, Rapid, Fast Root, Surface Tension Transfer, Cold Metal Transfer, ColdArc, and Wise.

40|$|The {{antigravity}} {{welding processes}} {{are defined as}} the welding processes where the welding molten metal has the natural tendency to flow. There are cases when it is necessary a very carefully technological and equipment designing activity to make efficient the mechanized antigravity welding. That was the reason to establish theoretically and experimentally some limits for the mechanized position welding parameters, with the view to obtain in a maximum productivity with imposed quality rules. For this purpose, a mathematical model of the forces that act towards the welding bath has been created. It was also necessary to verify experimentally the model and to offer some useful indications for designers and welders. Original laboratory research equipment was designed, was manufactured and was used for different experiments.

The {{major part of}} the paper is dedicated to welding of 20 % Cr- 5 % Al steel with 3 mm in thickness. Welding was carried out with five different welding processes, i. e., manual metal-arc, MIG, <b>TIG,</b> <b>plasma</b> arc, and laser beam welding process, using a filler material and using no filler material, respectively. The welded joints obtained were subjected to mechanical tests and the analysis of microstructure in the weld metal and the transition zone.

40|$|A técnica de soldagem apresenta vantagem de união de partes metálicas que permite melhora na adaptação e uniformidade na distribuição das forças mastigatórias, minimizando falhas no tratamento reabilitador. O objetivo foi avaliar a resistência {{flexural}} entre três métodos de soldagem diferentes: Chama Direta a maçarico, método TIG - Tungstênio gás inerte (Soldadora NTY - Kernit, Brasil) e o método de solda a Laser (Soldadora Desktop - Dentaurum, Alemanha) comparando a um grupo controle (Monobloco). Os espécimes cilíndricos foram obtidos a partir de canais de cera pré-fabricados com 3 mm de diâmetro e 30 mm de comprimento, fundidos em liga de Ni-Cr e seccionados transversalmente, formando os grupos T 1 e L 1. Depois da secção, dez espécimes dos grupos L e T receberam chanfros em 45 ° para preenchimento, formando os grupos (L 2 e T 2). As extremidades foram unidas com resina acrílica obedecendo a uma distância pré-determinada, de 0, 3 mm para o grupo chama direta, 0, 1 mm para o grupo TIG e juntas do tipo topo a topo para o grupo laser. Os corpos foram incluídos e soldados de acordo com a proposição. Após a soldagem os corpos de prova foram torneados e levados ao teste de flexão. Os dados foram submetidos aos testes estatísticos (ANOVA e Student-Newman-Keuls - p < 0, 05) para comparações múltiplas. De acordo com os resultados (MPa) o grupo M (1796, 55) obteve o maior valor, seguindo pelo grupo C(1370, 56), ficando o grupo T 1 (990, 84) com o valor menor. Não houve diferença estatística entre os grupos soldados, existindo somente diferença entre os grupos de teste para o grupo controle em monobloco. No entanto podemos afirmar que o preenchimento parece influenciar discretamente os resultados da resistência flexural no grupo TIG. Conclui-se que o método TIG produz resultado semelhante ao laser e a chama direta, o que é clínica e operacionalmente importante. The {{welding technique}} presents advantage of union of metallic parts that improves the adaptation and appropriate {{distribution of the}} bite forces, minimizing flaws in the dental prostheses. The objective was to evaluate the flexural strength in different welding methods: Brazing; Laser (Welder Desktop - Dentaurum, Germany) and Tungsten inert gas - <b>TIG</b> (<b>Welder</b> NTY - Kernit, Brazil), comparing to a control group (non-welded). The cylindrical specimens were obtained from prefabricated wax conduits with 3 mm of diameter and 30 mm of length, melted in Ni-Cr alloys and split up transversally, forming the groups T 1 and L 1. After of the section the groups L and T received slices in 45 ° for fulfill, forming the groups (L 2 and T 2). The extremities were united with acrylic resin obeying a predetermined distance, from 0, 3 mm to the brazing group, 0, 1 mm to the TIG group, and in the laser group there wasnt́ any space between the extremities of jointing. The specimes were included and welding {{in agreement with the}} proposition, turned and conducted to the flexion test. The data were submitted to the statistical test (ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls - p< 0, 05) for multiple comparisons. According to the results (MPa) the control group (1796, 55) obtained the largest average value, followed by the brazing group (1370, 56), being the group T 1 (990, 84) with the smallest value. In terms of statistics {{there was no difference between}} the groups with welding, existing only difference among the tested groups for the control group. However, we can affirm that the completion seems to influence the results of the resistance flexural discreetly in the TIG group. It can be concluded that the TIG method produces similar result to the laser and the brazing, what is clinical and important operationally...|$|R

Main conclusion is that the maximum of the diagrams, which characterise the effect of taper angle for sharpened electrodes, were at taper angle of 20 - 30 °. The properties of the red and the black electrodes are running collaterally. Despite of them the characteristics of the gold electrode shift to higher taper angles causing by the high La 02 content of the electrode.

40|$|Conventionally, <b>TIG,</b> <b>plasma</b> arc, {{electron}} beam and CO 2 laser welding {{have been used}} to join titanium alloys. To date, little has been reported on the weldability of titanium alloys using high power Nd: YAG lasers. This work reports on the effect of joint gap on the characteristics of 3. 05 -mm thick Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy welded using a 4 kW Nd: YAG laser. Examination of butt welded Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy indicated that full penetration is possible up to a joint gap of 0. 5 mm. The main defects in the welds consisted of underfill and porosity. The application of filler wire during welding was observed to reduce the underfill defect. The porosity increased with increasing joint gap, although it remained less than 1 % of the fusion zone area. The tensile properties seemed optimal at an intermediary gap size (0. 2 - 0. 3 mm), most likely due to a balance between underfill and porosity defects. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Inconel 713 C {{precision}} castings {{are used}} as aircraft engine components exposed to high temperatures and the aggressive exhaust gas environment. Industrial experience has shown that precision-cast components of such complexity contain casting defects like microshrinkage, porosity, and cracks. This necessitates the development of repair technologies for castings of this type. This paper {{presents the results of}} metallographic examinations of melted areas and clad welds on the Inconel 713 C nickel-based superalloy, made by <b>TIG,</b> <b>plasma</b> arc, and laser. The cladding process was carried out on model test plates {{in order to determine the}} technological and material-related problems connected with the weldability of Inconel 713 C. The studies included analyses of the macro- and microstructure of the clad welds, the base materials, and the heat-affected zones. The results of the structural analyses of the clad welds indicate that Inconel 713 C should be classified as a low-weldability material. In the clad welds made by laser, cracks were identified mainly in the heat-affected zone and at the melted zone interface, crystals were formed on partially-melted grains. Cracks of this type were not identified in the clad welds made using the plasma-arc method. It has been concluded that due to the possibility of manual cladding and the absence of welding imperfections, the technology having the greatest potential for application is plasma-arc cladding...|$|R
