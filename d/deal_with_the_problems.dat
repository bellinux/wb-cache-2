Estimates {{of the size of the}} crowd range from 30,000 to 70,000. Shops and government offices closed for the event, special trains brought people into the city. Steam-ships carrying spectators accompanied the competing champions, and hundreds of smaller, private vessels crowded the river. Special Regulations were published by the Marine Board of the NSW Government to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of regulating maritime traffic during the event.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxon kings ruled through ealdormen, who had {{the highest}} lay status under the king. In ninth-century Wessex they each ruled a single shire, but {{by the middle of}} the tenth they had {{authority}} over a much wider area, a change probably introduced by Æthelstan to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of governing his extended realm. One of the ealdormen, who was also called Æthelstan, governed the eastern Danelaw territory of East Anglia, the largest and wealthiest province of England. After the king's death, he became so powerful that he was known as Æthelstan Half-King. Several of the ealdormen who witnessed charters had Scandinavian names, and while the localities they came from cannot be identified, they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led Danish armies in the time of Edward the Elder, and who were retained by Æthelstan as his representatives in local government.|$|E
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E

25|$|West Midlands Police {{struggled}} {{to operate on}} the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated and helpless on the estate.

The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic enough to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> on the estate. By 1992, 41% of residents said they were victims of crime and 55% said they were afraid to go out at night.|$|E

He eventually secured an assignment with the Intelligence Corps and additional training. His military career continued with assignment to the War Office in Whitehall, where he was attached to the section known as Military Intelligence (Liaison), and later—for a short time—to the Cabinet Office to serve on the Secretariat of the Joint Intelligence Committee, securing promotions along the way.|$|E

25|$|Few {{industrialists}} {{were prepared}} for the Wall Street Crash of October 1929. Though Studebaker's production and sales had been booming, the market collapsed and plans were laid for a new, small, low-cost car—the Rockne. However, times were too bad to sell even inexpensive cars. Within a year, the firm was cutting wages and laying off workers. Erskine maintained faith in the Rockne and rashly had the directors declare huge dividends in 1930 and 1931. He also acquired 95% of the White Motor Company's stock at an inflated price and in cash. By 1933, the banks were owed $6 million, though current assets exceeded that figure. On March 18, 1933, Studebaker entered receivership. Erskine was pushed out of the presidency {{in favor of more}} cost-conscious managers. Albert R. Erskine committed suicide on July 1, 1933, leaving it to successors Harold Vance and Paul Hoffman to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Civic Administration of Thimphu city is the {{responsibility}} of the Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC). It was established in 1995 through a royal decree. It became an autonomous corporation in 1999, following the enactment of the Municipal Act of 1999. Its headquarters is at the Lungtenzampa zone of Thimphu. The corporation is headed by a mayor (currently Dasho Nima Wangdi) who is called Thrompon in the Bhutanese language. The mayor is appointed by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS). An executive committee comprising 17 members governs the corporation; 8 members are elected from 6 zones and 7 members are nominated from government organizations and meet nearly every 6 weeks. However, its capacity to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> is hindered by lack of adequate staff (without any proportionate increase in staff strength to deal with its large jurisdiction) and its expenditure far outstrips the revenue earned. In order to provide cost effective services, the Corporation (as the regulating body) has contemplated privatization of public services, particularly water supply, solid waste, sewerage and parking.|$|E

[...] He had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. [...] Wood was available, but the mill was built [...] away, making transport time consuming. [...] Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and working equipment. [...] Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort's construction. [...] As a result, only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters (four duplexes and post commandant's house) was built by 1844, and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed. [...] In his 1844 inspection of the fort, Colonel George Croghan reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott [...] "above average".|$|E
500|$|Before, {{during and}} after his mayoralty, Sharpe {{played a major role}} in {{promoting}} sanitary reform, often meeting considerable opposition and needing to use his oratorical, political and persuasive skills to the full. A campaign to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> had been initiated in 1847 by two Lancaster doctors, Thomas Howitt and Edward Denis de Vitre. [...] Sharpe joined them, drawing extensively on his experience of having accompanied Professor Richard Owen (born and educated in Lancaster) on his tour of inspection of the town in 1844. In 1848 Robert Rawlinson, also from Lancaster, was appointed as local surveyor, and published a further report that recommended new sewers and drains and the construction of a waterworks. Although Sharpe agreed in principle with the report, he was not satisfied with its details. Later that year, which was during his mayoralty, he travelled to London with the town clerk and a former mayor to meet representatives of the General Board of Health, including its chairman, Lord Morpeth, and its secretary Edwin Chadwick. [...] As a result of this meeting, the Board of Health appointed James Smith from Scotland as an inspector, and commissioned him to produce a further report on Lancaster's problems. Smith's investigation took place in January 1849, and his report was received in July. In his conclusions, Smith noted that Lancaster was favourably situated to provide a healthy environment for its inhabitants, and that this could be achieved by [...] "a complete and constant supply of pure and soft water, and... a thorough system of drainage and sewerage". Subsequently, an Act of Parliament gave approval for these measures to be carried out, and in 1852 royal assent was given for the waterworks to be constructed. Delays, disputes and controversies continued, until the waterworks was eventually opened in 1855, when work on the drainage and sewage systems was already under way. [...] This enabled underground pipes for the two systems to be laid simultaneously. Sharpe had played a significant part in arranging Queen Victoria's visit to Lancaster in October 1851, and with Paley designed four triumphal arches for the occasion. [...] He also took part in the proceedings on the day, escorting the Queen, Prince Albert, and the Prince of Wales (the future KingEdward VII) to the top of the castle tower.|$|E
