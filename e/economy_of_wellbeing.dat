40|$|This paper {{begins to}} link the earlier ‘Bath’ {{research}} into welfare regimes in developing countries with the WeD research into wellbeing in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Peru and Thailand. It thus presents a qualitative comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> across the four countries. The welfare regime model is modified in two main ways: to include satisfaction with important life goals as a measure <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> outcomes, and to include comparative family and cultural structures as major explanations of welfare regimes. The second section summarises the global context shaping the four countries since 1990 and the combined and unequal reflection of these in the political <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> the four countries. The next four sections consider in turn: welfare and wellbeing outcomes, the ‘welfare mix’ (the ways states, markets, communities, households and their international equivalents interact to produce wellbeing or illbeing), some of the structural determinants of these, and political mobilisations to protect or change the regime pattern. It concludes by relating welfare regimes to the idea <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> developed within the WeD programme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dominant {{paradigms}} <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> {{continue to}} struggle {{to make sense of}} what this term means. Equally, policy makers struggle to make dominant visions <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> a reality. This paper examines the understanding <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> recently adopted by the Bolivian constitution. High relevance is given to indigenous understandings of ‘vivir bien’, a concept that could be translated as ‘living well together’ under principles of conviviality and promoting values of reciprocity. Having been adopted by Bolivians in their 2009 Constitution as one of the country’s fundamental values, the paper explores the contribution it can make to understandings <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> It argues that ‘vivir bien’ constitutes progress in our understandings <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> because <b>of</b> the emphasis the concept makes on harmonious relations, not only in society but also with nature (the Pachamama –our Mother Earth), providing a link to sustainability that current conceptions <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> often fail to make...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} 30 years, {{developing}} economies {{around the world}} have grown rapidly. Only in the last decade has the concept <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> become part <b>of</b> development discourse. As material resources are limited, a promising concept has evolved so that development and wellbeing can be achieved even though development and as such improved wellbeing may not be attainable for all people. As wellbeing is essentially a social and cultural construction concept, its measurement must therefore take social and cultural concepts into account. This paper explores local conceptions <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> {{and the extent to which}} these conceptions have been incorporated into the measurements used in the nation of Laos. Data were collected through qualitative methods. Content analysis was employed to examine and analyze participants' responses. This paper argues that in the diverse cultural settings of Laos, it is challenging to develop a standard set <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> measurements. Although existing measurement includes social and cultural considerations, this study shows the local conception <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> was largely omitted. Based on the findings, it is suggested that measurements <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> in Laos be expanded to cover a wider number of aspects that encompass the Lao socio-cultural identity. This study proposed to add more indices <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> into development measurement than have been used in Laos...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} three question: 1) What are ‘{{subjective}}’ measure? 2) What is ‘wellbeing’? and 3) Are subjective measures <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> <b>of</b> use for policymaking, {{in particular in}} developing nations? The first question is answered by making a distinction between two kinds of ‘subjectivity’: subjective substance and subjective assessment. On that basis nine types of indicators are discerned, varying in degree of subjectivity. The second question is answered by discerning four kinds <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> Examples are presented of indicators for each <b>of</b> these <b>wellbeing</b> variants. It is argued {{that there is little}} sense in combining these variants in one sum-score <b>of</b> overall <b>wellbeing,</b> since this involves adding apples and oranges.

40|$|In Australia, {{wellbeing}} {{has been}} used as an assessment of how young people are doing by health researchers, youth researchers and psychologists.

Key components <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> for young people were found to include relationships, psychological dimensions and personal issues while family and 'pressure' impacted wellbeing.

40|$|Abstract: Many experts now {{recognize}} that income {{is not a}} measure that alone captures the <b>wellbeing</b> <b>of</b> individuals, and governments {{around the world are}} starting to rethink {{the ways in which they}} measure the welfare <b>of</b> their citizens. <b>Wellbeing</b> is best understood as a multifaceted phenomenon that can be assessed by measuring a wide array of subjective and objective constructs. This review summarizes the state of research on the various domains <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> measured by psychologists and social scientists, and provides an overview of the main theoretical perspectives that integrate these domains. Among these theoretical perspectives, we highlight Well-being Theory, which decomposes the wellbeing construct into five domains: Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment (PERMA). We conclude by formulating recommendations for future research on the measurement <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> These recommendations include the need to combine both objective and subjective indicators, and the use of a dashboard approach to measurement. This approach conveys the multifaceted nature <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> and will help policy-makers and citizens understand which domains <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> should constitute priorities for public policy...|$|R

40|$|I define {{wellbeing}} as preference realization. Wellbeing can {{be measured}} with affective (the amount of pleasant versus unpleasant experiences) and cognitive (satisfaction with life in general and life domains) measures. Since its inception 25 years ago, the SOEP has included cognitive measures <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> In the past years, studies of the SOEP data have produced a paradigm shift in wellbeing research. Previously influential set-point theories assumed that wellbeing is largely determined by heritable personality traits, and that effects of life events are short-lived due to adaptation (hedonic treadmill, aspiration treadmill). The SOEP data have uncovered strong environmental influences that parallel or even exceed the effects of personality traits. So far, these conclusions were limited to life-satisfaction judgments. This paper extends these findings to (weighted) averages of domain satisfaction as an alternative cognitive measure and an affective measure <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> In 2006, the SOEP included four affective indicators <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> (happy, sad, angry, afraid). This presentation examines {{similarities and differences between}} these subjective measures <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> as well as household income as an objective indicator <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> The four wellbeing measures are related to objective predictor variable...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{argue for}} a {{broadening}} of the conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> in the scholarly and policy literature on the topic. I do so as, despite the calls {{for the inclusion of}} place in analyses <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing,</b> the literature on the topic still carries a dominant conception <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> as a measurable index based on Euro-American practices and discourses, with their associated views of humanity and nature. I will advance the discussion on wellbeing’s intimate connection to place and place-based consciousness through an ethnographic engagement with kametsa asaiki (‘living well together’), an ethos <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> pursued by indigenous Ashaninka people in the Peruvian Amazon. This is a revealing context as Peru exemplifies how extractive development initiatives tend to misrecognise or underestimate their socio-natural consequences on local pursuits <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> I argue that an understanding of the role of place and place-based consciousness in wellbeing is key to enhancing the concept’s utility in policy and practice, especially due to its centrality in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In doing so, I call for further ethnographic explorations of the link between wellbeing models and understandings of humanity and nature...|$|R

This paper gives an overview <b>of</b> how <b>wellbeing</b> has influenced policy in the domains of health and international development, and draws from these insights to suggest the relevance and contribution <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> to sustainable fisheries. The paper describes the concept <b>of</b> eudaimonic <b>wellbeing,</b> which entails more than income, and happiness, but the living of, and flourishing in, a life that is valued and deemed worthwhile. A 3 -dimensional framework for wellbeing which gives attention to material, social and subjective wellbeing dimensions is also discussed. It is argued that this multi-dimensional framing <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> could contribute to sustainable fisheries in two ways: first, by providing a deeper form of social impact assessment, in particular in terms of capturing social and subjective impacts of fisheries decline.

40|$|Introduction: Wellbeing is an {{important}} goal and outcome measure for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Previous wellbeing studies have used standardised measures and not explored the individual understandings <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> {{and how it is}} affected by engagement in meaningful occupations. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore individual definitions <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> and perceived associations between engagement in daily occupations and wellbeing for people living at home with Parkinson’s disease. Method: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Participants completed 24 -hour time diaries prior to completing semi-structured interviews which explored participants’ individual definitions <b>of</b> <b>wellbeing</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> associations between <b>wellbeing</b> and engagement in occupation. Transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Seventeen participants were recruited and 11 completed interviews. Participants defined <b>wellbeing</b> in terms <b>of</b> independence and satisfaction in being able to contribute to others’ lives. Participants identified engagement in meaningful occupation as supporting their wellbeing and maintaining relationships and identity.
