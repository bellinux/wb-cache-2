Studies have shown that HAMLET is mostly localized to the nucleus within one hour of invading a tumor cell.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanism, structural correlates, and cis-acting elements involved in chromatin opening and gene activation, using the human β-globin locus as a model. Full transcriptional activity of the human β-globin locus requires the locus control region (LCR), composed {{of a series of}} nuclease hypersensitive sites located upstream of this globin gene cluster. Our previous analysis of naturally occurring and targeted LCR deletions revealed that chromatin opening and transcriptional activity in the endogenous β-globin locus are dissociable and dependent on distinct cis-acting elements. We now report that general histone H 3 /H 4 acetylation and relocation of the locus away from centromeric heterochromatin in the interphase nucleus are correlated and do not require the LCR. In contrast, LCR-dependent promoter activation is associated with localized <b>histone</b> H 3 <b>hyperacetylation</b> at the LCR and the transcribed β-globin-promoter and gene. On the basis of these results, we suggest a multistep model for gene activation; localization away from centromeric heterochromatin is required to achieve general hyperacetylation and an open chromatin structure of the locus, whereas a mechanism involving LCR/promoter <b>histone</b> H 3 <b>hyperacetylation</b> is required for high-level transcription of the β-globin genes...|$|R
40|$|The role of histone N-terminal domains on the {{thermodynamic}} {{stability of}} nucleosomes assembled on several different telomeric DNAs {{as well as}} on 'average' sequence DNA and on strong nucleosome positioning sequences, has been studied by competitive reconstitution. We find that <b>histone</b> tails <b>hyperacetylation</b> favors nucleosome formation, in a similar extent for all the examined sequences. On the contrary, removal of histone terminal domains by selective trypsinization causes a decrease of nucleosome stability which is smaller for telomeres compared to the other sequences examined, suggesting that telomeric sequences have only minor interactions with histone tails. Micrococcal nuclease kinetics shows enhanced accessibility of acetylated nucleosomes formed both on telomeric and 'average' sequence DNAs. These results suggest a more complex role for histone acetylation than the decrease of electrostatic interactions between DNA and histones. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that histone H 4 acetylation increases over a 1. 7 kb region of the IRF- 1 promoter in early G 1 and again at the G 1 /S transition in {{response to}} PRL stimulation.

50|$|Sodium {{butyrate}} is {{a compound}} with formula Na(C3H7COO). It is the {{sodium salt of}} butyric acid.

Specifically, butyrate treatment of cells results in <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation,</b> and butyrate itself inhibits class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, specifically HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8. Butyrate has been an essential vehicle for determining the role of histone acetylation in chromatin structure and function. Inhibition of HDAC activity is estimated to affect the expression of only 2% of mammalian genes.|$|E

Developing Tc 2 cells expressed lower GATA 3 levels and dramatically increased levels of repressor of GATA (ROG). A ROG response element in the IL- 13 gene exon 4 displayed Tc 2 -specific binding of ROG, HDAC 1, and HDAC 2 and exhibited repression of IL- 4 gene activation.

40|$|Recently a {{model for}} {{eukaryotic}} transcriptional activation has been proposed in which <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> causes release of nucleosomal supercoils, and this unconstrained tension in turn stimulates transcription (V. G. Norton, B. S. Imai, P. Yau, and E. M. Bradbury, Cell 57 : 449 - 457, 1989; V. G. Norton, K. W. Marvin, P. Yau, and E. M. Bradbury, J. Biol. Chem. 265 : 19848 - 19852, 1990). These studies analyzed the effect of <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> on the change in topological linking number which occurs during nucleosome assembly in vitro. We have tested this model by determining the effect of <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> on the linking number change which occurs during assembly in vivo. We find that butyrate treatment of cells infected with simian virus 40 results in hyperacetylation of the histones of the extracted viral minichromosome as expected.

40|$|Ligands of {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) abrogate {{the stimulation}} of collagen gene transcription induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). Here, we delineate the mechanisms underlying this important novel physiological function for PPAR-γ in connective tissue homeostasis. First, we demonstrated that antagonistic regulation of TGF-β activity by PPAR-γ ligands involves cellular PPAR-γ, since 15 -deoxy-Δ 12, 14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15 d-PGJ 2) failed to block TGF-β-induced responses in either primary cultures of PPAR-γ-null murine embryonic fibroblasts, or in normal human skin fibroblasts with RNAi-mediated knockdown of PPAR-γ. Next, {{we examined the}} molecular basis underlying the abrogation of TGF-β signaling by PPAR-γ in normal human fibroblasts in culture. The results demonstrated that Smad-dependent transcriptional responses were blocked by PPAR-γ without preventing Smad 2 / 3 activation. In contrast, the interaction between activated Smad 2 / 3 and the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase p 300 induced by TGF-β, and the accumulation of p 300 on consensus Smad-binding DNA sequences and <b>histone</b> H 4 <b>hyperacetylation</b> at the COL 1 A 2 locus, were all prevented by PPAR-γ. Wild-type p 300, but not a mutant form of p 300 lacking functional histone acetyltransferase, was able to restore TGF-β-induced stimulation of COL 1 A 2 {{in the presence of}} PPAR-γ ligands. Collectively, these results indicate that PPAR-γ blocked Smad-mediated transcriptional responses by preventing p 300 recruitment and <b>histone</b> H 4 <b>hyperacetylation,</b> resulting in the inhibition of TGF-β-induced collagen gene expression. Pharmacological activation of PPAR-γ thus may represent a novel therapeutic approach to target p 300 -dependent TGF-β profibrotic responses such as stimulation of collagen gene expression. —Ghosh, A.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} chromatin remodelling processes occurs during spermiogenesis, the post-meiotic phase of sperm development during which histones are replaced with sperm-specific protamines to repackage the genome into the highly compact chromatin structure of mature sperm. Here we identify Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (Chd 5) as a master regulator of the histone-to-protamine chromatin remodelling process. Chd 5 deficiency leads to defective sperm chromatin compaction and male infertility in mice, mirroring the observation of low CHD 5 expression in testes of infertile men. Chd 5 orchestrates a cascade of molecular events required for histone removal and replacement, including histone 4 (H 4) <b>hyperacetylation,</b> <b>histone</b> variant expression, nucleosome eviction and DNA damage repair. Chd 5 deficiency also perturbs expression of transition proteins (Tnp 1 /Tnp 2) and protamines (Prm 1 / 2).

This level of <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> diminishes gradually as repair proceeds. Accompanying this, chromatin in the promoter becomes more accessible to restriction enzymes after UV irradiation {{and returns to the}} pre-UV state gradually. UV-related <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> and chromatin remodeling in the MFA 2 promoter depend on Gcn 5 p and partially on Swi 2 p, respectively. Deletion of GCN 5, but not of SWI 2, impairs repair of DNA damage in the MFA 2 promoter. The post-UV histone modifications and chromatin remodeling at the repressed MFA 2 promoter do not activate MFA 2 transcriptionally, nor do they require damage recognition by Rad 4 p or Rad 14 p. Furthermore, we show that UV irradiation triggers genome-wide <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> at both histone H 3 and H 4. These experiments indicate that chromatin at a yeast repressed locus undergoes active change after UV radiation treatment and that failure to achieve histone H 3 hyperacetylation impairs the repair of DNA damage...|$|E

The acetylation states of histones associated with different regions of PetE were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for acetylated or nonacetylated histone H 3 or H 4 tails, followed by polymerase chain reaction quantification. Comparison of pea tissues indicated that <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> was associated with increased PetE transcription in green shoots. Moreover, hyperacetylation of both histones H 3 and H 4 was targeted to the enhancer/promoter region in green shoots, suggesting that only specific nucleosomes along the gene were modified. Time-course digestions of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease and DNaseI indicated that the enhancer/promoter region was more resistant to digestion in the inactive gene in pea roots than was the same region in the active gene in shoots, whereas the transcribed region of PetE was digested similarly among the tissues. This finding indicates that transcription is accompanied by changes in the nuclease accessibility of the enhancer/promoter region only. Moreover, {{these results indicate that}} the changes in nuclease accessibility are organ specific, whereas <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> is light dependent, and they suggest that changes in nuclease accessibility precede <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> during PetE activation...|$|E

In both primary and mouse embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> leads to an increased local transcriptional elongation rate and decreased inclusion of these exons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Hu proteins interact with histone deacetylase 2 and inhibit its deacetylation activity.

40|$|During {{the final}} stages of {{spermatogenesis}} in rainbow trout a dramatic increase in the level of <b>histone</b> H 4 <b>hyperacetylation</b> is observed which is closely correlated with the replacement of histones by protamines. In order to understand further how H 4 hyperacetylation might assist in protamine replacement of the histones, we have investigated the effect of H 4 hyperacetylation on chromatin structure in trout testes actively undergoing the replacement process. Long chromatin fragments enriched in hyperacetylated H 4 have been isolated and characterized. Evidence is presented that hyperacetylated H 4 is clustered in certain regions (domains) of late stage testis chromatin and within these domains the chromatin exhibits an altered, highly relaxed structure which {{is believed to be the}} result of the extensive hyperacetylation.

In this study, {{we find that}} rapamycin and nutrient starvation, conditions inhibiting TOR, lead to significant nucleolar size reduction in both yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, this morphological change is accompanied by release of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) from the nucleolus and inhibition of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription. We also present evidence that TOR regulates association of Rpd 3 –Sin 3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) with rDNA chromatin, leading to site-specific deacetylation of histone H 4. Moreover, histone H 4 hypoacetylation mutations cause nucleolar size reduction and Pol I delocalization, while rpd 3 Δ and <b>histone</b> H 4 <b>hyperacetylation</b> mutations block the nucleolar changes {{as a result of}} TOR inhibition.

During the incubation period, the small percentage of dynamically acetylated and deacetylated histone is radiolabeled and hyperacetylated. A second effect of the n-butyrate incubation is to shift a small subset of nucleohistone into a soluble form. This chromatin is predominantly polynucleosome size (approximately dimer to pentamer) and can be separated from soluble mononucleosomes by 5 - 30 % sucrose gradient centrifugation. The soluble polynucleosomes are 25 - 30 fold enriched for adult beta-globin (beta A) DNA and contain the hyperacetylated histones. We have tested whether <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> {{is responsible for the}} enhanced beta-globin chromatin solubility by in vitro deacetylation of the soluble chromatin histones.

This is an eleven fold enrichment over the soluble chromatin from untreated cells (Ferenz and Nelson (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13, 1977 - 1995). The enhanced beta A chromatin solubility and induced <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> are coincident.

We constructed several reporter plasmids containing the p 21 waf 1 promoter, and attempted to identify vesnarinone-responsive elements in the p 21 waf 1 promoter. By the luciferase reporter assay, we identified the minimal vesnarinone-responsive element in the p 21 waf 1 promoter at − 124 to − 61 relative to the transcription start site. Moreover, we demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that Sp 1 and Sp 3 transcription factors bound to the vesnarinone-responsive element. Furthermore, we found that vesnarinone induced the <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> in TYS cells.

Results Here, we demonstrate that a SNP microarray can be effectively used in this way to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip as an alternative to tiling microarrays. We illustrate this novel application by mapping whole genome <b>histone</b> H 4 <b>hyperacetylation</b> in human myoblasts and myotubes. We detect clusters of hyperacetylated histone H 4, often spanning across up to 300 kilobases of genomic sequence. Using complementary genome-wide analyses of gene expression by DNA microarray we demonstrate that these clusters of hyperacetylated histone H 4 tend to be associated with expressed genes. Conclusion The use of a SNP array for a ChIP-on-chip application (ChIP on SNP-chip) will be of great value to laboratories whose interest is the determination of general rules regarding the relationship of specific chromatin modifications to transcriptional status throughout the genome and to examine the asymmetric modification of chromatin at heterozygous loci. </p...|$|R
40|$|Polyamines are organic polycations {{essential}} {{for a wide}} variety of cellular functions, including nuclear integrity and chromosome condensation. Here we present genetic evidence that depletion of cellular polyamines partially alleviates the defects in HO and SUC 2 expression caused by inactivation of the GCN 5 histone acetyltransferase. In addition, the combination of polyamine depletion and a sin(-) allele of the histone H 4 gene leads to almost complete bypass of the transcriptional requirement for GCN 5. In contrast, polyamine depletion does not alter the transcriptional requirements for the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex nor does depletion lead to global defects in transcriptional regulation. In addition to these genetic studies, we show that polyamines facilitate oligomerization of nucleosomal arrays in vitro, and that polyamine-mediated condensation requires intact core histone N-terminal domains and is inhibited by <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation.</b> Our studies suggest that polyamines are repressors of transcription in vivo, and that one role of <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> is to antagonize the ability of polyamines to stabilize highly condensed states of chromosomal fibers...|$|E

Four HDAI (depsipeptide, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, MS- 275, and trichostatin A) were studied in two PEL B cell lines (BCBL- 1, BC- 3). As expected, <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> was readily induced in all PEL cells exposed to HDAI. HDAI also triggered KSHV reactivation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric and transmission electron microscopic studies, however, revealed that reactivation occurred in only a minor percentage (3 – 14 %) of treated cells. Importantly, and in contrast to viral reactivation, HDAI induced apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner in a large percentage (up to 90 %) of KSHV-infected cells. In summary, all four HDAI tested induced <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> in all cells, KSHV reactivation in a minority of cells, and apoptotic cell death in a majority of cells latently infected with KSHV.

Proteins that contain {{one or more}} plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers have been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. Pygopus 2 (Pygo 2) belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved PHD finger proteins thought to act as co-activators of Wnt signaling effector complexes composed of β-catenin and LEF/TCF transcription factor. Here we analyze mice containing hypomorphic alleles of pygopus 2 (Pygo 2 or mpygo 2) and uncover a β-catenin-independent involvement of the Pygo 2 protein in spermiogenesis. Pygo 2 is expressed in elongating spermatids at stages when chromatin remodeling occurs, and block of Pygo 2 function leads to spermiogenesis arrest and consequent infertility. Analysis of spermiogenesis in Pygo 2 mutants reveals reduced expression of select post-meiotic genes including protamines, transition protein 2, and H 1 fnt, {{all of which are}} required for germ cell chromatin condensation, and drastically altered pattern of <b>histone</b> H 3 <b>hyperacetylation.</b> These findings suggest that Pygo 2 is involved in the chromatin remodeling events that lead to nuclear compaction of male germ cells...|$|R

Fourteen new compounds derived from l-cysteine or 2 -aminosuberic acid were designed to inhibit P. falciparum HDAC- 1 (PfHDAC- 1) based on homology modeling with human class I and class II HDAC enzymes. The compounds displayed highly potent antiproliferative activity against drug-resistant (Dd 2) or drug sensitive (3 D 7) strains of P. falciparum in vitro (50 % inhibitory concentration of 13 to 334 nM).

Here, we identify a developmentally specific erythroid enhancer, hypersensitive site-embryonic 1 (HS-E 1), located within the embryonic β-globin domain in mouse, which is homologous to a region located downstream of the human embryonic ϵ-globin gene. This sequence exhibits nuclease hypersensitivity in primitive erythroid cells and acts as an enhancer in gain-of-function assays. Deletion of HS-E 1 from the endogenous murine β-globin locus results in significant decrease in {{the expression of the}} embryonic β-globin genes and loss of the domain-wide pattern of <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation.</b> The data suggest that HS-E 1 is an enhancer that is uniquely required for β-like globin expression in primitive erythroid cells, and that it defines a novel class of enhancer that works in part by domain-wide modulation of chromatin structure...|$|E
40|$|The developmentally {{regulated}} mammalian β-globin {{genes are}} activated by a distant locus control region/enhancer. To {{understand the role}} of chromatin remodeling complexes in this activation, we used stably replicated chromatin templates, in which transcription activation of the human embryonic ε-globin gene depends on the tandem Maf-recognition elements (MAREs) within the β-globin locus control region HS 2 enhancer, to which the erythroid factor NF-E 2 binds. The HS 2 MAREs are required for nucleosome mobilization and <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> at the distant promoter. Nucleosome mobilization also requires the promoter TATA box, and is independent of <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation.</b> In contrast, promoter hyperacetylation requires the promoter GATA- 1, and CACC-factor activator motifs, {{as well as the}} TATA box. ChIP analysis reveals that NF-E 2 is associated with the active ε-globin promoter, which lacks an NF-E 2 binding sequence, in a TATA box and HS 2 /MARE-dependent fashion. NF-E 2 association with the ε-globin promoter coincides with that of RNA polymerase II at both regulatory sites. The results emphasize MARE–TATA box interactions in the recruitment of complexes modifying promoter chromatin for transcription activation and imply close physical interaction between widely separated regulatory sequences mediated through these sites...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} and histone acetylation are two {{well known}} epigenetic chromatin modifications. Epigenetic agents leading to DNA hypomethylation and <b>histone</b> <b>hyperacetylation</b> {{have been approved}} for treatment of hematological disorders. The first histone deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat, has been licensed for cutaneous T cell lymphoma treatment. More than 11 new epigenetic agents are {{in various stages of}} clinical development for therapy of multiple cancer types. In this review we summarize novel histone deacetylase inhibitors and new regimens from clinical trials for epigenetic therapy of cancer...|$|E
40|$|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA 7) is one {{of several}} {{inherited}} neurodegenerative disorders caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion, but it is the only one in which the retina is affected. Increasing evidence suggests that transcriptional alterations contribute to polyQ pathogenesis, although the mechanism is unclear. We previously demonstrated that the SCA 7 gene product, ataxin- 7 (ATXN 7), is a subunit of the GCN 5 histone acetyltransferase– containing coactivator complexes TFTC/STAGA. We show here that TFTC/STAGA complexes purified from SCA 7 mice have normal TRRAP, GCN 5, TAF 12, and SPT 3 levels and that their histone or nucleosomal acetylation activities are unaffected. However, rod photoreceptors from SCA 7 mouse models showed severe chromatin decondensation. In agreement, polyQ-expanded ataxin- 7 induced <b>histone</b> H 3 <b>hyperacetylation,</b> resulting from an increased recruitment of TFTC/STAGA to specific promoters. Surprisingly, hyperacetylated genes were transcriptionally down-regulated, and expression analysis revealed that nearly all rod-specific genes were affected, leading to visual impairment in SCA 7 mice. In conclusion, we describe here a set of events accounting for SCA 7 pathogenesis in the retina, in which polyQ-expanded ATXN 7 deregulated TFTC/STAGA recruitment to a subset of genes specifically expressed in ro...|$|R
40|$|Canonical Wnt {{signaling}} and {{its nuclear}} effectors, β-catenin {{and the family}} of T-cell factor (TCF) DNA-binding proteins, belong to {{the small number of}} regulatory systems which are repeatedly used for context-dependent control of distinct genetic programs. The apparent ability to elicit a large variety of transcriptional responses necessitates that β-catenin and TCFs distinguish precisely between genes to be activated and genes to remain silent in a specific context. How this is achieved is unclear. Here, we examined patterns of Wnt target gene activation and promoter occupancy by TCFs in different mouse cell culture models. Remarkably, within a given cell type only Wnt-responsive promoters are bound by specific subsets of TCFs, whereas nonresponsive Wnt target promoters remain unoccupied. Wnt-responsive, TCF-bound states correlate with DNA hypomethylation, <b>histone</b> H 3 <b>hyperacetylation,</b> and H 3 K 4 trimethylation. Inactive, nonresponsive promoter chromatin shows DNA hypermethylation, is devoid of active histone marks, and additionally can show repressive H 3 K 27 trimethylation. Furthermore, chromatin structural states appear to be independent of Wnt pathway activity. Apparently, cell-type-specific regulation of Wnt target genes comprises multilayered control systems. These involve epigenetic modifications of promoter chromatin and differential promoter occupancy by functionally distinct TCF proteins, which together determine susceptibility to Wnt signaling...|$|R
40|$|DNA is {{packaged}} into chromatin, {{a highly}} compacted DNA-protein complex; therefore, all cellular processes {{that use the}} DNA as a template, including DNA repair, require {{a high degree of}} coordination between the DNA-repair machinery and chromatin modification/remodelling, which regulates the accessibility of DNA in chromatin. Recent studies have implicated histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes and chromatin acetylation in DNA repair; however, the precise underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the HAT cofactor Trrap and Tip 60 HAT bind to the chromatin surrounding sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vivo. Trrap depletion impairs both DNA-damage-induced <b>histone</b> H 4 <b>hyperacetylation</b> and accumulation of repair molecules at sites of DSBs, resulting in defective homologous recombination (HR) repair, albeit with the presence of a functional ATM-dependent DNA-damage signalling cascade. Importantly, the impaired loading of repair proteins and the defect in DNA repair in Trrap-deficient cells can be counteracted by chromatin relaxation, indicating that the DNA-repair defect that was observed in the absence of Trrap is due to impeded chromatin accessibility at sites of DNA breaks. Thus, these data reveal that cells may use the same basic mechanism involving HAT complexes to regulate distinct cellular processes, such as transcription and DNA repair...|$|R
