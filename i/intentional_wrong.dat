The efforts {{described}} {{under the}} last head, for gaining a personal influence over those, who from their disposition and character are most {{in danger of}} doing wrong, will not be sufficient entirely to prevent transgression. Cases of deliberate, <b>intentional</b> <b>wrong</b> will occur, and the question will rise, what {{is the duty of}} the teacher in such an emergency? When such cases occur, the course to be taken is, first of all, to come to a distinct understanding on the subject with the guilty individual. Think of the case calmly, until you have obtained just and clear ideas of it. Endeavor to understand precisely in what the guilt of it consists. Notice every palliating circumstance, and take as favorable a view of the thing as you can, while, at the same time, you fix most firmly in your mind the determination {{to put a stop to}} it. Then go to the individual, and lay the subject before him, for the purpose of understanding distinctly from his own lips, what he intends to do. I can however, as usual, explain more fully what I mean, by describing a particular case, substantially true.|$|E

50|$|The federal {{government}} and nearly every state have passed tort claims acts allowing them to be sued for the negligence, but not <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongs,</b> of government employees. The common-law tort doctrine of respondeat superior makes employers generally responsible for the torts of their employees. In the absence of this waiver of sovereign immunity, injured parties would generally have been left without an effective remedy. See Brandon v. Holt.|$|R

A criminal law shaped by Catholic principles, therefore, would sanction the criminalization not only of (some) <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongs</b> but also of (some) negligent wrongs; it would understand negligence, however, as the person’s failure to do his personal best to seek the real and the good. A Catholic criminal law would not purport to demand virtue; it would both call for and respect an indi-vidual’s conscientious, diligent quest for the good...|$|R
6000|$|The year wore away on {{his part}} in the harassing service of {{defending}} a wide frontier with an insufficient and badly organized force, and the vexations he experienced were heightened by continual misunderstandings with Governor Dinwiddie. From the ungracious tenor of several of that gentleman's letters, and from private information, he was {{led to believe that}} some secret enemy had been making false representations of his motives and conduct, and prejudicing the governor against him. He vindicated himself warmly from the alleged aspersions, proudly appealing to the whole course of his public career in proof of their falsity. [...] "It is uncertain," [...] said he, [...] "in what light my services may have appeared to your honor; but this I know, and it is the highest consolation I am capable of feeling, that no man that ever was employed in a public capacity has endeavored to discharge the trust reposed in him with greater honesty and more zeal for the country's interest than I have done; and if there is any person living who can say, with justice, that I have offered any <b>intentional</b> <b>wrong</b> to the public, I will cheerfully submit to the most ignominious punishment that an injured people ought to inflict. On the other hand, it is hard to have my character arraigned, and my actions condemned, without a hearing." ...|$|E

Generally, governmental immunity has protected educators in four areas: discretionary or judicial function, mandatory function, passive misconduct, and when state interests outweighed individual rights. On the other hand, courts also have held public educators liable in cases that involved: private function (proprietary), ministerial function (mandatory acts), optional or permissible function, creation or maintenance of nuisance resulting in injury or death, active, positive or willful and <b>intentional</b> <b>wrong,</b> judicial waiver, legislative waiver, judicia...|$|E

50|$|Each {{theory of}} {{liability}} has certain conditions, or elements, {{that must be}} proven by the claimant before liability will be established. For example, the theory of negligence requires the claimant to prove that (1) the defendant had a duty; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the defendant's breach caused the injury; and (4) that injury resulted in recoverable damages. Theories of liability can also be created by legislation. For example, under English law, {{with the passing of}} the Theft Act 1978, it is an offense to evade a liability dishonestly. Payment of damages usually resolves the liability. A given liability may be covered by insurance. In general, however, insurance providers only cover liabilities arising from negligent torts rather than <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongs</b> or breach of contract.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{reasonableness}} is the golden thread which {{runs through the}} law of negligence, tying together all the disparate elements of duty, right, harm and injury into one coherent whole. It is the principle upon which the legal duty not to harm one's neighbour is based {{and it is the}} principle that ties that legal idea to particular fact situations. It is offundamental import to the law. A claim for damages based on negligence is a claim to be compensated for an injury caused unintentionally, and consequently the law must find some other justification for holding a person liable than that person's wrongful intent (which is the justification for <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongs).</b> That justification emerges from the concept of reasonableness. If a person injure...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} analysis of which Adam Smith {{is a principal}} founder is helpful in practical reasoning about problems of justice precisely insofar as it systematically calls attention to the side-effects of individual choices and actions and behavior. Still, {{it would be a}} mistake to conclude that we need only a more adequate account of the benefits and burdens up for distribution or allocation by those responsible for the common good or general fate. We need also to bear in mind what Smith did not forget and what economics does not comprehend, the requirements of commutative justice. To see this, we may look at one of the economic and security policies of the rich which was developed in England in the half-century after Adam Smith 2 ̆ 7 s flourishing: the policy of laying hidden traps. After this, we turn to Richard Posner’s implications of {{economic analysis}} for common law, and then to objections that may be made to Posner’s school of economic analysis. Finally, I should say a little more about how intention and <b>intentional</b> <b>wrong</b> is related to the vast problem of harmful side-effects (including latent and long-term side-effects in environmental degradation of every kind) ...|$|E
500|$|Although some {{perceive}} the settlement as {{an admission of}} guilt, the settlement agreement specifically stated that Jackson admitted no wrongdoing and no liability and legally, a settlement cannot be used as evidence of guilt in future civil and criminal cases. The settlement payment was [...] "for alleged personal injuries arising out of claims of negligence and not for claims of <b>intentional</b> or <b>wrong</b> acts of sexual molestation." [...] In the settlement, both parties agreed they would not speak about the case details in public {{but it did not}} prevent the Chandlers from testifying in a criminal trial or sharing information with authorities in a criminal investigation. The settlement document adamantly states there is no admission of wrongdoing on Jackson's part and no admission of molestation or immodesty and that under no circumstances shall any payment be withheld from the complainants, even if they were to testify against Jackson.|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} Jennifer Jackson's recent defence of doctors' {{rights to}} deceive patients. Jackson maintains {{there is a}} general moral difference between lying and intentional deception: while doctors have a prima facie duty not to lie, there is no such obligation to avoid deception. This paper argues 1) that an examination of cases shows that lying and deception are often morally equivalent, and 2) that Jackson's position is premised on a species of moral functionalism that misconstrues the nature of moral obligation. Against Jackson, it is argued that both lying and <b>intentional</b> deception are <b>wrong</b> where they infringe a patient's right to autonomy or his/her right to be treated with dignity. These rights represent 'deontological constraints' on action, defining what we must not do whatever the functional value of the consequences. Medical ethics must recognise such constraints if it is to contribute to the moral integrity of medical practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} enforcement of monetary claims in cases of intellectual property rights infringement. It focuses on the Act n. 221 / 2006 Sb. on {{the enforcement of}} intellectual property and on the directive 2004 / 48 /EC of the European parliament and of the Council. The main aim is to evaluate the extent of monetary claims especially with regard on possible overlap or mutual consumption of the claims. The second aim is the analysis of English terminology {{in relation to the}} nearest Czech equivalents. The dissertation uses methods of logic induction and abstraction and the international multilateral comparative method, where the use of language plays a crucial role. The exact method of modelling combined with mathematical game theory is used. The dissertation progressively explains terms and relevant enactments. It introduces existing ambiguities. It tries to clarify them by analysing the EU legislation, the implementations in different member states, the statutory and common law in the USA. Consecutively it focuses on unjust enrichment in English law, then in the USA and in the continental system, where this institute is set negatively [...] as the unjustified enrichment. Within the whole thesis the analysis takes place in relation to intellectual property rights infringement. In the penultimate chapter, TRIPS and ACTA are compared with the directive 2004 / 48 /EC to provide further explanations. The dissertation concludes that a parallel award of damages and infringer's profits theoretically is possible, when it is not a single flow of value which is concerned by the infringement. The dissertation negatively replies to the question if damages and infringer's profits may be awarded concurrently in two separate lump-sum amounts according to § 5 (2) or (3) of the Act n. 221 / 2006 Sb. The reason is that the rate of the royalty is applied to sales of the infringer. These sales relate to the unjust enrichment of the infringer. If damages were again calculated by applying the same rate to the same sales, that would be double recovery. But theoretically this possibility cannot be excluded. A real-world example is very hard to find, even in the non-lump-sum form. Collateral sales awarded with lost profit in US law may serve as one. From the EU documents it seems, that infringer's profits is equalled to unjust enrichment and that is translated as unjustified enrichment. But English theory distinguishes restitution of unjust enrichment and gain-based recovery for wrong, the latter encompassing the award of infringer's profits in the form of damages. The broader Czech notion of unjustified enrichment is not to be equalled to unjust enrichment in the pure English notion, because the former encompasses also <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongs.</b> With regard to the restitution of infringer's profits based on unjust enrichment, the intent plays a role. The broader notion of unjust enrichment relevant to intellectual property rights infringement is called interceptive unjust enrichment, where enrichment "from the property of the plaintiff" is at stake and it is also possible to claim profits gained by the infringement. Focus is on the enrichment "from the property", not on the wrong. The dissertation examines the terms "account of profits", apportionment of profits", "disgorgement" and impure negotiorum gestio with regard to intellectual property infringement. In several countries reasonable royalty is regarded as good measure of net gain from the infringement of intellectual property. When the infringement was not innocent or wilful, it's possible to claim not only the objective enrichment but also the subjective enrichment [...] profits of the infringer. In Czech law, that is represented by the emoluments from the enrichment. The aim of the last chapter is to evaluate, {{in the context of the}} operation of other relevant elements of legal environment, the preventive function of the double royalty claim introduced by the Act n. 221 / 2006 Sb. By construing a game theory model and using simulation, the thesis concludes that in lower royalty intervals, where attorney's costs are a high burden, the effect of the double royalty is insignificant. Where "more significant infringements" are at stake, and the royalty passes a given frontier, the application of the double royalty heightens the preventive function of the Act. Those "more significant infringements" have two intervals [...] with the highest effect of the double royalty and with the "stabilized effect of the double royalty". But overall, in cases of "more significant infringements", the application of the double represents a heightening of the preventive power by a third and fifth respectively, and this is true only in the case, where the prospective infringers would try to calculate the effect of their infringement before infringing...|$|R
