50|$|The {{concept of}} {{cultural}} <b>frame</b> <b>switching</b> (CFS) or double consciousness made popular by W.E.B Du Bois addresses how an individual switches between cultural frames or systems {{in response to}} their environment. The presence of culture-specific peers can elicit culture-specific values. CFS {{can be used to}} describe the switching of different language use depending on the context. Thus, CFS can be connected to cultural accommodation, which is seen when bilinguals respond to situations with the language that applies best to the situation present. It is evident that language can have an effect on an individual’s thinking process; this is because the language itself primes the individual’s cultural values, attitudes and memory which in turn affects behavior. Thus, language has a powerful effect on the way in which an individual responds to change.|$|E
50|$|Low BII bicultural {{individuals}} have difficulties in incorporating both cultures into a cohesive identity {{and tend to}} see both cultures as highly dissimilar. Bicultural individuals with high BII on the other hand, see their identities as complementary and themselves {{as part of a}} “third” culture, which integrates elements from both their cultures.According to Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist, individuals respond in a more stable fashion when their cultural contexts are understood. Researchers wanted to examine how these differences could relate to other factors and the results are insightful. BII is significantly associated with the psychological and social adjustments of the bicultural. Low BII bicultural individuals are found to have inferior bilingual proficiency, experience more anxiety, depression and are more neurotic and less open than bicultural individuals with high BII.More importantly, low BII bicultural individuals are not chameleon-like. They resist the <b>frame</b> <b>switching</b> {{and are more likely to}} respond in ways inconsistent with the cultural cues. In other words, when low BII Chinese-Americans are presented with American cues, unlike high BII bicultural individuals, they would not behave like Americans but instead, more like a Chinese.However, the identity struggle for bicultural individuals can be made less arduous. It is important to note that like other personality traits, BII is malleable to contextual factors. BII can be increased by asking bicultural individuals to recall positive cross-cultural exchanges or like in another study, make high-level construals. These findings can be useful in for example, helping immigrants to cope with their new environment.|$|E
40|$|Identifying with {{multiple}} cultures is increasingly common. In negotiating their two cultures, biculturals engage different cognitive systems depending on contextual cues a phenomenon called cultural <b>frame</b> <b>switching.</b> Effective cultural <b>frame</b> <b>switching</b> likely requires biculturals to attend {{closely to the}} surrounding context, and as a result, biculturals may become especially context-sensitive. We experimentally tested whether cultural <b>frame</b> <b>switching</b> increases biculturals context sensitivity (Part One) and whether greater context sensitivity relates to higher well-being for biculturals (Part Two). Part One results failed to demonstrate a consistent causal relationship between <b>frame</b> <b>switching</b> and context sensitivity, though exploratory analyses provided some evidence that biculturals self-reported ability to frame switch between cultures may predict context sensitivity. Part Two results showed mixed support for a relationship between biculturals context sensitivity and well-being.

To gain more insights into the switch practical performance, an extensive performance evaluation study is conducted using computer simulations.

Studies 1 - 2 b document social class cultural models {{of education and}} explore whether these models change as FGs spend time in the university. Study 1 suggests that working-class and middle-class models of education include both overlapping and diverging components and that FGs’ models may change as they spend time in the university. Studies 2 a and 2 b examine how these models are embedded within the networks of associations that guide thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors and suggest that differences in working-class and middle-class models may arise from differences in the underlying networks of associations. Collectively, these studies suggest that FGs’ ways of understanding the world may change as they spend time in middle-class universities. Studies 3 - 5 explore social class cultural <b>frame</b> <b>switching</b> among FGs. Study 3 examines whether the contexts of family and university {{can be used to}} prime social class context.

40|$|Abstract — An optical slot {{switching}} node network called POADM (packet optical add-drop multiplexers) has formerly been proposed as a flexible solution for metropolitan ring networks to carry data traffic with a sub-wavelength switching granularity {{and with a}} good energy efficiency, which is enabled by optical transparency. In this paper, we propose several architectures for the electronic side of optical slot {{switching node}}s. Those architectures increase the flexibility with which a client, attached to a node, can access the transport medium, through the addition of electronic switches, working either at client frame granularity or at slot granularity (a slot encapsulates several client frames); such electronic switches can be located at either transmitter, receiver, or {{both sides of a}} node, thereby decreasing traffic latency, at the expense of increased node cost and/or energy consumption. This paper focuses on the latency aspect only. We assess and compare the latency of these node architectures with simulations; some results are also backed analytically. The utilization of an (electronic) slot switch enables load balancing across the transport channels, while the node architecture with an (electronic) client <b>frame</b> <b>switch</b> additionally permits flow aggregation, resulting in lower queuing delay. The lowest queuing delay is achieved by the architecture embedding client <b>frame</b> <b>switches</b> at both transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) sides, while the absence of electrical switches leads to the worst performance, but presents the advantage of lower cost and consumption with respect to the other architectures.

40|$|Bilingualism = Biculturalism? Reflections on the {{relationship}} between language and culture Luxembourg has three officially recognized national languages (French, German, and Luxembourgish); at least two of these are used in everyday interactions by Luxembourgers and the non-resident population. A series of empirical studies using quantitative as well as qualitative methodology tested {{the relationship}} between bilingualism and biculturalism. The first study (N = 99 students) addressed tri-lingual Luxembourg nationals. The results of this quantitative study showed {{that the vast majority of}} the Luxembourg participants consider themselves to be multi- or bilingual, though they report to feel monocultural. The qualitative findings obtained in this study indicate that language was considered to be a necessary, but not sufficient condition for multiculturalism. In line with other research on biculturalism, the results showed that biculturalism requires cultural immersion to take place. Furthermore, for those who feel bicultural, language is considered a prime for cultural <b>frame</b> <b>switching.</b> This implies that the language prompts the cultural <b>frame</b> <b>switching</b> and the switching between languages does not require conscious efforts.

Examples of switching detectors include the {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) [8 – 10], where switching occurs between the superconducting and dissipative state and is driven by quantum fluctuations, and the Josephson bifurcation amplifier (JBA) [11 – 14], which has been employed in the delicate task of detecting a qubit state in a minimally invasive fashion [15]. In this case, the detector can switch between different, weakly dissipative, dynamical states based on quantum activation [16] or dynamical tunneling [17].

The current paper provides answers to these questions by introducing approaches to the study of multiculturalism and their implications. We first present the view of multiculturalism as a static and dispositional phenomenon (i. e., demographic, as well as most uni- and bidimensional conceptualizations of acculturation) and then focus on more dynamic approaches to multiculturalism, that view culture as emerging from domain-specificity, situated cognition, or as a dynamic constructivist process. As part of a dynamic approach to culture, two prominent techniques of priming cultural orientations (i. e., priming Individualism - Collectivism versus Cultural <b>Frame</b> <b>Switching)</b> are introduced and compared, and implications are outlined.
