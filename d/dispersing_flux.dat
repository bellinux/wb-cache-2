40|$|Cross-flow {{membrane}} emulsification {{has great}} potential to produce monodisperse emulsions and emulsions with shear sensitive components. However, until now, only low <b>disperse</b> phase <b>fluxes</b> were obtained. A low flux maybe a limiting factor for emulsion production {{on a commercial}} scale. Therefore, the effects of membrane parameters on the <b>disperse</b> phase <b>flux</b> are estimated. Besides, {{the effects of these}} parameters on the droplet size and droplet size distribution are qualitatively described. Wetting properties, pore size and porosity mainly determine the droplet size (distribution). Membrane morphology largely determines the <b>disperse</b> phase <b>flux.</b> As an example, industrial-scale production of culinary cream was chosen to evaluate the required membrane area of different types of membranes: an SPG membrane, an alpha-Al 2 O 3 membrane and a microsieve. Due to the totally different morphologies of these membranes, the fraction of active pores is I for a microsieve and is very low for the other membranes. The choice of the optimal membrane did not depend on the production strategy: either to produce large quantities or to produce monodisperse emulsions, the best suitable was a microsieve with an area requirement of around I m(2). In general, the total membrane resistance should be low to obtain a large <b>disperse</b> phase <b>flux.</b> In contrast, the membrane resistance should be high to obtain monodisperse emulsions when using membranes with a high porosity.

Analysis of pitch angle distributions indicates that these dispersed electrons are typically trapped on closed field lines formed above strong crustal magnetic sources. Most of the dispersed electron signatures are characterized by peak energies decreasing with time rather than increasing peak energies. These properties can be explained by impulsive and local injection of hot electrons into closed field lines and subsequent dispersion by magnetic drift of the trapped electrons.

All emulsions consisted of 10 vol% of sunflower oil or silicone oil stabilised by 1 wt% Tween 20. The transmembrane pressure (0. 1 – 1. 8 bar), rotational speeds (100 – 2000 RPM) annular gap width (5 – 45 mm), dispersed and continuous phase viscosity were all investigated as to their effect on emulsion droplet size and <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux.</b> Modification of the dispersed phase flow properties alters the droplet size with four regions being suggested; a decrease in size (as droplet coalescence is minimised), a plateau (size-stable zone), a gradual increase in size (due to transfer of mass via droplet neck) and then a rapid increase (due to jetting). The importance of Taylor vortices development was seen with larger droplets formed in their absence; typically at low rotational speeds, narrow vessel diameters and more viscous continuous phases. It was concluded that the flow behaviour of each phase requires careful consideration to understand the likely formation mechanism(s) during operation.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{optimise}} the membrane emulsification process, {{there is a}} need for a model that can be used to keep the production time of an emulsion to a minimum, without impairing its quality. This was the aim of our work. For that, we have studied the influence of transmembrane pressure on the fraction of active pores and on the drop diameter and the drop diameter distribution. We have found that an increase in transmembrane pressure makes it possible to increase the <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux</b> by a rise in the number of active pores (from 1 to 13 % for the 0. 2 µm membrane and from 2 % to 45 % and 49 % for the 0. 5 and 0. 8 µm membranes, respectively). Furthermore, the increase in transmembrane pressure leads to an increase in the diameter of the droplets produced. For the 0. 5 and 0. 8 µm pore diameter, we have even found an increase in the polydispersity of the emulsion produced. A thorough study allowed us to locate the origin of this polydispersity: we ruled out post-production coalescence both in the bulk and in the laminar sub-layer. We showed the possibility of the expansion of the three-phase contact line over more than one pore, phenomenon we referred to as membrane coalescence. Based on these results, we built a model which allows to evaluate the risk of membrane coalescence under experimental conditions of <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux</b> and transmembrane pressure: the number of active pores at a distance dd/ 2 from the centre of a given active pore must be less than 2. For the three pore diameter membranes studied, our model matched the experimental results and could explain the polydispersity observed...|$|R

Moreover the use of membrane emulsification may reduce the energy cost. The food industry is interested in reducing the use of food additives, both to save money and increase consumer acceptance.

40|$|With {{membrane}} emulsification {{in principle}} monodisperse emulsions can be produced, requiring {{a relatively low}} energy density which implies that the shear stress exerted on the ingredients is low. In membrane emulsification the to-be-dispersed phase is pressed through the membrane pores; under certain conditions droplets are formed at the membrane surface. In cross-flow membrane emulsification the droplets are detached by the continuous phase flowing across the membrane surface. A limiting factor for emulsion production on a commercial scale will be a low <b>disperse</b> phase <b>flux.</b> Better knowledge of how membrane parameters affect the <b>disperse</b> phase <b>flux</b> would enable the targeted development of membranes, optimal for the process of cross-flow membrane emulsification for a given application. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of droplet formation at the membrane surface and of the flow of the disperse phase through the membrane {{as a function of the}} membrane characteristics. Droplet formation was studied at a microscopic level with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and by microscopic experiments of droplet formation at a very thin microsieve with uniform pores. Since these membranes are extremely well defined, they are a good model system for detailed study. Results from both simulations and experiments indicate that to prevent coalescence and steric hindrance of droplets, the membrane porosity should be very low. Steric hindrance resulted in polydisperse emulsions and led to coupling of droplet detachment from neighboring pores. Furthermore, although the pores all had the same diameter, the number of pores at which droplets were formed only increased gradually with increasing transmembrane pressure. This effect was further studied with a scaled-up analogon and could be modeled by taking the resistance of the pores and the resistance of a membrane substructure into account. This model is compared with a model for flow through an isotropic membrane with interconnected uniform pores and extended to describe flow through a membrane with a pore size distribution. This model is used to show that in most cases the estimation of a membrane pore size distribution by using the liquid displacement method is not correct. Just as in membrane emulsification, pores become active at higher transmembrane pressures than expected. Finally, the effects of several membrane parameters on membrane emulsification performance are summarized. As an example, the membrane area required for a typical industrial application is estimated using the models mentioned above, for different types of membranes...|$|R

Such magnetic field magnitudes are comparable with the typical value of magnetic field induction necessary for manifestation of electrodynamics non-linearity in vacuum.

The silicon MCE chips consisted of numerous asymmetric through holes with a characteristic cross-sectional size of 20 μm to 50 μm, each consisting of a microslot and a circular microchannel (MC). MCE using such chips enabled the stable production of uniform large droplets with average diameters of 75 μm and 179 μm respectively, and a coefficient of variation below 2 %. The detachment behavior of the large droplets generated from the asymmetric through holes was analyzed and discussed based on results obtained by real-time optical microscopy. The size of droplets smaller than 100 μm was independent of the flow rate of the cross-flowing continuous phase (Qc) applied in this study.

40|$|In {{membrane}} emulsification, especially {{under conditions}} where droplets are forming {{with a narrow}} droplet size distribution, it is conjectured that the interfacial phenomena are determining the emulsification result. The process parameters of continuous phase flow and <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux</b> were analysed {{from the perspective of}} how they could be affecting the interfacial tension of the growing droplet. This work first reviews the applicability of current droplet formation models (force balance and spontaneous transformation based (STB)), describes the interfacial transport of surfactant molecules to an expanding oil-water interface, and models the flow of dispersed phase through a pore using MATLAB. The data from these calculations are then applied in a model to predict the final size of the droplets, which includes dynamic effects of mass transfer and expansion rate. The droplet detachment mechanism in membrane emulsification was modelled {{from the point of view}} of Gibbs free energy. An interactive finite element program called the surface evolver was used to test the model. A program was written and run in the surface evolver, which allows the user to track the droplet shape as it grows, to identify the point of instability due to free energy, and thus predict the maximum stable volume (MSV) attached to the pore. The final droplet size was found by applying a pressure pinch constraint (PPC), which is based on the division of the surface into two volumes, a droplet and a segment, which remains attached to the pore mouth. The relative size of these two volumes is such that the resulting radii of curvature of the droplet will maintain an equal Laplace pressure across the surface of both volumes. Predicted droplet sizes were compared to experimental data from the literature. It was found that changes in surfactant coverage caused by mass transfer coupled to the expansion rate of the oil-water interface have a significant and predictable effect on the final droplet size in membrane emulsification. The extent of the influence of the <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux</b> on dynamic interfacial tension was quantified using a dimensionless parameter, the mass transfer expansion ratio (MER). The MER can be used to predict the effect of increasing the depletion of surfactant on the relative final droplet size in membrane emulsification.

Using microengineered nickel membranes with pore sizes between 15 and 40 μm, median drop sizes of double emulsion droplets were in the range between 100 and 430 μm, depending mainly on the shear at the membrane surface and dispersed phase injection rate.

This data is similar to what was obtained previously for simple O/W emulsions of the same materials. Hence, the internal water phase, and internal surfactant, 5 % PGPR (polyglycerol polyricinoleate), did not adversely influence the emulsification process.

40|$|Membrane {{emulsification}} of oil {{in water}} may be enhanced by mechanically exciting the membrane, thereby enabling the formation of smaller droplets of a narrower size distribution, combined with higher specific production rate. To evaluate this potential, a force balance model was developed that includes the additional forces induced by the transversal membrane movement. This model yielded the ranges of interest of the excitation amplitude A and frequency f. In these ranges of interest, 3 D transient simulations were carried out to predict the 3 D droplet formation and detachment on a single pore under constant cross-flow. For conditions without membrane excitation, the force balance model agreed satisfactorily with experimental results {{reported in the literature}} and with the current 3 D computations. The model also predicts a non-linear dependence of the droplet size on the pore diameter. However, under membrane excitation the extended force balance model does not seem to give reliable results. This is probably due to the simplifications in this model, which does not include the effects of the <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux</b> and viscosity, and the strongly non-spherical droplet geometry upon detachment. Moreover, for large vibration-induced forces coalescence occurred in the 3 D model, which leads to much larger droplets. Thus, fully transient 3 D CFD simulations appear to be required for reliable predictions. Ideally these should account for surfactant dynamics and a variable surface tension coefficient. The simulations show that membrane excitation potentially has a strong effect on the average droplet size in membrane emulsification, but that successful exploitation will require careful design of membrane and process.

The Brγ line is resolved by VLTI+AMBER on all three baselines, with the maximum projected baseline extending 69 meter and a P. A. ranging between 10 ◦ and 30 ◦. A differential phase between line and continuum is detected on the longest baseline. The Brγ emission region is found to have a diameter of 3. 3 milli-arcseconds (FWHM), when compared to a Gaussian intensity distribution. A uniform disk and a ring-like intensity distribution do not fit the line visibilities. The size of the continuum emission is not constrained by the observations. Comparing the AMBER equivalent width of Brγ with measurements from various epochs, we find that the stellar photosphere contributes about 60 % of the total continuum light at 2. 2 µm. The remaining 40 % continuum emission is found on scales larger than the 66 mas AMBER field of view. This independently confirms similar results made by previous studies. If the Brγ emission is optically thin, then the observations do not allow to make any inferences about the shape of the line forming region. However, there is indirect evidence that the hydrogen recombination line emission is optically thick. In that case, using simple arguments, we find that the line emitting region is elongated.

The Dispersion Cell membrane emulsification technique {{was used for the}} production of w/o emulsions with controlled droplet size and narrow size distribution. The influence of the operating parameters of the process was investigated. Varying the <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux</b> (10 - 1250 L h- 1 m- 2) and the shear stress (2 - 59 Pa), droplets between 30 and 280 μm were produced with CV's as low as 18 %. Nickel and stainless steel membranes were used for the membrane emulsification. Pore geometry influenced the droplet size as well as uniformity and a normally hydrophilic stainless steel membrane with sharp pore openings produced more uniform and smaller drops compared to a PTFE coated hydrophobic nickel membrane with a conical pore surface. For the dispersed phase 15 wt. % PVA or 1 - 3 wt. % chitosan as well as their blends in water were used. Surfactants PGPR and ABIL EM 90 were tested to determine their capability to form stable emulsions in Miglyol 840. PGPR could not be used to stabilize the emulsion with chitosan as the dispersed phase, probably due to the chemical interference between the carboxyl group present in the PGPR and chitosan. Solid microparticles were obtained by chemical crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (GA) at different concentrations (1 - 50 vol. %). Particles crosslinked using less than 10 vol. % GA were able to swell and release encapsulated compounds. Acid sensitive particles were produced by blending the PVA and chitosan. Up to 80 % of Cu 2 + and 20 % of sodium salicylate was released from the particles under acidic conditions. No significant release was determined under neutral conditions...|$|R

Methods: We use three telescopes of the VLT Interferometer {{in combination with the}} AMBER near-infrared beam combiner to measure spectrally <b>dispersed</b> correlated <b>fluxes</b> in the K-band around the Brγ transition. The resulting visibilities are compared with predictions of various simple models in order to infer the size of the observed emission region. Results: The Brγ line is resolved by VLTI+AMBER on all three baselines, with the maximum projected baseline extending 69 m and a PA ranging between 10 ° and 30 °. A differential phase between line and continuum is detected on the longest baseline. The best fitting model, a Gaussian flux distribution, implies a size of the Brγ emission region of 3. 3 milli-arcsec (FWHM). The size of the continuum emission is not constrained by the observations. From a comparison of the AMBER equivalent width of Brγ with measurements from various epochs, we find that the stellar photosphere contributes about 60 % of the total continuum light at 2. 2 μm. The remaining 40 % continuum emission originates from structures larger than the 66 mas AMBER field of view. This independently confirms similar results made by previous studies. If the Brγ emission is optically thin, then the observations do not allow to make any inferences about the shape of the line forming region. However, there is indirect evidence that the hydrogen recombination line emission is optically thick. In that case, using simple arguments, we find that the line emitting region is elongated. This is because the spectrum indicates that the projected line emitting area is about twice that of the stellar surface. A circular Brγ line emitting area, however, would have a size an order of magnitude larger using the size of the emission region measured along our baseline. We briefly mention the possibilities whether such a structure is due to a bi-polar flow or a circumstellar disk. Based on observations with VLTI, proposal 077. D- 0388...|$|R

V. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] emulsions consisting of rapeseed oil as the dispersed phase and 2 wt. % Tween 80 dissolved in demineralized water as the continuous phase were prepared by using different emulsification methods, such as membrane emulsification (ME) with Shirasu porous glass (SPG) and α-aluminium oxide (α-Al 2 O 3) membranes, microfluidization (MF) and microchannel (MC) emulsification. The influence of operating conditions and membrane structure on the emulsification process and the emulsion properties was investigated and compared. Under the same conditions and for the same pore size, the SPG membrane enabled to obtain more uniform droplets (span= 0. 26 – 0. 45) than α-Al 2 O 3 membrane. However, the span of the droplet size distribution of 0. 51 – 0. 59 for the α-Al 2 O 3 membrane at the wall shear stress of 8 Pa and the <b>dispersed</b> phase <b>flux</b> up to 9 l m− 2 h− 1 was significantly smaller than that reported elsewhere for the same membrane type, which was due to careful membrane cleaning by ultrasonication. The calculated maximum proportion of active pores for unhindered droplet growth was higher for the α-Al 2 O 3 than for SPG membrane, due to the smaller porosity and smaller mean droplet/pore size ratio for the α-Al 2 O 3 membrane. At the same Δptm/pcap ratio, the actual proportion of active pores was also higher for this membrane, due to the smaller thickness of active layer. The microfluidization is a suitable method for producing O/W emulsions with a very small mean droplet sizes of 0. 085 – 0. 30 μm, that cannot be attained by membrane or microchannel emulsification. However, the span of the droplet size distribution was in the range between 0. 91 and 2. 7...|$|R
40|$|The sudden {{reconnection}} of a non-force free 2 D current layer, {{embedded in}} a low-beta plasma, triggered by the onset of an anomalous resistivity, is studied in detail. The resulting behaviour consists of two main phases. Firstly, a transient reconnection phase, in which the current in the layer is rapidly <b>dispersed</b> and some <b>flux</b> is reconnected. This dispersal of current launches a family of small amplitude magnetic and plasma perturbations, which propagate away from the null at the local fast and slow magnetosonic speeds. The {{vast majority of the}} magnetic energy released in this phase goes into internal energy of the plasma, and only a tiny amount is converted into kinetic energy. In the wake of the outwards propagating pulses, an imbalance of Lorentz and pressure forces creates a stagnation flow which drives a regime of impulsive bursty reconnection, in which fast reconnection is turned on and off in a turbulent manner as the current density exceeds and falls below a critical value. During this phase, the null current density is continuously built up above a certain critical level, then dissipated very rapidly, and built up again, in a stochastic manner. Interestingly, the magnetic energy converted during this quasi-steady phase is greater than that converted during the initial transient reconnection phase. Again essentially all the energy converted during this phase goes directly to internal energy. These results are of potential importance for solar flares and coronal heating, and set a conceptually important reference for future 3 D studies. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Blowdon cooling heat {{transfer}} {{is an important}} process that occurs early in a hypothetical large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) in a pressurized water reactor. During blowdown, the flow through the hot assembly is a post-critical heat <b>flux</b> <b>dispersed</b> droplet flow. The {{heat transfer}} mechanisms that occur in blowdown cooling are complex and depend on droplet and heated surface interaction. In a safety analysis, it is of considerable importance to determine the thermal-hydraulic conditions leading to the minimum film boiling temperature, Tmin. A flow boiling rig for measurement of blowdown cooling heat transfer and quench phenomena on a nuclear fuel rod simulator was designed and constructed for operation at up to 12. 4 MPa. The test section consisted of a concentric annulus, with a 9. 5 mm OD nuclear fuel rod simulator at the center. The rod was contained within a 0. 85 mm thick, 19 mm OD 316 stainless steel tube, forming the flow channel. Two types of rods were tested; one type was sheathed with Inconel 600 while the other was clad with Zircaloy- 2. Water was injected into the test section {{at the top of}} the heated length through an injection header. This header was an annular sign that fit around the fuel rod simulator and within the stainless steel tube. Small spacers aligned the injection header and prevented contract with either the heater rod or the tube. A series of small diameter holes at the bottom of the header caused the formation of droplets that became entrained with the steam flow. The test section design was such that quench would take place on the rod, and not along the channel outer annulus...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} status of an ongoing {{investigation}} to discern {{the influence of the}} divertor and plasma geometry on the confinement of both ELM-free and ELMing discharges in DIII-D. The ultimate goal is to achieve a high-performance core plasma which coexists with an advanced divertor plasma. The divertor plasma must reduce the heat flux to acceptable levels; the current technique <b>disperses</b> the heat <b>flux</b> over a wide area by radiation (a radiative divertor). To date, we have obtained our best performance in double-null (DN) high-triangularity ({delta} {approximately} 0. 8) ELM-free discharges. As discussed in detail elsewhere, there are several advantages for both the core and divertor plasma with highly-shaped DN operation. Previous radiative-divertor experiments with D{sub 2 } injection in DN high-{delta} ELMing H-mode have shown that this configuration is more sensitive to gas puffing ({tau} decreases). Moving the X-point away from the target plate (to {approximately} 15 cm above the plate) decreases this sensitivity. Preliminary measurements also indicate that gas puffing reduces the divertor heat flux but does not reduce the plasma pressure along the field line. The up/down heat flux balance can be varied magnetically (by changing the distance between the separatrices), with a slight magnetic imbalance required to balance the heat flux. The overall mission of the Radiative Divertor Project (RDP) is to install a fully pumped and baffled high-{delta} DN divertor. To date, however, both the DIII-D divertor diagnostics and pump were optimized for lower single-null (LSN) low-{delta} ({delta}{approximately} 0. 4) plasmas, so much of the divertor physics has been performed in LSN; these results are discussed in Section 2. As part of {{the first phase of the}} RDP, we have installed a new high-{delta} USN divertor baffle and pump; these results are discussed in Section 3. Both divertor and core parameters are discussed in each case...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{magnetic}} flux from the quiet-sun photosphere {{is important for}} maintaining the statistical steady-state of the magnetic field there, for determining the magnetic flux budget of the Sun, and for estimating the rate of energy injected into the upper solar atmosphere. Magnetic feature death is a measurable proxy {{for the removal of}} detectable flux. We used the SWAMIS feature tracking code to understand how nearly 20000 detected magnetic features die in an hour-long sequence of Hinode/SOT/NFI magnetograms of a region of quiet Sun. Of the feature deaths that remove visible magnetic flux from the photosphere, the vast majority do so by a process that merely <b>disperses</b> the previously-detected <b>flux</b> so that it is too small and too weak to be detected. The behavior of the ensemble average of these dispersals is not consistent with a model of simple planar diffusion, suggesting that the dispersal is constrained by the evolving photospheric velocity field. We introduce the concept of the partial lifetime of magnetic features, and show that the partial lifetime due to Cancellation of magnetic flux, 22 h, is 3 times slower than previous measurements of the flux turnover time. This indicates that prior feature-based estimates of the flux replacement time may be too short, in contrast with the tendency for this quantity to decrease as resolution and instrumentation have improved. This suggests that dispersal of flux to smaller scales is more important for the replacement of magnetic fields in the quiet Sun than observed bipolar cancellation. We conclude that processes on spatial scales smaller than those visible to Hinode dominate the processes of flux emergence and cancellation, and therefore also the quantity of magnetic flux that threads the photosphere.
