500|$|Despite the defeat, David James {{expressed}} his opinions over them match while also {{suggesting that the}} match would most likely be his last in the Indian Super League. After scoring the winning goal for his side, Mohammed Rafique was very happy while also singing the praises of his coach, saying, [...] "I cannot describe what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>feeling</b> in words," [...] said the midfielder. [...] "I {{would like to thank}} my coach, who had faith in me. It was he who decided to bring me on and what happened next was surreal. People dream of scoring in a final and I am very fortunate that I got to experience that in the flesh." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>feeling,</b> {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
50|$|I {{began to}} ceaselessly examine and confirm my state of mind: myself {{when it went}} well, myself when it went poorly, myself when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to defeat my partner, myself when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> fear, myself when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> insecure, etc. From these confirmations, I learned the {{importance}} of ceaselessly keeping my mind calm.|$|R

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, {{the album}} {{contains}} [...] "raspy braggadocio and sexy rhymes" [...] which complement Queen's raspy vocals. It alternates between reggaetón and hip hop as Queen experiments with Caribbean music, R, pop, electronica, funk, dancehall and acoustic ballads: [...] "I really think this album {{is for people}} to really just sit down and listen to it". She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful. Although Queen said the album has its share of [...] "battles against men", she wants it to demonstrate that she is a well–rounded artist. Describing the songs, she said [...] " [...] {{are always going to be}} real because they are feelings that people have...The hits that I have now, the girls love them because they are real. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>feeling</b> hurt and need to curse to express that, then I will. I am going to be real all the way because that's what made Ivy Queen".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} that Patel and Bhatt broke their five-year relationship. Bhatt confirmed the break-up {{in a conversation}} with Mid-Day. Shortly afterwards, Patel's parents explained their willingness to reconcile with their daughter and that [...] "everybody is happy about the break-up" [...] but their relationship remained strained. On 12 March 2008, Patel was spotted with London-based businessman Kanav Puri at Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. In June 2008, she confirmed their relationship in an interview with Mid-Day: [...] "I did not admit to Kanav sooner because he's very special and I did not want to jinx it. It was too precious for me to talk about it to people. It's almost six months now and now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>feeling</b> secure and now I know our relationship is too strong for anything or anyone to come between us." [...] The media once reported that she got married to Puri but she denied these rumours.|$|E

I am really nervous but now we have started rehearsing, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>feeling</b> equally excited. It will {{definitely}} be an experience and I hope Perry runs smoothly!" [...] She also said she was [...] "terrified" [...] of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she [...] "was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was [...] "really, really nervous" [...] and that the prospect of acting the birth was [...] "very scary", but added, [...] "I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at EastEnders for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll go well." [...] To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told [...] "It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!" [...] She found it [...] "quite difficult" [...] to imagine what it would be like to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show One Born Every Minute to help, as she did not want to [...] "overdo the scene or make it look really fake." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> {{sick and}} faint with horror now. Gunga Dass nearly {{rolled off the}} {{platform}} and howled aloud.|$|R
