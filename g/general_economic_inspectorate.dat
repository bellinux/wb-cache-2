40|$|The paper {{examines}} the theoretical contributions of two eminent {{representatives of the}} Italian Paretian School, namely Luigi Amoroso and Giulio La Volpe. Both contributed to the most ambitious project undertaken by the Paretian School, that is, dynamization of the <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> equilibrium. This research programme was grounded on two pillars. The first concerned the use of then sophisticated mathematical instruments, such as functional, differential equations, and the calculus of variations. The second pillar involved maintenance of a strict analogy with physics and mechanics. But whilst Amoroso mainly used a theory based on the past, La Volpe founded his proposal on the future. <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> equilibrium, economic dynamics, Pareto...|$|R

Meanwhile, {{the decisions of the}} House of Lords in OBG Ltd v Allan [2008] 1 AC 1 and Total Network SL v HMRC [2008] 1 AC 1174 have left us with unanswered questions regarding the scope {{and the future of the}} <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> torts. This paper proposes an economic approach to the <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> torts under English common law. It examines the extent to which economic theory could guide the development of the <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> torts under English law. To this end, this paper looks at the influence of economic theory on business tort principles in the United States and seeks to draw comparative lessons from U. S. law...|$|R

50|$|Max Weber's Wirtschaftsgeschichte (<b>General</b> <b>Economic</b> History in English) (1923) {{is a book}} of {{economic}} theory which was composed by his students from lecture notes and released three {{years after his death}} in 1920. In his <b>General</b> <b>Economic</b> History, Weber creates an institutional theory of the rise of capitalism in the west. Unlike in his earlier work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, religion is given a minor role. The emphasis of the work lies instead on the place of the state and calculable law in allowing economic actors to predict exchange for gain.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades the interplay between Services of <b>General</b> <b>Economic</b> Interest and the EU law of {{competition}} and State aid has shifted from near anonymity to the centre stage of political and legal debate. This reflects the apparent reorientation of the European Union’s objectives from those of a purely economic nature to ones more social and cohesion-oriented. The inclusion of Article 14 TFEU in the ‘Principles’ part of the Treaty coupled with the evolution of the European Court of Justice’s approach towards the services in question places the issue beyond purely competition law. The paper examines the concept of Services of <b>General</b> <b>Economic</b> Interest {{in the light of the}} evolution of delimitation of vertical competences and responsibilities between Member States and EU. It addresses the dynamic evolution of the legal environment of Services of <b>General</b> <b>Economic</b> Interest and tackles the issue whether this process could be regarded as the birth and development of a communautaire concept of public services...|$|R
