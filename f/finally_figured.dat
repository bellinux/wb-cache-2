Tags are written in all lowercase, with no spaces, and limited to 64 characters. For example, articles could be tagged as being about [...] "security" [...] or [...] "mozilla".

500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E

500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early because I knew there would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. Here she was able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album. The landscape around Broome inspired the lyrics for [...] "Going North". She said, [...] "It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country". The lyrics for [...] "Steer" [...] were inspired when Higgins looked up at the night sky on a Broome beach: [...] "It dawned on me how small we are, how short life is ... I felt so liberated to have <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> that out." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Vespertine {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 28 reviews. Heather Phares from AllMusic called it [...] "an album singing {{the praises of}} peace and quiet", praising it for proving that [...] "intimacy {{can be just as}} compelling as louder emotions". Anthony Carew from About.com gave the album the highest rating and said it was [...] "quite possibly the best album of the '00s". He considered the album to be self-aware of [...] "the digital epoch [...] had just dawned upon the realm of recorded music" [...] in the early 2000s, noting that it is [...] "not just a product of this brave new non-world, but wholly informed by that." [...] The A.V. Clubs Keith Phipps found it to be: [...] "an album both timeless and of the moment, an avant-garde electronic-pop exploration of classic themes". David Fricke of Rolling Stone felt that Vespertine was: [...] "the sound and sentiment of a woman exulting in the power and possibility of her gift, one who has <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> out how to grow up without growing old." [...] In a later review for The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Douglas Wolk described the album as [...] "a banquet in the hall of Björk's personal erotics" [...] and stated that [...] "it's not the stuff of radio hits, but the music is spectacular".|$|E
500|$|The gesture {{has been}} {{involved}} in notable political events. During the [...] incident, in which an American ship was captured by North Korea, the captured American crewmembers often discreetly gave the finger in staged photo ops, thus ruining the North Koreans' efforts at propaganda. The North Koreans, ignorant of what the gesture meant, were at first told by the prisoners that it was a [...] "Hawaiian good luck sign", similar to the shaka. When the guards <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> things out, the crewmembers were subjected to more severe mistreatment. [...] Abbie Hoffman used the gesture at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Ronald Reagan, while serving as the Governor of California, gave the middle finger to counterculture protestors in Berkeley, California. Nelson Rockefeller, then the Vice President of the United States, directed the gesture to hecklers at a 1976 campaign stop near Binghamton, New York, leading it to be called the [...] "Rockefeller gesture". Pierre Trudeau, then the Prime Minister of Canada, gave the finger to protesters in Salmon Arm, British Columbia, earning the incident the nickname the [...] "Salmon Arm salute". The gesture itself has also been nicknamed the [...] "Trudeau salute". Former president George W. Bush gave the finger to the camera at an Austin production facility during his term as governor of Texas, saying it was [...] "just a one-finger victory salute." [...] Anthony Weiner gave the finger to reporters after leaving his election headquarters the night he lost the 2013 primary election for Mayor of New York City.|$|E

The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the {{attendance}} as the first, and the 3rd awards ceremony had double this number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: [...] "We <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press {{from all over the}} world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on," [...] he said to BBC News.|$|E
2500|$|Coppola had {{developed}} a list of actors for all the roles, and his list of potential Dons included the Oscar-winning Italian-American Ernest Borgnine, the Italian-American Frank de Kova (best known for playing Chief Wild Eagle on the TV sit-com F-Troop), John Marley (a Best Supporting Oscar-nominee for Paramount's 1970 hit movie Love Story who was cast as the movie producer Jack Woltz in the picture), the Italian-American Richard Conte (who was cast as Don Corleone's deadly rival Don Emilio Barzini), and Italian movie producer Carlo Ponti. Coppola admitted in a 1975 interview, [...] "We <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> we had to lure the best actor in the world. It was that simple. That boiled down to Laurence Olivier or Marlon Brando, who are the greatest actors in the world." [...] The holographic copy of Coppola's cast list shows Brando's name underlined.|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, Grant warned Boutwell that a [...] "desperate struggle" [...] {{was taking}} place between the [...] "bulls and bears" [...] of the gold market. Corbin told Gould he was {{concerned}} whether Grant would stop selling gold from the Treasury, whereby Gould told Corbin {{to write a letter}} to Grant encouraging him not to sell gold. Corbin wrote Grant the letter, now lost, encouraging Grant not to sell gold. Fisk had the letter delivered by William Chapin of the Erie Railroad, to Washington, Pennsylvania, where Grant was vacationing. Interrupting Grant's crochet game, Chapin gave him Corbin's letter, whereupon Grant read the letter and told Chapin [...] "No, nothing" [...] when Chapin asked for a reply. When Chapin had left, Porter told Grant about Gould setting up a $500,000 gold account in New York. Upon hearing this, Grant <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> out what Gould and Fisk were up to. Through a letter his wife was writing to her sister, Grant urged Corbin to {{have nothing to do with}} Gould and Fisk, and promptly arranged a meeting with Boutwell.|$|E

50|$|When Isaac Newton {{published}} the Principia Mathematica in 1687, he <b>finally</b> <b>figured</b> {{out how the}} heavens moved. Newton provided a physical mechanism for Kepler's laws and his law of universal gravitation allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the Copernican principle—that the bodies on earth obey the same physical laws as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.|$|E

Concerning the 8 -mm sphere, no correlation can be found between the detection rate and VOI size. However, if detected, the volume error is also constant over the VOI range.|$|R
