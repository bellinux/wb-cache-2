5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
5|$|Being a soft metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS <b>form)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> size of its luggage compartment (572 litres). But {{the fact that a}} car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E

5|$|The {{work was}} {{translated}} back to French by Felix Coveliers for a {{production at the}} Fantaisies-Parisiennes in Brussels, which opened on 28 December 1878, despite concerns from Scribe's widow. However, in Paris, she refused permission for the Gaîté to mount the work in that <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> directors of the Théâtre des Nouveautés, Boulevard des Italiens therefore procured a much altered libretto from Alfred Delacour and Victor Wilder, {{and in this form}} the Paris première was produced at that theatre on 15 March 1879, with costumes by Grévin, running for 59 nights. Revived in April 1882, the production received 55 more performances, with Marguerite Ugalde in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Written by Mike Tucker & Robert Perry, {{this was}} a three-part Cybermen story set in war-torn London of the 1940s. They had {{completed}} the first two episodes in script <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> final episode as a storyline, and were planning to submit it during the start of production on season 26. Fellow writer Ben Aaronovitch intercepted the script, suggesting that submitting to script editor Andrew Cartmel a World War II script when he was currently already editing something similar (The Curse of Fenric) was a mistake and to instead submit it for the following series. Tucker & Perry later adapted the story as a novel for the BBC Past Doctors range in October 1997.|$|E
5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E

5|$|During the 2006–07 season, manager Colin Todd {{had been}} sacked {{because of a}} poor run of results. Club captain David Wetherall was {{originally}} appointed Todd's successor on a caretaker basis, before being handed the role {{until the end of}} the season, during the following month. Wetherall could not stop City's run of poor <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> club were relegated to League Two on 28 April 2007 after a 3–0 defeat at Chesterfield. It was the club's third relegation in seven seasons, and meant the 2007–08 season would be their first season in the fourth division of English football in 25years. On 22 May 2007, former City player Stuart McCall, who had played more than 400games for the club during two previous spells, was announced as the club's new manager to take over on 1 June 2007. Although the club had just 13players with first-team experience, the bookmakers made City second favourites to win the League Two title.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive <b>Form</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E

5|$|Secular {{portraiture}} was {{a rarity}} in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end {{of the market in}} betrothal portraits or royal family commissions. While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed. Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer; his seminal 1432 Léal Souvenir is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance. His Arnolfini Portrait is filled with symbolism, as is the Madonna of Chancelor Rolin, commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.|$|E
5|$|Serevi started 2001 {{by leading}} Fiji in the 2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Argentina.

Serevi was omitted from the team due to <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> desire to develop new players for the 2004 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Fiji's coach at the time, Tomasi Cama, suggested Serevi had lost some pace and age was catching up with him. Serevi's last sevens tournament for the year was the World Games in Akita, Japan. As captain, he led Fiji to the Gold medal after defeating Australia 35–19 in the final.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars {{have two}} {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps, not three {{as in the}} black and brown rats. The first and second upper molars are oval in <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars. The anterocone, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (anteromedian flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the anteromedian fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the labial cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest are united into a single structure by wear. In the third upper molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small labial root.|$|E
