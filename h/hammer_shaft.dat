60|$|The wooden conduit which sprang {{across a}} gorge just {{there on a}} slender trestle was full to the brim, and Brooke, who leaned on his long <b>hammer</b> <b>shaft,</b> watched the crystal water swirl by with a {{satisfaction}} which was distinctly new to him, while the roar it made as it plunged down into the valley {{from the end of}} the uncompleted flume came throbbing across the pines. Though it was a very crude piece of engineering, that trestle had cost him hours of anxious thought and days of strenuous labor, and now, standing above it, very wet and somewhat ragged, with hands as hard as a navvy's, he surveyed it with a pride which was scarcely warranted by its appearance. It was, however, the creation of his hands and brain, and evidently capable of doing its work effectively.|$|E

He is {{recorded}} as leasing Canserns (also spelt Canserne or Cansiron) Forge in Hartfield, Sussex, in 1589 and Pilbeams (Ashurst) Forge in Chiddingstone and Withyham on the borders of Kent and Sussex in 1592, and he died in possession of the latter in 1601. [...] A tilt <b>hammer</b> <b>shaft</b> and wooden anvil base found at Cansiron Forge are in the Anne of Cleaves Museum in Lewes.|$|E

This paper {{studies the}} bearing {{capacity}} parameters {{of a single}} pile of <b>hammering</b> sunk <b>shaft</b> rammer pile with engineering practice, proposes three parameters: the shape factor of expanded head α, correction factor of pile tip resistance β and the uplift height h, modifies the calculation formulae of bearing capacity of a single pile and expanded head based on these parameters, and validates the application of these parameters with engineering practice. ...|$|R
50|$|The Frohnauer Hammer {{still has}} the {{original}} hammer mill technology from {{the second half of}} the 17th century. The heart of this system is the three tilt <b>hammers,</b> whose <b>shafts</b> are driven by an overshot water wheel. The hammers themselves have a weight of 100 kg, 200 kg and 250 kg. They can develop a hammer force of up to 12 tons. Nowadays, during demonstrations, only the small hammer is operated. The bellows system has also been preserved. A water-driven, manual lathe and a drill spindle may be viewed in an outbuilding.|$|R

She is {{best known}} for her roles during the 1970s, which {{included}} blaxploitation films such as <b>Hammer,</b> Melinda, Blacula, <b>Shaft</b> in Africa, Detroit 9000 and 1974's Thomasine & Bushrod alongside her then-boyfriend Max Julien. She was a regular on the 1987 Universal Television situation comedy Bustin' Loose, starring as Mimi Shaw for its first and only season (1987-88).|$|R

Biomass grinding machine {{is an important part}} of the briquetting plant, whose function is to convert aggregate material in to small pieces. Biomass grinder consists of mainly <b>hammer,</b> grate and <b>shaft.</b> Shaft is an essential component of grinding machine, when holds hammers, pulley and fan. The failures of shaft bearing were observed due to non uniform distribution of stress. The study was under taken to conduct simulation study of shaft for stress analysis with the help of FE software ANSY...|$|R
40|$|Slow speed {{rotary shear}} {{shredders}} have recently re ceived considerable attention for processing of municipal solid waste. Potential benefits from shear shredding could include reduced explosion potential, lower power con sumption, lower operating and maintenance costs and less overgrinding of glass. Although {{there has been}} much interest in rotary shear shredders, little actual operating data exist showing the capacity and performance of these units on municipal solid waste at full scale. A large scale, 50 TPH (45. 3 tph) Iowa Manufacturing Company (Cedarapids) Model 5096 (127 cm X 244 cm) shear shredder was installed and has been evaluated over a 6 -month period at the Charleston County Solid Waste Reduction Center. Two Heil 42 F vertical <b>shaft</b> <b>hammer</b> mills also are operated at the reduction center. Long term landfill tests were conducted on waste processed by both shredders to measure the performance of the shear shred der and to compare the effect of shredder type on land filling characteristics. These results show capacity in excess of 60 TPH (54. 4 tph) using 4 in. (10 cm) cutters and comparable landfilling characteristics for both types of shredders...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Increasingly, {{communities}} {{are making the}} decision to process collected recycled glass locally {{in order to develop}} local recycled glass self-reliance. This Best Practice presents a spreadsheet {{that can be used to}} help a community to make the “ship or process”decision [...] Best Practice: The economic model below is based on the actual costs of a community glass processing system established in 1997. The system was manufactured by Andela Tool and Machine of Richfield Springs, New York. The community’s recycled glass collections totaled about 1000 tons per year, which means that the 5 -ton per hour processing system operates only one day per week. This processing system consists of an infeed hopper, infeed conveyor, two-stage pulverizer, outfeed conveyor, and twostage trommel separator. The pulverizer is an impact mill with a series of hinged <b>hammers</b> attached to <b>shafts.</b> The system generates two grades: 1 / 8 x 3 / 8 ” and 1 / 8 ” and finer. The coarse output is being used as drainage aggregate and the finer is being used in on-site wastewater treatment systems.
