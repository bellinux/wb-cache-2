25|$|Illingworth played 787 {{first-class}} matches over nearly 33 years. As a bowler {{in county}} cricket, he took 2072 wickets. He sent down 408 balls without reward {{in the three}} Tests against New Zealand in 1973 but conceded only 1.91 runs an over in his Test career. He was not a sharp spinner of the ball, relying on accuracy and subtle variations of flight, but his arm ball was particularly effective with many of his victims being caught at slip, playing for spin that was not there. His middle-order batting was based around stern defence; a fifth of his innings, mostly from number 6 or 7 in the order, finished not out. He scored 24,134 first-class runs in all, with a best of 162, {{at an average of}} 28.06. Against the Rest of the World in 1970, Illingworth topped the England averages with 476 runs (52.89) and six half-centuries, a testament to <b>his</b> <b>grit</b> and determination against the best in the world.|$|E
