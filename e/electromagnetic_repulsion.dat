25|$|The fission of a {{heavy nucleus}} {{requires}} a total input energy of about 7 to 8 million electron volts (MeV) to initially overcome the nuclear force which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape, and from there, deform it into a two-lobed ("peanut") shape in which the lobes are {{able to continue to}} separate from each other, pushed by their mutual positive charge, in the most common process of binary fission (two positively charged fission products + neutrons). Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a critical distance, beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the (longer range) <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.|$|E
25|$|The first {{island of}} {{stability}} {{is expected to}} be centered on unbibium-306 (with 122 protons and 184 neutrons), and the second {{is expected to be}} centered on unhexquadium-482 (with 164 protons and 318 neutrons). This second island of stability should confer additional stability on elements 152–168; on the other hand, due to the enormously greater forces of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> that must be overcome by the strong force at this second island, it is possible that nuclei around this region only exist as resonances and cannot stay together for a meaningful amount of time. It is also possible that some of the superactinides between these series may not actually exist because they are too far from both islands, in which case the periodic table would quite possibly end around Z = 130 instead of 173, with nuclear properties imposing an end earlier than the electronic properties.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{research}} {{efforts to develop}} a hardware concept were successful {{on the scale of}} millimeters, creating cylindrical prototypes 44 millimeters in diameter which interact with each other via electromagnetic attraction. Their experiments helped researchers verify the relationship between mass and potential force between objects as “a 10-fold reduction in size [...] should translate to a 100-fold increase in force relative to mass”. Recent advancements in this prototype concept are in the form of one millimeter diameter cylindrical robots fabricated on a thin film by photolithography that would cooperate with each other using complex software that would control <b>electromagnetic</b> attraction and <b>repulsion</b> between modules.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetism-like (EML) {{algorithm}} {{is a new}} evolutionary algorithm that bases on the <b>electromagnetic</b> attraction and <b>repulsion</b> among particles. It was originally proposed to solve optimization problems with bounded variables. Since its inception, many variants of the EML algorithm have been proposed in the literature. However, it remains unclear how to simulate the electromagnetic heuristics in an EML algorithm effectively to achieve the best performance. This study surveys and compares the EML algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, local search and perturbed point are two techniques commonly used in an EML algorithm to fine tune the solution and to help escaping from local optimums, respectively. Performance study is conducted to understand their impact on an EML algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The Physic-inspired {{computation}} {{is becoming}} popular {{and has been}} acknowledged by the scientific community. This emerging area has developed {{a wide range of}} techniques and methods for dealing with complex problems. On the other hand, automatic circle detection in digital images has been considered as an important and complex task for the computer vision community that has devoted a tremendous amount of research seeking for an optimal circle detector. This article presents an algorithm for the automatic detection of circular shapes embedded into complicated and noisy images with no consideration of the conventional Hough transform techniques. The approach is based on a nature-inspired technique called the Electromagnetism- Like Optimization (EMO) which is a heuristic method following electromagnetism principles for solving complex optimization problems. For the EMO algorithm, solutions are built considering the <b>electromagnetic</b> attraction and <b>repulsion</b> among charged particles with a charge representing the fitness solution for each particle. The algorithm uses the encoding of three non-collinear points as candidate circles over an edge-only image. Guided by the values of the objective function, the set of encoded candidate circles (charged particles) are evolved using the EMO algorithm so that they can fit into the actual circles on the edge map of the image. Experimental results from several tests on synthetic and natural images with a varying range of complexity are included to validate the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding accuracy, speed, and robustness...|$|R
500|$|Thorium nuclei are {{susceptible}} to alpha decay because the strong nuclear force cannot overcome the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between their protons. The alpha decay of 232Th decay initiates the 4n decay chain which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by 4 (hence the name; it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor). This chain of consecutive alpha and beta decays begins with the decay of 232Th to 228Ra and terminates at 208Pb. Any sample of thorium or its compounds contains traces of these daughters, which are isotopes of thallium, lead, bismuth, polonium, radon, radium, and actinium. Natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract useful daughter nuclides, such as 212Pb, which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy. 232Th also very occasionally undergoes spontaneous fission rather than alpha decay, and has left evidence in doing so in its minerals (as trapped xenon gas formed as a fission product), but the partial half-life {{of this process is}} very large at over 1021years and alpha decay predominates.Th |journal=Phys.

2500|$|From {{theoretical}} considerations, in 1934 Hideki Yukawa {{predicted the}} existence and the approximate mass of the [...] "meson" [...] as the carrier of the nuclear force that holds atomic nuclei together. If there were no nuclear force, all nuclei with two or more protons would fly apart due to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion.</b> Yukawa called his carrier particle the meson, from μέσος mesos, the Greek word for [...] "intermediate", because its predicted mass was between that of the electron {{and that of the}} proton, which has about 1,836 times the mass of the electron.

50|$|A {{stronger}} {{attractive force}} was postulated {{to explain how}} the atomic nucleus was bound despite the protons' mutual <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion.</b> This hypothesized force was called the strong force, which was believed to be a fundamental force that acted on the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus.|$|E
40|$|The Lorentz {{transform}} {{indicates that}} the emission and absorption of a photon occur when events separate in real time are synchronous in complex time. Photons only exist as separate entities from the point perspective of real time. Cumulative fields of time dilation act within complex time also. If this is true then electromagnetic fields do not contain any energy. An explanation for inertia as the consequence of electromagnetic force is then in harmony with both relativity and quantum mechanics. Inertia may be an interaction with matter in the distant universe. Gravity may be a geometric imbalance between <b>electromagnetic</b> attraction and <b>repulsion</b> due to the distribution of charges. The results of recent propulsion experiments can then be explained. 2 Insights into the relevance of complex time to our relationship with the distant universe may be gained from both Einstein and Landau. Einstein proposed that the photon has momentum, or at least conveys momentum, which is an important distinction because the photon has no observable existence independent of the matter with which it interacts. He describes the role of imaginary time, within special relativity, in the lectures he delivered at Princeton in 1921. In lecture II, he introduces light-time, l = ct in place of time, t, to avoid {{the use of the}} inflexible ratio, c, between light speed and the passage of time in the description of curvilinear space. The Lorentz transformation can then be defined as, ∆ l 2 = ∆ x 1 2 + ∆ x...|$|R
50|$|A charged {{black hole}} {{is a black}} hole that {{possesses}} electric charge. Since the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> in compressing an electrically charged mass is dramatically greater than the gravitational attraction (by about 40 orders of magnitude), it is not expected that black holes with a significant electric charge will be formed in nature.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} shapes for the density {{distribution}} of protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus are spherical, prolate and oblate spheroidal, where the polar axis {{is assumed to}} be the spin axis (or direction of the spin angular momentum vector). Deformed nuclear shapes occur {{as a result of the}} competition between <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between protons, surface tension and quantum shell effects.|$|E
50|$|Since {{interacting}} protons have {{a mutual}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> that {{is stronger than}} their attractive nuclear interaction, neutrons are a necessary constituent of any atomic nucleus that contains more than one proton (see diproton and neutron-proton ratio).

50|$|Virtual {{particles}} do {{not necessarily}} carry the same mass as the corresponding real particle, although they always conserve energy and momentum. The longer the virtual particle exists, the closer its characteristics come to those of ordinary particles. They are important in the physics of many processes, including particle scattering and Casimir forces. In quantum field theory, even classical forces—such as the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> or attraction between two charges—can {{be thought of as}} due to the exchange of many virtual photons between the charges.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935 Hideki Yukawa [...] {{proposed}} {{the first significant}} theory of the strong force {{to explain how the}} nucleus holds together. In the Yukawa interaction a virtual particle, later called a meson, mediated a force between all nucleons, including protons and neutrons. This force explained why nuclei did not disintegrate under the influence of proton repulsion, and it also gave an explanation of why the attractive strong force had a more limited range than the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between protons. Later, the discovery of the pi meson showed it to have the properties of Yukawa's particle.|$|E

50|$|These {{disintegration}} energies however {{are substantially}} {{smaller than the}} potential barrier provided by the nuclear force, which prevents the alpha particle from escaping. The energy needed is generally {{in the range of}} about 25 MeV, the amount of work that must be done against <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> to bring an alpha particle from infinity to a point near the nucleus just outside the range of the nuclear force's influence. An alpha particle {{can be thought of as}} being inside a potential barrier whose walls are 25 MeV. However, decay alpha particles only have kinetic energies of 4 MeV to about 9 MeV, far less than the energy needed to escape.|$|E
50|$|The {{nuclear force}} holding an atomic nucleus {{together}} is very strong, in general {{much stronger than}} the repulsive electromagnetic forces between the protons. However, the nuclear force is also short range, dropping quickly in strength beyond about 1 femtometre, while the electromagnetic force has unlimited range. The strength of the attractive nuclear force keeping a nucleus together is thus proportional {{to the number of}} nucleons, but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so large that the strong nuclear force holding it together can just barely counterbalance the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between the protons it contains. Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by reducing size.|$|E

50|$|Protons and {{neutrons}} behave almost identically {{under the}} influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of isospin, in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle, is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces. Because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances, the binding energy of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms. Nuclear reactions (such as nuclear fission) therefore have an energy density that is more than ten million times that of chemical reactions. Because of the mass-energy equivalence, nuclear binding energies add or subtract from the mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide (e.g., uranium-235) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic potential energy.|$|E
50|$|To {{create this}} effect, {{a stream of}} {{negative}} muons, most often created by decaying pions, is sent to a block that may {{be made up of}} all three hydrogen isotopes (protium, deuterium, and/or tritium), where the block is usually frozen, and the block may be at temperatures of about 3 kelvin (−270 degrees Celsius) or so. The muon may bump the electron from one of the hydrogen isotopes. The muon, 207 times more massive than the electron, effectively shields and reduces the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> between two nuclei and draws them much closer into a covalent bond than an electron can. Because the nuclei are so close, the strong nuclear force is able to kick in and bind both nuclei together. They fuse, release the catalytic muon (most of the time), and part of the original mass of both nuclei is released as energetic particles, as with any other type of nuclear fusion. The release of the catalytic muon is critical to continue the reactions. The majority of the muons continue to bond with other hydrogen isotopes and continue fusing nuclei together. However, not all of the muons are recycled: some bond with other debris emitted following the fusion of the nuclei (such as alpha particles and helions), removing the muons from the catalytic process. This gradually chokes off the reactions, as there are fewer and fewer muons with which the nuclei may bond. The number of reactions achieved in the lab can be as high as 150 d-t fusions per muon (average).|$|E

Considering the practical application of switch technology {{in the field of}} SFCL, a high-speed switch based on <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> mechanism (ERM) has received lots of attention from research scholars (Lim et al. 2010, 2014; He and Wang 2014).

According to theory analysis and parameter design, the electromagnetic switch’s response time can be less than 0.5  ms, and it can meet the requirements of the SFCL for high-speed control. Furthermore, based on the performance simulations of the SFCL equipped with this high-speed switch, the SFCL is able to quickly and availably suppress the fault current contributed by the DG units in the micro-grid system, and meanwhile improve the voltage sag and reduce the frequency fluctuations. As a result, the suggested SFCL’s service practicability can be well confirmed.|$|E

As complement to existing simulation methods, we present a fully analytic space charge model valid for transverse Gaussian beams and which includes non-linear space charge forces and cross-plane coupling. We verify the validity of the model by running test simulations in a few accelerator lattice examples. Finally, we briefly explore the possibilities for future simulations regarding new insights in beam dynamics and show initial results of the development of a beam envelope (core) in a test ring, as well as the dynamics of passive spectator particles which observe the non-linear electric field generated by a beam core...|$|E

In this paper, the high-speed switch is based on <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>repulsion</b> mechanism, and its conceptual design is carried out to promote {{the application of the}} modified SFCL. Regarding that the switch which is consisting of a mobile copper disc, two fixed opening and closing coils, the computational method for the electromagnetic force is discussed, and also the dynamic mathematical model including circuit equation, magnetic field equation as well as mechanical motion equation is theoretically deduced. According to the mathematical modeling and calculation of characteristic parameters, a feasible design scheme is presented, and the high-speed switch’s response time can be less than 0.5  ms. For that the modified SFCL is equipped with this high-speed switch, the SFCL’s application in a 10  kV micro-grid system with multiple renewable energy sources are assessed in the MATLAB software.

In this process, the functions of voltage powering solenoids used to control the position of the linear electromagnetic motor are evaluated. This procedure assumes minimizing two conflicted criteria: the time of movement of the motor and the energy input. In this case the device works in the open-loop system without a feedback loop. The results of the application of the conventional PID controller are also presented, which allows precision positioning up to 1 µm.
