5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E

Prescription, on the other hand, is concerned with acquiring a right that did not previously exist.|$|E
25|$|The Parable of the Prodigal Son {{is also a}} {{recurring}} theme {{in the works of}} Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted the parable in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the conventional reading. His version of the parable was not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family; the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son can love God more, even if this love is not returned.|$|E

25|$|There is {{an entirely}} <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{accomplish}} the same timing measurement, not by comparing {{the timing of the}} pulse envelopes, but timing the phase of the signals. This is actually quite easy to do in electronics, and can be displayed directly using a simple mechanical pointer. The trick to such a system is to ensure the master and slave stations are phase-coherent, which was an expensive and complex proposition during World War II. But by isolating the expensive portions of the system at the few broadcast stations, the Decca Navigation System using this technique went active in 1944, offering accuracy similar to Gee but using low-cost mechanical displays which were also much easier to use.|$|E
25|$|Bengali and Odia {{style is}} worn without any pleats. Traditionally the Bengali style is worn without pleats where the saree is wrapped around in an {{anti-clockwise}} direction {{around the waist}} and then a second time from the other direction. The loose end is a lot longer and that goes around the body over the left shoulder. There is enough cloth left to cover the head as well. The modern style of wearing a saree originates from the Tagore family. Jnanadanandini Devi, the wife of Rabindranath Tagore's elder brother Satyendranath {{came up with a}} <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> wear the saree after her stay in Bombay. This required a chemise or jacket (old name for blouse) and petticoat to be worn under the saree and made it possible for women {{to come out of the}} secluded women's quarters in this attire.|$|E
25|$|During the 1940s, {{the term}} descarga was {{commonly}} used in the music scenes of Cuba to refer to performances of jazz-influenced boleros in an improvised manner. This {{was part of the}} so-called filin (feeling) movement spearheaded by artists such as José Antonio Méndez, César Portillo de la Luz, and Luis Yánez. This style was inherited by musicians such as Bebo Valdés and Frank Emilio Flynn who explored the combination of jazz and Cuban forms into the 1950s. In particular, Bebo's 1952 session with producer Norman Granz in Havana, credited to Andre's All Stars, is often cited as a milestone in the development of Cuban jazz, and by extension, descarga. At this time, however, the term descarga began to be used in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> describe jam sessions based on the son montuno and other Afro-Cuban rhythms. The incipient mambo and Afro-Cuban jazz scene found in New York during the 1940s was also a catalyst of the development of descargas, with artists such as Machito, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Tito Puente performing extended jams with Afro-Cuban motifs.|$|E

25|$|A <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} the aggregation problem {{does not involve}} the Classical pricing equations. Think about {{a decrease in the}} r, the return on capital (corresponding to a rise in w, the wage rate, given that initial levels of capital and technology stay constant). This causes a change in the distribution of income, the nature of the various capital goods demanded, and thus a change in their prices. This causes a change in the value of K (as discussed above). So, again, the rate of return on K (i.e., r) is not independent of the measure of K, as assumed in the neoclassical model of growth and distribution. Causation goes both ways, from K to r and from r to K. This problem is sometimes seen as analogous to the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results (e.g., by Mas-Colell 1989) in general equilibrium theory, which shows that representative agent models cannot be theoretically justified, except under restrictive conditions (see Kirman, 1992 for an explanation of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results as an aggregation problem). Note that this says that it's not simply K that is subject to aggregation problems: so is L.|$|E

500|$|Alongside {{eventual}} castmates Lo Bosworth, Kristin Cavallari, and Stephen Colletti, Conrad {{was educated}} at Laguna Beach High School. In 2004, they starred in , an MTV reality television series which documented their lives during high school.

Upon their arrival, actress Helen Pearson, who plays mother Frankie Dean, assessed that they were [...] "really supportive of each other", and [...] "quite solid, like an old-fashioned family unit", despite their lack of finances which required them to undertake [...] "various scams to keep body and soul together." [...] As time went on, the Deans were affected by affairs and parental separation, more typical of the soap's other families.|$|E

500|$|In {{contemplating the}} role of {{democratic}} schools in addressing race-based inequities, Astra Taylor saw the Albany Free School [...] "as a microcosm of an American society that had failed to come into existence". She thought that the school sounded [...] "like unschooling, but in a group setting", where children are free to cross age lines, learn from older idealists, and manage their own affairs. Children are trusted to [...] "learn responsibility, problem solving, and self-governance in the process". Taylor added that the practical needs of tending the chicken coop and vegetables turned [...] "necessity into virtue" [...] as lack of money became [...] "self-reliance and simple living". She compared the school's work to Rebecca Solnit's prefigurative politics: one small group models a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> pursue a principle, such that the group can live by its ideals while affecting a change they seek.|$|E

Hsu and the translators had the same problem with this as Fuse had when balancing the prosecutor and convict aspects of the character, but eventually leaned more towards the prosecutor side, and made him speak Victorian English. They felt that this made more sense than portraying him as a cursing delinquent due to his high intelligence, and his Victorian-era clothes, due to their different cultural connotations in the West compared to Japan.|$|E

500|$|Maxwell, as a character, [...] "controls the action". He is the protagonist, and traps {{the viewer}} into the {{coach in the}} opening seconds of the episode by closing the curtains.

His profession and supply of medication bring to mind [...] "upper-class gentleman serial killers" [...] or [...] "cut-glass accented British actors brought in to play cold killers in Hollywood cinema".

500|$|Hunger {{and desperation}} {{eventually}} forced Sitting Bull, and 186 {{of his family}} and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, [...] "I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." [...] To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, [...] "to surrender my rifle" [...] in this context meant [...] "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back to you, for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> help us overcome the white man." [...] In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.|$|E
