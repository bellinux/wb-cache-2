Well--it is very astonishing, appalling--all but incredible, if we had not the facts to prove it. But of the facts there can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt.</b> There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the climate of this northern hemisphere has changed enormously more than once. [...] There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the distribution of land and water, the shape and size of its continents and seas, have changed again and again. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that, for instance, long before the age of ice, the whole North of Europe was much warmer than it is now.|$|R

5|$|Today, Beebe's 1915 {{description}} of his hypothetical four-winged bird ancestor is regarded as prescient, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Microraptor looks startlingly similar to the almost-century old Tetrapteryx illustrations.

Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, and intervention by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.|$|E

There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> however, that the lesser clergy of Rome was represented in the election. The electoral decree of Anacletus II bears the subscriptions of some of them, including Subdeacon Gregorio, primicerius scholae cantorum, who was appointed Cardinal-Deacon of S.

5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that {{the healing power of}} goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm II {{was born}} to Kenneth II of Scotland. He was {{grandson}} of Malcolm I of Scotland. In 997, the killer of Constantine is credited as being Kenneth, son of Malcolm. Since there is no known and relevant Kenneth alive at that time (King Kenneth having died in 995), it is considered an error for either Kenneth III, who succeeded Constantine, or, possibly, Malcolm himself, the son of Kenneth II. Whether Malcolm killed Constantine or not, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that in 1005 he killed Constantine's successor Kenneth III in battle at Monzievaird in Strathearn.|$|E

5|$|Many {{writers have}} {{attempted}} to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes that claims that he originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research, and {{the origins of the}} observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a single person, and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and that media coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.|$|E
5|$|Quintus of Smyrna, in {{a passage}} whose {{atmosphere}} Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani {{are the two}} important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy's fall. In this case, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the Posthomerica Troilus's armour {{is one of the}} funerary gifts after Achilles' own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus's youth: he is beardless, virgin of a bride, childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba's children. Yet he was lured by Fate to war when he knew no fear and was struck down by Achilles' spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no seed is killed by the gardener.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was published}} in Mantua in 1607 {{to coincide with the}} premiere and incorporated Striggio's ambiguous ending. However, Monteverdi's score published in Venice in 1609 by Ricciardo Amadino shows an entirely different resolution, with Orpheus transported to the heavens through the intervention of Apollo. According to Ringer, Striggio's original ending was almost certainly used at the opera's premiere, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Monteverdi believed the revised ending was aesthetically correct. The musicologist Nino Pirrotta argues that the Apollo ending was part of the original plan for the work, but was not staged at the premiere because the small room which hosted the event could not contain the theatrical machinery that this ending required. The Bacchantes scene was a substitution; Monteverdi's intentions were restored when this constraint was removed.|$|E

5|$|While the {{persecution}} under Constantius was relatively light, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> about {{the force of}} {{the persecution}} in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E
5|$|Wulfstan {{must have}} early on {{garnered}} the favour of powerful men, particularly Æthelred king of England, for we find him personally drafting all royal law codes promulgated under Æthelred's reign from 1005 to 1016. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Wulfstan had {{a penchant for}} law; his knowledge of previous Anglo-Saxon law (both royal and ecclesiastical), as well as ninth-century Carolingian law, was considerable. This surely made him a suitable choice for the king's legal draftsman. But it is also likely that Wulfstan's position as archbishop of York, an important centre in the then politically sensitive northern regions of the English kingdom, made him not only a very influential man in the North, but also a powerful ally for the king and his family in the South. It is indicative of Wulfstan's continuing political importance and savvy that he also acted as legal draftsman for, and perhaps advisor to, the Danish king Cnut, who took England's West Saxon throne in 1016.|$|E

5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E
5|$|John Meares, who {{had also}} served under Cook, sailed to the North West Coast in 1786. He spent the winter in Prince William Sound, his ship trapped by ice and his men dying of scurvy. He was rescued by the timely arrival of Dixon and Portlock. Meares {{organized}} a second expedition of two ships, the Felice Adventurero and Iphigenia Nubiana. Meares was captain of the Felice and William Douglas was captain of the Iphigenia. Meares decided not to license his ships with the EIC, instead trying to conceal the illegal activity by using the flag of Portugal. They arrived at Nootka Sound in May 1788. Meares later claimed that Chief Maquinna sold him some land and on it Meares had a building erected. These claims later became a point of dispute during the Nootka Crisis. Spain, which sought control of Nootka Sound, rejected both claims; the true facts of the matter have never been fully established. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> however, that Meares had the sloop North West America built in Nootka Sound, the first nonindigenous vessel built in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
