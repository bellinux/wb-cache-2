40|$|Soil {{salinisation}} and waterlogging {{are significant}} {{problems in the}} Irrigation Areas and Districts of southern New South Wales. Various actions can be taken at either a regional or farm level to alleviate these problems. District surface <b>drainage,</b> <b>sub-surface</b> drainage, pumping from deep aquifers and changes to water pricing policies are regional options, while possible on-farm options include laser controlled landforming, pumping groundwater from shallow aquifers, recycling drainage water, changes to crops and rotations and the adoption of improved irrigation systems. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse the agricultural benefits of a surface drainage scheme proposed for an Irrigation District in the Murrumbidgee Valley. The objective of the analysis was to determine overa 30 year period the change in present value of district net farm income anributable to the surface drainage scheme. The study differed from other economic assessments of the losses due to salinity and waterlogging in that it accounted for farmers' adjustment processes. A regional linear programming model was developed which determined the optimal mix of agricultural activities in any year, subject to the level of soil salinity and waterlogging.

40|$|Abstract: Validated biophysical {{simulation}} models {{can be applied}} to undertake an a priori assessment of environmental outcomes by taking into account the interaction of various human activities, biological and physical processes. These include land management and practice, water balance, erosion, nutrients, carbon and vegetation dynamics. Model output can {{be an integral part of}} an evidence-based approach to the procurement of environmental outcomes. Biophysical models typically operate on discrete computation cells of a catchment in the order of 20 - 50 metres and on daily time steps. They can be used to evaluate the production and environmental aspects of farming systems and catchments. These models also provide estimates of deep <b>drainage,</b> <b>sub-surface</b> lateral flows and surface runoff. Water partitioning is important as vertically dominated recharge and horizontally dominated flow produce very different environment outcomes. However, the effect of these flows on nutrient, contaminants and sediment transport can only be assessed if the output from one computational cell forms the input to the neighbouring computational cells of the farm/catchment. There are many single-flow and multiple-flow algorithms reported in the literature to determine surface water flow directions. These include the Deterministic 8 (D 8), multiple flow direction, two-directional edge-centred routing, two directional block-centred and D ∞ flow path algorithms. The D 8 single-flo...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{two approaches}} for managing deep drainage losses under border-check irrigation on a dairy {{farm in the}} Shepparton Irrigation Region. The first approach reduces deep drainage to the groundwater system by converting to an efficient sprinkler irrigation system. The second approach involves installing a <b>sub-surface</b> <b>drainage</b> system to extract excess deep drainage (under border-check irrigation), thus preventing net recharge to the groundwater system. The costs of implementing both approaches are developed and compared over a fifteen-year period. Analysis of areas where groundwater pumping is feasible was conducted using a GIS framework. The most favourable approach for managing deep drainage {{is related to the}} characteristics of the underlying aquifer system. Where groundwater pumping and farm reuse are possible (high yielding low salinity aquifers), pumping excess groundwater to recycle deep drainage losses is less expensive than converting the border-check system to an efficient sprinkler irrigation system. This finding applies to half of the border-check irrigated pastures in the Shepparton Irrigation Region. <b>Sub-surface</b> <b>drainage</b> has considerably higher infrastructure costs in areas with less permeable aquifers.

50|$|Before the {{construction}} of the High Dam, groundwater levels in the Nile Valley fluctuated 8-9 m per year with the water level of the Nile. During summer when evaporation was highest, the groundwater level was too deep to allow salts dissolved in the water to be pulled to the surface through capillary action. With the disappearance of the annual flood and heavy year-round irrigation, groundwater levels remained high with little fluctuation leading to waterlogging. Soil salinity also increased because the distance between the surface and the groundwater table was small enough (1-2 m depending on soil conditions and temperature) to allow water to be pulled up by evaporation so that the relatively small concentrations of salt in the groundwater accumulated on the soil surface over the years. Since most of the farmland did not have proper subsurface drainage to lower the groundwater table, salinization gradually affected crop yields. <b>Drainage</b> through <b>sub-surface</b> drains and <b>drainage</b> channels is essential to prevent a deterioration of crop yields from soil salinization and waterlogging.

40|$|This study {{documented}} hydrologic changes, specifically wetland losses, in Seven Mile Creek Watershed. Historical aerial photos {{along with}} a Geographic Information System (GIS) {{were used to assess}} these changes as it relates to water resources management. The 95. 3 km 2 (36. 8 mi. 2) study area is a small, agricultural watershed located in south-central Minnesota. More than 130 aerial photographs from seven different periods dating back to 1938 were scanned and rectified for use in a GIS. Wetland areas converted to cropland were then interpreted and digitized. In addition, other land use changes, such as surface and <b>sub-surface</b> <b>drainage</b> modifications and cropping system shifts, were mapped and documented. Results from the study indicate significant hydrologic changes have occurred in the watershed. Analysis of pre-settlement maps and survey notes indicate that about 50 % of the watershed was once covered by wetlands. Of those wetlands, it is estimated that 88 % of the natural wetlands have been converted to cropland. About 47 % of those losses occurred from early settlement (late 1800 ’s) to 1938. From 1938 to 1985, an additional 41 % of the wetlands were drained and converted to cropland. This translates to an average annual net wetland loss of 40 hectares (100 ac.) per year. During this same period (1938 - 1985), 40 km (25 mi.) of drainage ditches were constructed, more than 966 km (600 mi.) of public and private <b>sub-surface</b> <b>drainage</b> systems were installed, and it is estimated that total corn and soybean acreage increased from 30 % to 96 % within the watershed. The most rapid percent change, a 50 % wetland decrease, occurred between 1955 and 1961. The construction of two county drainage ditch systems in 1955 accounts for this change. After 1985 the wetland loss trend has decreased. Wetland increases are a direct result of conservation programs combined with grants from private and state water resource protection programs...|$|R

40|$|The Water Framework Directive aims {{to achieve}} at least “good status” of all surface and {{groundwater}} bodies by 2015. In 2009 programmes of measures {{to achieve this}} status must be implemented. In 2012 water quality response to these measures will be examined at river basin catchment level. The adoption of the Water Framework Directive from the 1 st January 2007 restricts the amount of nutrients which {{can be applied to}} agricultural land. A nutrient discharge to a waterbody has a negative impact on the environment and may lead to eutrophication. A broad strategy exists at European level to minimise nutrient loss to a waterbody. This strategy examines the source/pressure, pathway and receptor approach for nutrient transport. Such nutrient management strategies try to minimise nutrient loss while maintaining productivity. Nitrogen usage is now associated with environmental degradation even at lower levels than the maximum allowable concentration (11. 3 mg NO 3 -N L- 1). A further strategy proposes that nutrient management and increased utilisation of nutrients alone will fail to recognise nutrient loss even at high levels of efficiency. This strategy attempts to use remediation (Nitrate) and control technologies (Phosphorous) to intercept nutrients before discharge. Another function would be to further reduce concentrations presently at allowable levels. This introduces an interceptor phase into the nutrient transfer model. Groundwater characterisation leads {{to a better understanding of}} the nutrient source and pathway to a groundwater or surface water receptor. The interactions between surface runoff, <b>sub-surface</b> <b>drainage</b> (man made) and groundwater are important when dealing with the source pathway receptor concept. Interactions between shallow groundwater and surface water should also be considered. The deeper groundwater body and surface water interactions should also be characterised. A monitoring network incorporating surface, subsurface and groundwater elements was created on the Teagasc Environmental Research Centre, Wexford. A <b>sub-surface</b> <b>drainage</b> system was characterised and water quality monitored. Some breaches of the maximum admissible levels (MAC) of nitrate in groundwater were found in two separate locations (Dairy and Beef farms).

Finally, sensitivity analyses were made to study the effects of varying drain depth, spacing and amount of irrigation water applied on root zone salinity and depth to water table. Here, the model predicted that closer than the present spacing or further deepening of the drains from the present depth of 1 m to 1. 4 m will not have any better influence on the reduction of the root zone salinity than in the present situation. These simulations also suggested that by applying 80 % of the present amount of irrigation water, the root zone salinity can be brought down to 5 and 4 dS/m by second and fourth years, respectively and this will in turn reduce the problem of water logging and salinity to some extent...|$|R
40|$|A multi-scale {{approach}} for restoration site selection is presented {{and applied to}} an upland catchment, the River Ure, North Yorkshire. Traditional survey methods, advances in remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and risk-based fine sediment modelling using the SCIMAP module are combined to gather data at the catchment-scale through to the in-stream habitat-scale. The data gathered have been assessed against spatially distributed brown trout fry populations using Pearson’s correlation and multiple stepwise regressions. Fine sediment was shown {{to have a positive}} correlation with fry populations when upland drainage channels (grips) were added to the SCIMAP model. This suggests risk from peatland drainage is realised further down the catchment where eroded sediments are deposited. Farm-scale SCIMAP modelling was tested against farmers’ knowledge with variable results. It appears there is a cultural response to risk developed over generations. Management of meadows and pasture land through <b>sub-surface</b> <b>drainage</b> and stock rotation resulted in the risk being negated or re-routed across the holding. At other locations apparently low-risk zones become risky through less sensitive farming methods. This multi-scale approach reveals that the largest impacts on brown trout recruitment operate at the habitat-adjacent scale in tributaries with small upstream areas. The results show a hierarchy of impact, and risk-filters, arising from different intensity land management. This offers potential for targeted restoration site selection. In low-order streams it seems that restoration measures which exclude livestock, and provide bankside shading, can be effective. At such sites the catchment-scale shows a reduced signal on in-stream biota. Thus, brown trout stocks could be significantly enhanced by targeting restoration at riffle-habitat zones and adjacent land in order to disconnect the stream from farm-derived impacts and through adding structure to the stream channel...|$|R
