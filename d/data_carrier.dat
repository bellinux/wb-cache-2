25|$|The {{software}} distribution {{of a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a <b>data</b> <b>carrier</b> such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this <b>data</b> <b>carrier,</b> or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E

30|$|Decision {{feedback}} and smoothing information: using {{the maximum amount}} of <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> to derive the channel estimate results in the best performance. However, this also leads to a higher computational complexity overhead. A possible technique to reduce this computational complexity is to lower the amount of used <b>data</b> <b>carriers.</b> This results in a degradation of the accuracy of the channel estimation though. To achieve a significant decrease in computation complexity, the amount of <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> has to be lowered {{in such a way that}} the corresponding performance decrease is unacceptable. Therefore, it is chosen to use all <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> when estimating the channel based on decision {{feedback and}} smoothing information.|$|R

The concomitant data is coded into a preset {{total number of}} sub data sets according to a preset process. The concomitant data is stored {{in such a manner}} that the concomitant data is decoded using arbitrary amount of sub data sets, where the amount is lesser or equal to the preset minimum number of sub data sets. USE - Method for storing concomitant data of a loading unit for package. ADVANTAGE - The method enables storing of concomitant data in multiple <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> in a reliable and safety manner, so that the concomitant data of the loading unit can be reconstructed from the data contained in the remaining <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> of other packages during failure of one of the <b>data</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R
