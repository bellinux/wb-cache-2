5|$|After the Americans {{attacked}} the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October, the Japanese implemented their plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> these areas {{that required the}} transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces, {{with only a few}} aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion.|$|E
5|$|Bush also {{expressed}} U.S. support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft {{collided with a}} People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1668 when Angulo y Sandoval's predecessor, Juan de Urtarte, wrote a {{memorandum}} to the King of Spain {{stating that the}} San Antonio de la Eminencia castle was unfit for defense. Several years later (and without proper authorization), Angulo y Sandoval began construction of a fortress {{that would be more}} useful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the city than the two existing fortifications. The castle underwent several renovations to repair damage caused by severe earthquakes. A 1684 quake severely damaged the castle and another in 1929 left the structure in ruins. The castle was declared a cultural and municipal asset in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{internal}} hearing, the City of Chicago was simultaneously paying lawyers to defend Burge during an appeal by Wilson and a new civil case by Banks, while employing lawyers to prosecute him on departmental charges. The City of Chicago hired outside counsel to prosecute the detectives at {{the internal}} hearing. After having spent $750,000 to defend Burge in the Wilson case, the City of Chicago questioned whether to follow normal practices and pay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> its police officers.|$|E
5|$|Hindman set to {{work and}} issued a series of harsh {{military}} edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about {{the strength of the}} state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E
50|$|The Unattached Companies of Massachusetts Volunteer Militia were units <b>of</b> {{infantry}} raised <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{coast of}} Massachusetts during the American Civil War.

5|$|Lucius Aelius Sejanus {{had served}} the {{imperial}} family for {{almost twenty years}} when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD15. As Tiberius became more embittered with the position of Princeps, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed {{the ranks of the}} Praetorian Guard responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls into the city itself, giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops.|$|E
5|$|Military {{planners}} in Paris {{understood that}} the northern Rhine Valley, the south-western German territories, and Switzerland were strategically important <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the Republic. The Swiss passes commanded access to northern Italy; consequently, the army that held those passes could move troops to and from northern and southern theaters quickly. The river was a formidable barrier to what the French perceived as Austrian aggression, and the state that controlled its crossings controlled the river itself. Finally, control of the Upper Danube would allow France to move its troops from Italy to the North Sea, or any point in between, offering immense strategic value.|$|E

5|$|On 4 May 1684 an {{earthquake}} devastated the city, severely damaging the Santa María castle. A road linking the Santa María de la Cabeza and San Antonio de la Eminencia castles was mentioned by Agustín Crame in a 1777 proposal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the city. Crame opposed the idea, but stated {{that if a}} road were built {{it should be a}} gravel one. The Santa María de la Cabeza castle was partially destroyed in a powerful earthquake felt throughout the state in 1797.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E

On May 14, he was commissioned a major general in the regular army. At age 34, he outranked everyone in the Army except Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, the general-in-chief. McClellan's rapid promotion was partly due to his acquaintance with Salmon P. Chase, Treasury Secretary and former Ohio governor and senator.|$|E

5|$|The Army of the Republic of Vietnam {{responded to}} the appeal, putting on a show of {{solidarity}} behind Diệm to isolate dissident officers. Thirty high-ranking officers headed by General Lê Văn Tỵ declared their resolve to carry out all missions entrusted to the army <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> {{the constitution and the}} Republic. The declaration was a veneer which masked a developing plot to oust Diệm. Some of the signatories were to become personally involved in Diệm's overthrow and death in November. Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn, the presidential military advisor and the chief of the army who were to lead the coup, were overseas.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans {{was a clear}} sign to the {{cautious}} {{citizens of}} Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed, the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues. The fall of Bosnia, which followed soon in 1463, only hastened the works. As a result, the Republic invited the architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence to direct {{the improvement of the}} city's defenses. His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion of numerous buildings of key importance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Dubrovnik.|$|E
5|$|The {{innovations}} of Andriamasinavalona {{were numerous}} and enduring. He created two additional noble castes and defined their associated rights, responsibilities and restrictions, and {{was responsible for}} introducing {{the tradition of the}} red parasol as an indicator of royalty; he also decreed that all women had the right to choose their husbands. Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury items like silver piastres and porcelain dishes. The dikes around the Betsimitatatra rice fields of Antananarivo were expanded and raised to help ensure against famine.|$|E
