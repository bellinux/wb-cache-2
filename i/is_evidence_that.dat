5000|$|Despite the {{disappearance}} of Fingal from the historical record, there may <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> his descendants ruled in parts of Galloway. Specifically, in 1094, the Annals of Inisfallen records {{the death of a}} certain King of the Rhinns named [...] "Macc Congail". On one hand, this could <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Fingal's name <b>was</b> actually Congal. On the other hand, [...] "Macc Congail" [...] may simply represent the source's confusion between the names Fingal and Congal. In fact, the record of Echmarcach reigning as [...] "rex Innarenn" [...] could <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Echmarcach had formerly ruled this particular region. In any case, it is unknown if Macc Congail was independent from, or dependent upon, Gofraid Crobán's authority.|$|R

This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, Ficus, and Indigofera, which are typical of lowland rainforest.|$|E
