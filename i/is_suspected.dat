40|$|Fetal echocardiograms were {{performed}} in 21 pregnancies before midtrimester termination. All fetal heart specimens were collected and studied morphologically. Eighteen {{had been diagnosed}} as normal echocardiographically and this was confirmed anatomically. Deficiency of the atrial septum <b>was</b> <b>suspected</b> in one, and primum and secundum atrial septal defects were found anatomically.

50|$|Of the 693 total former detainees {{transferred}} out of Guantanamo, 30% <b>are</b> <b>suspected</b> or {{confirmed to}} have reengaged in terrorist activity.

50|$|Therefore, it is {{expected}} that 303.15 bbl are required to accomplish this task. If 3000 psi is achieved prior to this quantity being pumped, a blockage <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>suspected.</b> If after pumping 303 bbl, pressurisation is not achieved, a leak <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>suspected.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it <b>is</b> <b>suspected</b> that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis <b>is</b> <b>suspected</b> {{based on}} lesion {{circumstances}} and clinical evidence, most prominently a neurological examination, for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally {{in response to}} light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score.

50|$|Cotton {{began to}} {{implement}} the emerging medical theory of infection-based psychological disorders by pulling patients' teeth, as they <b>were</b> <b>suspected</b> of harboring infections. If this failed to cure a patient, he sought sources of infection in tonsils and sinuses and often a tonsillectomy was recommended as additional treatment. If a cure was not achieved after these procedures, other organs <b>were</b> <b>suspected</b> of harboring infection. Testicles, ovaries, gall bladders, stomachs, spleens, cervixes, and especially colons <b>were</b> <b>suspected</b> {{as the focus of}} infection and were removed surgically.|$|R

5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food.

5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility <b>is</b> <b>suspected</b> to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{can also}} be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure <b>is</b> <b>suspected</b> due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E

5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause <b>is</b> <b>suspected,</b> genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|Pack {{breeding}} {{early in}} its development {{led to a}} level of genetic variation, so the hereditary conditions of more popular breeds are not common in the AWS.

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that SCSFLS runs in {{families}} and it <b>is</b> <b>suspected</b> that genetic similarity in families includes weakness in the dura mater, which leads to SCSFLS.
