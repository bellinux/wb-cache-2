He was also a scholar of the classics and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E
5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if <b>he</b> <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E

He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Born in Toronto {{with the}} surname Nudelman, Newman {{was the son}} of a Russian-Jewish {{immigrant}} father who ran a shoe shop. After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of thirteen, he later enrolled in the Central Technical School, studying art and design subjects. He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters. However, he found it so difficult to earn enough money to make a living from this profession that instead, <b>he</b> <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> working in the film industry itself. In 1938, he travelled to Hollywood, where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on the strength of his graphic design work. However, he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a work permit. Returning to his native country, in 1941, he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada. He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB.|$|E
5|$|Following the Peace of Paris in 1783, Seymour took a {{house in}} London with his brother Lord George Seymour and John Willett Payne. The three men became notorious socialites, joining the Prince of Wales on many of his {{drinking}} exploits across London: Seymour remained close friends with Prince George {{for the rest of}} his life. Seymour, already known for his good looks, good manners, height and martial bearing, rapidly gained a reputation for dissolution. In 1785 however, Seymour married Lady Anne Horatia Waldegrave, daughter of Earl Waldegrave and Maria Walpole (later Duchess of Gloucester) at the insistence of his family in a successful attempt to curtail his social activities. It was at this time that Seymour made his first foray into politics, becoming MP for Newport on the Isle of Wight before relinquishing the post two years later. In 1788 he became MP for Tregony, but in 1790 <b>he</b> <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> become MP for Wendover. Seymour remained in this position until 1796 when he changed his seat to Portsmouth, in which he remained until his death. He did not serve as an active politician in any of these positions, preferring his navy career to his political one.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} Gatorade Duel, Murphy Reynolds gave the command for drivers {{to start their}} engines. During the pace laps, Casey Mears went {{to the back of}} the field because he changed his engine and Truex did the same because <b>he</b> <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> a backup car. At the start, Gordon and Bayne were the leaders. On the first lap, Bowyer became the leader after having {{assistance}} from Burton. On the following lap, Jamie McMurray moved into the third position, after drafting with Kyle Busch. On the third lap, the first caution was given because Mears' engine failed. At the lap six restart, Bowyer was the leader, ahead of Burton, Kyle Busch, and Biffle. Two laps later, Busch became the leader. On the 11th lap, Carl Edwards moved up to third, while McMurray moved up to second. Two laps later, Edwards became the leader.

5|$|Toivonen {{had strong}} ties to {{rallying}} at an early age. He was born in Jyväskylä, the city which has hosted the Rally Finland since 1951. His father, Pauli Toivonen, was a successful international rally driver who {{would go on to}} win the Monte Carlo, 1000 Lakes and Acropolis rallies and become the 1968 European Rally Champion.
