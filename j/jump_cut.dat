5|$|Although {{the series}} {{shared the same}} mockumentary style as The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to {{establish}} a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. For example, the documentary-style interviews with characters sometimes feature two separate angles on the same person, with footage of the two different angles intercut into a single scene for the final episode. This distinguishing technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 documentary by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched {{at the suggestion of}} actor Paul Schneider. The pilot episode also makes use of the <b>jump</b> <b>cut</b> technique more often than in The Office. In one example from the pilot episode, a scene repeatedly jumps cuts to several brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>jump</b> <b>cut</b> {{editing techniques}} of Anticipation won the commercial {{a degree of}} critical acclaim and several awards from within the advertising industry, including the 1995 Institute of Creative Advertising & Design craft award for editing {{as well as a}} Gold Medal for editing and a Golden Shark award at the Kinsale International Advertising Festival.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, British {{director}} Mehdi Norowzian {{submitted a}} show reel containing {{a number of}} short examples of his work to several prospective employers, including the Irish advertising agency Arks Ltd., {{in the hopes of}} being taken on to direct one or more of their commercials. Included on the reel was a short piece entitled Joy, which was shot using a static camera on a London rooftop and comprised a <b>jump</b> <b>cut</b> sequence of a man performing an extended dance of exuberation against a plain canvas background.|$|E
5000|$|Continuity editing uses a {{guideline}} called the [...] "30 degree rule" [...] to avoid <b>jump</b> <b>cuts.</b> The 30 degree rule advises that for consecutive shots to appear [...] "seamless," [...] the camera position must vary at least 30 degrees from its previous position. Some schools {{would call for}} a change in framing as well (e.g., from a medium shot to a close up). Generally, if the camera position changes less than 30 degrees, {{the difference between the two}} shots will not be substantial enough, and the viewer will experience the edit as a jump in the position of the subject that is jarring, and draws attention to itself. Although <b>jump</b> <b>cuts</b> can be created through the editing together of two shots filmed non-continuously (spatial <b>jump</b> <b>cuts),</b> they can also be created by removing a middle section of one continuously filmed shot (temporal <b>jump</b> <b>cuts).</b>|$|R

500|$|The figure {{remains in}} shadow, with an insert showing it with cloaked arms spread, {{as the camera}} moves further away and slowly circles to the right. [...] After a <b>jump</b> <b>cut,</b> the {{lighting}} around the figure improves, revealing that the figure is wearing an outfit that resembles a plague doctor costume, a long dark long-sleeved hooded cloak with its face masked by a long, downward-pointing dark leather beak and goggles. The figure holds up their right hand, palm facing outward at shoulder height, to reveal a blinking light {{in the center of}} the palm. Beeping noises appear on the soundtrack in coordination with the blinks.|$|E

500|$|The climactic {{murder of}} Madeline Ferguson in the episode {{features}} {{extensive use of}} <b>jump</b> <b>cuts</b> to portray Leland Palmer's spirit possession, switching rapidly between actors Ray Wise and Frank Silva.

500|$|According to Kamal, {{the film}} was {{inspired}} by David Lean's 1970 drama, Ryan's Daughter. Film scholar Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai noted that {{the film was}} marked by [...] "ambiguous and dark protagonists, new subjectivity, [...] avoidance of clichéd and cathartic closures". Kumuthan Maderya, writing for <b>Jump</b> <b>Cut,</b> described 16 Vayathinile as a [...] "neo-nativity" [...] film [...] a story set in rural Tamil Nadu, valorising the rustic and foregrounding the lives of villagers. Ashis Nandy, in his 1998 book The Secret Politics of Our Desires, noted that doctors in Tamil films like 16 Vayathinile are always viewed with [...] "a bit of suspicion" [...] and remain complete outsiders [...] "capable of seducing women and polluting the community".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote, [...] "This {{version of}} The Mummy has no pretenses to be {{anything}} other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think Raiders of the Lost Ark with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think Night of the Living Dead stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture (The Road to Hamunaptra?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof." [...] Publications like The Austin Chronicle and Dallas Observer {{came to the conclusion that}} despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion; talking about the special effects, the Observer lamented [...] "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy." [...] Other publications such as <b>Jump</b> <b>Cut</b> felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to The Mummy; [...] "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the <b>Jump</b> <b>Cut,</b> [...] "is standard-issue I.L.". Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic. USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was [...] "not free of stereotypes", a sentiment with which the BFI concurred. [...] "If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene. Fraser, equally quick with weapon, fist or quip, may save the day, but even he can't save the picture", USA Today wrote.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Oli Marlow {{reviewed}} the soundtrack in 2013, {{calling it a}} unique fusion of religious, folk, and classical music, with influences from around the world. He also commented on the sound design of the film, calling it psychedelic, and saying that there was [...] "a lot of incredible incidental music" [...] in the film that {{was not included in}} the soundtrack releases. In a 1999 paper submitted to London's Symposium on Sound in Cinema, film critic Shoma A. Chatterji said, [...] "Sholay offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes. Sholay is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to <b>jump</b> <b>cut</b> to a different scene and time, without breaking the continuity of the narrative, yet, intensifying the drama." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jump</b> <b>cuts</b> {{are also}} {{distinguishable}} from an impossible match on action (a.k.a. impossible continuous action), {{where the action}} of the subject seems continuous and fluid but the background suddenly changes in an impossible way. Several of the <b>cuts,</b> sometimes mislabeled <b>jump</b> <b>cuts,</b> in the [...] "Patricia in the car" [...] sequence from Godard's Breathless are actually examples of impossible match on action. Other infamous examples include Resnais' Last Year in Marienbad, and the [...] "air mattress to Mrs. Robinson" [...] cut in The Graduate.|$|R

500|$|During this period, it {{was common}} for dancers to carry tap shoes with them and, when they {{encountered}} another dancer on the street, throw down their shoes by way of challenge. The culture of street dancing in the 1920s {{has been compared to}} the rise of break dancing six decades later. As the journal <b>Jump</b> <b>Cut</b> described it, [...] "'challenge dancing,' in which each performer tries to outdo the other, is part of tap dancing's heritage, something like the jazz solos in which musicians try to outshine one another." [...] Sims later described how the atmosphere of these dance challenges was at least as much collegial as combative, and how dancers learned from one another in what became essentially [...] "open air dance schools". Despite performing at various vaudeville venues, Sims found neither fame nor success as a dancer in Los Angeles. In 1947, he tagged along on one of his professional-boxer friend Archie Moore's cross-country drives, and settled in New York City.|$|E

Early in the season, editor Dean Holland developed a technique that would be used throughout the series. During a scene in [...] "The Reporter" [...] in which Leslie reacts to quotes read to her by the journalist, Poehler improvised a number of jokes, many of which were ultimately going to be cut from the episode. Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage intercutting several of the lines. The producers sought to lend authenticity to the fictional Pawnee setting by incorporating real-life Indiana elements. They contacted the Bloomington–based Upland Brewing Company and asked for empty beer bottles and labels to be used as background props.|$|E

Another distinction from The Office is that, while almost all footage from that show is filmed in a workplace setting, the documentary crew on Parks and Recreation regularly follows the characters into more intimate, non-work settings, such as on dates or at their homes. Parks and Recreation also makes frequent use of the <b>jump</b> <b>cut</b> technique.

2500|$|This {{technique}} of separating the 3D image {{has been called}} a new shot in filmmaking, although it is partially comparable to shots in the first 3D feature film The Power of Love. Calum Marsh of The Dissolve said that [...] "the vocabulary of the cinema has been enriched. There is a new tool available to filmmakers: a new technique, like the <b>jump</b> <b>cut</b> before it", and that in his previous films Godard has [...] "been searching for a way to unify ideas—to join disparate images to create a new one. This shot is the realization." [...] Erin Whitney of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The moment is so innovative and unusual that Godard and his cinematographer, Fabrice Aragno, didn't even have a name for it (Aragno has referred to the shot as [...] "separation," [...] {{for lack of a better}} term)." [...] David Ehrlich of The Dissolve has described the technique as a [...] "choose your own adventure" [...] shot and wrote that [...] "by rendering the disparate images separate but simultaneous, Godard has found a way for viewers to compare separate images at the moment they see them. Goodbye To Language effectively argues that every cut is porous, and that seeing is just looking, if it's distracted by memory." [...] Amy Taubin of Film Comment called the shot [...] "a mindboggling, eyeball-dislocating, narratively profound sequence" [...] and reported that after the shot concluded the audience erupted into applause at the film's premiere during the Cannes film festival. Jonathan Romney of Film Comment said that [...] "it's in-camera magic of a Méliès vintage: a piece of cheap trickery, but brilliantly and simply carried off, finding hitherto unsuspected delight in a simple 'improper' use of 3-D." ...|$|E
50|$|Vernacular use of {{the term}} <b>jump</b> <b>cut</b> can {{describe}} any abrupt or noticeable edit in a film. However, technically, many such over-broad usages are incorrect. In particular, a cut between two different subjects is not a true <b>jump</b> <b>cut,</b> no matter how jarring.|$|E

50|$|A {{large number}} of filter effects, shutter effects, and <b>jump</b> <b>cuts</b> are used to make long {{dialogue}} scenes (particularly between the two cop and between the two lovers) more visually interesting. The audio itself on both is done as a single long take.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his films}} of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa {{frequently}} employs the [...] "axial cut", in which the camera moves closer to, or further away from, the subject, not {{through the use of}} tracking shots or dissolves, but through a series of matched <b>jump</b> <b>cuts.</b> For example, in Sanshiro Sugata II, the hero takes leave of the woman he loves, but then, after walking away a short distance, turns and bows to her, and then, after walking further, turns and bows once more. This sequence of shots is illustrated on film scholar David Bordwell's blog. The three shots are not connected in the film by camera movements or dissolves, but by a series of two <b>jump</b> <b>cuts.</b> The effect is to stress the duration of Sanshiro's departure.|$|R
50|$|Fades and dissolves {{typically}} have a duration of 1 to 2 seconds (24-48 frames), though this may {{vary according to}} the preference of the director and editor.
