The effect of heat pretreatment on peeling and cutting under pressure at 250 "F were investigated. It was shown that heating for I min. gave the best result on peeling and cutting. The proximate analysis at different heating times yielded similar results. However, the percent amylose content to dry basis of Klue numwa and Klue hakmuk flours were 12. 06 and 10. 58, respectively. The physical properties of Klue numwa and Klue hakmuk flour were also studied. The swelling and gelatinization properties of Klue numwa flours was similar to rice starch while Klue hakmuk flour was alike that of <b>glutinous</b> rice <b>starch.</b> The mixture of Klue nLlmwa flour and rice starch were consequently made to prepare Khanom kluc, khanom toui and kaotoo (Thai desserts). Only Khanom klue - containing 25 Vo Kluc mumwa flour was acccpted by thc panelist. Moreover, addition of 25 o/o Klue hakmuk to <b>glutinous</b> rice <b>starch</b> to prcpare khanom neaw, khanom tuapap and khanom tomkoa (Thai desserts) were the maximum amount to be acceptccl.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the effects of drying {{temperature}} on the properties of deproteinized natural rubber latex (DNRL) /starch composite films. These composite films were prepared by simple mixing and then drying at different temperatures of 50, 60 and 70 o C. Various parameters such as types (potato, sago, bean, corn, tapioca, rice, and <b>glutinous</b> <b>starches),</b> amounts (5 - 20 part per hundred of rubber (phr)) and water-dispersed concentrations (5 - 50 %) of starch blended were evaluated. It was found that only some DNRL/starch composite formulations could be prepared as the completely homogeneous films. Drying temperature affected the degree of starch gelatinization that confirmed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) technique. The DNRL composite films of 20 phr of all 7 starch types could be formed at 50 and 60 o C, while those of 20 phr sago, bean, corn, and rice starch could be formed at 70 o C. Some of these films were difficult to be the completely dry films at 70 o C due to their more degree of gelatinization of starch on the surface films which inhibited the evaporation of water inside the films. However, only some DNRL/starch composites showed the homogeneous film under cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Their compatibilities were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and DSC. Their physical and mechanical properties were further evaluated by the universal testing machine...|$|R

40|$|From the digest of / 3 -limit dextrin (prepared from <b>glutinous</b> rice <b>starch)</b> with sac-charifying a-amylase of Bacillus subtilis [EC 3. 2. 1. 1] (BSA), two {{extensively}} branched dextrins {{consisting of}} nine (No. 6, 1 Fig. 1) and ten (No. 7, Fig. 1) glucose units were isolated by paper chromatography. Structural analysis using various enzymes revealed that No. 6 and No. 7 were both mixtures of four triply branched dextrins. They had structures which were built up with 63 -a-glucosylmaltotriose and/or 62 -a-glucosylmaltose as a linking unit. However, the branching configuration and the minimum a-l, 4 -glucosidic linkages existing between two branches followed {{one of the}} three structures shown below: 1) O—O, 2) O—O —O, and 3) O—O —O —. 2 In a previous paper (7) it was reported that all the doubly branched dextrins produced as a limit dextrin by saccharifying a-amylase [EC 3. 2. 1. 1] of Bacillus subtilis (BSA) (2 - 4) con-tained a 63 -a-glucosylmaltotriose moiety at the reducing end and an isomaltosyl moiety at the non-reducing end. The branched dextrins were thus regarded as condensation products of 63 -a-glucosylmaltotriose or of 62 -a-glucosylmaltose and the former dextrin. Kainuma and French (5) have suggested that a branching configura-tion similar to that of our doubly branched dextrins is present in starch. 1 A small quantity of branched decaose was con-tained and its structure was also determined. 2 O, glucose residue; |, a-l, 6 -glucosidic linkage; —, a-l, 4 -glucosidic linkage. The purpose of the present work was to isolate and investigate the structures of more extensively branched dextrins which are pro-duced by saccharifying a-amylase as a limit dextrin. In the present paper, implication of the results is also discussed to deduce some general rules for branching configuration of <b>glutinous</b> rice <b>starch</b> amylopectin...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} glucoamylases I and II were {{produced}} by Amylomyces sp. 4 - 2 isolated from Loogpang Kaomag used in Thailand. Both enzymes, completely purified from solid wheat bran {{culture of the}} strain, hydrolyzed gelatinized <b>glutinous</b> rice <b>starch</b> completely but hydrolyzed gelatinized potato starch {{only to the extent}} of 60 %. Glucoamylase I and glucoamylase II hydrolyzed glycogen completely and to the extent of only SO%, respectively. Both enzymes had the optimal activity on gelatinized potato starch between pH 3. 5 - 5. 0 at 55 ℃. Glucoamylase I (MW 68, 000) had the ability to digest and be adsorbed onto raw starch whereas glucoamylase II (MW 50, 000) lacked such activities. The optimal pH of glucoamylase I for raw starch digestion was between 3. 5 - 4. 5 and that for raw starch adsorption was 4. 0...|$|R
40|$|Glutinous {{rice flour}} (GRF) and <b>glutinous</b> rice <b>starch</b> (GRS) were {{modified}} by dry-heat treatment and their rheological, thermal properties and freeze-thaw stability were evaluated. Compared with the native GRF and GRS, the water-holding ability of modified GRF and GRS were enhanced. Both the onset and peak temperatures of the modified samples increased while the endothermic enthalpy change decreased significantly (p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, dry heating remarkably increased the apparent viscosities of both GRF and GRS. Importantly, compared with GRS samples, the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G") values of modified GRF increased more greatly and the tanδ values decreased more remarkably, {{indicating that the}} dry-heat treatment showed more impact on the GRF and a higher viscoelasticity compared with GRS. Our results suggest the dry-heat treatment of GRF is a more effective method than that of GRS, which omits the complex and tedious process for purifying GRS, and thereby has more practical applications in the food industry...|$|R

In the past, it was used for aesthetic propose on face and body with good odor. Nowadays, PR is not popular and going to be disappeared. Five natural materials, i. e. agar, rice flour, <b>glutinous</b> flour, corn <b>starch,</b> and tapioca starch were selected to use as binders. Binders were dissolved with boiled water into concentration 5 % and 10 % w/w except agar that was prepared 0. 5 % and 1 % w/w. PR with and without binder were formulated. Physical properties, i. e. weight, shape, color, and hardness were evaluated. PR with 10 % of corn starch solution had suitable hardness (14. 2 ± 0. 9 kg) and the best appearance.

40|$|An Anoxybacillus strain SK 3 - 4 was {{previously}} isolated from Perak Sungai Klah hot spring. The a-amylase gene fragment from Anoxybacillus sp. denoted as ASKA was cloned into pET- 22 b(+) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). However, the reactivity and productivity of this amylase is underexplored. The main {{objective of this}} project is to optimize the reducing sugars production using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The ASKA substrate specificity was determined using soluble starch and nine different commercial starches: corn, tapioca, wheat, potato, rice, sago, rye, green peas and <b>glutinous</b> rice <b>starch.</b> Sago starch {{was found to be}} the best substrate with highest reducing sugars production. Variable parameters such as reaction temperature, sago starch and ASKA concentration were screened using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach before they were optimized through two-level full factorial design and central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Statistical analysis showed that all the three parameters were significant factors in 23 full factorial design before further optimized the reducing sugars production with CCRD. The final optimized parameters using CCRD was capable to produce 7. 97 g/L reducing sugars with 2. 64 % (w/v) sago starch and 0. 375 unit ASKA under 66. 9 ºC reaction temperature. The hydrolysis products were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Maltose was the major hydrolysis product and no glucose production was detected. As a conclusion, applying experimental designs method was able to improve the efficiency of reducing sugars production for 87. 09 % compared with the reference reaction condition with maltose as the major end product...|$|R
