40|$|The bialaphos {{resistance}} gene, bar, {{was used}} as a selectable marker to isolate the bialaphos production genes (bap) from the Streptomyces viridochromogenes genome. The S. viridochromogenes bar gene was cloned on overlapping restriction fragments using pIJ 680 and pIJ 702 in the bialaphos-sensitive host, S. lividans. Although the restriction endonuclease cleavage map of these fragments was not similar to the bap cluster of S. hygroscopicus, the presence and location of bar and four other bap genes as well as a gene required for the transcriptional activation of the cluster (brpA) was demonstrated by <b>heterologous</b> <b>cloning</b> experiments using a series of previously characterized bialaphos-nonproducing S. hygroscopicus mutants. Since recombination-deficient mutants of streptomycetes have not been isolated, restored function provided by cloned homologous DNA results from both recombination (marker rescue) and complementation in trans. In contrast to our previously reported homologous cloning experiments where we were able to define the position of mutant alleles by recombination, in these <b>heterologous</b> <b>cloning</b> experiments we observed little if any recombination between plasmid-cloned genes and the chromosome. As a result, this approach allowed us to define the location and orientation of functional genes using a genetic complementation test. The organization of the clustered S. viridochromogenes bap genes was indistinguishable from the corresponding S. hygroscopicus mutant alleles. The fact that the S. viridochromogenes transcriptional regulatory gene, brpA, functioned in S. hygroscopicus implied that some transcriptional regulatory signals may also be interchangeable. In these two Streptomyces species, which have considerable nucleotide sequence divergence, the complex biochemical and genetic organization of the bialaphos biosynthetic pathway is conserved. ...|$|E

With the E. coli cloning vector pHSG 298, transformation frequencies of up to 2 × 107 transformants/μg DNA were achieved. This frequency is comparable to that obtained for CaCl 2 -mediated transformation of E. coli; thus, direct cloning of DNA into P. stutzeri is feasible.

The copy numbers of both wild-type pJTU 112 and three derivatives of it can be amplified at least sixfold by addition of streptomycin to the culture medium. The integrative system was developed by the use of a pBR 322 -derived Escherichia coli plasmid vector, pSET 152, mediated by the attP site of the Streptomyces phage ΦC 31.

40|$|Cosmid cloning and {{mutagenesis}} {{were used}} to identify genes involved {{in the production of}} phaseolotoxin, the chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, the causal agent of halo blight of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Eight stable clones were isolated from a genomic cosmid library by en masse mating to 10 ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) -induced Tox- mutants. In cross-matings, each suppressed all 10 mutants as well as an additional 70 EMS-induced Tox- mutants (and one UV-induced Tox- mutant). On the basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and hybridization studies, the clones were grouped into three classes. Clones in a particular class shared common fragments, whereas clones in different classes did not. Clones from class I (but not classes H and III) also suppressed TnS-induced Tox- mutants. Interposon mutagenesis and marker exchange of a representative clone from class III into the wild-type genome did not alter its Tox+ phenotype, indicating that this clone does not harbor structural or regulatory genes involved in phaseolotoxin production. We suggest that the genome of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola contains a "hot spot " in one of the functions involved in toxin production which is affected by EMS and UV and that <b>heterologous</b> <b>clones</b> are able to suppress the Tox- phenotype because their inserts encode products that are able to substitute for the product of the mutated gene.

Examination of four cointegrates indicated that pGK 12 and pSA 3 had inserted within two locations on pTR 2030. Resolution of the cointegrates generated vector derivatives containing a 0. 8 -kb insert of pTR 2030 DNA. Restriction analyses of several resolution plasmids indicated that the 0. 8 -kb element had inserted into various positions within pGK 12 and pSA 3 and in certain cases had inactivated the Cmr or Emr marker of pGK 12.

The number of different bacterial species and strains reported to produce Shiga toxin is now more than 500, since the first reported STEC infection outbreak in 1982. Clearly, Stx phages are spreading rapidly, but the underlying mechanism for this dissemination has not been explained. Here we show that an essential and highly conserved gene product, YaeT, which has an essential role in the insertion of proteins in the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane, is the surface molecule recognized by the majority (ca. 70 %) of Stx phages via conserved tail spike proteins associated with a short-tailed morphology. The yaeT gene was initially identified through complementation, and its role was confirmed in phage binding assays with and without anti-YaeT antiserum. <b>Heterologous</b> <b>cloning</b> of E. coli yaeT to enable Stx phage adsorption to Erwinia carotovora and the phage adsorption patterns of bacterial species possessing natural yaeT variants further supported this conclusion. The use of an essential and highly conserved protein by the majority of Stx phages is a strategy that has enabled and promoted the rapid spread of shigatoxigenic potential throughout multiple E. coli serogroups and related bacterial species.

The immunity was manifested as either: (a) complete protection, (b) reduced parasitemia, or (c) selection against parasites bearing the original VAT. The three idiotypes (Id) {{were found in}} variable levels in serum {{during the course of}} infection in control animals.

There is no vaccine against melioidosis {{and it can be}} fatal if not treated with a specific antibiotic regimen, which typically includes the third-generation cephalosporin, ceftazidime (CAZ). There have been several resistance mechanisms described for B. pseudomallei, of which the best described are amino acid changes that alter substrate specificity in the highly conserved class A β-lactamase, PenA. In the current study, we sequenced penA from isolates sequentially derived from two melioidosis patients with wild-type (1. 5 µg/mL) and, subsequently, resistant (16 or ≥ 256 µg/mL) CAZ phenotypes. We identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that directly increased CAZ hydrolysis. One SNP caused an amino acid substitution (C 69 Y) near the active site of PenA, whereas a second novel SNP was found within the penA promoter region. In both instances, the CAZ resistance phenotype corresponded directly with the SNP genotype. Interestingly, these SNPs appeared after infection and under selection from CAZ chemotherapy.

Notwithstanding lignin degradation by microbes represents a key-step in {{the completion of the}} carbon cycle in land ecosystems. The most well-known microorganisms involved in lignin degradation are fungi using oxidoreductases such as laccases, high redox peroxidases and peroxide forming enzymes. Bacterial lignin degradation is much less characterized and might allow the development of new cost-affordable bioprocesses for lignin depolymerisation, considering the relative easiness of bacterial enzyme production and engineering systems. This work focuses on in silico screening, cloning, expression and characterisation of bacterial lignin-degrading auxiliary enzymes, more specifically, H 2 O 2 forming enzymes such as aryl-alcohol oxidase, pyranose- 2 -oxidases, glyoxal oxidases or galactose oxidases with the intent to advance the scope of our understanding of lignin degradation in bacteria. Here we report the successful cloning of the first bacterial pyranose- 2 -oxidase and also the <b>heterologous</b> <b>cloning,</b> production and preliminary biochemical characterization of a bacterial galactose oxidase, both from Arthrobacter siccitolerans.

40|$|Studies of {{the immune}} {{responses}} of cattle to Theileria parva have provided evidence that immunity to the parasite can operate at two levels, namely the sporozoite and the schizont-infected lymphoblast. Antibodies that neutralize the infectivity of sporozoites have been detected in the serum of hyperimmunized cattle, and a recombinant sporozoite surface antigen {{has been shown to}} induce neutralizing antibodies and protection against experimental challenge. However, the immunity that develops following primary infection with T. parva is accompanied by only low levels of antibodies to sporozoites; there is overwhelming evidence that under these circumstances protection is mediated by T cell responses against infected lymphoblasts. Potent class IMHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are detected in animals recovering from infection and treatment or challenge infections. Two recent findings have provided direct evidence for the importance of these responses in immunity. First, the strain specificity of CTL in cattle immunized with one stock of the parasite was found to correlate with the subsequent susceptibility of individual animals to challenge with a <b>heterologous</b> <b>cloned</b> parasite population. Second, the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes highly enriched for CD 8 plus T cells, from immune to naive identical twin calves, was found to protect against experimental challenge. The CTL response in individual animals appears to be directed towards a limited number of antigenic epitopes.

40|$|AbstractMalaria parasites are {{frequently}} polymorphic at the antigenic targets of many candidate vaccines, presumably {{as a consequence}} of selection pressure from protective immune responses. Conventional wisdom is therefore that vaccines directed against a single variant could select for non-target variants, rendering the vaccine useless. Many people have argued that a solution is to develop vaccines containing the products of more than one variant of the target. However, we are unaware of any evidence that multi-allele vaccines better protect hosts against parasites or morbidity. Moreover, selection of antigen-variants is not the only evolution that could occur in response to vaccination. Increased virulence could also be favored if more aggressive strains are less well controlled by vaccine-induced immunity. Virulence and antigenic identity have been confounded in all studies so far, and so we do not know formally from any animal or human studies whether vaccine failure has been due to evasion of protective responses by variants at target epitopes, or whether vaccines are just less good at protecting against more aggressive strains. Using the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi and recombinant apical membrane antigen- 1 (AMA- 1), we tested whether a bi-allelic vaccine afforded greater protection from parasite infection and morbidity than did vaccination with the component alleles alone. We also tested the effect of mono- and bi-allelic vaccination on within-host selection of mixed P. chabaudi infections, and whether parasite virulence mediates pathogen titres in immunized hosts. We found that vaccination with the bi-allelic AMA- 1 formulation did not afford the host greater protection from parasite infection or morbidity than did mono-allelic AMA- 1 immunization. Mono-allelic immunization increased the frequency of <b>heterologous</b> <b>clones</b> in mixed clone infections. There was no evidence that any type of immunization regime favored virulence. A single AMA- 1 variant is a component of candidate malaria vaccines current in human trials; our results suggest that adding extra AMA- 1 alleles to these vaccines would not confer clinical benefits, but that that mono-allelic vaccines could alter AMA- 1 allele frequencies in natural populations...|$|R

Coexpression of β 4 GalNAcTB and GABPI generates the active enzyme that is localized together with GABPI in the Golgi.

40|$|In vivo {{excision}} and amplification {{of large}} segments of a genome offer an alternative to <b>heterologous</b> DNA <b>cloning.</b> By obtaining predetermined fragments of the chromosome directly from the original organism, the problems of clone stability and clone identification are alleviated. This approach involves the insertion of two recognition sequences for a site-specific recombinase into the genome at predetermined sites, 50 - 100 kb apart. The integration of these sequences, together with a conditional replication origin (ori), is targeted by homologous recombination. The strain carrying the insertions is stably maintained until, upon induction of specifically engineered genes, the host cell expresses the site-specific recombinase and an ori-specific replication protein. The recombinase then excises and circularizes the genomic segment flanked by the two insertions. This excised DNA, which contains ori, is amplified {{with the aid of}} the replication protein and can be isolated as a large plasmid.

30|$|Bacillus licheniformis CGMCC 2876, a Gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium, {{produces}} a flocculating agent that {{is widely used}} in industrial processes, including wastewater refinement, downstream treatments, and food-related and fermentation processes (Xiong et al. 2010; Zhuang et al. 2012). The bioflocculant from B. licheniformis CGMCC 2876 is an extracellular polymer mainly composed of polysaccharide (89 %, wt/wt). In the latter phase of polysaccharide fermentation, the flocculating activity decreases because of the degradation of this bioflocculant. At the same time, a gene encoding β-glucosidase (Bgl.bli 1) in a bioflocculant-producing clone was predicted {{to be involved in}} polysaccharide bioflocculant dissimilation (Yan et al. 2013). The present study describes the <b>cloning,</b> <b>heterologous</b> expression and biochemical characterization of this β-glucosidase. Moreover, the relation between β-glucosidase and polysaccharide bioflocculant was further explored. This report is the first of the hydrolysis of a polysaccharide bioflocculant by β-glucosidase.|$|R
40|$|Infective clones of the Nigerian isolate of cassava latent virus (CLV) {{have been}} obtained. The {{apparent}} molecular {{weight of the}} capsid protein of this isolate is slightly higher than that produced in plants infected with cloned DNAs of the Kenyan isolate of CLV. Pseudorecombinant experiments using <b>heterologous</b> combinations of <b>cloned</b> DNAs have confirmed that the physical properties of the capsid protein are encoded on DNA 1 and at least some determinants of symptom induction are also located on this DNA. Comparison between the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames encoding the two capsid proteins hows several nucleotide differences which affect he amino acid composition but which do not significantly alter the potential molecular weight of the product. In vitro translation of poly(A) ÷ RNAs shows that the differences in electrophoretic mobility are not {{due to differences in}} host-directed post-translational processing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Laccases are an {{interesting}} group of multi copper enzymes, which have received much attention of researchers in last decades due {{to their ability to}} oxidize both phenolic and non-phenolic lignin related compounds as well as highly recalcitrant environmental pollutants. This makes these biocatalysts very useful for their application in several biotechnological processes. Such applications include the detoxification of industrial effluents, mostly from the paper and pulp, textile and petrochemical industries, polymer synthesis, bioremediation of contaminated soils, wine and beverage stabilization. Laccases are also used as catalysts for the manufacture of anti-cancer drugs and even as ingredients in cosmetics. Recently, the utility of laccases has also been applied to nanobiotechnology. This paper reviews recent and important patents related to the properties, <b>heterologous</b> production, molecular <b>cloning,</b> and applications of laccases within different industrial fields as well as their potential extension to the nanobiotechnology area...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} new Streptomyces species named S. formicae that was {{isolated}} from the African fungus -growing plant-ant Tetraponera penzigi and show that it produces novel pentacyclic polyketides that are active against MRSA and VRE. The chemical scaffold of these compounds, which we have called the formicamycins, {{is similar to the}} fasamycins identified from the <b>heterologous</b> expression of <b>clones</b> isolated from environmental DNA, but has significant differences that allow the scaffold to be decorated with up to four halogen atoms. We report the structures and bioacti vities of 16 new molecules and show, using CRISPR/Cas 9 genome editing, that biosynthesis of these compounds is encoded by a single type 2 polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster in the S. formicae genome. Our work has identified the first antibiotic from the Tetraponera system and highlights the benefits of exploring unusual ecological niches for new actinomycete strains and novel natural products...|$|R
40|$|Many {{microbial}} pathogens recognise oligosaccharides {{displayed on}} the surface of host cells as receptors for toxins and adhesins. These ligand-receptor interactions are critical for disease pathogenesis, making them promising targets for novel anti-infectives. One strategy with particular utility against enteric infections involves expression of molecular mimics of host oligosaccharides {{on the surface of}} harmless bacteria capable of surviving in the gut. This can be achieved in Gram-negative bacteria by manipulating the outer core region of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through expression of <b>cloned</b> <b>heterologous</b> glycosyltransferases. The resultant chimeric LPS molecules are incorporated into the outer membrane by the normal assembly route and presented as a closely packed 2 -D array of receptor mimics. Several such “designer probiotics” have been constructed, and these bind bacterial toxins in the gut lumen with very high avidity, blocking their uptake by host cells and thereby preventing disease.

40|$|Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion {{channels}} {{serve as}} downstream targets of signalling pathways in vertebrate photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons. Whether CNG channels subserve similar functions in invertebrate photoreception and olfaction is unknown. We have cloned genomic DNA and cDNA encoding a cGMP-gated channel from Drosophila. The gene contains {{at least seven}} exons. <b>Heterologous</b> expression of <b>cloned</b> cDNA in both Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells gives rise to functional ion channels. The Drosophila CNG channel is approximately 50 -fold more sensitive to cGMP than to cAMP. The voltage dependence of blockage by divalent cations is different compared with the CNG channel of rod photoreceptors, and the Ca 2 + permeability is much larger. The channel mRNA is expressed in antennae and the visual system of Drosophila. It is proposed that CNG channels are involved in transduction cascades of both invertebrate photoreceptors and olfactory sensillae...|$|R
40|$|The white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium {{produces}} glucuronoyl esterase, {{a recently}} discovered carbohydrate esterase, during growth on sugar beet pulp. Two putative genes encoding this enzyme, ge 1 and ge 2, were isolated and <b>cloned.</b> <b>Heterologous</b> expression in Aspergillus vadensis, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Schizophyllum commune resulted in extracellular glucuronoyl esterase activity, demonstrating that these genes encode this enzymatic function. The {{amino acid sequence}} of GE 1 was used to identify homologous genes in the genomes of twenty-four fungi. Approximately half of the genomes, both from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, contained putative orthologues, but their presence could not be assigned to any of fungal class or subclass. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of identified and putative glucuronoyl esterases to other types of carbohydrate esterases (CE) confirmed that they form a separate family of CEs. These enzymes are interesting candidates for biotechnological applications such as the separation of lignin and hemicellulose...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} identification, <b>cloning,</b> <b>heterologous</b> {{expression}} and functional characterization {{of a novel}} antifungal peptide named lucimycin from the common green bottle fly Lucilia sericata. The lucimycin cDNA was isolated from a library of genes induced during the innate immune response in L. sericata larvae, which are used as therapeutic maggots. The peptide comprises 77 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 8. 2 kDa and a pI of 6. 6. It is predicted to contain a zinc-binding motif and to form a random coil, lacking beta-sheets or other secondary structures. Lucimycin was active against fungi from the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota, {{in addition to the}} oomycete Phytophtora parasitica, but it was inactive against bacteria. A mutant version of lucimycin, lacking the four C-terminal amino acid residues, displayed 40 -fold lower activity. The activity of lucimycin against a number of highly-destructive plant pathogens could be exploited to produce transgenic crops that are resistant against fungal diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEnvenoming {{with brown}} spiders (Loxosceles genus) is common {{throughout}} the world. Cutaneous symptoms following spider bite accidents include dermonecrosis, erythema, itching and pain. In some cases, accidents can cause hypersensibility or even allergic reactions. These responses could {{be associated with}} histaminergic events, such as an increase in vascular permeability and vasodilatation. A protein that {{may be related to}} the effects of spider venom was identified from a previously obtained cDNA library of the L. intermedia venom gland. The amino acid sequence of this protein is homologous to proteins from the TCTP (translationally-controlled tumor protein) family, which are extracellular histamine-releasing factors (HRF) that are associated with the allergic reactions to parasites. Herein, we described the <b>cloning,</b> <b>heterologous</b> expression, purification and functional characterization of a novel member of the TCTP family from the Loxosceles intermedia venom gland. This recombinant protein, named LiRecTCTP, causes edema, enhances vascular permeability and is likely related to the inflammatory activity of the venom. Moreover, LiRecTCTP presents an immunological relationship with mammalian TCTPs...|$|R
40|$|Major T-cell {{receptor}} {{beta chain}} variable region (TCRBV) repertoire perturbations are temporally {{associated with the}} down-regulation of viremia during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and with oligoclonal expansion and clonal exhaustion of HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). To determine whether initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) during primary infection influences the dynamics of T-cell-mediated immune responses, the TCRBV repertoire was analyzed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction in serial blood samples obtained from 11 untreated and 11 ART-treated patients. Repertoire variations were evaluated longitudinally. Stabilization of the TCRBV repertoire was more consistently observed in treated as compared with untreated patients. Furthermore, the extent and the rapidity of stabilization were significantly different in treated versus untreated patients. TCRBV repertoire stabilization was positively correlated with the slope of HIV viremia in the treated group, suggesting an association between repertoire stabilization and virologic response to treatment. To test whether stabilization was associated with variations in the clonal complexity of T-cell populations, T-cell receptor (TCR) heteroduplex mobility shift assays (HMAs) were performed on sequential samples from 4 HAART-treated subjects. Densitometric analysis of HMA profiles showed a {{reduction in the number of}} TCR clonotypes in most TCRBV families and a significant decrease in the total number of clonotypes following 7 months of HAART. Furthermore, a biphasic decline in HIV-specific but not <b>heterologous</b> CTL <b>clones</b> was observed. This indicates that ART leads to a global reduction of CD 8 (+) T-cell oligoclonality and significantly modulates the mobilization of HIV-specific CTL during primary infection.

40|$|A gene (pub @ {{encoding}} the aminase {{activity of}} p-aminobenzoate (PABA) synthase in Lactococcus luctis subsp. luctis was cloned in pIJ 41 and expressed in Streptomyces lividans strains defective in PABA biosynthesis. Expression {{of the gene}} {{was associated with a}} 1. 2 kb deletion between the uph promoter and the cloning site in pIJ 41. Subcloning in pBR 322 and expression in Escherichia coli AB 3295 of the cloned L. Zuctis DNA fragment localized thepabBcomplementing gene in a 1 - 9 kb segment. The nucleotide sequence of this segment contained a 1410 bp open reading frame encoding a 470 -amino-acid polypeptide of 50937 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed substantial similarity to those reported for PabB and TrpE from several organisms. Synonymous codon usage reflected the low G + C content in the genomic DNA of L. luctis subsp. luctis, and therefore differed markedly from the preferred usage in the S. Zividans host.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} number of annotated bacterial genomes provides a vast resource for genome mining. Several bacterial natural products with epoxide groups {{have been identified as}} pre-mRNA spliceosome inhibitors and antitumor compounds through genome mining. These epoxide-containing natural products feature a common biosynthetic characteristic that cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and its patterns such as epoxidases are employed in the tailoring reactions. The tailoring enzyme patterns are essential to both biological activities and structural diversity of natural products, and can be used for enzyme pattern-based genome mining. Recent development of direct <b>cloning,</b> <b>heterologous</b> expression, manipulation of the biosynthetic pathways and the CRISPR-CAS 9 system have provided molecular biology tools to turn on or pull out nascent biosynthetic gene clusters to generate a microbial natural product library. This review focuses on a library of epoxide-containing natural products and their associated CYPs, with the intention to provide strategies on diversifying the structures of CYP-catalyzed bioactive natural products. It is conceivable that a library of diversified bioactive natural products will be created by pattern-based genome mining, direct <b>cloning</b> and <b>heterologous</b> expression as well as the genomic manipulation...|$|R
