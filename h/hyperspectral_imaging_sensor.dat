Common ground-based methods such as vegetation mapping or quantitative sampling are time-consuming {{in the field and}} often spatially restricted, but provide highly dissolved data (on species level).

Recent developments in portable analytical instrumentation {{have made this}} more accessible to heritage institutions, but many commercial systems are not optimised for the specific requirements of manuscripts and works on paper. This paper describes the successful use of Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and hyperspectral imaging to identify and map watercolour pigments used by the eighteenth century botanical illustrator, Ferdinand Bauer, and demystify the unusual colour code system found in his sketches. The value, delicate nature and large size of these paintings necessitated the use of using in situ, non-contact methods of analysis. A portable, bespoke Raman spectrometer specifically designed for analysing pigments from works on paper was used together with a bespoke portable Fibre optic reflectance spectrometer, portable X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer and a <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor.</b> The results demonstrate that {{although there is a}} significant compromise between achieving good Raman spectroscopic results from artists’ pigments and using sufficiently low laser power densities so as not to cause damage to the pigments, good results could be obtained with this portable system, particularly when combined with XRF, fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) and hyperspectral imaging. Eight pigments were identified unequivocally from 125 watercolour paintings analysed, suggesting that Bauer used a more traditional and more limited palette than previously considered, and that his palette changed significantly in his later paintings. Similar pigments identified by the authors on colour chart that was discovered in 1999 in Madrid and attributed to Bauer, add weight to the attribution of this chart to Bauer. The data provides a much deeper insight into Bauer’s colour annotations, and how he was able to achieve such an impressive degree of colour fidelity in his work.|$|E

Many studies have explored this topic using remote sensing images that were obtained by satellite-borne and airborne sensors, which are known to be efficient for monitoring the mangrove ecosystem. With improvements in carrier platforms and sensor technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high-resolution hyperspectral images in both spectral and spatial domains have been used to monitor crops, forests, and other landscapes of interest. This study aims to classify mangrove species on Qi’ao Island using object-based image analysis techniques based on UAV hyperspectral images obtained from a commercial <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor</b> (UHD 185) onboard a UAV platform. First, the image objects were obtained by segmenting the UAV hyperspectral image and the UAV-derived digital surface model (DSM) data. Second, spectral features, textural features, and vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted from the UAV hyperspectral image, and the UAV-derived DSM data were used to extract height information. Third, the classification and regression tree (CART) method was used to selection bands, and the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) algorithm was employed for feature reduction. Finally, the objects were classified into different mangrove species and other land covers based on their spectral and spatial characteristic differences. The classification results showed that when considering the three features (spectral features, textural features, and hyperspectral VIs), the overall classification accuracies of the two classifiers used in this paper, i. e., k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM), were 76. 12 % (Kappa = 0. 73) and 82. 39 % (Kappa = 0. 801), respectively.

It is clear that SVM outperformed KNN for mangrove species classification. These results also suggest that height information is effective for discriminating mangrove species with similar spectral signatures, but different heights.

Proxy measures for depth were evaluated to estimate the true depth of F 1900 from such data. Suitable proxy measures were identified using data acquired by a high-resolution spectrometer (under artificial and natural illumination) and by a <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor</b> (under artificial illumination), with different amounts of simulated atmospheric noise. The best performing proxy measures were used to estimate depth from hyperspectral imagery acquired in the field under natural illumination. Proxy measures comprised a ratio of reflectance, continuum-removed depth at a single wavelength and continuum-removed depth integrated over several wavelengths. For high resolution spectra, a ratio of reflectance at 2017 nm and 1967 nm (Ratio 2017 / 1967) and the continuum-removed depth at 1967 nm (CRD 1967) were strongly correlated with depth R 2 = 0. 98 – 0. 99 and R 2 = 0. 95 – 0. 96, respectively. For hyperspectral imagery acquired in the laboratory, Ratio 2017 / 1967 and CRD 1967 were strongly correlated with depth across all levels of atmospheric noise (R 2 = 0. 94 – 0. 98 and 0. 94 – 0. 97, respectively). Proxy measures using integrated depth performed relatively poorly (R 2 = 0. 65 – 0. 86). In independent tests, depth of F 1900 was consistently overestimated by CRD 1967 but not by Ratio 2017 / 1967. Validation of field imagery was done by comparing depth predicted by the proxy measures with depth measured from laboratory imagery of collocated samples from the field. Ratio 2017 / 1967 derived from a polynomial fit to the data between 1961 and 2134 nm (RatioP 2017 / 1967) most closely approximated measured depth. Ratio 2017 / 1967, derived from the original data either under or overestimated depth. Measures of continuum-removed depth generated from the original data (CRD 1967) and from a polynomial fit to the original data (CRDP 1967) overestimated the depth of F 1900.

The term "atmospheric compensation" refers to the removal of unwanted atmospheric components of the measured radiance. For hyperspectral data analysis, the general objective for atmospheric compensation algorithms is to remove solar illumination and atmospheric effects (predominantly aerosol scattering and water vapor absorption) from the measured spectral data so that an accurate estimate of the surface reflectance can be obtained.

40|$|Due to {{its use of}} {{hundreds}} of contiguous spectral channels, a <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor</b> can now uncover many material substances which cannot be identified by prior knowledge or by visual inspection. Therefore, it is very challenging and difficult {{to determine how many}} spectral signal sources are present in a hyperspectral image. The research in this dissertation investigates this problem and is directed toward estimation of effective spectral dimensionality (ESD) of hyperspectral imagery, which can be considered as an extension of virtual dimensionality (VD) recently introduced by Chang and Du in hyperspectral imagery. In doing so, the orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) is first introduced to estimate VD, where the spectrally distinct signatures, called virtual endmembers (VE) can be obtained at the same time during the process. A similar concept to OSP is further explored for VD estimation where the maximum orthogonal complement algorithm (MOCA) is developed. It turns out that the MOCA is a variation of automatic target generation process (ATGP) implemented coupled with Neyman-Pearson detector along with super-Gaussian noise assumption. The high-order statistics is the further studied where the Harsany-Farrand-Chang (HFC) algorithm used to estimate the VD is extended to high-order statistics HFC algorithm where the probability distributions under the Neyman-Pearson test are obtained by MOCA. In order to demonstrate the utility of the ESD, endmember extraction is used as an application for experiments. In order to efficiently implement the N-FINDR several fast algorithms of N-FINDR are developed to reduce computational complexity. These include re-derivations of four sequential versions of N-FINDR and three different effective ways to calculate matrix determinants involved in simplex volume computation. Finally, to conclude this dissertation, an FPGA design of N-FINDR is investigated for potential hardware implementation. Since N-FINDR does not have prior knowledge of the number of endmembers, p required to generate, a direct FPGA implementation of the N-FINDR is unrealistic. In this case, the FPGA implementation for a sequential version of N-FINDR, Simplex Growing Algorithm (SGA) is investigated as an alternative to resolve this issue. It turns out that the FPGA of the SGA can be implemented {{in such a way that}} the value of the p can vary with different data sets, a task that cannot be accomplished by any FPGA design of N-FINDR...|$|E

Thus, managing mangrove forests is very challenging to the department and a precise geospatial database is urgently required. The objectives of this paper are to assess the capability of UPM-APSB’s AISA airborne <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor</b> for developing a geospatial database through an individual mangrove species mapping and to determine the wavelength regions that define the inherent spectral characteristics amongst mangrove species. A total of nine groups of mangrove species spectral separability were identified in Port Klang, Selangor namely Lumnitzera littorea, Rhizophora mucronata, R. stylosa, Sonneratia alba, Avicennia officials, R. apiculata, Bruguiera parviflora, B. gymnorhiza, B. cylindrical and S. caseolaris. The species were easily identified and separated in the NIR range (700 nm to 900 nm) with the following spectral values namely (a) 1, 750 - 6, 000 :B. cylindrical, (b) 2, 000 - 7, 750 : B. gymnorhiza, (c) 1, 875 - 8, 250 : B. parviflora, (d) 1, 875 - 5, 500 :A. officials, (e) 1, 625 - 6, 250 :S. caseolaris, (f) 1, 875 - 5, 250 : S. alba, (g) 1, 750 - 7, 500 : R. apiculata, (h) 2, 000 - 8, 000 : R. stylosa, (i) 2, 200 - 7, 000 : R. mucronata. Results of this study indicated that the mangrove species could only be identified at the near infrared (NIR) wavelength (700 nm to 900 nm) and not in the visible (VIS) spectrum. With such a capability, the sensor should be in a position to provide a geospatial database of the Malaysian mangroves for Tsunami management and other purposes of interests. Future management of mangrove forests in P. Malaysia should then adopt an integrated approach by further refining the current management and incorporating latest findings and updated latest geospatial information through more vigorous airborne hyperspectral data acquisition on mangrove forest. With the future geospatial database developed from the sensor, the National Forestry Policy and other policies related to mangrove forests management can be revised from time to time to match latest prevailing conditions and requirement. The future success in developing a mangrove geospatial database using UPM-APSB’s AISA data by FDPM will in fact contribute to the sustainability of the wetlands in Malaysia which is crucial to the survival and future health of our Mother Earth.     </p...|$|E
40|$|Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Lake Erie {{have been}} {{prominent}} in recent years. The bloom in 2014 reached a severe level causing the State of Ohio {{to declare a}} state of emergency. At that time NASA Glenn Research Center was requested by stakeholders to help monitor the blooms in Lake Erie. Glenn conducted flights twice a week in August and September and assembled and distributed the HAB information to the shoreline water resource managers using its <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor</b> (in development since 2006), the S 3 Viking aircraft, and funding resources from the NASA Headquarters Earth Science Division. Since then, the State of Ohio, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have elevated their funding and activities for observing, monitoring, and addressing {{the root cause of}} HABs. Also, the communities and stakeholders have persistently requested NASA Glenns participation in HAB observation. Abundant field campaigns and sample analyses have been funded by Ohio and NOAA, which provided a great opportunity for NASA to advance science and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing economically. Capitalizing on this opportunity to advance the science of algal blooms and remote sensing, NASA Glenn conducted the Airborne Hyperspectral Observation of harmful algal blooms campaign in 2015 that was, in many respects, twice as large as the 2014 campaign. Focusing mostly on Lake Erie, but also including other small inland lakes and the Ohio River, the campaign was conducted in partnership with a large number of partners specializing in marine science and remote sensing. Airborne hyperspectral observation of HABs holds promise to distinguish potential HABs from nuisance blooms, determine their concentrations, and delineate their movement in an augmented spatial and temporal resolution and under cloudsall of which are excellent complements to satellite observations. Working with collaborators at several Ohio and Michigan institutions as well as one in South Dakota and one in Alabama, this effort was able to provide next-day georeferenced estimates of cyanobacteria and scum concentrations. Very prompt processing and analysis of the hyperspectral imagery is necessary for the information to be acted upon. For example, a next-day report of an overflight over the Ohio River indicated that a bloom could be present as far downstream as the Cincinnati intake, but the Ohio EPA had not received visual reports of a bloom that far downstream. Water samples were obtained at the Cincinnati water intake, based on the flight data, and detected microcystins in the source water. The flight data helped State and municipal authorities realize the potential extent of that bloom, and triggered response sampling, before the visual river-wide scums started forming. The present document describes the process that was utilized to take raw remote sensing data and create information products; this includes system calibration and validation, efforts to correct atmospheric effects, and algorithms that produce the data products. Furthermore, successful research into improved algorithms for expanding the capability to delineate in water constituents is included. Finally, comparisons that show expected relationships between ground-based measurements and hyperspectral imager version 2 (HSI 2) data results are presented, giving confidence in the remote sensing products...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> technique based on laser-induced fluorescence for non-invasive detection of tumorous tissue on mouse skin. <b>Hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensors</b> collect image {{data in a}} number of narrow, adjacent spectral bands. Such high-resolution measurement of spectral information reveals contiguous emission spectra at each image pixel useful for the characterization of constituent materials. The hyperspectral image data used in this study are fluorescence images of mouse skin consisting of 21 spectral bands in the visible spectrum of the wavelengths ranging from 440 nm to 640 nm. Fluorescence signal is measured with the use of laser excitation at 337 nm. An acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) is used to capture images at 10 nm intervals. All spectral band images are spatially registered with the reference band image at 490 nm to obtain exact pixel correspondences by compensating the spatial offsets caused by the refraction differences in AOTF at different wavelengths during the image capture procedure. The unique fluorescence spectral signatures demonstrate a good separation to differentiate malignant tumors from normal tissues for rapid detection of skin cancers without biopsy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are used}} to detect and {{identify}} diverse surface materials, topographical features, and geological features. Because the intervening atmosphere poses an obstacle to the retrieval of surface reflectance data, algorithms exist to compensate the measured signal {{for the effects of}} the atmosphere. This article provides an overview and an evaluation of available atmospheric compensation algorithms for the visible-through-shortwave infrared spectral region, including comparison of operational characteristics, input requirements, algorithm limitations, and computational requirements. Statistical models based on empirical in-scene data are contrasted with physicsbased radiative transfer algorithms. The statistical models rely on a priori scene information that is coupled with the sensor spectral observations in a regression algorithm. The physics-based models utilize physical characteristics of the atmosphere to derive water vapor, aerosol, and mixed gas contributions to the atmospheric signal. Treatment of aerosols in atmospheric compensation models varies considerably and is discussed in some detail. A three-band ratio approac...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in hyperspectral data acquired by various experimental <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensors,</b> {{it is necessary to}} develop efficient and innovative tools to handle and analyze these data. The objective {{of this study is to}} seek effective spatial analytical tools for summarizing the spatial patterns of <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> data. In this paper, we (1) examine how fractal dimension D changes across spectral bands of <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> data and (2) determine the relationships between fractal dimension and image content. It has been documented that fractal dimension changes across spectral bands for the Landsat-TM data and its value [(D) ] is largely a function of the complexity of the landscape under study. The newly available <b>hyperspectral</b> <b>imaging</b> data such as that from the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) which has 224 bands, covers a wider spectral range with a much finer spectral resolution. Our preliminary result shows that fractal dimension values of AVIRIS scenes from the Santa Monica Mountains in California vary between 2. 25 and 2. 99. However, high fractal dimension values (D > 2. 8) are found only from spectral bands with high noise level and bands with good image quality have a fairly stable dimension value (D = 2. 5 - 2. 6). This suggests that D can also be used as a summary statistics to represent the image quality or content of spectral bands...|$|R
