An XF 7 C- 1 airplane, equipped with <b>service</b> <b>cowling</b> and with narrow ring, wide ring, and exhaust collector ring cowlings over the <b>service</b> <b>cowling,</b> was used. For these four cowling conditions, the rate of climb and high speed performance were determined, the cylinder conditions were measured, and pictures to show visibility were taken. The level flight performance obtained with an engine speed of 1900 r. p. m. for the service type, the narrow ring, the wide ring, and the exhaust collector ring was 144. 4, 146. 6, 152. 8, and 155 mph, respectively. The rate of climb was practically the same for each type tested. The visibility was not materially impaired by the use of the wide or the narrow cowlings. With the narrow ring and exhaust collector ring cowlings there was an increase in cylinder temperature. However, this increase was not enough to affect the performance of the engine. The use of an exhaust collector ring incorporated into the cowling is practical where the problem of visibility does not enter...|$|R

This small but technologically advanced sector delivers critical innovation inputs to firms that produce durable goods. Evidence from a survey of 85 US design companies suggests that competitive success <b>hinges</b> upon <b>service</b> diversity. Specifically, the most commercially buoyant companies have diversified their service offerings beyond product or component design. These firms have developed strategic competencies in fields such as contract research, prototype development, product testing, technological forecasting, market analysis and even advertising. Although most US design companies are small-to-medium-sized enterprises, successful firms do not differ from their less successful counterparts in terms of employment size, occupational structure, regional location or market focus (client sectors). Instead, the key differences lie in service diversity {{and the quality of}} human capital. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of the empirical findings for future research on the dynamics of the design industry.

40|$|On 24 November 1992, Australia {{overturned}} its longstanding ban on gay {{and lesbian}} service in the Australian Defence Force. The ban was on the political agenda throughout 1992, though {{it was never a}} government priority or subject to mass protest.

40|$|The {{future of}} {{biodiversity}} and ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>hinges</b> on harmonizing agricultural production and conservation, {{yet there is}} no planning algorithm for predicting the efficacy of conservation investments in farmland. We present a conservation planning framework for countryside (working agricultural landscapes) that calculates the production and conservation benefits to the current baseline of incremental investments. Our framework is analogous to the use of reserve design algorithms. Unlike much countryside modeling, our framework is designed for application in data-limited contexts, which are prevalent. We apply our framework to quantify the payoff for Costa Rican birds of changing farm plot and border vegetation. We show that installing windbreaks of native vegetation enhances both bird diversity and farm income, especially when complementing certain crop types. We make predictions that differ from those of approaches currently applied to agri-environment planning,: e. g., although habitat with trees has lower local species richness than farm plot habitats (1 – 44 % lower), replacing any plot habitat with trees should boost regional richness considerably. Our planning framework reveals the small, targeted changes on farms that can make big differences for biodiversity...|$|R

This study was undertaken to estimate the probability of reaching residential stability over time and to identify predictors of residential stability among homeless young adults aged 18 to 25 years. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out in Montréal, Canada, between April 5 (th) 2006 and January 21 (th) 2009. Interviews conducted every three months included questions on life conditions and social and mental health factors that are known to influence residential trajectories. Residential status was determined, starting on the first day after recruitment; each follow-up day was classified as a homeless day or a housed day. A period of 90 days was used to define residential stability; therefore the main study outcome was the occurrence of the first consecutive 90 housed days during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Of the 359 participants, 284 reached 90 days of residential stability over the study period, representing an annual probability of 80. 5 %. In multivariate analysis, youth who had a high school degree, had a formal sector activity, and those who had sought psychological help were more likely to reach residential stability. Being a man, injecting substances, and having an informal sector activity were associated with a decreased probability to reach residential stability. CONCLUSION: Exposure to factors related to opportunities that promote social integration increases the chance of reaching residential stability. On the other hand, factors related to high level of street entrenchment seem to interfere with stabilization. Maximum efforts should be made to prevent chronic homelessness among youth, targeting not only individual impairments but also <b>hinging</b> on <b>services</b> adapted to foster social connections among the youth...|$|R
40|$|General Practitioners {{and mental}} health clinicians {{recognise}} and acknowledge the expertise of psychologists in the diagnosis {{and management of the}} full range of mental health problems. This presentation highlights the challenges of recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of psychologists by a particular service provider, while also outlining a particularly effective strategy implemented over the past decade. Continuing difficulties are identified with some options suggested as part solutions. Data is presented illustrating the scope of the challenges faced: nature and extent of mental health problems; scale of demand and geographic are covered; comparative research involving other service providers. The organisation has been recruiting and employing qualified and experienced psychologists for South West Queensland region for the past 13 years. The challenge to the organisation to offer effective and continuous <b>services</b> <b>hinges</b> on the difficulties of recruitment and retention of staff in these areas. The practice of sponsoring psychologists from abroad, who meet the standards of the Australian Psychological Society as well as the Queensland Board of Psychology, has proven to be an effective strategy. This has allowed for effective service delivery in this region as described by the community, GPs and consumers in a recent survey. Service delivery remains a challenge due to numerous reasons to be explored. Of particular note is the challenge of managing a situation in which overseastrained psychologists with a particular cultural orientation are required to serve an ever changing multi-cultural population in the South West Queensland region. A future based exploration of ways to support these psychologists—personally and professionally — whilst delivering an effective service within this multicultural environment is outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{disorders}} for which genetic testing is available has increased nearly 500 % {{in the past}} 15 years. Access {{to the majority of}} genetic tests and <b>services</b> <b>hinges</b> on physicians’ ability to identify patients at risk for genetic disease and provide appropriate testing and counseling or refer to genetic specialists. Recent research demonstrates the need for referrals to genetic specialists by showing that many physicians lack skills required to perform appropriate genetic services, such as making proper risk assessments, providing genetic counseling, ordering genetic testing and interpreting results. However, little research exists on physicians’ awareness and utilization of genetic services. In this study, an electronic survey evaluating practicing physicians’ awareness of, utilization of and perceived barriers to genetic services in Texas was distributed via state physician organizations. Of the 157 participants, approximately half reported they were moderately or very aware of genetic testing and services in their area. Very few reported awareness of telemedicine services. Over two-thirds reported never or rarely referring to genetic counselors or other genetic specialists, despite 75 % reporting they had noticed an increased impact of genetics on their field and 61 % reporting they had discussed genetics more in their day-to-day practice in the last 5 - 10 years. Only 20 % reported genetics was very integral to their specialty. Over three-fourths of all participants indicated interest in learning more about genetics, genetic testing and genetic services. Among the most frequently chosen barriers to genetic counselors were awareness-related barriers such as not knowing how to refer to a genetic counselor. Responses to many items varied significantly by medical specialty. The results identify a need to increase awareness of genetic services and referral logistics. Specific findings can help direct outreach efforts to educate clinicians, such as developing clinically meaningful, specialty-specific educational objectives...|$|R
40|$|Presently, many {{children}} and adolescents {{have the opportunity to}} engage in service-learning, however, students with disabilities rarely have access to these opportunities. This paper focuses on using service-learning with students with disabilities to enhance outcomes at the intersection of special education, transitions, and inclusion. Special Education, as mandated through federal legislation in the U. S., provides customized education for students with diagnosed disabilities. Special Education services must be delivered in the “least restrictive environment”, fostering inclusion of students with disabilities with typically-developing peers. Special Education must target transitions, the process of facilitating post-school adjustment of students, particularly students with disabilities, to adult life. Service-learning, as a philosophy, pedagogical technique, and community development strategy, should be part of a comprehensive transition plan to support students to gain experience and develop skills needed to successfully pursue post-secondary activities. Additionally, service-learning for students with disabilities enhances community outcomes in inclusion (a process, method, or state of being involved) by integrating those excluded (or at risk of being excluded) into the community. Service-learning intentionally links community service with academic, socio-emotional, and/or career curriculum goals and can optimize student development during transitions. This paper reviews best practices for creating transition plans that systematically include service-learning for students with various disabilities. This best-practices portion aims to strengthen the skills and leadership of professionals interested in and engaged in supporting intentional service-learning and professionals who see diversity and inclusion as mechanisms to improve transitions and communities. The next portion reviews a study of Project Impact (Timmons 2 ̆ 6 Zalewska, 2012), which engages high school- and college-aged students with disabilities in AmeriCorps and their communities. Project Impact’s service-learning activities purposefully connect academic, socio-emotional, and career development with service.

40|$|In this study, {{glass and}} Kevlar® fibers {{reinforced}} epoxy composites were manufactured and characterized using different techniques. The effect of thermal exposure on the flexural {{properties of the}} composites was investigated to ascertain its suitability for the intended application in cowling panels of light engine aircraft. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on both reinforced and unreinforced epoxy resin to evaluate their thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was carried out to evaluate the effects of thermal exposure, applied strain and frequency on the dynamic mechanical response of the composites. The effects of the applied resin hardener and thermal exposure on the flexural strength, flexural modulus and dynamic impact response of the composites were also investigated. The flexural properties were determined using 3 -point bending test, while the impact test was carried out using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). TGA analysis of the reinforced and unreinforced epoxy showed no significant weight loss until the test samples were heated above 250 °C in an inert atmosphere. Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) on the composites indicated the glass transition temperature to lie between 80 and 100 °C. The results of the flexural and impact tests showed that the mechanical integrity of both glass and Kevlar® fiber reinforced epoxy composites remained unimpaired by radiative or convective heat exposure for up to 3 h until the exposure temperature exceeded 200 °C. This {{is much higher than}} the <b>service</b> temperature of <b>cowling</b> panels of light engine recreational aircrafts. When the manufactured fiber reinforced epoxy composites were exposed to temperature above 200 °C matrix degradation occurred, which became very significant when the exposure temperature was higher than 250 °C. Extensive delamination and matrix cracking occurred when the composites were exposed to the temperature range 250 °C - 300 °C for 1 h. Fiber-matrix debonding was not observed in the composite except after failure under impact loading. This is evidence {{of the fact that the}} epoxy matrix was adequately wetted by both the glass and Kevlar® fibers resulting in the strong fiber/matrix interfacial bonding. While the Kevlar® reinforced epoxy displayed a better damage tolerance under flexural and impact loading, glass fiber reinforced epoxy showed higher strength but lower damage tolerance. Glass fiber reinforced epoxy also showed more resistance to damage under exposure to thermal flux than Kevlar® reinforced epoxy. Under impact loading, the Kevlar® reinforced composite failed by delamination with no fiber rupture, whereas the glass fiber reinforced epoxy failed by matrix cracking, debonding, fiber rupture and fiber pullout. The results from this research have established the effect of radiative and convective thermal exposure on the mechanical behavior of the fabricated Kevlar® fiber and glass reinforced epoxy composites. The maximum temperature reached on the inner surface of the cowling panels of a typical light engine recreational aircraft due to heat radiations from the engine block has been estimated to be about 65 °C. This is lower than the glass transition temperature of the epoxy matrix as obtained from DMTA. The low temperature rise is due to inflow cooling air into the cowling chamber in flight. The results of the current investigations suggest the suitability of composite materials for the intended application. The intensity of thermal exposure, to which the materials will be exposed in such application, may not cause any significant damage to the mechanical integrity of the composite. However, since the difference between the possible exposure temperature and the glass transition temperature is only a little over 20 °C, a layer of thermal insulator on the inner surface of the cowling made of fiber reinforced epoxy will be desirable to further sustain the mechanical integrity of the composites when selected for use as choice materials for cowling panels of light engine aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{transport}} sector {{is critical to}} the performance of various sectors of the economy both trade in goods and <b>services</b> <b>hinges</b> on an efficient and reliable transport services sector. South Africa has undertaken limited commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in the {{transport sector}}. South Africa's transport sector in general is controlled by the government through state owned firms. The transport sector is competitive relative to Africa, however, relative to developed economies, the transport sector lags behind in terms of efficiency and cost (DBSA, 2012). Inefficiencies result in increased transaction costs and impede the overall competitiveness and economic performance of the country. The transport sector and other services sectors in general are mainly governed by domestic legislation. Barriers to trade in services may be located in laws and regulations of individual economies often referred to as behind the border measures such as license, technical, educational, registration and local ownership requirements and as such are more difficult to address than barriers to goods. (Hartzenberg, 2012). To identify these measures it is important to undertake an assessment of the legislation governing sector. This study analyses both vertical and horizontal legislation governing the sector. This study aims to assess the level of liberalisation of South Africa's transport sector to gauge the presence of trade restrictive measures in the sector that would limit access, establishment and or operation by foreign service suppliers. This is done through an analysis of domestic legislation governing the transport sector and its related sub - sectors. This effectively entails a comparison between actual commitments as reflected in South Africa's GATS schedule of specific commitments and applied policy as reflected in legislation. Data from such a study provides valuable technical information to trade negotiators regarding the policy space available allowing them to develop and formulate informed negotiating positions. The methodology employed in this study is adapted from the World Bank's Regulatory Assessment of Services, Trade and Investment (RASTI) and has been adapted for purposes of this study. A country, prior to engaging in a services negotiation should conduct an assessment of the level of liberalisation of each service sector to gauge its competitive strengths and weaknesses. Such an assessment entails an assessment of the country's regulation to determine if such regulation is overly burdensome {{to the extent that it}} inhibits competition and trade in services in an economy. Once such an assessment is concluded, a large number of countries have found that domestic regulatory reforms are necessary for effective participation in services negotiations. (Molinuevo & Sáez, 2014). The importance for such assessments often referred to as audits, have been confirmed as the most effective way of ensuring that regulations are not restrictive of trade. (Molinuevo & Sáez, 2014). Moreover, periodic regulatory audits serve the purpose of identifying discriminatory measures and minimising discriminatory effects that have the effect of increasing costs and discriminating against foreign service suppliers. A comparison of the liberalisation of South Africa's transport sector in terms of the actual commitments (as reflected in the GATS services schedule) against the applied domestic regulation is an important exercise in view of the discussions at the WTO level about the liberalisation of services and at a regional level in view of South Africa's regional and continental aspirations to promote regional integration. The transport sector has been identified as a priority sector in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) invol ving, COMESA, E AC and SADC. In the TFTA negotiations, even though the first phase focused on trade in goods, the second phase will address trade in services, including transport services. Negotiations in SADC based on the Protocol on Trade in Services are ongoing and wil l include transport services. A study of this nature is important for undertaking and formulating negotiating positions for trade in services and may be replicated across various service sectors...|$|R
