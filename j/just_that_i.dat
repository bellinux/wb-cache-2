I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much."

Plumbing is." [...] Tracy was humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, [...] "it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> try no tricks. No profile. No 'great lover' act...

500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they assumed she didn't like them. Series producer Leonard Katzman confronted her about the issue and she said, [...] "I like everybody. It's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E

With regards to his large fortune, Houphouët-Boigny said in 1983, [...] "People are surprised that I like gold. It's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was born in it." [...] The Ivorian leader acquired a dozen properties in the metropolitan area of Paris (including Hotel Masseran on Masseran Street in the 7th arrondissement of Paris), a property in Castel Gandolfo in Italy, and a house in Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland. He owned real estate companies, such as Grand Air SI, SI Picallpoc and Interfalco, and had many shares in prestigious jewelry and watchmaking companies, such as Piaget SA and Harry Winston.

Manager Danny Wilson described Cresswell as [...] "one for the future" [...] after admitting the player [...] "is not the striker people may perceive as the big one we were chasing". His debut came in Wednesday's 2–1 home defeat to Coventry City on 3 April 1999, before scoring his first goal with an 87th-minute winner at home to Liverpool in a 1–0 win on 8 May. He finished 1998–99 with one goal in seven appearances for Wednesday. Cresswell completed 1999–2000 with two goals in 25 appearances, having been given few opportunities in the team, as Wednesday were relegated into the First Division.|$|E

500|$|On 22 August 634, Abu Bakr died, {{having made}} Umar, Khalid's cousin, his successor. Umar's first move was to relieve Khalid from supreme command of Muslim Forces and appoint Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah {{as the new}} {{commander}} in chief of the Islamic army. Khalid had become a trial of disbelief (because of his undefeated wars) for the Muslims as they had attributed the wins of battles to the personality and figure of Khalid; Umar was reported as saying:"I did not fire Khalid ibn al Waleed because I am angry with him or because of betrayal of trust or responsibility but the reason was <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted people to know that it is Allah who gives victory". This resulted in the dismissal of Khalid from supreme command and later in 638, from military services.

500|$|As {{a member}} of the Barnes family, Pamela was {{initially}} met with suspicion and hostility from the rival Ewing family after she had married Bobby Ewing and moved onto the Southfork Ranch to live with her new husband. The strongest hostility towards Pamela came from Bobby's older brother, J.R. Ewing, who tried to drive Pamela off Southfork Ranch with methods of bribery and intimidation, as well as trying to con Bobby into believing that Pamela {{was having an affair with}} her ex-boyfriend, Ray Krebbs. Principal, who wanted to represent her character's outsider perception of the family, would portray this with the cast. Leonard Katzman described her as being [...] "the world's most isolated lady". When confronted by Katzman about why Principal chose to be isolated from everyone else, he described the situation as: [...] "After a while, I thought, 'Maybe she doesn't like us'. I went to see her.

500|$|According to writer Linda Ruth Williams, {{the music}} video {{attracted}} {{attention from the}} press because of [...] "the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue." [...] A Spears representative spoke to the Sunday Sport and revealed, [...] "as far as I'm aware the director just does music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all." [...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> also like {{people to know that}} I don't currently and haven't in a long time." [...] Billboard reporter Carla Hay also noted, [...] "I don't think people who buy records are too concerned about the background of the video's director." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul, noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. Time journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears [...] "may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair," [...] while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it [...] "a suitably soft-focus affair". The video was also added to MTV's 2000 Yearbook, a list with the [...] "biggest, best, most memorable music videos of every year since the beginning of MTV." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foucault is {{sometimes}} criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social constructionism, which some see as {{an affront to}} the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating [...] "He struck me as completely amoral, I’d never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't make sense of him.

It was <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt like I didn't have to shake his hand." [...] Kadri later had second thoughts about his refusal, stating, [...] "I regret it a little bit." [...] During the gold medal game against the United States, Kadri had two assists including one on Jordan Eberle's game-tying goal with 1:35 left in the third period.
