5|$|Guest {{returned}} to England and joined No. 53 Squadron RAF in 1943, flying B-24 Liberator bombers from RAF Thorney Island on anti-submarine patrols over the Bay of Biscay. Soon {{after arriving in}} England, on 4 October 1943, his and another aircraft were sent out on patrol. They were attacked by six Ju 88s. The other aircraft sought {{the protection of the}} clouds but Guest decided to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> He did not return. He was pronounced missing in January 1944. Guest is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial.|$|E
5|$|When renewed air {{operations}} began over the Bay, the Command found U-boats not only adhering {{to a new}} strategy (of avoidance), they discovered the Germans obeying new tactical instructions. The German crews were ordered to transit the Bay in groups, submerged, and at night, but on the surface in daylight, to concentrate their defensive fire. Later U-boat designs had their firepower upgraded for this purpose. Also, the Luftwaffe provided Junkers Ju 88 night fighters to escort the submarines. The increased firepower and determination of German air and submarine crews to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> did not deter British crews. The Third Bay Offensive became the bloodiest in the aircraft-submarine battle yet, which involved heavy losses. Despite efforts to defend themselves, by 17 June, air attacks had forced German submarines {{to make the trip}} submerged during daylight. The effects were not just indirect; patrols also inflicted increasing losses on U-boats. From 1 July to 2 August 1943, 86 submarines passed through the Bay; 55 were sighted and 16 sunk, in exchange for 14 aircraft.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of November 24, Bragg asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat or to stand and fight. Cleburne, {{concerned}} about what Sherman had accomplished, expected Bragg to retreat. Hardee also counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on the strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the right wing to assist in repelling Sherman.|$|E
25|$|Mark Schwarzer's {{departure}} {{at the end}} of {{the previous}} season saw Gareth Southgate announce that Brad Jones and Ross Turnbull would <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for the first choice goalkeeper's shirt, and thus no goalkeepers were amongst the signings during the summer, much to the initial dismay of Boro supporters. Liverpool goalkeeper Charles Itandje later revealed that Middlesbrough tried to sign him on loan during the summer, but that his club refused to allow him to move.|$|E
25|$|Like Latour, Riesch's {{troops had}} to contend with terrible roads and snow squalls. They fell far behind Kollowrat, {{reaching}} Albaching only at 9:30am. Consequently, Richepanse's division passed in front of Riesch. Near the village of St. Christoph, the two Austrian grenadier battalions sent by Kollowrat stumbled upon Richepanse's marching column, cutting his division in half. With single-minded determination, the Frenchman left his rear brigade under General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Drouet to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and drove to the north with his leading brigade.|$|E

5000|$|Godric is told in Saint Godric's own voice: Buechner {{intentionally}} uses style, tone, {{and word}} choice to evoke a [...] "mediaeval" [...] manner of speaking. The book unfolds with Godric narrating {{the events of}} his life in retrospect, as he looks back on his hundred years of life and does not see the saintly existence that many ascribe to him. The honest earthiness of Godric's account of his life—his candour in describing his most pious acts and most wretched sins—made this book a critical favourite. The Times, for example, noted in its Literary Supplement that [...] "Godric is a living battleground where God <b>fights</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with the world, the Flesh, and the Devil." ...|$|R
25|$|Prevost {{replied that}} as he was faced with such a large {{military}} force, {{he would have to}} take some of them prisoner before he could accept. Moultrie advised the council that he would never stand by and allow the British to take Americans prisoner without fighting, so the council decided to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> The city braced itself for an attack, but the next morning, the British had disappeared. Prevost had intercepted a letter from General Lincoln to Moultrie saying that he was marching to the aid of Charleston, and Prevost decided that he could not hold out if the Americans got reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|By midnight, Lookout Mountain was quiet. Pettus and Holtzclaw {{received}} orders at 2 a.m. {{to march}} off the mountain. Postwar writings of both Union and Confederate veterans {{refer to a}} brilliant moon, which slipped into the blackness of a total lunar eclipse, screening the Confederate withdrawal. That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on the strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg's army.|$|E
25|$|Chappell, the {{grandson}} of Victor Richardson, had no doubt been weaned on tales of the Bodyline tour by his grandfather, {{one of the few}} Australian batsmen to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with Larwood and his support bowlers. Forty years later, {{and it was time to}} pay back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.|$|E

The winner was Ikram Kerwat by knockout.|$|R
5000|$|Havok {{appears as}} an NPC in X-Men Legends, voiced by Matt Nolan. He has {{joined forces with}} the Brotherhood, much to Cyclops' chagrin. Discovering that mutants are being experimented on in the {{abandoned}} Weapon X labs, he contacts his brother to secretly meet up with him to check <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Cyclops initially <b>fights</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with Havok, until Wolverine, having also come to investigate due to his ties to Weapon X, breaks things up. Together the three attack the labs, freeing the imprisoned mutants, though Havok returns to the Brotherhood afterwards. Later on, Havok (along with Magneto and some unnamed Brotherhood grunts) fights alongside the X-Men when the Mansion grounds are under attack by Sentinels. Eventually, Havok has second thoughts about working with the Brotherhood and is immediately imprisoned for mutiny upon being subdued by Blob. He is freed in the final mission by the X-Men. After winning the game, Havok {{and the rest of}} the Brotherhood of Mutants are playable in the Danger Room.|$|R

25|$|For {{all of the}} {{advantages}} of a small ship, there were drawbacks that could sway captains to look to larger vessels. A sloop or a ship of similar size could not carry a large enough crew to take on bigger prizes by boarding and couldn't carry enough firepower to force submission or <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with larger foes; it was also limited in the amount of cargo it could carry. In terms of firepower, anything the size of a sloop would not carry more than fourteen guns, with the French sloop's carrying six guns or less. Conversely some of the largest pirate ships like Bartholomew Roberts flagship the Royal Fortune sported forty-two guns.|$|E
25|$|While Napoleon {{fought against}} Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's Russo-Prussian army to the north, Schwarzenberg's army pushed Marshal Jacques MacDonald's army back toward Paris. After his victory at Reims, Napoleon moved south to {{threaten}} Schwarzenberg's supply line to Germany. In response, the Austrian field marshal pulled his army back to Troyes and Arcis-sur-Aube. When Napoleon occupied Arcis, the normally cautious Schwarzenberg determined to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> rather than retreat. The clashes {{on the first}} day were inconclusive and Napoleon mistakenly believed he was following up a retreating enemy. On the second day, the French advanced to high ground and were appalled to see between 74,000 and 100,000 enemies in battle array south of Arcis. After bitter fighting, Napoleon's troops fought their way out, but it was definitely a French setback.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{relative}} {{successes in}} his near abroad, Swa still had {{little control over}} his own vassal Toungoo. He never trusted Gov. Pyanchi of Toungoo, who was educated in Pegu and had been contact with Pegu during Ava's brief war with Maw. As a first step, in 1374, Swa asked Toungoo's eastern neighbor Lan Na not to interfere. Chronicles say after he had threatened to send a sizable force to the frontier, Chiang Mai sent an embassy to Ava, and agreed to a peace treaty. But Chiang Mai might have simply let Ava and Pegu <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> At any rate, Pyanchi now recognized that Ava was trying to isolate him, and asked Pegu for military aid. Despite the 1370 non-aggression pact, Binnya U sent a sizable force consisting of infantry, cavalry and war elephants to Toungoo.|$|E

25|$|Mortier reached Bar-sur-Aube on 20 January {{and that}} {{afternoon}} his force {{was joined by}} the 2nd Old Guard Division led by Charles-Joseph Christiani and the 113th Line Infantry Regiment under Louis Auguste Victor de Bourmont. Mortier complained {{in a letter to}} Napoleon's Chief of staff Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier, that Christiani's division had fewer than 3,000 men. Bourmont's regiment counted 1,800 soldiers. On 21 January, Mortier got a message that Napoleon was approaching his position and this made the marshal more determined to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> During the next few days major units of the Army of Bohemia remained inert though both the III and IV Corps gathered intelligence of Mortier's positions from patrols. The arrival of Czar Alexander at the front on 22 January forced Schwarzenberg's hand. Alexander urged Schwarzenberg to advance and when the Austrian made weak excuses, the czar accused him of sabotaging the campaign. To placate Alexander, Schwarzenberg agreed to a plan of attack that Gyulai and the Crown Prince submitted to his headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Empress Matilda and {{her party}} took refuge at Arundel Castle {{where they were}} welcomed by King Henry's widow Adeliza and her new husband William d'Aubigny. Robert of Gloucester rode to Bristol to rally support for the empress. Stephen quickly {{assembled}} an army and surrounded Arundel Castle, demanding that the empress be handed over to him. Though her garrison was weak, Adeliza sent word that she would <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> At this point Stephen committed an astonishing blunder by giving Empress Matilda a safe-conduct pass to Bristol and withdrawing his army. When his enemy reached safety, the civil war broke out in full fury. While London and the east remained loyal to Stephen, the west declared for the empress. Stephen hired a body of Flemish mercenaries under William of Ypres, antagonizing his English subjects. The system of justice established under Henry I went to pieces and the common people suffered under the harsh demands of local noblemen and officials.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Spencer {{attacked}} again and {{was joined by}} another Coast Guard cutter, the , they waited for U-175 to surface. On board U-175, quick thinking by the boat's engineer to blow the ballast tanks had prevented them from sinking further and helped right the boat, but communications had been knocked out and {{it became clear to}} Bruns that the only option was to surface. Giving the order, the boat rose to the surface; as it did so, Spencer and Duane began firing at close range, while Spencers commander, Berdine, closed with intent to ram. But Bruns was not intending to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and, seeking to save his crew, led the way onto the conning tower to signal his intention to surrender. The Coast Guard crewmen, however, did not immediately understand the Germans' intentions and maintained a devastating fire on the conning tower that cut down Bruns and a number other men and forced the others to delay their exit. During the firing, stray rounds from one of the merchant ships hit Spencer killing one and wounding seven others.|$|E

Terry normally reports on criminal news, but failed to scoop a kidnapping of a famous lawyer named Rex Crenshaw, and was put on sports duty instead. While trying to get the kidnapping story, Terry sacrificed a quite-important appointment at the marriage license office, and his fiancé Maris was enraged enough to break up with him.|$|R
50|$|Unbeknown to most, Hypno-Disc {{also took}} part in a Wild Card Warrior battle in Extreme Series 1, where it went up against TX-108.

However, Hypno-Disc suddenly broke down completely, just 30 seconds into the <b>fight.</b> <b>It</b> was counted <b>out</b> by the Refbot, and TX-108 was declared the winner.

25|$|Naturally {{the fight}} for the top spots means that the most {{significant}} rivalries are with the other Top 14 big guns, Toulouse and Biarritz Olympique. Stade Français {{has been seen as}} the rising threat by the all-powerful Toulousains who had won four consecutive titles (1994–97), before Paris won the next one. The clubs alternated for four years, winning two titles each until 2001, though they never met in the final. When they finally did, Stade Français walked over Toulouse for a victory (32–18) in 2003. Toulouse got their revenge in 2005, when they won a tight Heineken Cup final in overtime (18–12 a.e.t.) at Murrayfield. The clubs often <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in the press, but there have never been any real tensions on the pitch, largely because many players have been playing together for France. Regular season games are rarely spectacular. In October 2005, Toulouse was the guest for the first ever regular season match at the Stade de France, but coach Guy Novès chose to leave key regular starters at home, so the Stade Français 29–15 victory was maybe not as significant.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, {{the plans}} of Wagenknecht, Reed & Co. to <b>fight</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> at the 1919 Emergency National Convention {{continued}} apace. With {{the most radical}} state organizations effectively purged by the Regulars (Massachusetts, Minnesota) or unable to participate (Ohio, Michigan), and the Left Wing language federations suspended, a big majority of the hastily elected delegates to the gathering were controlled by the Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the Regulars. A group of Left Wingers without delegate credentials, including John Reed and his sidekick Benjamin Gitlow, {{made an effort to}} occupy chairs on the convention floor before the gathering was called into order. The incumbents were unable to block the Left Wingers at the door, but soon called the already present police to their aid, and the officers of the law obligingly expelled the boisterous radicals from the hall. With the Credentials Committee firmly {{in the hands of the}} Regulars from the outset, the outcome of the gathering was no longer in doubt and most of the remaining Left Wing delegates departed, to meet with other co-thinkers downstairs in a previously reserved room in a parallel convention. It was this gathering which established itself as the Communist Labor Party on August 31, 1919.|$|E
