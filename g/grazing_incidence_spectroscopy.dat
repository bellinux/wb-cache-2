Single, double, and triple layer titanate and tungstate thin films were deposited on silicon substrates, and these films were initially annealed at 400 °C. Structural and microstructural {{aspects of the}} films were investigated {{using a variety of}} techniques, including X-ray reflectometry, <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> X-ray absorption <b>spectroscopy</b> (GIXAS), cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The dimensions of the films and the character of the interfaces were principally gauged by cross-sectional TEM and X-ray reflectometery. All films were continuous on a local scale and had relatively low surface roughness. At the treatment temperature of 400 °C, only the tungsten oxide component showed appreciable crystallinity. The multilayer films had relatively diffuse interfaces, even after annealing in air at this temperature. At these temperatures, easily measurable diffusion of tungsten into the titanium oxide component was observed, whereas the diffusion of titanium into the tungsten oxide component occurred to a lesser degree. At higher temperatures, interdiffusion of components was found to be significant. TEM, X-ray diffraction, and Ti K-edge GIXAS measurements indicated that annealing at 400 °C generated films in which the titanate component remained amorphous while the tungstate component crystallized in the tetragonal modification Of WO 3, which is normally stable only at high temperatures. <b>Grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> X-ray absorption <b>spectroscopy</b> allowed the degree of distortion of the tungsten oxygen polyhedra to be monitored as a function of depth into the film.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{analysis}} of the optical properties of two different fs-laserinduced nanostructures which possess great potential for near-field applications due to their sub- 100 nm features. The first structures are standing gold nanojets generated by irradiation of thin gold films with single pulses of fs-laser radiation. Due to their upright standing orientation, the characteristic extinction resonances of these nanojets are studied by <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> infrared <b>spectroscopy</b> with ppolarized radiation. The resonance wavelength strongly depends on the lateral extent of the nanojet and can be tailored by adjusting the focusing numerical aperture and the applied pulse energy. The observed correlation between the lateral extent of the nanojet and the resonance wavelength is described by the monopole model of a linear antenna. The second type of structures under investigation are fs-laserinduced sub-wavelength ripples on silicon. Ripple structures of different geometrical shape are generated and coated with a thin gold film. Here, the metallic cover layer allows for the excitation of surface plasmons. Based on the generated surface profiles, the corresponding plasmonic resonances are simulated. Angle-resolved UV-VIS spectroscopy measurements are performed and the resulting plasmonic dispersion relation of these structures is compared to the calculated resonance conditions.

Both 6 and 12 nm Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were made through a surfactant-free preparation and dispersed on an Al 2 O 3 surface formed by atomic layer deposition. Under reaction conditions the nanoparticles retained their oxidation state {{and did not}} sinter. They instead underwent an assembly/ disassembly process and could reorganize within their assemblies.

The mechanistic features thought to control the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and other light alkanes on cobalt oxide were established by carrying out density functional theory calculations on the activation of propane, a surrogate model alkane, over model Co 3 O 4 surfaces. The initial activation of the alkane (propane) proceeds via hydrogen abstraction over surface oxygen sites. The subsequent activation of the resulting alkoxide intermediate occurs at a second surface oxygen site to form the alkene (propene) which then desorbs from the surface. Hydroxyl recombination results in the formation of water which desorbs from the surface.

The surfaces were first modified by the spontaneous adsorption {{of a number}} of synthesized 1, 2 -diacyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine lipids with different ω-mercapto fatty acids. The influence of packing density, order, fluidity, and mobility of the head groups of these supported thiolipid monolayers on the nonspecific adsorption of proteins was systematically investigated. Nonspecific binding of fibrinogen, IgG, BSA, and rabbit serum to such surfaces was monitored on-line by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) and was found to be exceptionally low. Characterization of the supported thiolipid monolayers by <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> infrared <b>spectroscopy,</b> wetting, impedance spectroscopy, calorimetry, and SPR indicates that protein adsorption is influenced {{by the nature of the}} fatty acids and suggests that besides the molecular structure of the layer-forming molecules, other supramolecular aspects such as flexibility of the immobilized lipid layer or protrusion of the lipid head groups play a role. These investigations point the way for the construction of even more highly protein repellent surfaces with potential technical applications in the medical (implants) and diagnostic fields (biosensors). To investigate specific protein-surface interactions, acetylcholine containing ligand molecules of the general molecular structure HS(CH 2) 15 (CO) O(CH 2 CH 2 O) nCH 2 (CO) OCH 2 CH 2 N+(CH 3) 3 X- (n = 4, 6, 13) were synthesized.
