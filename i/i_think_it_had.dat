5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{more to do with the}} actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
2500|$|Russell Crowe as Javert, {{a police}} {{inspector}} dedicating {{his life to}} imprisoning Valjean once again. Before being cast as Javert, Crowe was initially dissatisfied with the character. On his way to Europe for a friend's wedding, Crowe came to London and met with producer Cameron Mackintosh. On meeting with Tom Hooper, he told the director about his concerns about playing Javert, and after meeting with him, Crowe was [...] "determined {{to be involved in}} the project and play Javert. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> something to do with Tom's passion for what he was about to undertake, and he clearly understood the problems and he clearly understood the challenge." [...] On visiting Victor Hugo's home in Paris, Crowe said, [...] " [...] told me about [...] Vidocq, a man who had been both a prisoner and a policeman, the man credited with inventing undercover police work when he established the Brigade de Surete." ...|$|E
60|$|No, no, {{it was not}} lack {{of enthusiasm}} that killed the Whirlwind Campaign in Mariposa. It must have been {{something}} else. I don't just know what it was but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{something to do with the}} financial, the book-keeping side of the thing.|$|E
60|$|Algernon. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{been a great}} success. I'm in {{love with}} Cecily, and that is everything.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This year is, on many accounts, {{much to be}} regretted,' said Mr. Mohun, 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{brought out}} Lily's character.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{to do with}} them; as {{you will}} see if you will look at the text with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{think that}} she cares about you. I don't think it for a moment. You say you haven't spoken to her, and I am sure she's not a girl to throw herself at a man's head. I don't approve it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> better fall to the ground. It must fall to the ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{explanations}} I {{was taken}} to this officer's head-quarter tent. He was a tall, nervous-looking man with a fair, handsome face and long side-whiskers. One of his arms, I remember, {{was supported by a}} sling, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been injured in some Kaffir fighting. When I was introduced to him he was very busy, having, I understood from some one on his staff, just received orders to [...] "operate against Matshana." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{happened}} {{after her husband}} had recovered from the hurts he received in the battle, on an occasion when he was obliged to separate from her for a day in order to attend to some matter in the Town of the Child. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{to do with the}} rifles used in the battle, which he had presented to the White Kendah. So, leaving me to look after her, he went, unwillingly enough, who seemed to hate losing sight of his wife even for an hour.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a name!' Downe observed: 'I went past--when was it?--this morning; and I saw something,--"Chateau Ringdale," [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was, {{stuck up}} on a board!' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was amused}} at his {{momentary}} muddle. [...] "You can fancy my fight! She believes in her triumph. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{been part of}} her joy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{got hold}} of me at last,' he said with difficulty. 'I must try to get home. Let Mr. Vannicock take you back, Laura.' ...|$|R
6000|$|GILBEY. [...] "I {{think my}} brother {{must have been}} just a little to blame himself; so, between ourselves, I shall, with due and {{impressive}} formality, forgive Bobby later on; but for the present <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> better be understood {{that he is in}} disgrace, and that we are no longer on visiting terms. As ever, yours sincerely." [...] [His agitation masters him again] Thats a nice {{slap in the face to}} get from a man in his position! This is what your son has brought on me.|$|E
60|$|The pulpit, rising ten {{or twelve}} feet high, against the rear wall, was back' d by a {{significant}} mural painting, in oil--showing out its bold lines and strong hues through the subdued light of the building--of a stormy sea, the waves high-rolling, and amid them an old-style ship, all bent over, driving through the gale, and in great peril--a vivid and effectual piece of limning, not meant for the criticism of artists (though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> merit even from that standpoint,) but for its effect upon the congregation, and what it would convey to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I was {{at school}} at Marysville until {{he took me}} away. I saw little of him {{for the past two}} years, for he had {{business}} in the mountains--very rough business, where he couldn't take me, for it kept him away from the settlements for weeks. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> something to do with cattle, for he was always having a new horse. I was all alone before that, too; I had no other relations; I had no friends. We had always been moving about so much, my brother and I. I never saw any one that I liked, except you, and until yesterday I had only HEARD you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{very much}} aged. Her mind {{has never been}} quite itself since the last stroke, though I can hardly tell the difference, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{softened}} her.' ...|$|R
60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. Oh, I love London Society! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> immensely improved. <b>It</b> {{is entirely}} {{composed}} now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics. Just what Society should be.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have fixed my mind on that stick! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a bend at the root. Will {{you cut it}} for me, {{and trim}} it up for a walking-stick?' ...|$|R
60|$|The room {{contained}} a huge bed, {{big enough for}} eight people, and quite clean. And the table on which stood the candle actually had a cloth. But imagine that cloth! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been originally white: now, however, {{it was such a}} web of time-eaten holes and mournful black inkstains and poor dead wine stains that it was like some 2000 B.C. mummy-cloth. I wonder if it could have been lifted from that table: or if it was mummified on to it! I for one made no attempt to try. But that table-cover impressed me, as showing degrees I had not imagined.--A table-cloth.|$|E
6000|$|Life at Longbarns {{was very}} quiet during the days which she passed there before he left them. She was {{frequently}} alone with him, but he, if he still loved her, did not speak of his love. He explained it all one day to his mother. [...] "If it is to be," [...] said the old lady, [...] "I don't see the use of more delay. Of course the marriage {{ought not to be}} till March twelvemonths. But if it is understood that it is to be, she might alter her dress by degrees,--and alter her manner of living. Those things should always be done by degrees. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> better be settled, Arthur, {{if it is to be}} settled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I must. You're {{one or the}} other, you know. You're dear--to your family,--and you're Marcia: you can't deny it. The only {{question}} is whether you're the dearest of all the Miss Marcias. I may be mistaken, you know. We'll err on the safe side: Dear Marcia:" [...] He wrote it down. [...] "That looks well, and it reads well. It looks very natural, and it reads like poetry,--blank verse; there's no rhyme for it that I can remember. Dear Marcia: Will you go sleigh-riding with me to-morrow afternoon, at two o'clock sharp? Yours--yours? sincerely, or cordially, or affectionately, or what? The 'dear Marcia' seems to call for {{something out of the}} common. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> better be affectionately." [...] He suggested it with ironical gravity.|$|E
6000|$|... "That bird is not {{as other}} birds," [...] one astrologer declares. [...] "I <b>have</b> watched <b>it</b> for years past--it is ever alone--the others all avoid <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, really, Lillie, {{what can}} one {{have more than}} real old china and heavy silver plate? I rather pique myself on that; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> quite a good, rich, solid old air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God, Doctor, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> passed. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> {{my pulse}} went a beat faster when the guns opened on us, and the crackle {{of our own}} musketry had no more effect. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> gone forever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} a thing like that," [...] he said. [...] "The trader at the great fresh-water lake had one. He carried it in a small bag at his waist, and used often {{to pull it out}} and look at it. He never told me what it was for, but once he let me hear it speak. It went on just like this one--tik, tik, tik--but it did not require shaking or squeezing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a tongue like some of our squaws, who never stop speaking. One day when I went into the trader's house I saw it lying on the thing with four legs which the white men put their food on when they want to eat, and it was talking away to itself as fast as ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have wisdom," [...] she replied, {{not without}} a note of admiration in her voice. [...] "The moths are few that fear the flame, {{but those are the}} moths which live. Also I think that you have {{scorched}} your wings before and learned that fire hurts. Indeed, now I remember that I have heard of three such fires of love through which you have flown, Allan, though all of them are dead ashes now, or shine elsewhere. Two burned in your youth when a certain lady died to save you, a great woman that, is it not so? And the third, ah! she was fire indeed, though of a copper hue. What was her name? I cannot remember, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{something to do with the}} wind, yes, with the wind when it wails." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't a {{question}} of all that," [...] Maxwell interposed, with a worried glance at his wife. [...] "Mr. Godolphin has merely suggested {{something that can be}} taken into the general account; we needn't decide it now. By the way," [...] he said to the actor, [...] "have you thought over that point about changing Haxard's crime, or the quality of it? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> better not be an intentional murder; that would kill the audience's sympathy with him from the start, don't you think? We had better have it what they call a rencontre down there, where two gentlemen propose to kill each other on sight. Greenshaw's hold on him would be that he was the only witness of the fight, and that he could testify to a wilful murder if he chose. Haxard's real crime must be the killing of Greenshaw." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{always been}} a dream for the band to have a fourth member since the band {{originally}} meant to have two guitars. Now that we have Erikson, we expect to have a fuller sound, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you will}} have the {{satisfaction}} of knowing {{that you have been}} the means of exposing corruption, and of helping to turn such a man as Griffenbottom out of the House. Upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been worth while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he meant}} that {{a study of}} bones and muscles and diseased bodies had not made us prosaic and--and old. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> made me still more in love with healthy human flesh--but never mind that now; we must hurry." ...|$|R
60|$|Compared {{with any}} speaker or singer one knows, even with Aeschylus or Homer, {{why should he}} not, for {{veracity}} and universality, last like them? He is sincere as they; reaches deep down like them, to the universal and perennial. But as for Mahomet, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been better {{for him not to}} be so conscious! Alas, poor Mahomet; all that he was conscious of was a mere error; a futility and triviality,--as indeed such ever is. The truly great in him too was the unconscious: that he was a wild Arab lion of the desert, and did speak out with that great thunder-voice of his, not by words which he thought to be great, but by actions, by feelings, by a history which were great! His Koran has become a stupid piece of prolix absurdity; we do not believe, like him, that God wrote that! The Great Man here too, as always, is a Force of Nature. Whatsoever is truly great in him springs up from the inarticulate deeps.|$|E
6000|$|He {{ran over}} the {{headings}} of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He repeated to himself a phrase {{he had written}} in his review: [...] "One feels that one is listening to a thought-tormented music." [...] Miss Ivors had praised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night. It unnerved him {{to think that she}} would be at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack." [...] Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{disclosing}} any trade secrets. In {{fact the}} manager said afterwards that Mr. Kurtz's methods had ruined the district. I have no opinion on that point, but I want you clearly {{to understand that}} there was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. They only showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his various lusts, that there was something wanting in him--some small matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under his magnificent eloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I can't say. I think the knowledge came to him at last--only at the very last. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> whispered to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude--and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core. [...] . I put down the glass, and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No;--I don't know. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been so. <b>I</b> do {{know that}} John Crumb had {{threatened}} to do this thing, and I felt sure {{that sooner or later}} he would be as good as his word. If <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been so, who is to blame him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am by {{no means}} so sure of that. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been her fault; and now she has made herself notorious by being at this bazaar, and by having herself called a ridiculous name by everybody. Nothing will make me believe but what she likes it." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the title}} track {{frontman}} Chris Cheney writes, [...] "I have a weak spot for these mags. I am fascinated at the social preoccupation with reading about other people’s lives.
