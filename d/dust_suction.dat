40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of traditional vacuum cleaner and automatic cleaning robot are analyzed in the paper. A new device for household cleaning is designed. The device combines leaning mechanism with suction mechanism. It could work only by pushing the cleaning machine. In its working process, the cleaning mechanism cleans larger litters first, {{and then the}} acceleration mechanism drives the impeller rotating at a high speed, and thus produces negative pressure to inhale the remaining dust. The device could improve cleaning efficiency. As the <b>dust</b> <b>suction</b> mechanism only needs to inhale dust, the force could be smaller. It will saves power and reduces the noise generated by the vacuum part at the same time...|$|E
40|$|In {{this day}} and age, {{employee}} health safety is an extremely important issue for companies. Along with maximising profits, companies such as Sims Metal Management want {{to provide the best}} working conditions possible for their employees and minimise the risks of injury or future health concerns. Companies must do what is reasonable and practicable to ensure this. Currently in the non-ferrous recovery plant, the dust levels are sometimes too high. This causes some issues, employees must wear uncomfortable dust masks all day and causes further discomforts. It settles on machinery and on the ground. Over time this dust builds up requiring extensive cleaning and production must be stopped. Dust also increase maintenance costs and reduces the life of machinery. To combat the dust the following were completed. A high pressure water system was used to slightly dampen stored material and suppress dust plumes when this material is unloaded from the bucket of a front end loader. A bag house <b>dust</b> <b>suction</b> system was installed to remove as much dust as possible without overloading the suction system. A vibratory screener was modified to filter out the finer material and remove as much dirt as possible before it travelled further down the plant spilling and vibratory feeds which usually cause dust particles to become airborne. Wider conveyor belts and additional skirting systems and belt scrapers were installed to reduce the spillage. The amount of car tires entering the plant was also reduced by rearranging the magnet setup to decrease load on metal sorters and allow an increase in the processing rates in the plant...|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Dyson {{had the idea}} of using {{cyclonic}} separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of <b>dust</b> thus reducing <b>suction.</b> The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology (qv. History of Dyson Ltd).|$|R
5000|$|In the {{practical}} design of primarily round structural process ductwork in the cement, lime and lead industries, the duct size involved ranges from 18 inches (45 cm) to 30 feet (10 m). The air temperature may vary from ambient to 1000 °F (515 °C). Process ductwork {{is subject to}} large loads due to <b>dust</b> buildup, fan <b>suction</b> pressure, wind, and earthquake forces. [...] 30 ft diameter process ductwork may cost $7,000 per ton. Failure to properly integrate design forces may lead to catastrophic duct collapse. Overdesign of ductwork is expensive.|$|R
40|$|Background: Silicosis is an {{occupational}} lung disease caused by inhaling particles of crystalline silica in a long time. The disease then results in inflammation and defects in lung tissue. Prosthesis construction is usually conducted in dental laboratory using a lot of materials containing crystalline silica, such as gypsum, ceramics, planting material, sandblast and others. Purpose: This research aims to determine levels of crystalline silica dust in the dental laboratory of Dental Health Technology Diploma Study Program, Vocational Faculty, Universitas Airlangga. Method: Three measurement points was determined, namely point 1, point 2 and point 3 in each dental laboratory space (I and II). <b>Suctioning</b> <b>dust</b> was performed at those points using Low Volume Dust Sampler (LVDS). Samples taken {{were divided into two}} groups, namely X and Y. Taking dust samples were carried out for 30 minutes. Elements of crystalline silica contained in the dust were quantitatively measured using XR Defractometry tool, while size and morphology of silica were measured using SEM EDX tool. Data obtained were statistically analyzed by paired t test. Result: The results showed significant differences in the levels of the total dust measured and crystalline silica in the form of quartz and cristobalite among those two dental laboratory spaces. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the levels of the total dust and silica quartz dust in the dental laboratory spaces I and II were greater than the Threshold Limit Value (TLV) determined...|$|R
