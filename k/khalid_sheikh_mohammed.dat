5|$|After {{the death}} of bin Laden, some {{officials}} from the Bush administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout. Mukasey said that the waterboarding of <b>Khalid</b> <b>Sheikh</b> <b>Mohammed</b> caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden's courier.|$|E
5|$|The hijackers {{stormed the}} aircraft's cockpit {{approximately}} 46 minutes after takeoff. The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. However, Ziad Jarrah, who had {{trained as a}} pilot, {{took control of the}} aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C. <b>Khalid</b> <b>Sheikh</b> <b>Mohammed</b> and Ramzi bin al-Shibh have claimed that the intended target was the Capitol Building.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from <b>Khalid</b> <b>Sheikh</b> <b>Mohammed,</b> who first {{presented}} it to Osama bin Laden in 1996.

5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, <b>Khalid</b> <b>Sheikh</b> <b>Mohammed,</b> Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. <b>Khalid</b> <b>Sheikh</b> <b>Mohammed</b> wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E
