40|$|The liftoff phase induces high {{acoustic}} loading over a {{broad frequency}} range for a launch vehicle. These external acoustic environments {{are used in}} the prediction of the internal vibration responses of the vehicle and components. Present liftoff vehicle acoustic environment prediction methods utilize stationary data from previously conducted hold-down tests to generate 1 / 3 octave band Sound Pressure Level (SPL) spectra. In an effort to update the accuracy and quality of liftoff acoustic loading predictions, non-stationary flight data from the Ares I-X were processed in PC-Signal in two flight phases: simulated hold-down and liftoff. In conjunction, the Prediction of Acoustic Vehicle Environments (PAVE) program was developed in MATLAB to allow for efficient predictions of sound pressure levels (SPLs) as a function of station number along the vehicle using semi-empirical methods. This consisted of generating the Dimensionless Spectrum Function (DSF) and Dimensionless Source Location (DSL) curves from the Ares I-X flight data. These are then used in the MATLAB program to generate the 1 / 3 octave band SPL spectra. Concluding results show major differences in SPLs between the <b>hold-down</b> <b>test</b> data and the processed Ares I-X flight data making the Ares I-X flight data more practical for future vehicle acoustic environment predictions...|$|E
