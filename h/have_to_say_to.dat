The paper asked [...] "What shall we tell civilized people? We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> them: 'Do not consider us as brothers anymore. We are mean and terrible people; we have killed those who hid at our place, who sought our protection'".|$|E

A previous investigation, the Widgery Tribunal, into the same event had been discredited. During {{the debate in the}} House of Commons, Trimble was one of few dissenting voices. He said [...] "I am sorry to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the Prime Minister that I think that the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) that this {{will be part of the}} healing process is likely to be misplaced. Opening old wounds like this is likely to do more harm than good. The basic facts of the situation are known and not open to dispute." [...] Reporting in 2010, The Saville Inquiry confirmed that all of the 14 killings and 13 woundings were unjustified.|$|E
