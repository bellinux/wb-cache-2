5|$|Concentrated <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> (fuming <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid)</b> forms acidic mists. Both {{the mist}} and the {{solution}} have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> can {{therefore}} be used to prepare salts called chlorides. <b>Hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> is a strong acid, since it is completely dissociated in water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> is {{prepared}} by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride {{can be generated}} in many ways, and thus several precursors to <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> exist. The large-scale production of <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> is almost always integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{corrosion}} behaviour of copper in 5 % (by weight) citric, sulphuric and <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acids</b> is studied. The efficiency of 2 -amino- 5 -mercapto- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole (AMT) as a corrosion inhibitor is {{compared with the}} use of benzotriazole (BTA). The experimental techniques were weight loss, polarization curves, polarization resistance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

5|$|Free <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> {{was first}} {{formally}} {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles. Other authors claim that pure <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated common salt and green vitriol, whereas others {{argue that there is}} no clear reference to the preparation of pure <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{industry}} demanding purity (food, pharmaceutical, drinking water), high-quality <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> is used {{to control}} the pH of process water streams.

5|$|In the 20th century, the Leblanc {{process was}} {{effectively}} {{replaced by the}} Solvay process without a <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> by-product. Since <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications, the commercial interest initiated other production methods, {{some of which are}} still used today. After the year 2000, <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> is mostly made by absorbing by-product hydrogen chloride from industrial organic compounds production.|$|E
50|$|Also nearby, {{immediately}} east of SeaWorld, is an unlined landfill.

No remediation efforts have occurred.|$|R
50|$|Tb4O7 {{reacts with}} atomic oxygen to produce TbO2, {{but a more}} {{convenient}} preparation of TbO2 is by disproportionation of Tb4O7. This is performed by refluxing with an excess of an equal mixture of concentrated acetic <b>acid</b> and <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acids</b> for 30 minutes, producing terbium(III) chloride and water.|$|R
50|$|Acids {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline. Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acids</b> also effect dehydration and condensation reactions. In biochemistry, many enzymes employ acid catalysis.|$|R
5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering {{oxidation-reduction}} reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{protective}} {{equipment such as}} latex gloves, protective eye goggles, and chemical-resistant {{clothing and}} shoes will minimize risks when handling <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid.</b> The United States Environmental Protection Agency rates and regulates <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> as a toxic substance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> as {{the binary}} (two-component) mixture of HCl and H2O has a constant-boiling {{azeotrope}} at 20.2% HCl and 108.6°C (227°F).

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. <b>Hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. <b>Hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct.
