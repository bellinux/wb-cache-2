500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. I knew {{that it was going to}} be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews. The series stars Lauren Vélez (Maria LaGuerta), David Zayas (Angel Batista) and Erik King (James Doakes), all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz.|$|E
2500|$|Geneticist Bryan Sykes and {{his team}} at Oxford University report that DNA {{analysis}} of presumed Yeti (or [...] "Abominable Snowman") samples {{may have come from}} a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. According to Sykes, [...] "I think this bear, which nobody has seen alive, may still be there and may have quite a lot of polar bear in it. It may be some sort of hybrid and if its behaviour is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> well be the source of the mystery and the source of the legend." ...|$|E
50|$|Stephanie Rothman {{admitted}} the film's commercial reception was disappointing. She thought {{the problem may}} have been the movie:Fell between two stools. It's not a traditional horror film nor a hard-core exploitation movie. In some places it was booked into art theatres. In others it had one week saturation release in drive ins and hard top theatres. There was no consistent distribution pattern for it because people responded differently to it and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be part of the problem. Also it was an independent producer. There were a lot of other competing vampire movies at the time with star names... But the film has not been forgotten. It keeps popping up at festivals and retrospectives which is interesting because it did not draw attention to itself upon how well it did at the box office.|$|E

5000|$|An {{interview}} with Jung {{on the design}} and illustration of the 1974 poster The Man with the Golden Gun elaborated on his creative process: [...] "The actual painting is done on 20x30 double-weight illustration board, half of a standard 30x40 board. I used acrylics, I can use it transparently or opaquely; it dries quickly and is permanent and can be reworked. I'd use airbrushing for large areas of background, color pencils, and inks and dyes and tempera and whatever else <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> give me the desired result. Sandpaper. Brillo. A single-edge razor blade. Whatever works." [...] Jung often used family members as models. For the Star Wars poster design, with Frank Frazetta in mind as his final illustrator, Jung posed his son Jeff as Luke Skywalker and his wife Kay as Princess Leia. After discussions with Don Smolen of Smolen, Smith and Connolly, {{it was decided that}} Jung would execute the illustration.|$|E
5000|$|John Simmons, {{son of a}} National Security Agency (NSA) employee, {{supposedly}} grew up {{amid the}} spy community in Washington, D.C. during the Cold War. It was life as normal, {{as far as he}} knew, to live at remote electronic listening posts, to [...] "pop in and out of Washington every once in a while," [...] to attend a different school and make new friends every two years. That didn't bother him at all. [...] "It was fun, and it helped me prepare for this wacky life style." [...] He attended the University of North Carolina and then spent a year abroad at the University of Kent in Canterbury. He studied theatre and history ("not theatre history", he emphasizes), then ended up dropping the theatre and graduating in history and journalism. [...] "I like history more than anything. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be why I make fun of the news. The kind of stupidity that's going on now has just been repeated through the centuries; it's nothing new." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding Truman's {{views on}} red scares in the United States, Lowenthal commented: [...] When {{he came back}} from service in the Army in the First World War, he was disgusted with the {{hysteria}} that prevailed in some quarters in 1919 and 1920, and I think he never forgot that -- that disgust that he had acquired. You may remember -- I don't mean to say that Mr. Truman mentioned this specifically -- there was a magazine published by a man named Guy Empey.... A good many people were greatly excited and there was a good deal of [...] "treat them rough stuff" [...] during World War I and {{for a year or two}} or three afterward. I think that burned into Mr. Truman, who had been engaged in active fighting in France during the war, that such things should go on...You know, there was during World War I bitterness against the Socialists and against the IWW, not against, to any extent, the Bolsheviks; that came later. You read about that period. They threw Victor Berger, the Socialist, out of the Congress. Mr. Truman was disgusted with such excitement, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been part of his make-up from childhood onward, but I'm only guessing.|$|E

5000|$|John and I wrote 'She's Leaving Home' together. It was my inspiration. We'd seen a {{story in}} the {{newspaper}} about a young girl who'd left home and not been found, {{there were a lot of}} those at the time, and that was enough to give us a story line. So I started to get the lyrics: she slips out and leaves a note and then the parents wake up ... It was rather poignant. I like it as a song, and when I showed it to John, he added the long sustained notes, and one of the nice things about the structure of the song is that it stays on those chords endlessly. Before that period in our song-writing we would have changed chords but it stays on the C chord. It really holds you. It's a really nice little trick and I think it worked very well.While I was showing that to John, he was doing the Greek chorus, the parents' view: 'We gave her most of our lives, we gave her everything money could buy.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been in the runaway story, it might have been a quote from the parents. Then there's the famous little line about a man from the motor trade; people have since said that was Terry Doran, who was a friend who worked in a car showroom, but it was just fiction, like the sea captain in [...] "Yellow Submarine", they weren't real people.|$|E

Dexter is a clever sociopathwho {{believes}} himself unlovable and is convinced he has no human feelings; however, he's an excellent actor whose agreeable, socially conventional demeanor belies the emptiness and rage inside.

40|$|The {{discordant}} {{conjunction of}} irreconcilable elements which {{the title of}} this paper represents is intended to convey something of the strange nature {{of the relationship between the}} discipline of group analysis and the institutions which offer an academic accreditation today.
