5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what he is}} doing and that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
25|$|If a {{game has}} an {{information}} set {{with more than}} one member that game is said to have imperfect information. A game with perfect information is such that at any stage of the game, every player <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what has taken place earlier in the game; i.e. every information set is a singleton set. Any game without perfect information has imperfect information.|$|E

Choreography is a collaborative effort focused on exchange of messages.

25|$|BAE Systems has {{completed}} development of its Striker II Helmet-Mounted Display that {{builds on the}} capabilities of the original Striker Helmet-Mounted Display, which is already in service on the Typhoon. Striker II features a new display with more colour and can transition between day and night seamlessly eliminating the need for separate night vision googles. In addition, the helmet can monitor the pilot’s exact head position so it always <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what information to display. The system is compatible with ANR, a 3-D audio threats system and 3-D communications; these are available as customer options.|$|E

25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what happened that day but will never tell.|$|E

However, the resolution of a camera can be much higher than the human visual system, and the optics much better, rendering photographic evidence irrelevant to the issue of whether it is visible to the naked eye.|$|E

25|$|A {{comparison}} with the earlier article shows that {{the reconstruction of the}} vicariate is not an organic continuation of the former condition but that an entirely new organization has been created. There is in this change an evident effort to organize the official bodies as servants of the public and to do this {{on the basis of the}} modern method of carrying on business, as it is found everywhere in countries that lead in civilization and in well-organized central boards of authorities. Formerly the administration was a cumbrous one, impeded by traditional obstacles; it may perhaps be said to have regarded itself as the primary object and the public which it should serve as of subordinate consideration. This state of things is now past, thanks to the energy of the reigning pope, which overcame all obstacles. Now, anyone who has business with the vicariate <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> to which department, which official, he must go in order to have the matter in question speedily settled. It is to be expected that in the course of time the third department owing to the test of practical working may undergo slight changes, as it is not probable that all ordinances will prove capable of permanent execution. The characteristics of the new organization are division of work and rigid separation of the judiciary from the executive administration, together with an ample supply of officials for the different departments. In the reorganization customs that had become historical were taken into consideration only insofar as they could be combined without difficulty with modern methods of business.|$|E
25|$|For this reason, {{many from}} this {{municipality}} {{and others from}} the Sierra Gorda, have migrated out to cities in Mexico and to the United States in order to work. The municipality estimates that about 35% of its population has migrated abroad, equaling about 8 thousand people. Others suggest the numbers are even higher, with an estimate of four people in the United States for each family here. No one <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how many {{from the state of}} Querétaro have gone to the U.S. to work or the amount which is sent back in remittances each year. However, it is estimated that the Sierra Gorda region receives between 50,000 and 100,000 USD per day or 18.2 million dollars each year. This is larger than the municipal budget of Pinal de Amoles. These remittances have come to overshadow earnings made locally from small shops, livestock and agriculture. In Pinal de Amoles and other areas of the Sierra Gorda, the dollar {{has become part of the}} economy, especially around Christmas when many come back to visit families for the holiday season. This has led to many businesses accepting the dollar as a medium of exchange in many businesses including restaurants and bars. Many families now use it as a regional currency. However, remittance money sent back can vary depending on economic and political factors. As of January 2011, the amount sent back to the Sierra Gorda fell about forty percent. Officials blame the security situation on the US-Mexican border, with many younger people in the US not visiting during the Christmas season.|$|E

500|$|Lydia first {{arriving}} on-screen {{was first}} shown {{as different from}} other characters and it was stated from her inception that she was passionate about music and enjoyed getting people into the music scene. Speaking of her character, Kelly stated [...] "She's very down to earth. She <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what she wants, where she wants to go, {{and how to get}} there! She's also very level-headed." [...] From the characters inception, she was shown to be an opinionated, proud young student who wasn't afraid of her homosexuality and a person who could make friends very easily, as well as enemies.|$|E

[...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|E

500|$|Scott {{is known}} for his skill at filming with {{multiple}} camera set-ups and Body of Lies used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, [...] "Actors like multiple cameras because they’re always on-camera, so they’re always in character and not wasting time off-camera." [...] One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs. Richard Cronn, the gaffer, attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, [...] "Ridley will stand at the monitors and tell you what's he's looking for – he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how he will cut it." ...|$|E

An Indian version of Guinness Book of World Records, the show premiered on 18 March to an audience measurement of 3.3 rating points, which made it occupy the 7th position on the chart of celebrity-driven reality shows on Hindi entertainment channels. In a four-star review for Hindustan Times, critic Rachana Dubey wrote, [...] "Preity is a riot. She's vivacious and <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> when she needs to be serious and when she can crack jokes." [...] Later that year, Zinta started hosting the celebrity-based chat show Up Close & Personal with PZ, shot at her own penthouse in Mumbai and broadcast on the newly launched channel UTV Stars. The first episode aired on 3 September. In 2015, Zinta featured as a talent judge for the seventh season of the dance reality show Nach Baliye.|$|E
500|$|In January 1947 Olivier {{began working}} on his second film as a director, Hamlet (1948), in which he also took the lead role. The {{original}} play was heavily cut {{to focus on the}} relationships, rather than the political intrigue. The film became a critical and commercial success in Britain and abroad, although Lejeune, in The Observer, considered it [...] "less effective than [...] stage work.... He speaks the lines nobly, and with the caress of one who loves them, but he nullifies his own thesis by never, for a moment, leaving the impression of a man who cannot make up his own mind; here, you feel rather, is an actor-producer-director who, in every circumstance, <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what he wants, and gets it". Campbell Dixon, the critic for The Daily Telegraph thought the film [...] "brilliant... one of the masterpieces of the stage has been made into one of the greatest of films." [...] Hamlet became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Olivier won the Award for Best Actor.|$|E
