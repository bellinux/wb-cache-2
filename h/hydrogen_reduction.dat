25|$|The {{dominant}} {{application of}} tungsten fluoride is in semiconductor industry, {{where it is}} widely used for depositing tungsten metal in a chemical vapor deposition process. The expansion of the industry in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the increase of WF6 consumption, which remains at around 200 tonnes per year worldwide. Tungsten metal is attractive because of its relatively high thermal and chemical stability, as well as low resistivity (5.6 µΩ·cm) and electromigration. WF6 is favored over related compounds, such as WCl6 or WBr6, because of its higher vapor pressure resulting in higher deposition rates. Since 1967, two WF6 deposition routes have been developed and employed, thermal decomposition and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reduction.</b> The required WF6 gas purity is rather high and varies between 99.98% and 99.9995% depending on the application.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>reduction</b> {{of lunar}} {{regolith}} {{has been proposed}} as a viable technology for oxygen production on the moon. Hydrogen reduces FeO present in the lunar regolith to form metallic iron and water. The water may be electrolyzed to recycle the hydrogen and produce oxygen. Depending upon the regolith composition, FeO may be bound to TiO 2 as ilmenite {{or it may be}} dispersed in glassy substrates. Some testing of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reduction</b> has been conducted with Apollo-returned lunar regolith samples. However, due to the restricted amount of lunar material available for testing, detailed understanding and modeling of the reduction process in regolith have not yet been developed. As a step in this direction, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reduction</b> studies have been carried out in more detail with lunar regolith simulants such as JSC- 1 A by NASA and other organizations. While JSC- 1 A has some similarities with lunar regolith, it does not duplicate the wide variety of regolith types on the moon, e. g., it contains almost no ilmenite.

The results showed that nanostructured beta-Mo 2 C can be formed on the activated carbon by carbothermal <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reduction</b> above 700 degreesC. The particle sizes of beta-Mo 2 C increase with increasing reaction temperatures and Mo loading. The bimetallic CoMo carbide can be synthesized by the carbothermal <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reduction</b> even around 600 degreesC. The bimetallic CoMo carbide is from carbothermal <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reduction</b> of CoMoO 4 precursor and is easily formed when the Co/Mo molar ratio is 1. 0.

The addition of a second metal such as Co and Ni, decreases the formation temperature of carbide because the second metal promotes formation of CHx species from reactive carbon atoms or groups on carbon material and hydrogen, which further carburizes oxide precursors.

40|$|At present, {{the use of}} {{hydrogen}} and oxygen gases is necessary to achieve a reasonable power density in fuel-cell systems. However, the overall energy density of a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell system is low in comparison with many present, or alternate, power systems, and the associated costs are high. Total energy density can be improved with the integration of a fuel reformation process, but {{at the cost of}} power density. In this paper, an alternative hydrogen peroxide/direct methanol fuel-cell system that holds potential for an increase in energy density is examined. The limiting factor in the oxidation of methanol, either through an integrated reformation process to produce hydrogen gas, or directly through increased catalyst loading, is power density. The limiting factor in <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>reduction</b> is also power density, due to the complexity of the reduction process, where the preferred reduction product is water, and not the simultaneous decomposition products of oxygen and water. However, in both methanol oxidation and <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>reduction,</b> energy density is not sacrificed to a large extent, and the resulting system has utility in the future as a viable power plant due to advances in both catalysis of direct methanol oxidation, and direct <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>reduction.</b> Fuel cell <b>Hydrogen</b> peroxide Energy density Portable power Direct methanol Bioelectrocatalysis...|$|R
