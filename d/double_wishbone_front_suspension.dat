5|$|While the C9 {{project was}} well advanced, PSA {{already had a}} crowded lineup in the large vehicle segment, {{including}} the legendary CitroÃ«n CX, the slow-selling Peugeot 604 and the newly launched Peugeot 505. But with so much having already been invested in the project, PSA decided to press ahead and complete the development of C9, albeit with modifications to allow the use of shared parts with other PSA models. The Simca <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> gave way to MacPherson struts adopted from the Peugeot 505 and 604, and the rear axle was replaced {{with that of the}} 505, much narrower than the one originally planned, as it was designed with respect to the 505 body width. The C9 front end was extended to accommodate the optional PRV engine: now that the model belonged to PSA, using the PRV presented no problems.|$|E
25|$|Project Blueprint saw {{the chassis}} pick-up points, wheelbase, track and driving {{position}} become common across both manufacturers. The Holdens were now {{required to use}} <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> {{similar to that of}} the Falcon, rather than the MacPherson struts used previously. The aerodynamic packages were comprehensively tested and revised and differences in the porting of each of the manufacturers' engines were also removed. The performance of the new Ford BA Falcon and Holden VY and VZ Commodores was fairly even for the next four years, with Ford winning the championship in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and Holden winning in 2006. Reverse-grid races were used at certain events in 2006 before unpopularity with the drivers, teams and fans saw them abolished halfway through the season.|$|E
2500|$|The Debonair {{was largely}} {{the result of}} former General Motors {{designer}} Hans S. Bretzner, while the result was largely influenced by the 1961 Lincoln Continental designed by Elwood Engel, {{as evidenced by the}} slab-sided body panels, squared wheel wells, extended protrusions {{at the front of the}} vehicle, wraparound turnsignals in the front, and tapered fins at the rear, with a rear tail light cluster, exhibiting a [...] "Continental-esque" [...] appearance. It used a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> with leaf springs and a differential for the rear axle for the entire generation.|$|E
50|$|In March 1956 the AMSH-1 was released. This {{model was}} nearly {{identical}} to the AISH-5 except for the <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> which provided improved ride quality.|$|R

2500|$|Although the Chevette was {{essentially}} a rebranded Opel Kadett C with revised front-end (detailed below), it used the 1,256cc overhead valve (OHV) engine from the Viva HC instead of the Kadett's 1,196 cc engines, which were produced by Opel. The Kadett's <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> rear-wheel drive and rear suspension with Panhard rod, torque tube and coil sprung live axle were carried over unaltered. Inside, the two cars differed {{only in terms of}} their dashboard and switchgear: the Chevette stuck to the British and Japanese right-hand drive tradition of having the indicator switch on the right-hand side of the steering column, while the Kadett had the mainland European left-hand drive custom of the flasher stalk being on the left. [...] The Chevette also had a much more angular instrument binnacle, although the instruments themselves were from the Kadett (though with imperial rather than metric scales).|$|E
2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod with coil springs and stabilizer bar. The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses power-assisted four-piston front and two-piston rear ventilated disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to control wheels that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a locking differential without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal locking differential setups.|$|E

5000|$|The Ford LTD Crown Victoria {{uses the}} rear-wheel drive, Ford Panther {{platform}} architecture. As {{part of a}} major downsizing over the 1973-1978 LTD Brougham/Landau, the LTD Crown Victoria shed 18 inches of length and nearly 1000 pounds of curb weight. Although much smaller than its predecessor, the LTD Crown Victoria would carry over the basic suspension design of its predecessor, with a live rear axle <b>suspension</b> and <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> Brakes were of a vented disc/rear drum configuration.|$|R
25|$|Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> {{and rear}} <b>suspension</b> systems. Ferrari {{improved}} traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa drivetrain {{was also an}} evolution of the BB 512i. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the BB 512i had four-valve cylinder heads that were finished in red.|$|R
50|$|The usual Daimler large {{cruciform}} chassis had a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> with laminated torsion bars, telescopic dampers, and an anti-roll bar, {{while the}} rear suspension used leaf springs with telescopic dampers.|$|E

50|$|Haynes Roadster is a {{follow-up}} to the Locost design described in a book by Ron Champion. Locost uses Ford Escort Mark II as a donor, but as these have become increasingly rare, a design based on a more affordable Ford Sierra has been proposed. In contrast to Locost, which used Escort's solid axle at the rear, Haynes Roadster has independent, <b>double</b> <b>wishbone,</b> <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> type <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> using a pushrod/rocker {{system to}} connect the chassis directly to the upright, linking the steering to the spring movement, and the related impact on racecar handling dynamics. The system {{has been used in}} the last 15 years in open wheel racing but yet no scientific analysis was done. Up to now its behaviour was analyzed using extensive testing. In this work this particular suspension design is analyzed using an analytical steady-state vehicle model, which includes previously calculated suspension derivatives and a full vehicle Multibody System (MBS) model to validate the theoretical approach. The final results are the suspension design guidelines...|$|R

2500|$|The 156 uses a {{platform}} {{derived from the}} Alfa Romeo 155, which in turn {{was derived from the}} Fiat Group's [...] "Tipo" [...] platform. However it is sufficiently different from the original [...] "Tipo" [...] one {{to be seen as a}} new platform. The 156 is a highly developed front-wheel drive car; (the Cross/Sportwagon Q4 offered four-wheel drive in left-hand drive markets) with a <b>double</b> high <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and Camuffo type rear suspension, which consists of a telescopic vertical strut with coaxial spring and two transverse links of different lengths and a longitudinal strut.

40|$|A {{kinematic}} {{design of}} a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> type <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> mechanism {{was used to determine}} the optimal hardpoint positions while considering controllability and stability performances of a vehicle simultaneously. Various performance parameters were classified into two objective functions related to controllability and stability performances. A distance function method was implemented with multi-objective optimization. Multi-objective optimization was performed by using a genetic algorithm. When the multi-objective optimization consisted of the performance parameters related to only controllability or stability performances, variations of each performance parameter were minimized by emphasizing the importance of each performance parameter. It was concluded that multi-objective optimization using the distance function method is very effective for obtaining the optimal hardpoint positions of a suspension mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|Its coil and <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> {{independent}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> was {{a departure}} from the leaf sprung live axle <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> used on most previous models but was similar to the independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> used on the 1947 Toyopet SA. The live axle rear suspension was similar to that used on most of the previous models (unlike the trailing arm rear suspension used on the SA). Taxi versions were produced and beginning in March 1959 commercial versions of the vehicle were also available, as an estate wagon and a three- or six-seater coupe utility. These took over the [...] "Toyopet Masterline" [...] name in the Japanese domestic market, but usually received [...] "Crown" [...] badges in the export. The [...] "Crown" [...] name was previously in use by the Imperial limousine manufactured by Chrysler in the early 1950s.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, VehicleSim multi-body {{software}} {{is used to}} extend and modify an existing motorcycle model by including different non-conventional suspension systems. Girder and Hossack <b>double</b> <b>wishbones</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> systems are designed, implemented and tested. Using a synthesis of mechanism methodology, they are designed with different kinematic configurations that allow different behaviours of the motorcycle front end. By means of CAD tools and finite element analysis, realistic three dimensional models of the suspension systems designs are developed. The dynamical properties of the mechanical assemblies are obtained from the CAD models and used to build a realistic mathematical model of a sport motorcycle fitted with theses alternative suspension systems. Dynamical and stability analyses of the alternative <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> systems are performed. For the different kinematic configurations, anti-dive properties and variation of the motorcycle's handling geometric parameters are studied by non-linear dynamical simulations. Stability analyses are performed {{by means of the}} motorcycle linear models eigenvalues. Passive interconnection of <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> systems of a sport motorcycle is also investigated. The effects of an interconnected suspensions system on the motorcycle in-plane motions are studied by means of reduced order linear models. The baseline model is modified to include passive interconnection forces between the <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> systems. The possible improvement introduced by an interconnected suspensions system in terms of suspension accuracy is investigated through non-linear simulations with delayed step tyres inputs. Appropriate values of the interconnection passive components for different possible mechanical implementation are found by means of optimization processes. Linear stability analyses are performed for each of the different optimal interconnected configurations. Nonlinear frequency analyses of the motorcycle wheels and chassis responses are also performed considering the delay between the front and rear tyre inputs. Non-linear simulations with variable frequency sinusoidal road inputs are run for this purpose. Finally, modal analyses of the motorcycle model are carried out for variable interconnection parameters {{in order to understand the}} effect of the interconnected suspensions system on the motorcycle's motion...|$|R

5000|$|Introduced in April 1955, [...] "SF" [...] {{stood for}} [...] "Suzuki Four-wheel car". Work {{had begun in}} Jamuary 1954, with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive and rear-engined design also {{considered}}. The first Suzuki was closely based on the Lloyd LP400, chosen after Suzuki also having considered the CitroÃ«n 2CV and Renault 4CV. The Suzulight SF shared the Lloyd's transversely mounted, front-wheel drive layout and the two-cylinder, two-stroke engine was a narrow-bored copy of the Lloyd's, using the same 66.0 mm stroke. It had drum brakes all around, was 2990 mm long, 1295 mm wide and 1400 mm tall, with a 2000 mm wheelbase and a 1050 mm front and rear wheel track. Because of the smaller bore and resulting [...] engine, it met the Japanese Keijidosha ("light car") legislation. Its design was by the company's founder Michio Suzuki. When introduced, the SF also had <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> coil-sprung <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and rear, with rack-and-pinion steering, features which were far ahead of their time. Just like the Lloyd which inspired it, the Suzulight featured a chassis consisting of a central tube with the suspension attached to {{each end of the}} tube.|$|R

50|$|Today, the TD2000 {{roadster}} {{consists of}} 2 models, a Silverstone {{comes with a}} 5-speed manual shift and Gatsby with a 4-speed automatic gear. It sits on a steel chassis and is equipped with an independent <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> a leaf-spring back axle and all-round disc brakes, delivering better handling and smoother ride than the original. Many local OEM engineers were contracted to study and build a complete suspension system with softer absorbers and 3-leaf springs, colder air-conditioning unit, and integrate a double-core radiator into the cooling system.|$|E
50|$|Like Peugeot's earlier 205 T16, the mid-engine Lancia Delta S4 was a Delta in {{name and}} body styling only (for {{marketing}} purposes), and shared virtually nothing {{in terms of}} construction with the production front-engine Delta. The chassis was a tubular space frame construction much like the 037. It featured long travel <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and rear, with a single large coil over at the front and separate spring and twin shock absorber at the rear. The bodywork was made of a carbon fibre composite with front and rear bodywork fully detachable for fast replacement due to accident damage, allowing ease of access during on-event servicing. The bodywork featured several aerodynamic aids including bonnet opening behind the front-mounted water radiator with Gurney flap, front splitter and winglets moulded into the front bumper panel, flexible front skirt, and rear deck lid wing that featured both a full aerofoil wind section twinned with a deflection spoiler. The door construction style was brought from the 037 with a hollow shell all-Kevlar construction that had no inner door skin, no door handle or window winder. The door was opened with a small loop and the windows were fixed perspex with small sliding panels to allow some ventilation and passing of time cards and suchlike.|$|R
5000|$|The {{width of}} the {{vehicles}} was originally set at 1300 mm, but to better cope with {{the center of gravity}} compared to the Jeep and Schwimenwagen it was enhanced to 1500 mm. It had a narrow steel cruciform ladder frame chassis, and a 2000 mm wheelbase. The rear axle was a solid differential, with a semi-elliptical leaf spring <b>suspension,</b> the <b>front</b> wheels used coil springs and a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> to enhance off road agility. The transmission had three forward speeds and one reverse gear that powered the rear wheels. A transfer case was used to temporarily engage the front wheels when necessary. Drum brakes were used on the rear wheels only, and it had a 48 L gas tank with 4 L for reserve, achieving [...] Its top speed on paved roads was 75 km/h, with a driving range of 450 km. To keep production and maintenance simple, universal joints were used to engage the front wheels. During development, a horizontally opposed engine had been considered due to the harsh, cold conditions of Manchuria where the car would be deployed initially. The vehicle needed to be durable and easy to maintain, and a flat engine had advantages in the torque production needed to operate all four wheels. Air cooling also solved the problem of available cooling water and engine ruggedness. Kurogane also manufactured motorcycles, and keeping the engine as air-cooled helped with parts availability. The engine used for production was a Kurogane V1-AF motorcycle engine, with a bank angle of 45 Â°, a V-type 2-cylinder OHV forced air-cooled engine with an engine displacement of 1.3 - 1.4 L developing [...] @ 3,300rpm. It was a simple design, while the British made Sunbeam Motorcycle may have been used in reference to its development. The Japan Internal Combustion Engine Company was building three-wheeler trucks and motorcycles, using a single-cylinder engine of their [...] "JACâ brand âZaimasu" [...] model motorcycle (zaimasu means âI will be thereâ) as the base engine used to develop the V2 engine. The front grille had a small hole to insert a handcrank to manually start the engine should the starter or battery fail.|$|R
40|$|To {{close the}} gap between the {{automotive}} industry and newly graduated engineers the graduates need to have a better understanding for how their design affects the end result. This thesis focuses on producing 3 D printed suspension scale models with correct kinematics to help students better understand how different types of suspensions behave. The suspension types chosen for the models are MacPherson and <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspensions</b> and trailing arm multi link suspension and a live axle for the rear. These models were designed in Catia V 5 and then 3 D printed in a scale of 1 : 5 and assembled together with some off-the-shelf components such as coilover dampers and ball joints. The models for the MacPherson and the trailing arm are based on Chalmers suspension setups while the live axle is based on modified values of the trailing arm. The <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> however is primarily based on given requirements and guidelines from the Chalmers suspension setup. The two <b>front</b> <b>suspensions</b> feature functioning steering and the MacPherson one also has a differential to illustrate the function of having a propulsion system. These suspensions are mounted on two vehicle chassis where the <b>front</b> <b>suspensions</b> can be swapped so all the combinations can be shown. The curves for camber gain and bump steer are plotted for the MacPherson and <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspensions. The 3 D printed models have similar kinematics to the original models. Because of the limited accuracy of 3 D printing there is some play in the suspension components reducing the similarity between the curves and the real behavior when manipulating the suspensions by hand...|$|R
