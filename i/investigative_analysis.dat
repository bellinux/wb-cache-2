According to the FBI, Ivins showed a fascination with codes and also had an interest in secrets and hidden messages, and was familiar with biochemical codons.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the dynamic}} of violent fantasy in lust murders is understood, an individual's {{violence}} fantasy alone {{is not enough to}} determine if an individual has or has not engaged in lust murder.

40|$|An {{assessment}} methodology is developed to guide quantitative predictions of adverse physical environments {{and the subsequent}} effects on the Ares- 1 crew launch vehicle associated {{with the loss of}} containment of cryogenic liquid propellants from the upper stage during ascent. Development of the methodology is led by a team at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) with guidance and support from a number of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) personnel. The methodology is based on the current Ares- 1 design and feasible accident scenarios. These scenarios address containment failure from debris impact or structural response to pressure or blast loading from an external source. Once containment is breached, the envisioned {{assessment methodology}} includes predictions for the sequence of physical processes stemming from cryogenic tank failure.

50|$|Criminal {{profiling}} is {{a process}} now known in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as criminal <b>investigative</b> <b>analysis.</b> Profilers, or criminal investigative analysts, are trained and experienced law enforcement officers who study every behavioral aspect and detail of an unsolved violent crime scene in which {{a certain amount of}} psychopathology has been left at the scene. The characteristics of a good profiler are discussed. Five behavioral characteristics that can be gleaned from the crime scene are described: 1) amount of planning that went into the crime, 2) degree of control used by the offender, 3) escalation of emotion at the scene, 4) risk level of both the offender and victim, and 5) appearance of the crime scene (disorganized versus organized). The process of interpreting the behavior observed at a crime scene is briefly discussed.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{asynchronous}} collaborative analysis, handoff {{of partial}} findings is challenging because externalizations produced by analysts may not adequately communicate their investigative process. To address this challenge, we developed techniques to automatically capture and help encode tacit {{aspects of the}} investigative process based on an analyst’s interactions, and streamline explicit authoring of handoff annotations. We designed our techniques to mediate awareness of analysis coverage, support explicit communication of progress and uncertainty with annotation, and implicit communication through playback of investigation histories. To evaluate our techniques, we developed an interactive visual analysis system, KTGraph, that supports an asynchronous <b>investigative</b> document <b>analysis</b> task. We conducted a two-phase user study to characterize a set of handoff strategies and to compare investigative performance with and without our techniques. The results suggest that our techniques promote the use of more effective handoff strategies, help increase an awareness of prior investigative process and insights, as well as improve final investigative outcomes...|$|R
