Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor,</b> the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E
5|$|Kerst {{designed}} an aqueous <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor</b> {{in which}} enriched uranium {{in the form}} of soluble uranium sulfate, was dissolved in water, and surrounded by a beryllium oxide neutron reflector. It was the first reactor to employ enriched uranium as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.|$|E

5|$|The Water Boiler was an aqueous <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor,</b> a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is {{dissolved}} in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of uranium nitrate because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the Water Boiler did take up an inordinate amount of T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the Water Boiler.|$|E
5|$|The French {{scientists}} {{made good}} {{progress on the}} design of an aqueous <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor,</b> but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British Tube Alloys project, that of building an atomic bomb, and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed plutonium, but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility. The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. It made sense to pool resources, and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as Henry D. Smyth, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims. These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using deuterium as a neutron moderator. There were also two patent applications in conjunction with Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather on the production and use of plutonium. George Thomson, the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
25|$|The fusion {{cross section}} {{calculations}} were finished by September 1943, and the Purdue group {{moved to the}} Los Alamos Laboratory, where most of them, including Holloway, worked on the Water Boiler, an aqueous <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor</b> that was intended {{for use as a}} laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials. The Water Boiler group was headed by Donald W. Kerst from the University of Illinois, and the group designed and built the Water Boiler, which achieved its criticality in May 1944 under the control of Enrico Fermi, after one final addition of uranium enriched to 14% uranium 235. It was world third reactor but the first reactor to use enriched uranium as a fuel, using most of the world's supply at the time, and the first to use liquid nuclear fuel in the form of soluble uranium sulfate dissolved in water.|$|E

500|$|Weinberg {{replaced}} Wigner as Director of Research at ORNL in 1948, {{and became}} {{director of the}} laboratory in 1955. [...] Under his direction it worked on the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program, and pioneered many innovative reactor designs, including the pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), which have since become the dominant reactor types in commercial nuclear power plants, and Aqueous <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactor</b> designs.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg had the Materials Testing Reactor {{converted}} into a mock-up of a real reactor called the Low Intensity Test Reactor (LITR) or [...] "Poor Man's Pile". Experiments at the LITR led {{to the design of}} both pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), which have since become the dominant reactor types in commercial nuclear power plants. Weinberg was attracted to the simplicity and self-controlling features of nuclear reactors that used fluid fuels, such as Harold Urey and Eugene Wigner's proposed Aqueous <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactor.</b> Therefore, to support the Nuclear Aircraft project in the late 1940s, Weinberg asked ORNL's reactor engineers to design a reactor using liquid instead of solid fuel.|$|E
500|$|This <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactor</b> Experiment (HRE) was affectionately dubbed [...] "Alvin's 3P reactor" [...] {{because it}} {{required}} a pot, a pipe, and a pump. The HRE went into operation in 1950 and, at the criticality party, Weinberg brought the appropriate spirits: [...] "When piles go critical in Chicago, we celebrate with wine. When piles go critical in Tennessee, we celebrate with Jack Daniel's." [...] The HRE operated for 105 days {{before it was}} closed down. Despite its leaks and corrosion, valuable information was gained from its operation and it proved a simple and safe reactor to control. During the time the HRE was online, Senators John F. Kennedy and Albert Gore, Sr. visited ORNL and were hosted by Weinberg.|$|E

500|$|From 1942 to 1943, Schreiber was a {{researcher}} with the Purdue Research Foundation. He participated in early {{work for the}} Manhattan Project there using the university's cyclotron. In 1943, he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory, and moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico {{with his wife and}} 16-month-old daughter. At Los Alamos, he worked on the Water Boiler, an aqueous <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor.</b> The Water Boiler group was headed by Donald W. Kerst from the University of Illinois, and consisted mainly of people from Purdue who had been working on calculations for Edward Teller's thermonuclear [...] "Super" [...] bomb. The group designed and built the Water Boiler, which commenced operation in May 1944. It was intended as a laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials. It was the first reactor to use enriched uranium as a fuel, and the first to use liquid fuel in the form of soluble uranium sulfate dissolved in water.|$|E
500|$|In early 1943, Christy joined Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, {{where he}} became an American citizen in 1943 or 1944. Hans Bethe, the head of T (Theoretical) Division, {{detailed}} his physicists {{to assist with the}} projects at the laboratory. With his knowledge of reactors, Christy's assignment was to help Donald W. Kerst's Water Boiler [...] group.

500|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{investigated}} multiple {{avenues of}} reactor development. One was a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor,</b> {{in which a}} uranium compound was dissolved in heavy water to form a slurry, or a [...] "mayonnaise" [...] as the Montreal team called it. This offered various advantages for cooling, control {{and the ability to}} draw off plutonium that was produced. Paneth, Goldschmidt and others experimented with methods of preparing such a uranium compound, but none could be found with the required density. They considered using enriched uranium, but it was unavailable. Attention then turned to a heterogeneous reactor, in which a lattice of uranium metal rods were immersed in heavy water. While much less heavy water would be required, there was a danger that the water would decompose into deuterium and oxygen—a potentially explosive combination. There was great interest in breeder reactors, which could breed plutonium from uranium or uranium-233 from thorium, as it was believed that uranium was scarce. A process was devised for separating the uranium from thorium.|$|E
50|$|Uranium sulfate (U(SO4)2) is a {{water-soluble}} salt of uranium. It is a {{very toxic}} compound. Uranium sulfate minerals commonly are widespread around uranium bearing mine sites, where they usually form during the evaporation of acid sulfate-rich mine tailings which have been leached by oxygen-bearing waters. Uranium sulfate is a transitional compound {{in the production of}} Uranium hexafluoride. It was also used to fuel aqueous <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{studies of}} <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> took place toward {{the close of}} World War II. It pained chemists to see {{precisely}} fabricated solid-fuel elements of heterogeneous reactors eventually dissolved in acids to remove fission products—the [...] "ashes" [...] of a nuclear reaction. Chemical engineers hoped to design liquid-fuel reactors that would dispense with the costly destruction and processing of solid fuel elements. The formation of gas bubbles in liquid fuels and the corrosive attack on materials (in uranyl sulfate base solutions), however, presented daunting design and materials challenges.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{new model}} for Flameless Combustion (FC) {{based on the}} {{tabulation}} of diluted <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> (DHR) is presented. This model is developed within the Large Eddy Simulations (LES) approach because LES has a good potential for correctly predicting the ternary mixing of FC. In DHR, a ternary mixture of fuel, air and burnt gases at equilibrium is considered as an initial condition for the reactor calculations. The auto-ignition of this mixture is then tabulated {{as a function of}} the input parameters which are mixture fraction, fresh gases temperature, dilution fraction, progress variable and enthalpy loss. The enthalpy loss is introduced by decreasing the temperature of the diluting burnt gases. The DHR model is first evaluated over the partially premixed Sandia Flame D. Correct results are obtained for this flame, although CO is overestimated by the model. This discrepancy is attributed to the usage of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> which impedes to account for the influence of scalar dissipation. Secondly, the flameless configuration of Verissimo et al., characterized by a strong enthalpy loss due to wall heat losses, is used to assess the performance of the model. Combustion results are found in correct agreement for temperature and major species. The largest discrepancies are found for CO again, although the axial shape for this species is correctly predicted...|$|R

5000|$|Aqueous <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> were {{sometimes}} called [...] "water boilers" [...] (not {{to be confused}} with boiling water reactors), as the water inside seems to boil, but in fact this bubbling is due to the production of hydrogen and oxygen as radiation and fission particles dissociate the water into its constituent gases, a process called radiolysis. AHRs were widely used as research reactors as they are self-controlling, have very high neutron fluxes, and were easy to manage. As of April 2006, only five AHRs were operating according to the Research Reactor database.|$|R

The fuel grains (ø 5μm) were designed by KEMA via a unique so-called sol-gel process, which also attracted attention from the industry.

40|$|Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) {{is a new}} {{combustion}} concept aiming {{a simultaneous}} reduction of oxides of nitrogen and soot emissions. Therefore the operation focuses on improved fuel–air mixing before ignition and lower maximum in-cylinder temperatures during the complete engine cycle. In the PCCI-regime, the injection and ignition events do not overlap due to the longer ignition delay timings. As such ignition is not influenced by the injection event like in the conventional operation and it is essentially governed by chemical kinetics. Numerical methods should incorporate flow and chemistry models in an accurate way. However, the computational demand for modeling these phenomena is high and the researchers work on several reduction techniques to achieve a practical computational efficiency. In this work the Flamelet Generated Manifold method is applied within the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework to study PCCI combustion. In FGM, thermo-chemical properties are preprocessed by solving canonical systems (here, Igniting Counter-flow Diffusion Flamelets and <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactors)</b> and stored in a manifold {{as a function of}} controlling variables. Since ignition control is difficult in the aforementioned combustion concept, the accurate prediction of ignition phenomena is significant. Simulations are performed with three different mesh settings, where the course grid proves to be sufficiently accurate. Later the effect of multiple pressure levels is investigated using both canonical systems and the study shows that a number of three pressure levels is sufficient to capture the ignition phasing with <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactors</b> based FGM tables.
