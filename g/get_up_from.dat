5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E

His first act when landing in Santiago's airport was to triumphantly <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his wheelchair to the acclaim of his supporters. He was first greeted by his successor {{as head of}} the Chilean armed forces, General Ricardo Izurieta. President-elect Ricardo Lagos said the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him.|$|E
25|$|Another version tells {{that two}} Sioux boys wandered {{far from their}} village when Mato the bear, a huge {{creature}} that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and wanted to eat them for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato tried to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins hangs over the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.|$|E

Pal retired after filming the two pilots, and his son, Lassie Junior (who {{was three years}} old and had been in training for a couple of years), stepped into the television role. [...] Pal would come to the show's studio home at Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles every day with his son during filming. [...] He had a bed behind the set, and was respectfully termed The Old Man. [...] Series star Tommy Rettig later recalled, [...] "When Rudd would ask Lassie, Jr. to do something, if you were behind the set, you could see The Old Man <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his bed and go through the routine back there." ...|$|E

[...] He teamed up with producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend who often worked with Wainwright's mother and aunt (Kate and Anna McGarrigle), and had helped him record several demo tapes prior to being signed to DreamWorks. Musicians Melissa Auf der Maur and Teddy Thompson also appear on the album, as does Wainwright's sister Martha Wainwright. Several tracks were produced by Greg Wells, Alex Gifford, Ethan Johns, and Damian LeGassick. The album took {{a year and a half}} to record [...] half the time it took him to record his first album.|$|E
2500|$|Verbal prefixes {{are used}} {{only in the}} {{independent}} order, although some forms of the independent order lack a prefix. There are three of them: /n-/ (first person), /k-/ (second person), and /w-/ (third person). If a stem has an underlying initial vowel, a /t/ is inserted after the prefix, and before this and other stem-initial consonants a /ə/ is inserted. Sometimes, this /ə/ contracts with a stem-initial /wə/ to /o·/ except when the /o·/ would be phonetically shortened via rule U-4a. Examples include: /ntá·mwi/ ("I <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> lying") versus /á·mwi·(w)/ ("he gets up"). Two roots with initial /t/ extend the syllable with /-ən/ when adding prefixes; these roots are /tal-/ ("there") and /tax-/ ("so many"), e.g. náni ntəntala·wsí·ne·n ("that is where we live [...] ") from the animate intransitive stem /tala·wəsi·/.|$|E

[...] (Xu's associate Cheng Daohui (程道惠) had initially urged that Xu offer the throne to an even younger brother, Liu Yigong (劉義恭) the Prince of Jiangxia, to control power longer, but Xu and Fu believed Liu Yilong to be capable and therefore decided on him.) [...] Xu remained at Jiankang, while Fu went to Liu Yilong's post at Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei) to welcome him.|$|E

[...] In order to counteract imperial authority, prior to Liu Yilong's arrival, made Xie the governor of Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei) to replace Liu Yilong, with the intent that Xie and Tan can counteract against the emperor should the emperor act against them. [...] Liu Yilong subsequently, after some deliberation, accepted the throne (as Emperor Wen).|$|E
2500|$|Śrīrāghave Bhārgavapraveśaḥ (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवे भार्गवप्रवेशः). Rāma {{counters}} {{the rage}} of Paraśurāma by his gentle words. Rāma accepts that he has indeed broken the bow, but only on orders of Viśvāmitra. He calls Paraśurāma as his Guru and himself as Paraśurāma's disciple. Rāma aplogizes to Paraśurāma for the insulting speech of Lakṣmaṇa. While Rāma speaks thus, Lakṣmaṇa giggles again at Paraśurāma. This further infuriates Paraśurāma who now challenges Rāma to a duel, saying he is no ordinary Brāhmaṇa. Rāma respectfully tells Paraśurāma that duel is only between equals, {{and he is not}} worthy of having a duel with Paraśurāma. He tells Paraśurāma that he (Rāma) is omnipotent but still a slave of the Brāhmaṇas. Then Rāma reveals his Mahāviṣṇu form to Paraśurāma, showing the mark of Bhṛgu's foot on his chest. On seeing the footprint of his ancestor, Paraśurāma gives up the pretence of anger. He asks Rāma to string the bow of Viṣṇu named Śārṅga. As he hands over the Śārṅga to Rāma, his axe disappears, and all his weapons go and dissolve into Rāma. His aura also enters Rāma. Rāma strings the Vaiṣṇava bow and places an arrow on it. Paraśurāma's pretence of doubt is also over. Paraśurāma then praises Rāma in twelve verses (19.63–19.76). Rāma tells Paraśurāma that his arrow is infallible. He asks Paraśurāma if he should use the arrow to destroy Paraśurāma's ability to move freely on earth, or if he should destroy the fruits earned by Paraśurāma with his penance. Rāma again gently reveals his Mahāviṣṇu form to Paraśurāma, and then falls at the feet of Paraśurāma to ask for his orders. Amidst acclaims from everybody in the assembly, Paraśurāma embraces Rāma and asks hims to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his feet. He then asks Rāma to destroy the fruits of his penance and not his mobility. [...] Rāma does the same. Paraśurāma starts to praise Rāma.|$|E
2500|$|The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is {{an artist}} {{who works in the}} motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous {{characters}} throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who's watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn’t think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots, seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves( [...] p.13 [...] "people <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the movie theatre or the TV and do what they just saw"). He also claims that he is just showing existing violence. Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the [...] "Mall Murderers") have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the next few minutes - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him. Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to how all the survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line [...] "No one has taken responsibility" [...] — echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.|$|E
