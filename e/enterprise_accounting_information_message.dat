This will alter the way the insurance companies keep their accounts and how they design strategies. All this work in accounting {{is being done to}} increase transparency and provide the most realistic accounts of insurance. This is an indirect form to protect the policyholders. Even the regulation on repayment ability is a method of protecting policyholders. Accounting is the process of collecting and reporting financial information about entity or about a group of units. Accounting practices are developed over time and they reflect the traditional national accounts. With the development of EU and increased activity of insurance companies or other companies outside the national borders, finding of a common way to present financial data of companies is becoming more critical. In connection with commercial <b>enterprises,</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>information</b> users include managers, investors, potential investors, lenders, investment analysts, regulators and consumers.

Through the application of ABC/XYZ-analysis of the nomenclature within the enterprise ERP-system, {{it is possible to}} increase significantly the efficiency of inventory management, in accordance with Pareto principle concentrating on managing the most important categories of goods. Various researchers dealt with the methods of ABC/XYZ-analysis itself but its usage {{as a part of the}} inventory management and procurement subsystem has a number of essential features, ignoring of which can lead to tangible negative consequences. The article discusses the methods and key problems of application of ABC/XYZ-analysis within the <b>enterprise</b> management <b>accounting</b> <b>information</b> system. For each of the factors that can affect the reliability of sales and procurement statistics and distort the results of the classification of goods, we have formulated the proposals to minimize the negative impact of that specific factor. Proposed methods allow reducing the impact of the following factors: availability of conditions for duplicate nomenclature to appear within the <b>enterprise</b> <b>accounting</b> software, the lack of a unified approach to the formation of names for newly created items of nomenclature, frequent changes in the products range of the suppliers, excessive detailing of information about a product in its name. The results of successfully implemented analysis and classification of goods can be used for a wide range of tasks varying from implementing effective inventory control to general planning and forecasting commodity flows as a part of the enterprise budgeting model. Solving these problems will harmoniously fit the inventory management in the managerial accounting system making it an effective tool in achieving strategic business goals...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{information}} {{plays an}} important role in the management system of an agricultural enterprise. Many researchers have proved this information to make 60 - 70 % of the information that is necessary for man-agement of an enterprise. This information is the basis for the heads and specialists of an enterprise in constant analysis and control of economic-financial activity of the enterprise, in making management decisions that regulate this activity to obtain positive financial results. Economic information is not monolitic information. Ac-counting information makes the greatest part (up to 80 %) of its structure. According to the stages of forma-tion economic information is classified into primary and secondary information. Primary information is formed where economic processes and financial and enterprise management operations take place. Secondary informa-tion is the product (result) of primary information proc-essing. Practically and in theoretical discussions it is called secondary information that is used in making and control of various management decisions. Quality of secondary information (accuracy, reliability and other indices) depends on means and methods to carry opera-tions of initial data measuring, registration, transmis-sion and processing. Possibilities of primary economic information computerization have already been ana-lyzed (Domeika, 2003, et. al). Therefore, this article analyses theoretical aspects of computerized arrange-ment and use of secondary <b>information</b> (<b>accountting</b> <b>information</b> in particular).
