They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I told myself that I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover how he has ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you. I tell you I am just like you!" ...|$|E

500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I like and I happen to like rock 'n' roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Mosley {{challenged}} Balestre for {{the presidency}} of FISA. Mosley said that his decision to challenge the Frenchman was prompted by Balestre's reported intervention {{on behalf of his}} countryman Alain Prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix. Mosley campaigned on the basis that Balestre, who was also president of the FIA and of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, could not effectively manage all these roles together. He also said that no-one challenged Balestre because they were afraid of the consequences and suggested that the FISA President should not interfere with F1, which could be left to run itself. Mosley won the FISA presidency by 43 votes to 29; Balestre remained as FIA president. Mosley resigned a year later, fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re-affirmation of his mandate. [...] "I wanted to show people that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I say", he said. [...] "Now they can judge me in a year's time." [...] FISA immediately re-elected him.|$|E
500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I do, I felt I had come to a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E

500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E

Choosing to ignore the Beastie Boys plea, Maxim introduced [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] with the declaration [...] "They didn't want us to play this fucking tune.

2500|$|In a small {{business}} all these functions might be done by one person or shared between the participants. In larger enterprises roles can differentiate and become more specialized emphasizing one or more aspects of the VSM. Local conditions, the environment {{and nature of the}} service or product, determines where warehousing, sales, advertising, promotion, dispatch, taxation, finance, salaries etc., fit into this picture. Not all enterprises charge for their transactions (e.g. some schools and medical services, policing) and voluntary staff may not be paid. Advertising or shipping might not be part of the business or they might be the principal activity. Whatever the circumstances, all enterprises are required to be useful to their users if they are to remain viable. For all participants the central question remains: [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I always do for this transaction or do I innovate?" [...] It is embodied in the calls on System 4. The VSM describes the constraints: a knowledge of past performance and how it may be improved.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Bianca is in {{a romance}} with {{newcomer}} Lena Kundera. She declares {{her commitment to}} Lena, and Maggie is left feeling rejected. Maggie's next romance is with character Jonathan Lavery, a relationship brought on by her hurt feelings, as well as feeling second best to Bianca's other best friend, Babe Carey (Maggie's cousin once removed). Maggie and Jonathan's romance was new territory for Hendrickson, as her character's sexual activity increased:Because I play a sexually confused character, I have not {{had to do a}} lot of sex scenes (giggles). Maggie lost her virginity to Henry in her dorm room, and it was PC, pretty chaste. Well, not with Jonathan! When we did our first big love scene, I was so surprised about how prudish and shy I became! It's like I became 16 again. I had to drop the blanket that was covering me, and in the middle of my kiss with Jeff Branson, Jonathan], I started cracking up. He was like, 'What did <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> did I do?' And I was like, 'Nothing! It wasn't you! I'm a 25-year-old professional woman. What is wrong with me?' I couldn't believe myself!'

2500|$|Ferguson had emptied two 15-round {{magazines}} {{during the}} shooting. While he was reloading his third magazine, somebody yelled, [...] "Grab him!" [...] Three passengers – Michael O'Connor, Kevin Blum, and Mark McEntee – tackled Ferguson and pinned him {{to one of}} the train's seats. Several other passengers ran forward to grab his arms and legs and help hold him pinned across a three-seat row with his head towards the window and legs towards the aisle. While he was pinned, Ferguson said, [...] "Oh God, what did <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> <b>What</b> did I do? I deserve whatever I get." [...] He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him, [...] "Don't shoot me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." [...] Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for some time while they awaited relief. While those who had not tackled him, but were holding him down, inquired as to the location of the gun, they were assured that it had been kicked away and that there had only been one gunman. Most, if not all passengers still in the car were concerned that no further violence take place and that the shooter be held rather than attacked. He was held down for several minutes. Soon, Andrew Roderick, an off-duty Long Island Rail Road police officer who was picking up his wife from the train, boarded the train car and handcuffed Ferguson.|$|E

2500|$|While Garbage had lyrical {{input from}} all band members, Manson was {{responsible}} for all the lyrics in Version 2.0.. Consequently, it was described by Manson as [...] "more direct and more personal than the first. I was able to verbalize things a little clearer this time—I mean, I'm no Nick Cave, I'm never gonna be Bob Dylan. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I can to express myself." [...] The singer [...] "tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies", adding that [...] "like human beings, songs shouldn't be one-dimensional". The singer declared that the introspective nature of Version 2.0 served to [...] "reassure myself while I'm going crazy" [...] due to her experiences during production, as she was [...] "living by myself in a hotel, and I {{had no one to}} really talk to" [...] and every day coming back by herself really late after working on the studio. Manson added that only [...] "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" [...] had something that was out of her life, being inspired by her friend Ruthie Trouble. [...] "Medication" [...] came about from a frightful, isolating experience with the US medical system. The song, Manson explained, is [...] "a reflection on past ills in a way ... about taking blame on yourself for things that you had no control of at the time, and finally pushing off and realizing that this was not my fault. It wasn't all my fault. There's a huge relief and release that comes from that".|$|E
