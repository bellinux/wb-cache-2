40|$|The Henry {{coefficients}} {{of a single}} component adsorbent + adsorbate system are calculated from experimentally measured adsorption isotherm data, from which the heat of adsorption at zero coverage is evaluated. The {{first part of the}} papers relates to the development of thermodynamic property surfaces for a single-component adsorbent + adsorbate system 1 (Chakraborty, A.; Saha, B. B.; Ng, K. C.; Koyama, S.; Srinivasan, K. Langmuir 2009, 25, 2204). A thermodynamic framework is presented to capture the relationship between the specific surface area (Ai) and the energy factor, and the surface structural and the surface energy heterogeneity distribution factors are analyzed. Using the outlined approach, the maximum possible amount of adsorbate uptake has been evaluated and compared with experimental data. It is found that the adsorbents with higher specific surface areas tend to possess lower heat of adsorption (ΔH°) at the Henry regime. In this paper, we have established the <b>definitive</b> <b>relation</b> between Ai and ΔH° for (i) carbonaceous materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), carbon nanotubes, zeolites + hydrogen, and (ii) activated carbons + methane systems. The proposed theoretical framework of At and AH 0 provides valuable guides for researchers in developing advanced porous adsorbents for methane and hydrogen uptake. © 2009 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study aims to {{evaluate}} the dentomaxillofacial radiographic changes in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who were on hemodialysis. Methods: Parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measurements, as well as Panoramic and periapical radiographs were obtained from seventy four patients {{with a history of}} end stage renal disease (ESRD). Results: 74 patients examined with age range of 15 to 68 years, and a mean age of 41. 4 ± 14. 6 years. The duration of dialysis ranged between 3 to 156 months with a mean duration of 40. 4 months. Thinning or loss of lamina dura was observed in 16 patients (51. 4 %) and calcification of the pulp in 28 patients (40 %). Changes in trabecular pattern was observed in 30 patients (40. 6 %), alterations in jaw bone density in 29 patients (39. 2 %) and bilateral calcification of stylohyoid ligaments in 13 patients (17. 6 %). We did not notice any non periapical origin radiolucent lesion. There was a significant relationship between bone trabecular pattern with P level, age and duration of dialysis. Changes in bone density showed significant relationship with frequency and hours of dialysis per week. Conclusion: No correlation was found between the radiographic changes and Ca level. Although changes in trabecular pattern and density were observed mostly in those who were on hemodialysis for a relatively long time, but we could not establish a <b>definitive</b> <b>relation</b> of radiographic manifestations in ESRD patients with the duration and frequency of dialysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesSeveral {{studies have}} {{documented}} a slight but significant deterioration of renal function after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (EVAR). The {{aim of this}} retrospective study was therefore to investigate whether medication with statins may favourably affect perioperative renal function. Material and MethodsFrom January 2000 to January 2008, {{out of a total}} cohort of 287 elective patients receiving endovascular repair of their AAA or aortoiliac aneurysm, 127 patients were included in the present study, as their medication was reliably retrievable. Patients were divided according to whether their medication included statins (> 3 months). Second, they were subdivided according to their supra- (SR) or infrarenal (IR) endograft fixation. Serum creatinine (SCr) and creatinine (CrCl) clearance were determined preoperatively, postoperatively, at 6 and 12 months. Patients with known pre-existing renal disease, with incorrect placement of the stent graft resulting in severe renal artery stenosis, and with occlusion or renal parenchymal infarction were excluded from the study. ResultsPatients receiving an infrarenal fixation of their graft had no change in the renal function, regardless whether they were on statins or not. In patients with SR fixation not receiving statins, a deterioration in renal function was observed in the early postoperative period ((SCr) preoperative vs. SCr postoperative: 1. 02 ± 0. 2 vs. 1. 11 ± 0. 28, p< 0. 001 and (Cr. Cl) preoperative vs. Cr. Cl postoperative: 74. 1 ± 21. 4 vs. 68. 0 ± 21. 4, p< 0. 001), whereas patients on statins experienced no change in renal function (SCr preoperative vs. SCr postoperative: 0. 99 ± 0. 24 vs. 1. 02 ± 0. 20 n. s. and Cr. Cl preop vs. Cr. Clpostop. : 76. 4 ± 19. 1 vs. 74. 28 ± 20. 50, n. s.). During follow-up, a constant worsening of renal function at 6 and 12 months was observed, irrespective of the medication with statins. ConclusionsThe present study suggests a slight immediate deterioration of the renal function using (SR) fixation, and this could be prevented by the use of statins. During follow-up, statins did not protect from further renal deterioration. Broader studies are needed to confirm a <b>definitive</b> <b>relation</b> between statin use and renal protection during the endovascular repair of AAA...|$|E

The hemolytic and bacteriolytic action of soaps of the unsaturated fatty acids is probably due in part to their avidity for protein and not wholly to their ability to dissolve lipoids.

40|$|International audienceExploratory data {{analysis}} (EDA) is a frequently under-valued part of {{data analysis}} in biology.

For phylogenetic analyses, a useful tool for EDA is a data-display network. This type of network is designed to display any character (or tree) conflict in a dataset, without prior assumptions about the causes of those conflicts. The conflicts might be caused by (a) methodological issues in data collection or analysis, (b) homoplasy, or (c) horizontal gene flow of some sort. Here, I explore 13 published datasets using splits networks, as examples of using data-display networks for EDA. In each case, I performed an original EDA on the data provided, to highlight the aspects of the resulting network that will be important for an interpretation of the phylogeny.

The impact on trust relations between the government, the National Health Service (NHS) and the citizen will be considered. The importance of anonymisation of personal data as a method of minimising privacy risks and increasing trust will be discussed. Using the results of the author’s exploratory empirical study into attitudes to sharing personal data with the public sector, the article will suggest that the benefits-versus-costs privacy problem is particularly significant in relation to data sharing projects in the public sector. The lack of <b>definitive</b> answers in <b>relation</b> to the risk of re-identification contributes to the problem.

40|$|Abstract Background Low {{back pain}} (LBP) in {{adolescents}} {{is associated with}} LBP in later years. In recent years treatments have been administered to adolescents for LBP, {{but it is not}} known which physical therapy treatment is the most efficacious. By means of a meta-analysis, the current study investigated the effectiveness of the physical therapy treatments for LBP in children and adolescents. Methods Studies in English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese, and carried out by March 2011, were selected by electronic and manual search. Two independent researchers coded the moderator variables of the studies, and performed the effect size calculations. The mean effect size index used was the standardized mean change between the pretest and posttest, and it was applied separately for each combination of outcome measures, (pain, disability, flexibility, endurance and mental health) and measurement type (self-reports, and clinician assessments). Results Eight articles that met the selection criteria enabled us to define 11 treatment groups and 5 control groups using the group as the unit of analysis. The 16 groups involved a total sample of 334 subjects at the posttest (221 in the treatment groups and 113 in the control groups). For all outcome measures, the average effect size of the treatment groups was statistically and clinically significant, whereas the control groups had negative average effect sizes that were not statistically significant. Conclusions Of all the physical therapy treatments for LBP in children and adolescents, the combination of therapeutic physical conditioning and manual therapy is the most effective. The low number of studies and control groups, and the methodological limitations in this meta-analysis prevent us from drawing <b>definitive</b> conclusions in <b>relation</b> to the efficacy of physical therapy treatments in LBP. </p...|$|R

When using cottonseed oil biodiesel blends, CO, total hydrocarbon (THC), NOx, and SO 2 emissions decreased as compared to petroleum diesel. Carbon dioxide emissions had no <b>definitive</b> trend in <b>relation</b> to cottonseed oil biodiesel blends. Carbon monoxide emissions increased by an average 15 % using B 5 and by an average of 19 % using B 100. Hydrocarbon emissions decreased by 14 % using B 5 and by 26 % using B 100. Nitrogen oxide emissions decreased by four percent with B 5, five percent with B 20, and 14 % with B 100. Sulfur dioxide emissions decreased by an average of 86 % using B 100, and by 94 % using B 50 blended with ultra-low sulfur diesel. The difference between peak output power when using biodiesel and when using diesel was insignificant in blends less than B 40. Peak brake power when using B 100 was about five percent lower than for diesel fuel. Pure cottonseed oil biodiesel achieved and maintained a peak corrected brake power of 13. 1 kW at speeds of 2990, 2875, and 2800 rpm at loads of 41. 3, 42. 7, and 43. 8 N-m.

40|$|The central {{investigation}} ofthis {{thesis is}} to examine the role of the Presbyterian. Church in Ireland at a time of proposed major constitutional change. The Home Rule era provides the historical context for this, and an attempt will be made to explore the Presbyterian Church's response, and subsequent action, relative to the three Home Rule Bills. This general investigation will in turn be complemented by a more. specific investigation ofthe individual roles played during the Home Rule era by two leading Presbyterian elders, namely Thomas Sinclair and Thomas Dickson. Their respective positions will indicate why the church was never able to speak with one voice on this momentous issue. In the mid nineteenth century both men were Liberals, politically, but with the introduction ofHome Rule the former was led to espouse the Unionist cause while the latter became a Nationalist. The differences between both men on the Home Rule issue were to be reflected, to some extent, in the Presbyterian Church at large and in its highest judicial and legislative body, the General Assembly. The heart ofthis thesis is to recall the story ofIrish Presbyterianism in the Home Rule era with reference to these two prominent elders. It is not primarily an attempt to draw any <b>definitive</b> conclusions in <b>relation</b> to its responsibility to exercise a prophetic witness within the political realm, and its Biblical imperative to render allegiance to the government, as in Romans 13 : 1, although the investigation will allude to it. A comparison ofthe present, and Home Rule periods will be made, and the political aspinitions and attitudes ofPresbyterians today and then will be viewed with parallels drawn, but such is not the main aim ofthis thesis. That aim is primarily to chronicle how the Presbyterian Church reacted to the Home Rule proposals.

40|$|O século XIX retoma, por meio de narrativas literárias e pictóricas, o enredo de Antão, personagem da religião católica que teria se exilado no deserto em busca da dedicação às suas orações e à leitura bíblica. A representação de Antão do deserto, do Santo Antão, é revista no texto literário de Gustave Flaubert e na pintura de Paul Cézanne. Flaubert, nas três versões de sua La Tentation de saint Antoine (1849, 1856 e 1874), reconstruiu o enredo do santo por meio do discurso da alucinação, articulado a suas leituras, estudos e observações do quotidiano, como se notam em seus relatos de viagem e em seus manuscritos. O escritor busca na construção do erótico e da ciência a base para o questionamento da fé do santo, atormentado por imagens invocadas dum sem-número de relações interdiscursivas. Cézanne, por sua vez, busca nas referências pictóricas, em especial em pinturas do século XIX, a produção de sua La Tentation de saint Antoine, estabelecendo, sobretudo na versão definitiva (1877), relações com a obra de Flaubert.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and discussion of}} Elizabethan sermon styles and major psychological and conceptual problems which participate {{in the formation of}} these styles is approached in two ways, of which the first investigates the sermons themselves, and the second, specific controversial and discursive works. Since the primary evidence of style is the distinctive existence of any given sermon, the sermons are analysed for the information which they provide on three deeply implicated fields: the context of the sermon, with special attention given to the preacher's perception of and theories about his own function,about his relation to his audience, and about the individual and corporate natures of that audience; the text of the sermon, that is, {{the manner in which the}} Biblical text is interpreted and influences the organisation of the sermon; and the modes of argumentation by which the multiple possibilities of the text are made to realise particular purposes. In order to indicate more exactly the nature of changes taking place in the Elizabethan sermon, the period has been broadly divided into two parts, with Archbishop Grindal's letter to the Queen on 20 December 1576, defending the puritan exercises,as the symbolic point of division. For efficient comparison it has been necessary to make reference to preachers of the generation before 1558, and to provide a specific control upon interpretation three sermons from each portion of the Elizabethan period have been chosen and are the subject of comparative analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to discover what may be called semantic forms in the three sermons, understanding these to be verbal structures synthesising dominant experiential and cognitive concerns which have been progressively elaborated in the preceding discussion. Sermon style is identified with these expressive forms, and not only with rhetorical categories or literary-aesthetic determinations. The second part provides another perspective upon particular questions which arise in the sermons, and upon the broad underlying movements in the experience and conception of which style is the most sensitive register. Once again this part is divided into two sections: in the first, certain aspects of two major controversies of special relevance in the formation of the Elizabethan church, those between Jewel and Harding, and Whitgift and Cartwright, are shown to localise issues of much more general significance; and in the second, three subjects which further reveal conceptual problems fundamental to the evolution of Elizabethan thought,in the areas of psychology, logic and rhetoric, and science are investigated. While these subjects involve all thinking men of the period in some way,/interactive relation with the sermon analysis is maintained by concentrating principally upon clerical representation of them. It becomes apparent that consideration of style in terms of literary values or terminology is inadequate both to characterise those elements of prose expression which represent the distinctive features of the thought and experience of individuals or groups, and to correlate the descriptions of these expressive forms with areas of development in the culture of a particular period where contemporaneous definition of concepts,apart from these forms, is necessarily lacking. The classifications attempted are understood to be indicative rather than <b>definitive,</b> since the <b>relation</b> between the content of a culture, the quality of its realisation in individual and group consciousness, and its communication and transformation, is of extreme complexity. It is more clearly focussed in the consideration of what was known or believed, and what was perceived as uncertain or unknowable, about human nature itself and the external world, and particularly about the nature and function of language as the means of relation...|$|R
