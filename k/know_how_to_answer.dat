60|$|It was {{an awkward}} question, and Philip did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Ferris {{remained}} silently troubled. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> you, Henry; but I {{think that}} you're judging him narrowly and harshly." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed not}} to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> this question, but at length spoke, a little timidly. [...] "Not since I have lived with you, Mary." ...|$|E
60|$|She was silent. She had not {{expected}} this, and she scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
60|$|He flushed slightly, but {{scarcely}} <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> He made a vague {{gesture of}} denial.|$|R
60|$|This speech {{contained}} so many surprises for {{him that}} he scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I have a boy's age, sir, I have a man's fist. I {{shall be}} {{fifteen years old}} this month, and <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> any one who insults me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{really have}} so {{surprised}} me that I hardly <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> you," [...] said Mrs. Thompson. [...] "Indeed, I cannot {{bring myself to}} imagine {{that you are in}} earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We shall <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the {{insolence}} {{of these}} Americans, señores,” he said, {{and held up}} his wine‐glass {{as he turned to}} Harper. “It is demanded that you join us—Viva la España!” ...|$|E
60|$|This was a {{question}} Dave had dreaded to have asked, and he hardly <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> He determined <b>to</b> be as frank as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 21: What would Guido {{have said}} to this? More, I suspect, than Dante would have liked <b>to</b> hear, or <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> But he died before the verses transpired; {{probably}} before they were written; for Dante, in the chronology of his poem, assumes what times and seasons he finds most convenient.] ...|$|R
60|$|It {{took her}} aback. She laughed, a little breathlessly, {{to hide her}} discomposure, and scarce <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> him, scarce <b>knew</b> whether she took {{pleasure}} or offense in his daring encroachment upon that royal aloofness in which she dwelt, and in which her Spanish rearing had taught her she must ever dwell.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{you take}} up the cudgel," [...] said Eystein, merrily; [...] "but I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> If I did sit at home, like my father's daughter, you cannot deny that, like a sister, I {{furnished}} you forth." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Joan trembled in the {{realization}} that a tremendous passion had seized upon this strange, strong man. In {{the face of it}} she did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> him. Yet somehow she gathered courage in the knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> or {{to thank}} you, Lord Arranmore," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "This is such a surprising offer. I scarcely {{see how you can}} be in earnest. You know so little of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, aye, sir!" [...] ejaculated Ali with precision, {{and moved}} on. He had been {{quartermaster}} with Lingard before making {{up his mind}} to stay in Sambir as Almayer's head man. He strutted towards the landing-place thinking proudly {{that he was not}} like those other ignorant boatmen, and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> properly the very greatest of white captains.|$|R
60|$|Okematan, who was {{intensely}} {{philosophical and}} inquisitive, had been carrying on a semi-speculative conversation with Billie {{on this very}} subject while descending the Red River towards Prairie Cottage--much to the perplexity of the invalid, who scarce <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the chief's queries, and greatly to the interest of Archie, who wondered at Little Bill's powers of reply.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her with a fine and {{wonderful}} curiosity. In his way he was quite as much one of the old school as the Earl of Eastchester, and the idea of a lady--a Wendermott, too--calling herself a journalist and proud of making a few hundreds a year was amazing enough to him. He scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, {{you must}} not be so very severe and dignified. Make some {{allowance}} for poor things who don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> Mrs. Nesbit, and say what first occurs. Indeed, I did not know you were so much interested in him.' ...|$|E
60|$|Bertrade de Montfort did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> so ridiculous a sophistry; and, {{truth to}} tell, {{she was more}} than pleased to hear from the lips of Roger de Conde what bored her on the tongues of other men.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a {{question}} which I hardly <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] cried Don Martin, [...] "I cannot {{stand there}} to hear such words of my master. Did {{they come from}} other lips, I should <b>know</b> better <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> them." ...|$|R
60|$|Was he, {{or was he}} not a wolf? That was the {{question}} which Mrs. Bell scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> Hetta had given her voice, saying he was lupine. Mr. Beckard's opinion she had not liked to ask directly. Mr. Beckard she thought would probably propose to Hetta; but as yet he had not done so. And, as {{he was still a}} stranger in the family, she did not like in any way to compromise Susan's name. Indirectly she had asked {{the question}}, and, indirectly also, Mr. Beckard's answer had been favourable.|$|R
2500|$|Separation of {{conjoined}} twins {{who were}} fused {{all the way}} from the shoulder to the pelvis and shared one heart. It is during this case that C. Everett Koop, the 13th Surgeon General of the United States, said [...] "The ethics and morals involved in this decision are too complex for me. I believe they are too complex for you as well. Therefore I referred it to an old rabbi on the Lower East Side of New York. He is a great scholar, a saintly individual. He <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> such questions. When he tells me, I too will know." ...|$|R
60|$|What was Miss Baker {{to say to}} this? She had not the {{slightest}} intention of making Miss Todd a confidante in the matter: certainly not now, as that lady was inclined to behave so very improperly with Sir Lionel; and yet she did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Vivisecting? Mortuisecting?" [...] exclaimed the spectre, {{with some}} amusement. [...] "Really, the {{proposal}} is so very novel that I hardly <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it. I don't think you will find it a very practicable undertaking: but still, if you like, yes, you may try your hands upon me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People never can, I think, {{at small}} parties like that. Dear Anna, you {{surprised}} {{me so much}} by {{what you told me}} {{on the banks of the}} Wharfe!" [...] She did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> him even a word. [...] "I know that I was unkind to you." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mother was}} subtler than her children, they very rarely <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> her. So Winifred was only more confused. It {{was not a}} {{question}} of lilies. At least, if it were a question of lilies, then her children were the little blossoms. They at least grew. Doesn't Jesus say: 'Consider the lilies how they grow.' Good then, she had her growing babies. But as for that other tall, handsome flower of a father of theirs, he was full grown already, so {{she did not want to}} spend her life considering him in the flower of his days.|$|R
60|$|When, {{at the end}} of two hours, the sisters-in-law met at the work- room, and Rosamond {{had taken}} a survey of the row of needle-women, coming up one by one to give their work, be paid and dismissed, there was a look of weariness and vexation on Cecil's face. She had found it less easy to keep order and hinder gossip, and had hardly <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> when that kind lady, Mrs. Miles Charnock, had been asked after; but she would have scorned to allow that she had missed her assistant, and only politely asked how Rosamond had sped.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord, it was but {{a little}} while back that I was asked that question, and <b>knew</b> not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it," [...] said Dick; [...] "but having {{answered}} once, I will not vary. My lord, I am for York." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ussher still {{remained}} silent; {{he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to this question. [...] "Come, Myles, speak to me. I know you came down to tell me your plans. What am I to do? You know you must settle now, if you're going so soon. What are your plans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{know what}} you mean, but I hardly do <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> you. If you went to Mary Lowther now, she would take it almost as an insult; and she would feel it in that light, because she is aware that you know of this story of her cousin." ...|$|E
60|$|He did {{not answer}} her; but getting up from his seat walked {{to the front of}} the summer-house, and stood there with his back turned upon her. It was not that he meant to be ungracious, but in truth he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> her. He had half repented of his bargain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who, I?--nothing," [...] {{answered}} Varney, {{but with}} sunken head and sullen voice; [...] "nothing but communicated to her her lord's commands, which, if the lady list not to obey, she <b>knows</b> better <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it than I may pretend to do." ...|$|R
60|$|Austen <b>knew</b> not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> He had {{not gone}} there to discuss this last and really great {{question}} with Mr. Flint, but he wondered whether the president actually thought him the fledgling he proclaimed. Austen laid his pass on Mr. Flint's desk, and rose.|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the results of}} the comparative analysis of interaction strategies and behavior models of managers (line and top) and professionals who work in the construction industry. The purpose of the research was to identify typical differences in the behavior of managers and professionals in the conflict situations in two of these three integrated factors: strategy of business communication and the model of behavior in the conflict. We used two test-questionnaires and some tasks (case-studies). The research showed the following result. The participants <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the questions correctly, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> choose the correct solution. However, their theoretical knowledge and practical skills, which are implemented in their life, are significantly different...|$|R
