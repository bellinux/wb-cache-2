40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} is to clarify {{the concept of a}} wage-led growth strategy, which combines pro-labour distributional policies with structural policies that strengthen a wage-led economic regime. A wage-led demand regime and pro-labour distributional policies must be distinguished, although we could say that pursuing pro-labour distributional policies in an economy whose structure is such that this economy is in a wage-led regime would constitute an appropriate wage-led growth strategy. Neoliberalism as it has occurred in practice has meant that most countries have instead pursued pro-capital distributional policies that have generated stagnant or unstable growth processes because these countries are mostly in a wage-led economic regime, thus necessitating external drivers such as household debt or export-led growth to maintain GDP growth. While a number of countries may be in a profit-led total demand regime when taking into account all elements of aggregate demand, <b>including</b> <b>net</b> <b>exports,</b> nearly all of them are in a wage-led domestic demand regime when only domestic demand is taken into account. Thus while pro-capital distributional policies may be demand-enhancing when a country is taken in isolation, this will not generally be the case when all countries are considered as a whole...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{impact of}} domestic currency depreciation caused by foreign exchange intervention of Czech National Bank (CNB) in November 2013 on foreign trade between Czech Republic and Eurozone. The total volume of Czech foreign trade has been growing, {{but in recent}} years Czech Republic loses price competitiveness and comparative advantage on the European market. Foreign exchange intervention promote export, but only if the J-curve occurs. Concept of the J-curve states that in the short run depreciation of domestic currency causes decrease of <b>net</b> <b>export</b> and only in the long run increase of <b>net</b> <b>export.</b> The reason is that while in the long run Marshall-Lerner condition is met, in the short run it is not. Thesis verifies the hypothesis that in the short run foreign exchange intervention lead to lower values of <b>net</b> <b>export,</b> while in the long run <b>net</b> <b>export</b> will rise and even above the values {{at the very beginning of}} the intervention. To verify this hypothesis is used method of least squares that uses monthly data from the middle of 2005 to the middle of 2015. The results of the study confirm a hypothesis of a fall in <b>net</b> <b>export</b> in the short run due to foreign exchange intervention. However, in the long run hypothesis of the growth of <b>net</b> <b>export</b> compared to the values of <b>net</b> <b>export</b> at the very beginning of the intervention is not confirmed...|$|R
