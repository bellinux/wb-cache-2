25|$|One of its {{sources for}} the 1980s and 1990s was Roy Bullock, an {{intelligence}} gatherer for the South African apartheid regime, a private collector of information. He amassed files on 10,000–12,000 individuals and 600 organizations and provided them to the ADL as a secretly paid <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> for over 32 years. Bullock often wrote letters to various groups and forwarded copies of their replies to the ADL, clipped articles from newspapers and magazines, and maintained files on his computer. He also used less orthodox, and possibly illegal, methods such as combing through trash and tapping into White Aryan Resistance's phone message system {{in order to find}} evidence of hate crimes. Some of the information he obtained and then passed on to the ADL came from confidential documents (including intelligence files on various Nazi groups and driver's license records and other personal information on nearly 1,400 people) that were given to him by San Francisco police officer and former CIA agent Tom Gerard.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 43 - 44). Medical transcription is the act of transferring a patient's medical history and treatment from oral to written form. Medical transcription services focus on providing medical transcription to a variety of medical specialists. At this time, there has been very little research performed on any aspect of the medical transcription industry. The work force of medical transcription services can consist of employees or <b>independent</b> <b>contractors.</b> This study will examine the use of <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> in medical transcription services. Specifically, this study will seek to determine why transcriptionists decide to work as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors,</b> the problems these transcriptionists face, and the problems medical transcription service owners encounter when they use <b>independent</b> <b>contractors.</b> Toward this end, I have surveyed medical transcriptionists working as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> and medical transcription service owners who utilize <b>independent</b> <b>contractors.</b> These surveys are qualitative in design in an effort to obtain detailed responses from the participants. The results of these surveys will contribute to the discovery of the environmental and situational factors transcriptionists working as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> face. This discovery can lead {{to an understanding of the}} factors that motivate these transcriptionists. Knowing the factors that motivate these <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> can contribute to increased job satisfaction and performance level if a company can develop managerial practices that raise worker motivation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>Contractors</b> of Australia (ICA) was {{established}} in 1999, with the aim to create a national association to represent <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> in the Australian workplace. <b>Independent</b> <b>contractors</b> operate in the workplace by contracting out their services rather than being engaged under an employment agreement. They are able to be distinguished from employees by some key differences. <b>Independent</b> <b>contractors</b> operate their business entity {{in order to provide}} a good or service for an agreed price usually stipulated in a commercial contract. Other differences are that in most cases <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> are paid for the results they achieve; provide the materials and equipment needed to complete the work they do and are free to delegate their work to others. Also, they are free to accept or refuse work and may make a profit or a loss from the contracts they enter into with their clients. ICA is a not-for-profit association incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act (1981) of Victoria.|$|R

25|$|In 1948, Schulz {{tried to}} have Li'l Folks {{syndicated}} through the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a firm run by the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. Schulz {{would have been an}} <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Li'l Folks was dropped in early 1950. Later that year, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate - also operated by Scripps-Howard - with his best work from Li'l Folks. When his work was picked up by United Feature Syndicate, they decided to run the new comic strip he had been working on. This strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. The name Li'l Folks was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp's Li'l Abner and a strip titled Little Folks. To avoid confusion, the syndicate settled on the name Peanuts, after the peanut gallery featured in the Howdy Doody TV show.|$|E
25|$|As can be noted, {{liability}} {{is generally}} not extended to the acts of independent contractors. Though such a distinction has been criticised, there are several circumstances in which an employer may be liable for the acts of contractors. If an employer commissions a tort, this will render the employer a joint tortfeasor. Additionally, where an employer is negligent in selecting a competent third party contractor, liability may be imposed. The broadest exception however is where a non-delegable duty is imposed upon an employer, either by statute or through common law, to prevent the harm of others. Where a duty is imposed by statute, either to carry out work in a certain way, or to take due care in carrying out work, then this is non-delegable. Common law duties may arise in several exceptional circumstances. One such is where an activity is being undertaken which is especially hazardous, and involves obvious risks of damage. This duty was recognised in Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd, where photographers who negligently photographed {{the interior of a}} theatre set alight to the building. Their employers were found vicariously liable, as the dangerous methods of photography created a fire hazard. Additionally, where work is being undertaken on a highway, a non-delegable duty is created not to endanger any road users. Lastly, occupiers are liable in full where an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor,</b> through negligence, allows fire to spread to neighbouring land.|$|E
500|$|Section 2(4)(b) {{establishes}} that [...] "where {{damage is}} caused to a visitor by a danger {{due to the}} faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repair by an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> employed by the occupier, the occupier {{is not to be}} treated without more as answerable for the danger if in all the circumstances he had acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> and had taken such steps (if any) as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work had been properly done". This accords with the previous general rule that an occupier cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligence of an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor.</b> When a visitor does suffer harm from the work of an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor,</b> the question is instead whether the occupier has taken reasonable steps to establish if the contractor is competent, and, if the job permits, whether the occupier has checked that the work has been properly done.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S. in 2009, {{federal and}} state {{agencies}} began increasing their oversight of freelancers and other workers whom employers classify as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors.</b> The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the Secretary of Labor have its Wage and Hour Division [...] "focus on misclassification of employees as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> during targeted investigations." [...] The increased regulation is meant to ensure workers are treated fairly and that companies are not misclassifying workers as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> to avoid paying appropriate employment taxes and contributions to workers’ compensation and unemployment compensation.|$|R

500|$|If an {{occupier}} allows {{an extremely}} dangerous activity {{to take place}} on his land without taking precautions to ensure the contractor has liability insurance and a safety plan, he may be held liable. In Bottomley v Todmorden Cricket Club [...] the Court of Appeal held that, where the defendant had allowed an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> {{to set up a}} pyrotechnic display on their land without checking for public liability insurance, they were liable for the injuries suffered by the claimant. The extent to which one has to check for public liability insurance is weak; in Gwilliam v West Hertfordshire Hospital NHS Trust [...] the Court of Appeal held that where the contractor's insurance had expired {{a few days before the}} event, the occupier was not liable. In Naylor v Payling the occupier was not liable for failing to check public liability, since he had checked the contractor was accredited under the police and local government schemes required, and the contractor had been employed for 18 months before the case during which there were no reasons to doubt his competency. The Court of Appeal also held that, except in special circumstances, there was no [...] "free-standing duty" [...] to take reasonable steps to ensure an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> was insured.|$|E
500|$|The {{application}} of this rule differs depending on the technical nature of the job and the competencies on the occupier. Haseldine v CA Daw & Son Ltd [...] established that the more technical a job is, the more reasonable it is to entrust it to an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor,</b> while in Woodward v The Mayor of Hastings [...] {{the court held that}} an occupier is not always absolved from liability if they have entrusted the job to a competent person; an occupier is required to take the kind of care that a reasonable man in his place would take.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the higher}} expense of {{maintaining}} employees, many employers needing to transition to <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> may find the switch to contracting difficult. There is a transitional status for employees {{as an alternative to}} independent contracting known as being a statutory employee. Statutory employees are less expensive to hire than classic employees because the employer does not have to pay unemployment tax. However, they are more expensive than <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> because Social Security and Medicare taxes must be paid on wages. Similarly to <b>independent</b> <b>contractors,</b> statutory employees can deduct their trade or business expenses from their W2 earnings.|$|R
2500|$|McReynolds {{rejected}} the government's proposed [...] "interference" [...] test as unworkable. The majority's test he also rejected, arguing that no tax, {{no matter how}} onerous, could ever truly burden the vast resources of the federal government. McReynolds further argued {{that none of the}} cases cited by the majority supported the majority's opinion, as they were decided narrowly and the facts in each case were so unlike the facts in the instant case that they were inapplicable. The dissent agreed that {{it is often difficult to}} determine whether a tax is laid on a company's general operations (which is valid) or on the specific transaction with the federal government (which is not valid), the majority's emphasis on the <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> nature of the company was misplaced since every private company is an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> to the federal government.|$|E
