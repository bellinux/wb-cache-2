40|$|<b>Frentizole</b> is a benzimidazoleurea {{that has}} {{immunosuppressive}} properties in mice. Eleven steroid-treated patients with active {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} received <b>frentizole</b> (150 - 350 mg/day) in combination with stable or decreasing doses of prednisone in an open label trial. Nine patients completed at least one 21 -to 75 -day course of therapy with this drug. Clinical parameters of disease improved in 8 of these 9 patients. Mean DNA binding decreased by 28 %, mean CH 50 increased by 20 %, and mean absolute lymphocyte and T cell counts decreased by 25 - 26 %. Granulocytopenia was not observed. Three patients developed reversible hepatic toxicity. Clinical and serologic improvement was noted in 3 patients who accepted a second 90 -day course of <b>frentizole</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Lymphocytic {{thyroiditis}} was induced {{in young}} Wistar rats by feeding them the immunosuppressive compound <b>frentizole</b> [I-(6 -methoxy- 2 -benzothiazolyl) - 3 -phenyl urea] for 1 year. About {{half of the}} rats given 0. 060 and 0. 150 % <b>frentizole</b> in the diet had lymphocytic thyroiditis. The incidence of thyroiditis was low in the group given the high dose because of severe anemia and hepatic disease which resulted in increased mortality. Reversibility of the thyroid lesion was indicated by reduced incidence rates at 15 and 18 months after treatment was stopped at 1 year. The thyroiditis was characterized by interstitial infiltrates of many lymphocytes and plasma cells and fewer macrophages with mild degenerative changes in the foIlicular epithelium. This inflammatory cell infiltrate was generally diffuse but occasionally was multifocal, particularly in thyroid glands of rats late in the reversibility phase of the study. The inflammatory cell infiltrate caused the thyroid glands to be several times normal size. Sera from rats with lymphocytic thyroiditis contained hemagglutinating antibody against rat thyroglobulin. One rat had a low titer and no thyroid enlargement; all others, however, had perfect correlation between the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibody and enlarged thyroid glands. Fine granular deposits of IgG and complement were identified {{in some areas of}} th...|$|E

Amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) has been recognized to interact with numerous proteins, which may lead to pathological changes in cell metabolism of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. One such known metabolic enzyme is mitochondrial amyloid-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), also known as 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17 β-HSD 10). Altered enzyme function caused by the Aβ-ABAD interaction, was previously shown to cause mitochondrial distress and a consequent cytotoxic effect, therefore providing a feasible target in AD drug development. Based on previous <b>frentizole</b> derivatives studies, we report two novel series of benzothiazolyl ureas along with novel insights into the structure and activity relationships for inhibition of ABAD. Two compounds (37, 39) were identified as potent ABAD inhibitors, where compound 39 exhibited comparable cytotoxicity with the <b>frentizole</b> standard; however, one-fold higher cytotoxicity than the parent riluzole standard. The calculated and experimental physical chemical properties of the most potent compounds showed promising features for blood-brain barrier penetration. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background : The {{mitochondrial}} enzyme amyloid beta-binding {{alcohol dehydrogenase}} (ABAD) {{also known as}} 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17 β-HSD 10) has been connected with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). ABAD/ 17 β-HSD 10 is a binding site for the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) inside the mitochondrial matrix where it exacerbates Aβ toxicity. Interaction between these two proteins triggers {{a series of events}} leading to mitochondrial dysfunction as seen in AD. Methods : As ABAD’s enzymatic activity is required for mediating Aβ toxicity, its inhibition presents a promising strategy for AD treatment. In this study, a series of new benzothiazolylurea analogues have been prepared and evaluated in vitro for their potency to inhibit ABAD/ 17 β-HSD 10 enzymatic activity. The most potent compounds have also been tested for their cytotoxic properties and their ability to permeate through blood-brain barrier has been predicted. To explain the structure-activity relationship QSAR and pharmacophore studies have been performed. Results and Conclusions : Compound 12 was identified being the most promising hit compound with good inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 3. 06 ± 0. 40 µM) and acceptable cytotoxicity profile comparable to the parent compound of <b>frentizole.</b> The satisfactory physical-chemical properties suggesting its capability to permeate through BBB make compound 12 a novel lead structure for further development and biological assessment.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with an excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). Based on the multifactorial nature of AD, preparation of multi-target-directed ligands presents a viable option to address more pathological events at one time. A novel class of asymmetrical disubstituted indolyl thioureas have been designed and synthesized to interact with monoamine oxidase (MAO) and/or amyloid-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD). The design combines the features of known MAO inhibitors scaffolds (e. g. rasagiline or ladostigil) and a <b>frentizole</b> moiety with potential to interact with ABAD. Evaluation against MAO identified several compounds that inhibited in the low to moderate micromolar range. The most promising compound (19) inhibited human MAO-A and MAOB with IC 50 values of 6. 34 μM and 0. 30 μM, respectively. ABAD activity evaluation did not show any highly potent compound, but the compound series allowed identification of structural features to assist the future development of ABAD inhibitors. Finally, several of the compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), preventing the use of the Amplex™ Red assay to detect hydrogen peroxide produced by MAO, highlighting the need for serious precautions when using an enzyme-coupled assay.
