However, training Neural Networks involve a large amount of data. Therefore, training the network is time consuming as each training session requires several epochs, which usually takes smeral seconds or even minutes. This paper proposes a multi-backpropagation approach to minimize the complexity of the network. The approach does not require an alteration of the algorithm. Instead, the large network is split into several smaller networks. An <b>integrating</b> <b>network</b> is then constructed to integrate the output from the smaller networks. ...|$|E

Facing these facts and challenges, a framework of deploying QoS in end systems is presented in this paper. The framework aims at both relieving bottleneck problems through utilizing limited resources efficiently and guaranteeing End-to-End QoS by <b>integrating</b> <b>network</b> QoS and end system QoS.

In particular, we seek to understand better the following questions: 1) how many coding nodes are needed, 2) where should the coding nodes be located, and 3) how should the coding nodes interact with other noncoding nodes? To this aim, we apply our previously proposed evolutionary algorithm that operates as a distributed protocol and present quantifiable results through various simulations. We also consider the algorithm's operation in lossy environments and show that the temporally distributed structure of our algorithm offers a significant advantage in overcoming the adverse effect of packet erasures.
