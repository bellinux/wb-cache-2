5000|$|British {{comic book}} writer Warren Ellis {{considered}} Brokencyde's [...] "FreaXXX" [...] music video [...] "a near-perfect snapshot of everything that’s shit about {{this point in}} the culture". A writer for the Warsaw Business Journal attempted to describe their music: [...] "Imagine an impassioned triceratops mating with a steam turbine, while off to the side Daft Punk and the Bee Gees beat each other to death with skillets and spatulas. Imagine the sound that would make. Just try. BrokeNCYDE is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> except it also makes you want to jab your thumbs into your eyeballs and gargle acid." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The character's {{evolution}} {{over the}} season hasn't really surprised me,' he continues. 'I've been excited {{about what the}} writers have written for him, but it wasn't really surprising. I figured {{that was the only}} way he could go, which was to become a little bit lighter. Once in a while I kind of like it that he thinks he's got a place in life, that this is his journey and he's going to follow that journey, no questions asked. He's going to question everything else and defy all authority. I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> because even when he doesn't want to do something, I figured he would go against his heart and do what he felt he was meant to do. In one sense it's admirable, but in another it's kind of ignorant and stupid. I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> loyalty on his part, but that's slowly going to be broken down with the relationship with Maria and Max and Isabel, which will force him to kind of embrace the human side of life more. That's going to be the real ultimate struggle for him. I don't think you can ride the fence on that one; you're going to have to fully embrace your alienhood or kind of go the other way, and I don't think, mentally for the health of the character, that he can just stay with his alienhood. Overall, I think a choice will have to be made and that's what he'll struggle with." [...] Brendan Fehr, from [...] "Roswell: Brendan Fehr" [...] by Edward Gross ...|$|E

5000|$|Kenneth Cole's {{socially}} conscious advertising for the causes that he champions can be somewhat controversial. One such example was {{his campaign for}} World AIDS Day in 2005. He designed T-shirts for the campaign which were sold at such stores as Barneys New York, Scoop, and Louis Boston. The messages on the shirts stated either, [...] "We All Have AIDS" [...] or [...] "I Have AIDS." [...] Cole created the shirts in hopes that those with or without AIDS would wear the shirts, to help diminish the stigma attached to the disease. Cole stated, [...] "There is a legend of the Danish king, Christian X, who, during World War II, when Hitler insisted all Jews publicly wear a yellow Star of David, would wear the star himself, hence {{making it difficult to}} differentiate who was Jewish. This is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> hopefully." ...|$|E

[...] Writing for So So Gay, David Lim noted the EP's sound to be influenced by Swedish pop producer Max Martin, who created songs for late-90's teen pop stars such as Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. Lim later went on to call the EP a [...] "shout of neon-bright tunes" [...] and said: [...] "The catchy melodies and electronic beats suit Austin’s own clean-cut, all singing-and-dancing persona, but at times it puts a wall between him and the listener." ...|$|E

Thrillist contributor Amy Wolfenberger included Funhouse in her list of [...] "The Best Theme Bars in Portland", {{in which she}} wrote: [...] "The Funhouse is a wonderland of improv theater, beer, shots (no cocktails), clowns, and a general sense of whimsy.

[...] Leading up to the film's premiere, Jorgensen said Robertson's American wife and two children had volunteered to participate in DNA testing but withdrew their intent. The filmmaker said, [...] "Somebody suggested to me maybe that's (because) the daughters don't want to know if it's him. It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> <b>that</b> was an ugly war.

At the age of 5, William’s parents got a divorce leading to relationships with his mother, father, and sisters he describes as “tenuous.” In an Uproxx mini-documentary from May 2015, he recalls asking his parents for a guitar to which they responded with laughter.Although still legally under his parent’s care, Williams {{spent most of his}} teen years sleeping at friend’s houses. William recalls struggling to fit in with other black youth telling Rolling Stone, [...] "I was fat and couldn't play basketball, and I wanted to listen to Linkin Park, and only the white kids at my school wanted to do that stuff, and it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Earl Sweatshirt line: 'Too white for the black kids, too black for the whites.'

5000|$|Robinson further {{commented on}} the {{recording}} process of Flux, remarking: [...] "On my last record, The Ceaseless Sight, I didn’t have as many songs. I had a few songs and parts of other songs and I {{wanted to use the}} studio to finish them. I liked the way it turned out, so for this record I said I’m not going to finish anything. You can have parts of songs and sit on them for a while, but when you’re in the studio you have a finite amount of time and you have to get in and finish them. There’s an urgency and I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> pressure. It forces you to make creative decisions on {{how this is going to}} turn out. So that’s how I went in. I love the fact that it’s a very eclectic record and that it draws from all of my influences. It takes you on a journey and that’s what records should do. I look at the record as a whole. What I feel when I hear this record is that I’m in a different place for every song. I get inside this place and then the next song comes and I’m in a different place and I really like that. It’s really interesting to go with the music and where it takes you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Author Daniel Raeburn wrote, [...] "I snicker at the {{neologism}} {{first for}} its insecure pretension—the literary equivalent of calling a garbage man a 'sanitation engineer'—and second because a 'graphic novel' {{is in fact}} the very thing it is ashamed to admit: a comic book, rather than a comic pamphlet or comic magazine." [...] Writer Neil Gaiman, responding to a claim that he does not write comic books but graphic novels, said the commenter [...] "meant it as a compliment, I suppose. But all of a sudden I felt like someone who'd been informed that she wasn't actually a hooker; that in fact she was a lady of the evening." [...] Responding to writer Douglas Wolk's quip that the difference between a graphic novel and a comic book is [...] "the binding", Bone creator Jeff Smith said, [...] "I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> answer. Because 'graphic novel'... I don't like that name. It's trying too hard. It is a comic book. But there is a difference. And the difference is, a graphic novel is a novel in the sense that there is a beginning, a middle and an end." [...] The Times writer Giles Coren said, [...] "To call them graphic novels is to presume that the novel is in some way ‘higher’ than the karmicbwurk (comic book), and that only by being thought of as a sort of novel can it be understood as an art form." ...|$|E
