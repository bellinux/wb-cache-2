50|$|The European Monetary System was {{no longer}} a {{functional}} arrangement in May 1998 as the member countries fixed their mutual exchange rates when participating in the euro. Its successor however, the ERM-II, was launched on 1 January 1999. In ERM-II the <b>ECU</b> <b>basket</b> was discarded and the new single currency euro has become an anchor for the other currencies participating in the ERM-II. Participation in the ERM-II is voluntary and the fluctuation bands remain the same as in the original ERM, i.e. +15 percent, once again with the possibility of individually setting a narrower band with respect to the euro. Denmark and Greece became new members.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} arbitrage pricing {{of bonds}} and {{the determination of}} interest rates in the European Currency Unit (ecu) in situations of impending <b>ecu</b> <b>basket</b> adjustments. These adjustments disrupt the markets for private ecu assets with a lead of several months. The approach of the paper {{is based on the}} observation that the ecu is a derivative asset, so that in the absence of transaction costs prices of ecu-denominated assets should be determined by the prices of the existing member currency assets and the member currencies' exchange rates. Using the technical apparatus of arbitrage pricing theory it is shown how the fundamental arbitrage pricing relationships implied by the derivative character of the ecu have to be adjusted in order to be applicable during periods of <b>ecu</b> <b>basket</b> adjustments.

25|$|Koivisto's {{policy was}} {{maintained}} only briefly after Esko Aho was elected Prime Minister. In 1991, the markka was pegged to the currency <b>basket</b> <b>ECU,</b> but the peg {{had to be}} withdrawn after two months with a devaluation of 12%. In 1992, Finland {{was hit by a}} severe recession, the Early 1990s depression in Finland. It was caused by several factors, the most severe being the incurring of debt, as the 1980s economic boom was based on debt. Also, the Soviet Union had collapsed, which brought an end to bilateral trade, and existing trade connections were severed. The most important source of export revenue, Western markets, were also depressed during the same time. As a result, by some opinions years overdue, the artificial fixed exchange rate was abandoned and the markka was floated. Its value immediately decreased 13% and the inflated nominal prices converged towards German levels. In total, the value of the markka had decreased 40% {{as a result of the}} recession. Also, as a result, several entrepreneurs who had borrowed money denominated in foreign currency suddenly faced insurmountable debt.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from the}} past three years {{indicates}} that the exchange rate between the private ECU and the official <b>ECU</b> <b>Basket</b> can deviate substantially from par. The value of the private ECU is driven by expectations that a future European Central Bank will enforce par convertibility between the private ECU and the official <b>ECU</b> <b>basket</b> of currencies. Meanwhile, no existing institutional arrangement limits the private ECU’s value in terms of the Basket. This paper addresses the question of what determines the values of the private ECU and of private ECU interest rates. We show that an anticipation of a future fixing of the private ECU’s value, together with the interest rate setting mechanism of the large-value ECU payment and clearing system, are sufficient to determine its value. The determination of the private ECU exchange rate provides the template for how to determine the value of any private composite currency, such as, for example, a private SDR. ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{examines}} how the irrevocably fixed conversion {{rates for the}} currencies of countries participating in the EMU can be set. The authors recall the few provisions delineated in the Maastricht Treaty before examining the wide set of options available. If there are currencies in the <b>ECU</b> <b>basket</b> that do not participate to the single currency, setting conversion rates becomes more complicated. Moreover, the Lamfalussy rule for defining rates comports undesirable consequences. The authors conclude by proposing a multi-stage solution that {{is compatible with the}} recent Council regulation on the legal framework: announcement that the euro conversion rate will be set equal to the ECU market rate on the last day and a parallel agreement on the desired structure of bilateral rates of the inside countries.     JEL Codes: F 02, F 15 Keywords: EMU, Conversion rates, European currency unit, </p...|$|E
40|$|When the 1987 general {{elections}} brought a durable government to Portugal, the national environment was still inflationary. Nevertheless, {{thanks to the}} efforts of successive ministers of finance/central bank governor pairs, the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) were met and the seventh pair saw the euro conversion rate be set at 200 escudos. The agreed rate represents a depreciation of some 16 % over the one at which the escudo entered the <b>ECU</b> <b>basket</b> in 1989. As the change in regime towards stability-oriented macroeconomic policies was completed when the parity grid of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System (ERM) was under severe stress, escudo depreciations were agreed upon at realignments initiated by the peseta. The understanding by the Portuguese authorities of the ERM code of conduct as they prepared to join after the 1991 {{general elections}} made it possible to acquire financial reputation very quickly. But the enhanced national credibility abroad caused tension within several minister/governor pairs, especially with respect to the timing of ERM entry, the speed at which to move to full currency convertibility and whether the escudo should respond to peseta realignments. Moreover, both the opposition and the governing party initially resisted the stability-oriented policy, stalling structural reforms and allowing the opposition to win the 1995 general elections on a reformist platform. As a consequence, the stability-oriented policy was maintained until EMU qualification but there were no other major reforms, rasing the threat of a "euro hold-up". The weekly escudo-DMark rate reveals widely different volatility states which were accompanied by six successive exchange rate regimes. Before entering the ERM, a crawling peg was discreetly replaced by DMark shadowing with reinforced controls on capital inflows at the beginning of first stage of EMU. Yet, the escudo-DMark rate, even allowing for the last realignment, was more stable in the ERM than when it was inconvertible and the central bank controlled the currency. The comparison excludes the subperiod of crises before widening the bands and the one after volatility in prospective EMU qualifying currencies subsided. Markov switching autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (SWARCH) models with more than three states capture all regimes. The specification with five states is favored because it suggests the nature of the response of the central bank to speculative attacks during the crises regime.

40|$|This {{study will}} address {{the issues raised by}} the Commission's Green Paper. Thus study reaches the {{following}} conclusions regarding the legal implications of EMU for transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions, regardless of whether legislation ensuring the continuity of contracts is passed in particular American jurisdictions and regardless of whether such legislation applies prospectively or retroactively. II/ 636 / 97 The legal implications of the European economic and monetary union (EMU) under the laws of New York State and other U. S. jurisdictions {{is one of the most}} important legal questions facing the international financial markets today. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that at the end of March 1995 the OTC derivatives market stood at $ 47. 5 trillion. Approximately half of all derivatives contracts worldwide are believed to be governed by New York law, including most U. S. swap contracts, up to half of the swap contracts in the London derivatives market and a significant proportion of swap contracts in other offshore financial centers (e. g., Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore). The Deutsche mark is the world's second most widely used currency after the U. S. dollar, and taken together the 15 currencies of the European Union and the <b>ECU</b> <b>basket</b> currency form a powerful currency bloc. Aside from the derivatives market, eurobonds denominated in EU currencies are frequently issued by U. S. corporations in offshore transactions governed by New York law. As with derivatives contracts, many of these transactions involve long-term obligations. Finally, long-term loan agreements and cross-border commercial transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions also involve obligations denominated in EU currencies. In May 1995 the European Commission's Green Paper on the Practical Arrangements for the Introduction of the Single European Currency predicted that under the laws of non-EU jurisdictions the proposed single currency would be recognized as the successor to existing EU national currencies at the fixed conversion rates at which the single currency will substitute EU national currencies. The Commission's Green Paper thus concluded that under the laws of non-EU jurisdictions the continuity of monetary obligations and other terms of a contract such as interest rates and other ancillary obligations could be expected. This study {{will address the}} issues raised by the Commission's Green Paper. Thus study reaches the following conclusions regarding the legal implications of EMU for transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions, regardless of whether legislation ensuring the continuity of contracts is passed in particular American jurisdictions and regardless of whether such legislation applies prospectively or retroactively. All long-term debts denominated in EU currencies must be discharged in the new single European currency - the euro - at the official conversion rates at which the euro will substitute existing EU currencies. All foreign exchange transactions (e. g., FX forwards, cross currency swaps and currency options) in which an EU currency is used on one side of the transaction (e. g., a US$/DM swap) must be discharged in the euro at the applicable conversion rates. All foreign exchange transactions involving the exchange of two currencies participating in EMU (e. g., a DM/FFr swap) should also be discharged in the euro at the applicable conversion rates. In the case of contracts involving periodic payments (i. e., a cross currency interest rate swap) the economic effect will be to impose an obligation on one party to make net payments for the remaining life of the contract, similar to an annuity. It may be necessary to explore the tax implications of this with the U. S. tax authorities. All fixed interest rate obligations (including fixed rate swaps) must be discharged at the rate specified in the contract. All floating interest rate obligations linked to particular EU national currencies should be discharged in accordance with the interest rates established by successor price sources for the euro in the event that existing price sources are no longer available after EMU. Force majeure clauses used in debt transactions which call for the discharge of EU currency debts in U. S. dollars or some other currency in the event that the currency of the contract is no longer available due to circumstances beyond the party's control will not be triggered by EMU. Impossibility clauses used in debt transactions which call for the discharge of EU currency debts in U. S. dollars or some other currency in the event that the currency of the contract is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency should not be triggered by EMU. All obligations denominated in the <b>ECU</b> <b>basket</b> currency should be discharged in the euro at the rate of one euro for one ECU, unless the terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances establish a clear intention to the contrary. Substantially identical legislation confirming the continuity of contracts in accordance with the above principles has been proposed in the three leading U. S. trading jurisdictions â€” New York, Illinois and California. This legislation has been enacted into law in New York and Illinois. This study reaches the following conclusions with respect to this legislation. Notwithstanding certain possible discrepancies, the New York and Illinois legislation confirms the continuity of contracts after EMU in a manner that is broadly consistent with the continuity regulations endorsed by the Council of the European Union. Any discrepancies between the EU Council regulations and the New York or Illinois legislation must be resolved by applying the applicable rules established under the EU Council regulations. Assuming that the New York and Illinois legislation applies retroactively, the legislation does not contravene the provisions of the United States Constitution prohibiting the states from enacting legislation that impairs the obligation of contracts. This is because state legislation confirming the continuity of contracts after EMU in a manner that is broadly consistent with the EU Council regulations is declaratory of existing law and does not impair pre-existing contractual obligations in any manner. In any case, such legislation has been enacted to protect a broad societal interest (i. e., the avoidance of needless litigation after EMU), and would therefore be upheld by American courts in deference to the judgment of the state legislatures. Because the New York and Illinois legislation recognizes the continuity of contracts in a manner that is broadly consistent with the monetary sovereignty of the European Union over the currencies of EU member states, the legislation does not infringe the U. S. Federal Government's undisputed authority over international monetary relations. emu, economic and monetary union, usa, legal, new york...|$|E
