5000|$|Felling - After {{clearing}} the tree's base undergrowth for the retreat path and the felling direction; felling is properly done with three main cuts. To control the fall, the directional cut line should run 1/4 {{of the tree}} diameter to make a 45-degree wedge, which should be 90 degrees to the felling direction and perfectly horizontal. Make the top cut first then, the bottom cut is made to form the directional cut line at the wedge point. A narrow or nonexistent hinge lessens felling direction control. From {{the opposite side of}} the wedge, plan to finish the <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> cut 1/10 of the tree diameter from the direction cut line. The felling cut is made horizontally and slightly (1.5-2 inches; [...] ) above the bottom cut. When the hinge is properly set, the felling cut will begin the fall in the desired direction. A sitback is when a tree moves back opposite the intended direction. Placing a wedge in the felling cut can prevent a sitback from pinching the saw.|$|E

The thesis covers the analysis of five different fertilization scenarios, varying in fertilization intensity, from no fertilization at all, to fertilization at every harvesting operation (thinning or <b>final</b> <b>felling).</b> A sub-study was also carried out so the reader in detail can see how the different fertilization scenarios affect individual forest stands of different nature. The analysis has been done with the planning tool PlanWise, which is an application of the Heureka analysis and planning system. Of the analyzed scenarios it is most profitable to fertilize as much as possible, at each harvesting operation or twice before <b>final</b> <b>felling.</b> Among the analyzed scenarios, both net present value and harvesting volumes are higher the more the forest is fertilized. The size of the planning reserve has a relatively large impact on forest management. A low planning reserve results in a higher harvest volume already today compared to the current harvest level. A high planning reserve brings about low harvest volumes {{at the beginning of}} the of the planning periodas old forest must be saved to obtain a certain level of the planning reserve.

Postotni udjeli tehničke oblovine određeni ovim istraživanjem uspoređeni su s planskim vrijednostima (sortimentnim tablicama) koje se primjenjuju u šumarskoj operativi. Na temelju rezultata istraživanja izrađene su nove sortimentne tablice prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma od 1995. godine. Istraživanja su provedena na uzorku koji obuhvaća 787 stabala u proredama, 1025 stabala u pripremnim, 606 stabala u naplodnim i 583 stabala u dovršnim sjekovima. Sveukupno je istraživanjima obuhvaćeno 3001 primjerno stablo. Starost istraživanih sječina iznosila je od 59 do 91 godinu kod prethodnog prihoda (proreda), od 94 do 110 godina kod pripremnog sijeka, od 100 do 112 godina kod naplodnog sijeka te od 98 do 112 godina kod dovršnog sijeka. Dosadašnji je pristup određivanju sortimentne strukture jednodobnih bukovih sastojina u velikoj mjeri pogrešan. Operativne sortimentne tablice daju previsoke procjene za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente svih vrsta sjekova osim zadnjih sjekova oplodnih bukovih sječina. Tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata koje uvažavaju vrstu sijeka kao jedan od ulaza, omogućuju pouzdaniju procjenu sortimentne strukture sječine i preciznije planiranje sječivog etata. Pri tome su kao čimbenici razdvajanja uzeti kriteriji selekcije prilikom doznake stabala za sječu koji se primjenjuju do uključivo pripremnog sijeka. Iz tih su razloga tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata izrađene zasebno za prorede i pripremni sijek, a zasebno za naplodni i dovršni sijek. The {{subject of}} {{research}} was probability of appearance of technical roundwood timber assortments in trees according to type of felling, {{as well as}} the difference between shares of technical roundwood timber assortments according to diameter class and type of felling. The percentages of technical roundwood established in this research were compared to the planned values (assortment tables) which are applied in forestry operational bodies. Research was carried out on a sample consisting of 787 trees in thinning felling, 1025 trees in preparatory felling, 606 trees in seeding felling and 583 trees in <b>final</b> <b>felling.</b> An overall number of 3001 exemplary trees were included in the research. The age of the felling areas studied was between 59 and 91 years in the preliminary yield (thinning), 94 to 110 years in preparatory felling, 100 to 112 years in seeding felling, and 98 to 112 years in <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> areas. We think that the approach to establishing the assortment structure of even-aged beech stands taken so far is to a large extent wrong. The operative assortment tables give too high estimates of top quality timber assortments of all types of felling, except the <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> of seeding beech felling areas. Timber assortment tables that take into consideration the type of felling as one of the inputs, enable a more reliable estimate of assortment structure of the felling area and more precise planning of timber mass marked for felling. In this case, as a distinguishing factor, we took the selection criterion for marking trees for felling which is applied for the types up to, and including, the preparatory felling. For that reason, timber assortment tables were made separately for thinning and preparatory felling, and separately for seeding and <b>final</b> <b>felling.</b> On the basis of the research results, new assortment tables were made according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995.

Doznačena primjerna stabla razvrstana su prema najizraženijim vanjskim značajkama u devet grupa (kategorija). Istraživanje je provedeno na ukupno 36 objekata gospodarske jedinice Bjelovarska Bilogora. U objektima oplodnih sječa podaci su prikupljani u više navrata (sjekova). Na taj je način razvrstano 2. 308 doznačenih stabla u ukupno 46 navrata (sjekova). Svi objekti pripadaju ekološko-gospodarskom tipu II-D- 11 i uređajnom razredu BUKVA s ophodnjom od 100 godina. Postotna zastupljenost stabala s pozitivnim utjecajem na sorimentnu strukturu, ovisno o vrsti sijeka, kreće se oko 50 % kod proreda i pripremnog sijeka te oko 60 % kod naplodnog i dovršnog sijeka. Na ukupnost strukture drvnih sortimenata pojedine vrste sijeka najveći utjecaj imaju srednje debela i debela stabla, odnosno stabla iz debljinskih razreda većih od 41 cm prsnog promjera. Razlog tomu je činjenica da samo ta stabla potencijalno mogu sadržavati najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente (prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma iz 1995) zbog minimalnih dimenzija propisanih za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente. Postotna zastupljenost i razlika postotnog udjela broja stabala prsnog promjera većeg od 41 cm s pozitivnim utjecajem na sortimentnu strukturu raste od proreda prema dovršnom sijeku. Postotak zastupljenosti od strane čovjeka oštećenih stabala raste od proreda prema dovršnim sjekovima što se može povezati s intenziviranjem radova iskorištavanja šuma u vrijeme oplodnih sječa.

The {{subject of}} {{research}} were absolute and percentage share of assigned trees according to diameter class {{and type of}} felling and their influence on assortment structure of particular types of felling. The assigned exemplary trees were categorized {{according to the most}} prominent outward features into nine categories. The research was carried out on the total number of 36 areas of the economic unit Bjelovarska Bilogora. In the seeding felling areas data were collected on several occasions (felling). In that way, 2, 308 assigned trees were categorized in the total of 46 occasions (felling). All the areas belong to ecological-economical type II-D- 11 and structural class BEECH with the rotation of 100 years. The aim of the process was gaining more insight into the factors that influence assortment structure of stands, as well as completing the information on principles and ways of forest management in the past and nowadays. Analysis of the number of trees of particular categories according to the type of felling (stand age) and diameter class was carried out with the aim of finding the answers to questions pertaining to the criteria of assignment of one type of felling, as well as the degree of damage to stands during the exploiting of forest in the area subject to research. The assigned trees of group A (undamaged trees of normal growth) have, on the whole, extremely positive influence on assortment structure of particular type of felling. To these we can, to a certain extent, join pregrowth trees, i. e. group G, whose influence is limited mostly to thinning felling. Trees of all the other described groups have more or less negative effect on assortment structure of particular type of felling. The influence of suppressed trees (group H) on assortment structure is insignificant, and their importance for successful carrying out of seeding felling is considerable. The percentage of trees with positive influence on assortment structure according to the type of felling, stands about 50 % in thinning and preparatory felling, while in seeding and <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> it is about 60 %. Trees of medium diameter and large diameter, i. e. trees of diameter class between 41 cm and 60 cm, and those with breast diameter over 61 cm, have the greatest influence on the whole of tree assortment structure or particular types of felling. The reason for that is the fact that only those trees can potentially contain timber assortment of the highest quality (according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995) because of the minimal dimensions prescribed for timber assortments of the highest quality. Percentage of those trees with positive and negative influence on assortment structure is almost identical in case of thinning and preparatory felling, while in case of seeding and <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> the share of trees with positive effect is considerably higher than the percentage of trees with negative effect on assortment structure. It can be said that the percentage of trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with the positive effect on assortment structure grows from 5. 7 % in thinning felling to 57. 5 % in <b>final</b> <b>felling.</b> If we focus on the relation (difference) between the trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with positive and negative effect on assortment structure, we can easily say that this value ranges from – 2. 9 % in thinning felling to 22. 9 % in <b>final</b> <b>felling.</b> Trees damaged {{as a result of our}} activities, or human influence, are contained within groups with description marks of C, D, E and I. The percentage of trees damaged by human activity increases from thinning felling to <b>final</b> <b>felling.</b> For thinning felling, this percentage amounts to 11. 2 %, for preparatory felling it is 13. 1 %, for seeding felling it is 15. 8 %, while for <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> it amounts to 23. 3 % of damaged trees. The increase in participation of trees damaged in that way towards the end of rotation can be attributed to intensifying of exploitation of forests at the time of seeding felling. However, as much as 23. 3 % of damaged trees out of the assigned trees of <b>final</b> <b>felling,</b> i. e. almost one quarter of more or less damaged trees left for <b>final</b> <b>felling,</b> is the information which calls for some concern. The quality of assortment structure of stand varies within a large scope and depends on different kinds of influence, from timely and high-quality cultivation activities, over influence of habitats, to the extreme abiotic influences of accidental character. Assortment structure of beech stands is the focus of our interest only in the sense of increasing the overall quality of beech trees, i. e. achieving the largest possible percentage of high-quality beech trees in the stand. The percentage of timber assortments in beech stands of particular age (except for <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> and clear felling) is not our primary interest. The primary interest of forestry operational bodies (as well as science) is the quality and quantity of timber assortments that can be achieved through carrying out of particular type of felling, i. e. assortment structure of felling area. The share of timber assortments of particular type of felling is to a great extent a result of our decisions during the selection of trees for felling, by which we pursue the aim and the guidelines of stand management. The principles (rules) we apply while assigning trees for particular type of felling lead us to “save” the high-quality trees for the end of the rotation (seeding felling, <b>final</b> <b>felling).</b> Having that in mind, it is to be expected that the percentage of the timber assortments of the highest quality (within the same diameter class) will increase from thinning felling towards <b>final</b> <b>felling.</b> For that reason it is necessary to distinguish between the assortment structure of stand and the assortment structure of felling area (specific types of felling). The assortment structure of stand varies within a wide and unknown scope, and its quality is the result of the success of our management in the past. Only in that sense does the assortment structure of stand influence the assortment structure of felling area. The increase in percentage shares of high-quality timber assortments according to diameter classes from thinning felling to <b>final</b> <b>felling</b> is a pattern determined by our decisions, i. e. expert conduct of cultivation activities of assigning trees for felling. This pattern is constant in the same measure as the principles of management and the manner of their implementation are constant...|$|E
