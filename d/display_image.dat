25|$|Dynamic color {{convergence}} and purity {{are one of}} {{the main}} reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of <b>display</b> <b>image</b> rotation, skew, and other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under user control.|$|E

50|$|Liquid crystal light valves work by {{rotating}} light between two polarizing filters. Due to these internal polarizers, LCD shutter-glasses darken the <b>display</b> <b>image</b> of any LCD, plasma, or projector image source, {{which has the}} result that images appear dimmer and contrast is lower than for normal non-3D viewing. This {{is not necessarily a}} usage problem; for some types of displays which are already very bright with poor grayish black levels, LCD shutter glasses may actually improve the image quality.|$|E
50|$|The OpenGL RSC is {{implemented}} using a reverse scan conversion approach which calculates for every image pixel {{the most appropriate}} radar amplitude value in the polar store. This approach generates an optimal image without any artifacts known from forward spoke fill algorithms. By applying bi-linear filtering between adjacent pixels in the polar store during the conversion process the OpenGL RSC finally achieves a very high visual quality radar <b>display</b> <b>image</b> for every zoom level, creating smooth images of the radar echoes.|$|E

50|$|Simple {{types of}} LCDs {{such as in}} pocket calculators are built without an {{internal}} light source, requiring external light sources to convey the <b>display</b> <b>image</b> to the user. Most LCD screens, however, are built with an internal light source. Such screens consist of several layers. The backlight is usually the first layer from the back. Light valves then vary the amount of light reaching the eye, by blocking its passage in some way. Most use a fixed polarizing filter and a switching one, to block the undesired light.|$|E
