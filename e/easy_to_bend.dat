[...] Hylton explained that the A330 [...] "was considered {{to be among the}} safest" [...] of the passenger aircraft. Hylton added that when [...] "Flight 447 seemed to disappear from the sky, it was tempting to deliver a tidy narrative about the hubris of building a self-flying aircraft, Icarus falling from the sky. Or maybe Flight 447 was the Titanic, an uncrashable ship {{at the bottom of the}} sea." [...] Dr. Guy Gratton, an aviation expert from the Flight Safety Laboratory at Brunel University, said, [...] "This is an air accident the likes of which we haven't seen before. Half the accident investigators in the Western world - and in Russia too - are waiting for these results. This has been the biggest investigation since Lockerbie. Put bluntly, big passenger planes do not just fall out of the sky." ...|$|E

However, when the height of model was above than the certain value, the model was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> in the intermediate region. Some results such as force and shearing stress had been gotten.

40|$|A b s t r a c t Background: Management of {{patients}} with acquired heart malformations, including aortic valve disease, is still challenging. Due to ageing of population, patients undergoing valve surgery are older than in the past. The 3 F Therapeutics, conducting a programme of construction of heart valves for transarterial or transapical implatation, prepared the ‘Enable ’ bioprosthetic valve for sutureless insertion in the aortic position. The first world implantation was performed in our Department on 13 January 2005. Aim: To present our experience, qualification criteria and methods of implantation of sutureless bioprosthesis of aortic valve – ‘Enable’. Methods: The ‘Enable ’ valve is a tubular structure, tailored and sutured of equine pericardium, treated with glutaraldehyde, and mounted on an openwork Nitinol ™ alloy stent. It consists of two distal rings connected with three vertical sticks. The characteristic property of nitinol is thermoplaticity: due to refrigeration it becomes elastic and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>bend,</b> after rewarming returns to the initial dimensions and shape, remaining stable at the body temperature. Distension of the nitinol ring make possible strong mounting of the valve in aortic annulus. The examined group consised of 27 patients (16 males, 11 females), aged 60 - 78 years (average 69. 5), with advanced aortic valve disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and aortic gradient up to 102 mmHg. Exclusion criteria were: severe annular deformations or bicuspid aortic valve, other valves ’ malformations, coronary disease, severe other comorbidities or no agreement for ‘Enable ’ valve implantation. The patients were operated using extracorporeal circulation, general moderate hypothermia and col...|$|E

30|$|Prior to {{structural}} optimization, the radii of {{the innermost}} walls are 2.1, 3.8, and 5.6 nm for 5 -wall, 10 -wall, and 15 -wall removed MWCNTs, respectively. As shown in Figure 3, upon energy relaxation, the cross-sections {{of all the}} MWCNTs are transformed from circular to polygonal shapes with flattened sides. The cross-sectional shapes in Figure 3 h and 3 m agree well with reported experimental results [35, 52]. A general trend is observed: along each column {{from top to bottom}} or along each row from left to right, the configurations of the innermost walls deviate progressively further from the circular shape. These morphological evolutions are generally due to the competition of the inter-wall vdW energy release and the out-of-plane bending penalty, as discussed earlier. Along each column from top to bottom, with increasing radius of the innermost walls, the innermost walls and the whole MWCNTs are increasingly more complaint, and thus <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> facilitate inter-wall vdW energy release. While along each row from left to right, with increasing wall numbers, the increasingly more excessive inter-wall vdW energy imposes progressively higher compressive stress onto the innermost walls, thereby inducing larger deformation from their circular shape.|$|R

5000|$|Some players, like Duane Allman, {{deviate from}} the norm and [...] "top wrap" [...] their strings. This is when the {{direction}} of the string path is reversed so that the strings are threaded through {{the leading edge of the}} stopbar then come out the rear and wrapped over the top of the stop bar. The advantage is that strings are supposedly <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> because of the decreased string break angle. Also, the [...] "nonspeaking" [...] string length is increased, which may have an effect on the strings' harmonic vibration (see sympathetic resonance). The increased tendency for the strings to produce natural harmonics may make techniques such as pinch harmonics <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> accomplish. This is the same way that a wraparound stoptail bridge is strung. Regardless of the technique used, the tension provided by tightening the strings to pitch is the only thing keeping the stopbar in place, unless it is a [...] "locking" [...] type.|$|R
50|$|Molded carpet {{generally}} {{refers to}} the carpets used in the interiors of cars. The molded carpet is designed to hug the floorpans {{so there are no}} pockets of loose fitting carpet. The process of creating the molded carpet requires the original floor pans and having the carpet laid upon the pans with a backing in between. There are generally two types of backings, poly backing and mass backing. Mass backing is the original type of backing that most car makers use. It's thicker and more rubber-like than poly backing. Poly backing is lighter, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> and more mesh like than mass backing. Some molded carpets come with jute backing where your feet rest on the floor pans. This helps prevent the carpet from wearing out prematurely because the majority of the wear is where feet contact the carpet. The jute padding also helps prevent mildew which was more of a problem in older leaking cars than modern cars.|$|R

5000|$|More common (especially in {{blues and}} rock) is [...] "crossharp" [...] or [...] "second position" [...] playing which {{involves}} {{playing in the}} key which is a perfect fourth below the key of the harmonica (for example, on a C tuned harmonica, a second position blues would be in G—resulting in the instrument playing in mixolydian mode). This is because the notes of the G pentatonic scale (a commonly used scale in blues and rock) are more easily accessible on a C-tuned harmonica. The lower notes of harps in the lower keys (G through C) are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>bend,</b> but take more wind. Since much of crossharp is played on the inhalation, every opportunity for exhalation must be capitalized upon—by blowing out lots of air on every exhaled note and during every pause. Crossharp lends itself to seventh and ninth chords (particularly G7 and G9) as well as blue notes (particularly on D chords, where the harmonica is tuned to play D minor while the other instruments play D major).|$|R
5000|$|Although most irons are now {{produced}} by investment casting, many high end iron sets are still {{produced by}} forging, as the resulting clubhead is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> adjust by <b>bending</b> <b>to</b> adapt the set to a player's specific needs.

2500|$|In any case, {{he decided}} to {{continue}} playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle – [...] "melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger" [...] – and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. [...] Secondly, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings <b>to</b> make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> do so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970–71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles [...] "helped with his technique" [...] {{because he had to}} use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on [...] "Children of the Grave", [...] "Lord of this World", and [...] "Into the Void", all on the album Master of Reality). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a [...] "bigger, heavier sound", slackening the strings makes it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> them.|$|R
