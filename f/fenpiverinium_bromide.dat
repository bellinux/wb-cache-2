50|$|<b>Fenpiverinium</b> <b>bromide</b> is {{typically}} used {{in combination with}} <b>fenpiverinium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and metamizole sodium. Previously produced as Baralgin by Sanofi Aventis, the drug is currently sold in Eastern Europe under various trade names, including Spasmalgon (Actavis, Bulgaria), Revalgin (Shreya, India), Spasgan (Wockhardt, India), Bral (Micro Labs, India), and others. It relieves pain and spasms of smooth muscles.|$|E
40|$|Three simple, {{precise and}} {{economical}} UV {{methods have been}} developed for estimation of <b>Fenpiverinium</b> <b>bromide</b> insingle component. <b>Fenpiverinium</b> <b>bromide</b> has the absorbance maxima in zero order spectra is 258. 5 nm (Method A). Method B applied was First order derivative for the analysis of <b>Fenpiverinium</b> <b>bromide</b> at 214. 5 nm. Method Capplied was area under curve in the wavelength range of 261. 5 - 255. 5 nm. Drug followed Beer-Lambert’s law in theconcentration range of 10 - 60 μg/ml for zero order and area under curve method and 10 - 50 μg/ml for first orderderivative spectrum. Results of analysis were validated statistically...|$|E
40|$|EN) In {{the first}} part of this work, {{analytical}} methods for determination of impurities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in combined pharmaceutical dosage forms were developed and validated. Development of the methods covered both the optimization of sample preparation procedure and chromatographic conditions. The methods were validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guideline and both of them were confirmed to be able to analyze stability samples. Impurities in paracetamol, codeine phosphate hemihydrate and pitophenone hydrochloride in the presence of fourth API <b>fenpiverinium</b> <b>bromide</b> were separated by using ion-pair reversed phase chromatography with gradient elution. Symmetry C 18, 250 x 4, 6 mm, 5 µm heated to 35 řC was used as a separation column. A diode array detector was used. The detection wavelengths were set as follows: 220 nm for paracetamol impurity K, 245 nm for paracetamol and its other impurities and 285 nm for codeine, pitophenone and their impurities. Impurities in valsartan, amlodipine besylate and hydrochlorothiazide were separated by reversed phase UHPLC method with gradient elution. Chromatographic column Zorbax Eclipse C 8 RRHD, 100 x 3, 0 mm, 1, 8 µm heated to 30 řC and spectrophotometric detection were used. The detection wavelengths were set as [...] ...|$|E
