25|$|The Surrey Street Pumping Station is Grade II listed; it {{was built}} in four phases. {{starting}} with the engine house in 1851, with a further engine house in 1862, a further extension in 1876-7 to house a compound <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine</b> and a further extension in 1912.|$|E
25|$|The LH {{designation}} {{stood for}} Lightweight chassis, <b>Horizontal</b> <b>engine.</b> It replaced the Bristol SU and was succeeded by the Leyland National B Series for operators {{in need of}} a small or lightweight bus. The Bristol RE was in production at the same time for those in need of larger or more robust vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Steam power came to {{the mill}} in three major {{building}} phases. In 1865 a beam engine house was built, together with a boiler house and the first chimney on the site. In the 1890s a second beam engine arrived, the boiler house was extended and the existing chimney built, and then in 1910 the existing <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine</b> was fitted, the Green's economiser house added and the boiler house extended again.|$|E

50|$|Patagonia was a steam-sail {{armoured}} cruiser {{with steel}} hull and wooden planking, and armoured conning tower. It was propelled by two compound <b>horizontal</b> <b>engines,</b> and two masts with brick sails.|$|R
50|$|Previous Herbert Austin {{cars for}} Wolseley Motors, which Austin founded, kept <b>horizontal</b> <b>engines</b> after {{vertical}} engines became the norm. Herbert Austin allowed {{his refusal to}} specify vertical engines to become the contract-breaking component of his disagreements with the Wolseley directors. He would provide a list of very pressing reasons for giving preference to <b>horizontal</b> <b>engines.</b> This 25-30, the first car bearing his own name, had a vertical engine. Either Austin reviewed his stance and changed it or his backers made him change. This vertical straight 4-cylinder 318 cu in (5185 cc) T-head engine with 4½ in bore x 5 in stroke (114 mm x 127 mm) was automatically governed {{to a maximum of}} 900 rpm.|$|R
25|$|The dock {{maintenance}} workshops {{are also}} survivors from the 1880s but were extended {{in the early}} 20th century. The brick building is topped with a tiled double-pile hipped roof with corbelled eaves. It has sliding doors at each end, giving access to the boiler and engine houses, blacksmith's and engineer's shops. Much of the original machinery survives, including steam-powered plant from the mid-1880s, these include a Whitworth planing machine, a Whitworth slotting machine, punching-and-shearing machines, a long-bed lathe and a steam hammer. There is also wall-mounted line-shafting and a Tangye <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine</b> and Cornish boiler.|$|E
500|$|The Super Cub {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Ford Model T, Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport. The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis, with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine</b> placed below the central spine, a configuration now called the 'step through' or 'underbone' motorcycle. By some criteria, the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify, landing somewhere between a scooter and a motorcycle, and sometimes it was called a moped, [...] "", or scooterette.|$|E
2500|$|For the adaptation, Dickerson {{purchased}} a $5,000, [...] stationary <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine,</b> with a [...] cylinder and [...] stroke, {{built by the}} Fishkill Landing Machine Works. Dickerson took eight months to adapt the engine to the yacht, at an overall cost of $16,178.08. On Clara Claritas trial trip, Dickerson's engine adaptation proved a complete failure. After Dickerson failed to return to rectify the problems, Jerome hired two qualified engineers, who, after another trial, agreed that the machinery was unfit for service.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result was}} the Class 17, fitted with a centre cab and low engine covers. These {{requirements}} meant that instead of having a single large engine, {{it was necessary to}} use two smaller six-cylinder <b>horizontal</b> <b>engines,</b> one {{on either side of the}} cab.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine room}} housed three {{compound}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>engines</b> and three dynamos. At 100 revolutions per minute, with a pressure of [...] per square inch, each engine developed [...] At 450 revolutions per minutes the dynamos gave an output of 260 amps at 350 volts.|$|R

The Corvair engine received its first size increase to [...] via {{a slight increase in}} bore size and was rated at [...] The base engine was still rated at [...] when paired with the manual transmissions and [...] when mated to the optional automatic transmission in Monza models. To increase luggage capacity in the front trunk, the spare tire was relocated to the engine compartment (in cars without air-conditioning) and new [...] "direct air" [...] heater directed warmed air from the cylinders and heads to the passenger compartment. The gasoline heater remained available as an option through 1963. Factory air conditioning was offered as a mid-1961 option introduction. The condenser lay flat atop the <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine</b> fan. A large, green-painted reverse rotation version of the standard GM Frigidaire air conditioning compressor was used, and an evaporator housing was added under the dash with integrated outlets surrounding the radio housing. Air conditioning was not available on wagons, Greenbrier/Corvair 95, or the turbocharged models introduced later, due to space constraints.|$|E

Abbey Mill Oldham (1876) needed 700 hp, Nile Mill (1896) needed 2500 hp. By the 1890, boilers produced 160 psi, and the triple expansion horizontals became standard. Chimneys were octagonal.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{internal}} combustion gas engines {{were developed to}} burn gasses produced from blast furnaces, {{eliminating the need for}} fuel for steam boilers and increasing efficiency. Bethlehem Steel was one such company to employ this technology. Huge, usually single-cylinder <b>horizontal</b> <b>engines</b> burned blast furnace gas. SA John Cockerill of Belgium and Körting of Hannover were both noted makers of such engines.|$|R
50|$|The Fitchburg engine (illus.) {{was one of}} {{a series}} of similar engines offered in various configurations. The steeple {{arrangement}} required a high ceiling to the engine house, but had two advantages: it took up less floor space than a <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine</b> and it also required less complex masonry foundations beneath the engine. A vertical engine could be erected on any reasonably level base that was strong enough to bear its weight. A <b>horizontal</b> <b>engine</b> required carefully aligned brickwork to support both the crankshaft and cylinder(s) separately. Such brickwork was costly, took time to build and also prevented new engines being installed in old engine houses without expensive rebuilding.|$|E
