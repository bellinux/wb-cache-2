25|$|When Andrea Doria and Stockholm {{collided}} {{at almost}} a 90° angle, Stockholms sharply raked <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> prow pierced Andrea Dorias starboard side {{about one-third of}} her length from the bow. It penetrated the hull {{to a depth of}} nearly , and the keel. Below the waterline, five fuel tanks on Andrea Doria's starboard side were torn open, and they filled with thousands of tons of seawater. Meanwhile, air was trapped in the five empty tanks on the port side, causing them to float more readily, contributing to a severe list. The ship's large fuel tanks were mostly empty {{at the time of the}} collision, since the ship was nearing the end of her voyage, but all the empty fuel tanks did was further increase the list.|$|E

She made six voyages between the United States and Manila in the Philippines before being {{returned}} to her owners. In 1900, Victoria sailed from the Puget Sound to Nome carrying hundreds of prospectors as part of the Klondike Gold Rush. In 1901, she was re-sold to the Northern Pacific Steamship Company, only to be resold three years later to the Northwestern Steamship Company. Under this new ownership, she permanently entered Alaskan service. Victoria's inch thick wrought-iron hull proved excellent for <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> capabilities. In 1905, Victoria was used as a blockade runner in the Russo-Japanese War, assisting the port of Vladivostok in Russia.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} his Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973), [...] "a formidable piece of abstract composition" [...] according to Bowen, Tippett {{returned to the}} modern vernacular in his fourth opera The Ice Break (1976). Describing the music in {{an introduction to the}} published libretto, Tippett identifies [...] "two archetypal sounds: one relating to the frightening but exhilarating sound of the <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> on the great northern rivers in the spring; the other related to the exciting or terrifying sound of the slogan-shouting crowds, which can lift you on your shoulders in triumph, or stamp you to death". [...] Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of The Midsummer Marriage". William Mann in The Times [...] was equally enthusiastic, finding the music compelling and worthy of many a rehearing.|$|E

500|$|In {{the dark}} winter months of May, June and July, Shackleton was {{concerned}} to maintain fitness, training and morale. Although the scope for activity was limited, {{the dogs were}} exercised (and on occasion raced competitively), men were encouraged to take moonlight walks, and aboard ship there were attempted theatricals. Special occasions such as Empire Day (24 May) were duly celebrated. The first signs of the <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> up occurred on 22 July. On 1 August, in a south-westerly gale with heavy snow, the ice floe began to disintegrate all around the ship, the pressure forcing masses of ice beneath the keel and causing a heavy list to port. The position was perilous; Shackleton wrote: [...] "The effects of the pressure around us was awe-inspiring. Mighty blocks of ice [...] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones gripped between thumb and finger [...] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed". This danger passed, and the succeeding weeks were quiet. During this relative lull the ship drifted into the area where, in 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell of the sealer Wasp reported seeing a coastline which he identified as [...] "New South Greenland". There {{was no sign of}} any such land; Shackleton concluded that Morrell had been deceived by the presence of large icebergs.|$|E
500|$|The best-known {{and most}} widely {{credited}} {{suggestion is that}} made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book De döda på Vitön ("The Dead on Kvitøya") in 1952: that the men succumbed to trichinosis, which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat. Larvae of Trichinella spiralis were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundström and Sundman both favor this explanation. Critics note that the diarrhea, which Tryde cites as the main symptomatic evidence, hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, but some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing. Also, Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen had lived largely on polar bear meat {{in exactly the same}} area for 15 months without any ill effects. Other suggestions have included vitamin A poisoning from eating polar bear liver; however, the diary shows Andrée to have been aware of this danger. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a theory that has found a few adherents, such as the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson. [...] The chief objection is that their primus stove had kerosene still in the tank when found. [...] Stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove, something he has experienced in his own expeditions. Lead poisoning from the cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion, as are scurvy, botulism, suicide (they had plenty of opium), and polar bear attack. A combination favoured by Kjellström is that of cold and hypothermia as the Arctic winter closed in, with dehydration and general exhaustion, apathy, and disappointment. Kjellström argues that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> up under their promisingly mobile home, forcing them to move onto a glacier island. [...] "Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvitøya, surrounded by food," [...] writes Kjellström. [...] "The surprise is rather that they found the strength to live so long" [...] (p.54).|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to clarify the formation, break and flow of river ice on frozen rivers. The {{aim of this study}} is to clarify <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> and flow phenomena during river ice breakup, as these phenomena are the initial stages of ice jam. With regard to the <b>break</b> of river <b>ice,</b> we developed a method of judging <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> by comparing the stress caused by the flowing water and flowing ice, and the allowable bending stress of the river ice. The ice flow is expressed using the continuity equation that considers the change in amount of ice, and the equation of motion that considers the effect of the flowing water.

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the role}} of topography, tree stand characteristics and management on the susceptibility of forest stands to abiotic natural disturbances. In 1996, stands of Börzsöny Mts, Hungary were hit by a severe ice storm, then by strong winds three years later.

The role of variables in predicting <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> and windfall was investigated by non-parametric statistical tests and {{by a series of}} C&RT (Classification and Regression Tree) analyses. Elevation, aspect and slope proved to have strong statistical relationships with the distribution of both <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> and windfall, with misclassification error (MER) of 18 % and 15 %, respectively, if studied without stand descriptors. Mixing ratio and age of beech were the most important stand descriptors to explain the distribution of <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> (MER= 15 %), whereas that of windfall was best described by the age and height of the two dominant tree species (MER= 11 %). The explanatory power could be increased if all variables (topographic + stand descriptors) were considered, though the increase in explanatory power was higher in the case of <b>ice</b> <b>break</b> (MER decreased from 15 % to 11 %) than for windfall (MER decreased from 11 % to 10 %). Since management related stand variables (beech mixture ratio, age, height, amount of recently felled stock, slenderness) and susceptibility to disturbance events seemed to be related, our results suggest that the sensitivity of tree stands could be decreased by increasing compositional and structural heterogeneity...|$|R

The second plane crash was when General Murray was an executive for an aerospace company and was aboard the company's business jet as a passenger. The plane began its descent for landing on a very cold winter day in Michigan. General Murray, concerned about an ice buildup, looked out the window over the wing and noticed large sheets of ice on the wings. He quickly notified the pilots, but it was too late. General Murray then observed the <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> off of the wings and being sucked into the jet engine intakes.

2500|$|Grand Trunk Western was one {{of three}} Michigan railroads, along with the Ann Arbor Railroad and Pere Marquette Railway, that {{operated}} separate railcar ferry service across Lake Michigan between Michigan and Wisconsin. Loading rail cars onto ships that had rails mounted to their decks, and ferrying the cars east and west across Lake Michigan, allowed railroads to bypass the congested rail interchanges in Chicago and move time sensitive freight more quickly. GTW's ferry service was originally operated by the former Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH) which Grand Trunk Railway acquired in 1882. [...] DGH initially had agreements with ferry companies operating on Lake Michigan to transfer its passengers and freight onto ships bound for Milwaukee form Grand Haven, Michigan. GTW's rail car ferry service began in 1902 with an operating agreement with the steamship company, Crosby Transportation Company. The railway constructed ferry slip docks at Grand Haven and Milwaukee and had two steamships built, the SS Grand Haven and SS Milwaukee, capable of carrying 26 freight railcars. In 1905 Grand Trunk assumed Crosby's interest and incorporated the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company to operate the ships. [...] In Milwaukee GTW interchanged rail cars with The Milwaukee Road, Chicago and North Western and the Soo Line. The ownership of the ferry company was shared with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) from 1927 until 1954 and sailed as the Grand Trunk-Pennsylvania Route. The SS Milwaukee sank loaded with rail cars in a storm after departing Milwaukee in October 1929 with everyone aboard lost. [...] Three new ships, the Grand Rapids, Madison, and the City of Milwaukee constructed between 1926 and 1931, replaced the Grand Haven and Milwaukee. The ships required a crew of 34 and with strengthen <b>ice</b> <b>breaking</b> hauls operated year round. On PRR's request GTW moved its Michigan docks to Muskegon in 1937 where its subsidiary the Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company initially operated ferry loading and switching operations. GTW had also changed its route into Muskegon with trackage rights over PRR's line from Grand Rapids. [...] By 1968 GTW was shipping over [...] of freight a year across Lake Michigan. However, the ferry service began running deficits of over $1 million annually in the 1970s and in 1975 GTW petitioned the ICC to end the service. Permission was eventually granted and the last ferry sailed on October 31, 1978.|$|E
