5|$|After passing Carlyon Bay {{the path}} {{comes to the}} much busier china-clay {{exporting}} port of Par, where it goes inland of the dock site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints' Way, a coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows the cliff tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin <b>Head.</b> <b>From</b> here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast.|$|E
5|$|Cape Fear {{experienced}} minor beach erosion. The erosion, {{combined with}} high waves, washed out {{a portion of}} a roadway. The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200cars and flooded nearly 500. Strong wind gusts left around 10,000buildings without power. Many places were not restored for two to three days after the storm. Wind and storm surge damaged over 100houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5million (2004USD). Two days after the storm passed, a man drowned off of Nags <b>Head</b> <b>from</b> strong rip currents and waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm.|$|E

5|$|Holmes was a {{stand-up}} style goaltender; {{later on in}} his career, Holmes wore a cap when in goal to protect his <b>head</b> <b>from</b> objects thrown by spectators, as it presented a tempting target to them. Holmes coached minor-league teams after his retirement, notably the Toronto Millionaires of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL) and the Cleveland Indians of the International Hockey League (IHL). Holmes died on June 27, 1941, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida and was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Isa Abdulhasan Ali Hussain was a 60-year-old Bahraini {{who died}} on 17 February morning {{immediately}} after riot police fired at his <b>head</b> <b>from</b> point-blank range. Hussain {{was a part of}} a group of protesters who marched back towards Pearl Roundabout after being dispersed when police shot him. Eyewitnesses say he went near security forces asking them to allow young people help the injured protesters. However, police claimed he was with a group of protesters who attacked them using metal rods, swords, molotov cocktails, stones and other weapons. His funeral was held on 18February in Karzakan and was attended by thousands of mourners. An unnamed policeman charged with his murder was acquitted on 27 September 2012.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} following Hard Justice that Shane Douglas was originally supposed to handle interview duties for the show, but {{came down with}} the stomach flu {{and was replaced by}} Terry Taylor. Also, that Jeff Hardy missed multiple flights causing him to arrive after the conclusion of the show. Hardy was subsequently suspended for this and past instances of no-showing events. Abyss and Ron Killings were the only ones to receive injuries at Hard Justice. Abyss was given a fairly deep cut {{on the top of his}} <b>head</b> <b>from</b> being bashed with a steel chair by Killings that required stitches. Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto a steel chair.|$|E

5|$|The Antonine Wall and its {{associated}} forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to Diana and Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house {{in the shape of}} a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E

5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the imminent arrival of the stoor worm sought {{the advice of a}} wise man or spaeman, who suggests that the beast might be appeased if it is fed seven virgins every week. In line with the wise man's advice, every Saturday the islanders provide a sacrificial offering of seven virgins, who were tied up and placed on the beach for the serpent to sweep into its mouth as it reared its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the sea.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the passing}} of the City and Suburban Electric Railways (Amendment) Act in 1947, {{construction}} finally commenced on a variation of the Bradfield's proposal. Two lines would be built: one proceeding on a viaduct out to Kings Cross, then eventually to Bondi Beach. Another line would <b>head</b> <b>from</b> St James via Taylor Square and the Sydney Cricket Ground, extending to Kingsford, with a proposal to extend from Taylor Square to Coogee. Construction commenced on sites around Central station but ceased in 1952 due to a recession. Work remained abandoned for over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.|$|E

5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its <b>head</b> <b>from</b> {{side to side}} to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited {{by most of the}} organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E
5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the <b>head</b> <b>from</b> an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E
