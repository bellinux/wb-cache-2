5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E

5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions.

In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{directed}} towards {{the issue of}} the long-term demand and supply of biomass for food, energy and materials. In the coming decades, the global requirements for biomass for such services are likely to increase substantially. Therefore, improved knowledge of options for mitigating the long-term production requirements and the associated effects on the Earth system is essential. The thesis gives a thorough survey of the current flows of biomass in the food system. This survey was carried out by means of a physical model which was developed as part of the work. For eight world regions, the model is used to calculate the necessary production of crops and other phytomass from a prescribed end-use of food, efficiency in food production and processing, as well as use of by-products and residues. The model includes all major categories of phytomass used in the food system, depicts all flows and processes on a mass and energy balance basis, and contains detailed descriptions of the production and use of all major by-products and residues generated within the system. The global appropriation of terrestrial phytomass production induced by the food system was estimated to some 13 Pg dry matter per year in 1992 - 94. Of this phytomass, about 0. 97 Pg, or 7. 5 percent, ended up as food commodities eaten. Animal food systems accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total appropriation of phytomass, whereas their contribution to the human diet was about one-tenth. Use of by-products and residues as feed, and for other purposes within the food system, was estimated to about 1. 8 Pg dry matter, or 14 percent of the total phytomass appropriation. The results also show large differences in efficiency for animal food systems, between regions as well as between separate commodities. The <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of cattle meat systems were estimated to about 2 percent in industrial regions, and around 0. 5 percent in most non-industrial regions (on gross energy basis). For pig and poultry systems, <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were roughly a factor of ten higher. The differences suggest that there is a substantial scope for mitigating the long-term production demand for crops and other phytomass by increases in efficiency and changes in dietary preferences...|$|R

40|$|Background and PurposeNapiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumacher) and pangolagrass (Digitaria decumbens Stent) are {{two major}} forage grasses for cow feeding. They possess high yields and high {{regeneration}} properties. Inoculation of cellulolytic microbes on herbage could enhance the protein content of herbage and promote digestibility in chickens. MethodsCellulolytic microbes were isolated from various sources and cultivated on napiergrass and pangolagrass with solid-state fermentation for protein enrichment and in vitro digestion improvement. The fermented napiergrass and pangolagrass were used as the main protein source in chicken diets to assess the feasibility for non-ruminants feed. ResultsAfter a 42 -day fermentation period, napiergrass showed higher protein contents (13. 4 – 13. 9 %) than those of pangolagrass(11. 1 – 11. 7 %).

This study used experimental method based on Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 5 treatments and 3 replications. Five diets (33 % isoprotein and 3. 85 kcal/g diet isoenergi) were formulated with substitution of the chiken feather silage meal to fishmeal protein. These substituted 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % (A, B, C, D and E respectively) of the fishmeal protein. Parameters observed and analyzed were: survival rate, specific growth rate, <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio, protein <b>efficiency</b> ratio, protein retention and protein digestibility. The results showed that the treatment had no effect on survival rate, specific growth rate, <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio, protein <b>efficiency</b> ratio, and protein retention but the effect on protein digestibility. Based on these results, it can be concluded that fishmeal protein can be substituted with the chiken feather silage meal up to 100 % in the feed formula of Colossoma macropomum...|$|R
40|$|Beef cattle {{contribute}} 7 % of anthropocentric {{greenhouse gas}} emissions in Australia through the release of methane into the atmosphere. Cattle in northern Australia produce more methane per unit of beef produced because tropical grasses are generally of poor quality and elicit slower average growth rates. In this paper the level of emissions from different herds and some strategies to reduce emissions are estimated with a daily time-step model. The results indicate that few options exist to reduce methane emissions from extensive grazing systems without reducing beef production. Options to improve production or <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> can generate lower levels of emissions per kg of beef produced, but {{can be expected to}} lead to increased livestock numbers and higher overall methane emissions. A woodland grazing case study from central Queensland suggests the opportunity cost of reducing each kg of methane emissions by reducing stocking rates ranges from 1. 0 to 1. 2 kg of liveweight beef production. A price of $ 23 per t of carbon dioxide equivalent would indicate that opportunity costs (ignoring fixed costs of production) of reducing emissions by adjusting stocking rates would range between $ 0. 39 and $ 0. 49 per kg of beef produced...|$|R
