6000|$|The day {{was soon}} fixed, but fixed not entirely in {{reference}} to the wants of Gertrude and her wedding. Lucy had also to be married from the same house, and the day for her marriage had already been arranged. Sir Thomas had ordered that everything should be done for Lucy as though she were a daughter of the house, and her wedding had been arranged for the last week in May. When he heard that Ayala and Colonel Stubbs were also engaged he was anxious that the two sisters should be [...] "buckled," [...] as he called it, on the same occasion,--and he magnanimously offered to take upon himself the entire expense of the <b>double</b> <b>arrangement,</b> intimating that the people in Kingsbury Crescent had hardly room enough for a wedding. But Ayala, acting probably under Stalham influences, would not consent to this. Lady Albury, who was now in London, was determined that Ayala's marriage should take place from her own house; and, as Aunt Margaret and Uncle Reginald had consented, that matter was considered as settled. But Sir Thomas, having fixed his mind upon a double wedding, resolved that Gertrude and Lucy should be the joint brides. Gertrude, who still suffered perhaps a little in public estimation from the Ostend journey, was glad enough to wipe out that stain as quickly as possible, and did not therefore object to the arrangement. But to the Captain there was something in it by which his more delicate feelings were revolted. It was a matter of course that Ayala should be present at her sister's wedding, and would naturally appear there {{in the guise of a}} bridesmaid. She would also, now, act as a bridesmaid to Gertrude,--her future position as Mrs. Colonel Stubbs giving her, as was supposed, sufficient dignity for that honourable employment. But Captain Batsby, not so very long ago, had appeared among the suitors for Ayala's hand; and therefore, as he said to Gertrude, he felt a little shamefaced about it. [...] "What does that signify?" [...] said Gertrude. [...] "If you say nothing to her about it, I'll be bound she'll say nothing to you." [...] And so it was on the day of the wedding. Ayala did not say a word to Captain Batsby, nor did Captain Batsby say very much to Ayala.|$|E

50|$|The rood screen (also choir screen, chancel screen, or jube) is {{a common}} feature in late medieval church architecture. It is {{typically}} an ornate partition between the chancel and nave, of more or less open tracery constructed of wood, stone, or wrought iron. The rood screen would originally have been surmounted by a rood loft carrying the Great Rood, a sculptural representation of the Crucifixion. In English, Scots, and Welsh cathedral, monastic, and collegiate churches, there were commonly two transverse screens, with a rood screen or rood beam located one bay west of the pulpitum screen, but this <b>double</b> <b>arrangement</b> nowhere survives complete, and accordingly the preserved pulpitum in such churches is {{sometimes referred to as}} a rood screen. At Wells Cathedral the medieval arrangement was restored in the 20th century, with the medieval strainer arch supporting a rood, placed in front of the pulpitum and organ.|$|E
40|$|In 1928, when {{studying}} the genus Pellatispira 1), I found some {{sections of the}} foraminifer described below in a limestone from S. E. Borneo (no. 1446 B. 414).

Because the material was insufficient I put it aside. Some time afterwards a more intense study was made possible, as another limestone from S. E.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of screens as energy dissipaters in small hydraulic structures using physical experiments. In the experimental design, the Froude number, screen arrangements, and screen porosity were the major controlling parameters. The experiments covered a range of Froude numbers between 2. 5 and 8. 5, screen porosity of 40 % and 50 %, and gaps of double screens between 1 and 5 cm. The main goal {{of this study was}} investigation of the screens creating submerged hydraulic jumps. The flow depth was digitally measured in order to perceive the turbulences and validate the results of energy dissipation against those of the methods in the literature. The experimental results show the importance of each parameter on the screen performance. The screens with <b>double</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the imposed hydraulic jump dissipated more energy. The gaps of the <b>double</b> <b>arrangement</b> had an insignificant effect on energy dissipation. The double screen with porosity of 40 % had the best performance. Since the Froude number was found to be the most effective parameter, quadratic equations as a function of this number were fitted to the experimental results with high R 2 and very low RMSE values. The quadratic equations can be employed as interpolators and/or extrapolators...|$|E

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing the X- 38 vehicle {{that will be}} used to demonstrate the technologies required for a potential crew return vehicle (CRV) for the International Space Station. This vehicle would serve both as an ambulance for medical emergencies and as an evacuation vehicle for the Space Station. Control surfaces on the X- 38 (body flaps and rudder/fin assemblies) require high temperature seals to limit hot gas ingestion and transfer of heat to underlying low-temperature structures to prevent over-temperature of these structures and possible loss of the vehicle. NASAs Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Glenn Research Center (GRC) are working together to develop and evaluate seals for these control surfaces. This paper presents results for compression. flow, scrub, and arc jet tests conducted on the baseline X- 38 rudder/fin seal design. Room temperature seal compression tests were performed at low compression levels to determine load versus linear compression, preload. contact area, stiffness. and resiliency characteristics under low load conditions. For all compression levels that were tested, unit loads and contact pressures for the seals were below the 5 lb/in. and 10 psi limits required to limit the loads on the adjoining Shuttle thermal tiles that the seals will contact. Flow rates through an unloaded (i. e. 0 % compression) <b>double</b> <b>arrangement</b> were twice those of a double seal compressed to the 20 % design compression level. The seals survived an ambient temperature 1000 cycle scrub test over relatively rough Shuttle tile surfaces. The seals were able to disengage and re-engage the edges of the rub surface tiles while being scrubbed over them. Arc jet tests were performed to experimentally determine anticipated seal temperatures for representative flow boundary conditions (pressures and temperatures) under simulated vehicle re-entry conditions. Installation of a single seat in the gap of the test fixture caused a large temperature drop (1710 F) across the seal location as compared to an open gap condition (140 F) confirming the need for seals in the rudder/fin gap location. The seal acted as an effective thermal barrier limiting heat convection through the seal gap and minimizing temperature increases downstream of the seal during maximum heating conditions...|$|E
