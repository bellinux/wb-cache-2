She took first prize making buttonholes at the New York State Fair when she was 10 years old. She was extremely neat and clean. A granddaughter remembered that her shoes had to fit like kid gloves before she would wear them. She was a dainty little woman, with fine delicate features, gray-blue eyes, and dark (some say light brown) hair.|$|E
50|$|Connolly was {{adept at}} {{reworking}} traditional Irish fabrics and styles - including peasant blouses, flannel petticoats and shawls - {{to give them}} contemporary appeal and glamour. Perhaps her most distinctive contribution to fashion was pleated <b>handkerchief</b> <b>linen</b> - as worn by Jackie Kennedy in the official White House portrait - it took up to nine yards of Irish linen handkerchiefs to create one yard of the uncrushable pleated fabric that she pioneered. Designs were created in Ireland, and Connolly employed up to 100 women, mostly crocheting and weaving in their own homes. Although there was intricate craft in her designs, prices were lower than the typical European couture label.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was held}} from 26 April - 3 November 1913. Goyard {{was awarded a}} Grand Prix, and the exposition’s reviewer, Mister Lamy-Torrilhon, stated how {{important}} Goyard was: [...] "It employs {{a large number of}} workers and shop clerks, whether in Paris or at its branch stores in Monte-Carlo and Biarritz. Its goods are remarkable for their elegance and level of craftsmanship, two qualities that combine to produce, for instance, state-of-the-art drawer trunks equipped with double door and props to keep drawers ajar, cases for gloves, <b>handkerchiefs,</b> <b>linen</b> and so on". The Class 99 International Jury gave Goyard a citation for its excellence, as it had previously been awarded a grand prix. Mr Goyard was made an Academic Officer (an Order of Chivalry of France for academics and cultural and educational figures) right after the World Exposition of Brussels in 1910.|$|R

50|$|Lindsay & Co were {{manufacturers}} of <b>linen</b> <b>handkerchiefs,</b> amongst other things. They received correspondence {{from a man}} named Blenkarn. He had rented a room at 37 Wood Street, Cheapside, but purported to be 'Blenkiron & Co'. Lindsay & Co knew of a reputable business of this name which resided at 123 Wood Street. Believing the correspondence to be from this company, Lindsay & Co delivered to Blenkarn a large order of handkerchiefs. Blenkarn then sold the goods - 250 dozen <b>linen</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> - to an innocent third party, Cundy. When Blenkarn failed to pay, Lindsay & Co sued Cundy for the goods.|$|R

5000|$|Maxim {{takes his}} new bride back to Manderley, his large country house in Cornwall.

Although dead, Rebecca's presence is pervasive: Several things throughout the house - stationery, <b>handkerchiefs,</b> bed <b>linens,</b> even the master bedroom door - bear her ornate [...] "R" [...] or [...] "R de W" [...] monogram. As her closest confidant, Mrs. Danvers regularly comments on Rebecca's exceptional grace and style. When asked what Rebecca was like, Frank Crawley (Reginald Denny), Maxim's best friend and manager of the estate, absent-mindedly tells the new Mrs. de Winter that Rebecca was an exceptional beauty.|$|R

60|$|The first {{tenderness}} {{of spring}} {{was in the}} air though down in that calle there was yet enough of the wintry rawness to chill the tip of Don Ippolito's sensitive nose, which he rubbed for comfort with a handkerchief of dark blue calico, and polished for ornament with a <b>handkerchief</b> of white <b>linen.</b> He restored each to a different pocket in the sides of the ecclesiastical talare, or gown, reaching almost to his ankles, and then clutched the pocket in which he had replaced the <b>linen</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> as if to make sure that something he prized was safe within. He paused abruptly, and, looking at the doors he had passed, went back a few paces and stood before one over which hung, slightly tilted forward, an oval sign painted with the effigy of an eagle, a bundle of arrows, and certain thunderbolts, and bearing the legend, CONSULATE OF THE UNITED STATES, in neat characters. Don Ippolito gave a quick sigh, hesitated a moment, and then seized the bell-pull and jerked it so sharply that it seemed to thrust out, like a part of the mechanism, the head of an old serving-woman at the window above him.|$|R

60|$|Doubtless {{it helped}} Mr. Ross in {{maintaining}} his sublimity {{to dress like}} a cleric--black, modest suits of straight lines, white shirts, small, black ties.

Her words were flames. There was a smell of liquor {{in the air and}} Saxon knew that the old woman had been drinking.

40|$|This brief article {{explains}} the non-hierarchical listing of all 'Troubles' {{deaths in the}} inclusive Irish Linen Memorial (renamed The Linen Memorial in 2007) - killings for which various persons/groups {{on either side of}} the political divide, as well as the security forces, were responsible. The artwork-memorial can be read as an anti-monument. The Linen Memorial (hereafter LM) acts as a 'modest witness' in reordering relationships and engaging a parity of esteem between Nationalist/Republican ('Catholic') and Loyalist/Unionist ('Protestant') communities during the post- 1998 period when Northern Ireland is emerging from conflict. The use of the <b>linen</b> <b>handkerchief</b> as symbolic for heartfelt grief was what inspired me to use it, as a building block, to create a non-traditional and mobile memorial to those killed in the sectarian violence, commonly called The Troubles, in Northern Ireland...|$|R
5000|$|Carl Lachmund {{seems to}} have been held in special favour by Liszt. He was the only American student to ever have a {{testimonial}} letter from the composer. [...] He was also given Liszt's diary for 1876, and the manuscript of the 2nd Mephisto Waltz. In addition, he retained various of Liszt's personal items, such as a box of strands of his shoulder-length hair, five of his cigar stubs, a cognac glass, two pencils Liszt used for correcting and annotating manuscripts, and a <b>linen</b> <b>handkerchief</b> embossed with his initials. Liszt had a habit of writing out two copies of his letters longhand, signing both copies, mailing one and keeping the other. Lachmund owned a number of these letters. There was also a sliver of wood from Schiller's deathbed and some leaves from Goethe's grave.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, after a {{visit to}} Northern Ireland, Trouton {{received}} a $5,000 research grant from Canada Council of the Arts to begin researching a textile memorial to those killed in The Troubles of Northern Ireland.

The Memorial {{is a list of}} almost 4,000 of those who died in 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland from 1966 to 2009 in a chronological Names List, embroidered on Irish <b>Linen</b> <b>handkerchiefs.</b> The Memorial was publicly unveiled in Ireland at a peace and reconciliation centre on the first Private Day of Reflection, 2007, on the sectarian violence. It formed the basis of Trouton's graduate thesis. It was also shown in Canberra's Design Centre, CraftACT, Australia, 2004, and in 2011 in Portneuf, Quebec Canada during Quebec's International Biennale of Flax and Linen (BILP).|$|R
