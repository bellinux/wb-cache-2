5|$|The antbird family {{contains}} over 200 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names {{refer to}} the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true wrens, vireos or shrikes. In addition, members of the genus Phlegopsis are known as bare-eyes, Pyriglena as fire-eyes and Neoctantes and Clytoctantes as bushbirds. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the myoglobin <b>intron</b> 2, GAPDH <b>intron</b> 11 and the mtDNA cytochrome b DNA sequences has largely confirmed it. There are two major clades – most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as Herpsilochmus, versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species – and the monophyly of most genera was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in <b>intron</b> inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

Here, we report an updated compilation of group II <b>introns</b> in Eubacteria and Archaea comprising 234 <b>introns.</b> One new phylogenetic class is identified, as well as several specialized lineages.

25|$|<b>Intron</b> retention: A {{sequence}} may be spliced {{out as an}} <b>intron</b> {{or simply}} retained. This is distinguished from exon skipping because the retained sequence is not flanked by introns. If the retained <b>intron</b> is in the coding region, the <b>intron</b> must encode amino acids in frame with the neighboring exons, or a stop codon or {{a shift in the}} reading frame will cause the protein to be non-functional. This is the rarest mode in mammals.|$|E

40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from a liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, contains thirty-two <b>introns.</b> Twenty-five of these <b>introns</b> possess the characteristic secondary structures and consensus sequences of group II <b>introns.</b> The remaining seven are group I <b>introns,</b> six of which happen to interrupt the gene coding for subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (cox 1).

Moreover, comparison of the four group I <b>introns</b> with their fungal counterparts shows that group I <b>introns</b> inserted at identical genomic sites in different organisms are indeed related to one another, in terms of the peptide sequences generated from the complete or fragmental ORFs encoded by these <b>introns.</b> At the same time, the liverwort <b>introns</b> {{turned out to be more}} divergent from their fungal cognates than the latter are from one another.

40|$|Abstract Background Group I <b>introns</b> {{are one of}} {{the four}} major classes of <b>introns</b> as defined by their {{distinct}} splicing mechanisms. Because they catalyze their own removal from precursor transcripts, group I <b>introns</b> are referred to as autocatalytic <b>introns.</b> Group I <b>introns</b> are common in fungal and protist nuclear ribosomal RNA genes and in organellar genomes. In contrast, they are rare in all other organisms and genomes, including bacteria. Results Here we report five group I <b>introns,</b> each containing a LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease gene (HEG), in large subunit (LSU) rRNA genes of cyanobacteria. Three of the <b>introns</b> are located in the LSU gene of Synechococcus sp. C 9, and the other two are in the LSU gene of Synechococcus lividus strain C 1. Phylogenetic analyses show that these <b>introns</b> and their HEGs are closely related to <b>introns</b> and HEGs located at homologous insertion sites in organellar and bacterial rDNA genes. We also present a compilation of group I <b>introns</b> with homing endonuclease genes in bacteria. Conclusion We have discovered multiple HEG-containing group I <b>introns</b> in a single bacterial gene. To our knowledge, these are the first cases of multiple group I <b>introns</b> in the same bacterial gene (multiple group I <b>introns</b> have been reported in at least one phage gene and one prophage gene). The HEGs each contain one copy of the LAGLIDADG motif and presumably function as homodimers. Phylogenetic analysis, in conjunction with their patchy taxonomic distribution, suggests that these intron-HEG elements have been transferred horizontally among organelles and bacteria.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many genes with {{important}} roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long <b>introns,</b> but the possible existence of special mechanims for their expression has not been investigated. We present bioinformatic, phylogenetic and experimental evidence in Drosophila for a general mechanism that subdivides many large <b>introns</b> by recursive splicing at non-exonic elements and alternative exons. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of <b>introns</b> longer than 20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within <b>introns</b> shorter than 10 kb. The predicted sites in long <b>introns</b> are highly conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, despite extensive divergence of other sequences within the same <b>introns.</b> These patterns of enrichment and conservation suggest that recursive splice sites are advantageous {{in the context of}} long <b>introns.</b> Experimental analyses of in vivo processing intermediates and lariat products from four large <b>introns</b> in th...|$|R

5000|$|Exon {{shuffling}} {{was first}} introduced in 1978 when Walter Gilbert discovered {{that the existence of}} <b>introns</b> could {{play a major role in}} the evolution of proteins. It was noted that recombination within <b>introns</b> could help assort exons independently and that repetitive segments in the middle of <b>introns</b> could create hotspots for recombination to shuffle the exonic sequences. However, the presence of these <b>introns</b> in eukaryotes and absence in prokaryotes created a debate about the time in which these <b>introns</b> appeared. Two theories arose: the [...] "introns early" [...] theory and the [...] "introns late" [...] theory. Supporters of the [...] "introns early theory" [...] believed that <b>introns</b> and RNA splicing were the relics of the RNA world and therefore both prokaryotes and eukaryotes had <b>introns</b> in the beginning. However, prokaryotes eliminated their <b>introns</b> in order to obtain a higher efficiency, while eukaryotes retained the <b>introns</b> and the genetic plasticity of the ancestors. On the other hand, supporters of the [...] "introns late" [...] theory believe that prokaryotic genes resemble the ancestral genes and <b>introns</b> were inserted later in the genes of eukaryotes. What is clear now is that the eukaryotic exon-intron structure is not static, <b>introns</b> are continually inserted and removed from genes and the evolution of <b>introns</b> evolves parallel to exon shuffling. In order for exon shuffling to start to play a major role in protein evolution the appearance of spliceosomal <b>introns</b> had to take place. This was due to the fact that the self-splicing <b>introns</b> of the RNA world were unsuitable for exon-shuffling by intronic recombination. These <b>introns</b> had an essential function and therefore could not be recombined. Additionally there is strong evidence that spliceosomal <b>introns</b> evolved fairly recently and are restricted in their evolutionary distribution. Therefore, exon shuffling became a major role in the construction of younger proteins. Moreover, to define more precisely the time when exon shuffling became significant in eukaryotes, the evolutionary distribution of modular proteins that evolved through this mechanism were examined in different organisms (i.e., Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, etc.) These studies suggested that there was an inverse relationship between the genome compactness and the proportion of intronic and repetitive sequences. As well as the fact that exon shuffling became significant after metazoan radiation.|$|R
