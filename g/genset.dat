5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the concept car based on a new family of common powertrain components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (<b>genset)</b> fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E
500|$|The Volt {{concept car}} {{became the first}} {{application}} of the E-Flex (Voltec) drive system {{with a combination of}} an electric motor, the same used in the Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell, a [...] lithium-ion battery pack with 136 kW of peak power, and a <b>genset</b> consisting of a small 1.0 L, 3-cylinder turbocharged flex-fuel capable engine linked to a [...] generator. General Motors called this <b>genset</b> an electric vehicle (EV) range extender. The vehicle was propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of [...] delivering 236lb ft (320 Nm) of motoring torque. The concept car featured several advanced materials from GE Automotive Plastics which allowed GM to reduce the vehicle weight up to 50 percent.|$|E
500|$|The Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) {{definition}} of a hybrid vehicle states that the vehicle shall have [...] "two or more energy storage systems both of which must provide propulsion power, either together or independently." [...] General Motors has avoided {{the use of the}} term [...] "hybrid" [...] when describing its Voltec designs, even after the carmaker revealed that in some cases the combustion engine provided some assist at high speeds or to improve performance. Instead General Motors describes the Volt as an electric vehicle equipped with a [...] "range extending" [...] gasoline-powered internal combustion engine (ICE) as a <b>genset</b> and therefore dubbed the Volt an [...] "Extended Range Electric Vehicle" [...] or E-REV.

These <b>genset</b> locomotives will have four [...] diesel engines in place of one large engine, with the aim of reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions because the engines can be shut down when not needed.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{technologies}} that are being deployed to reduce locomotive emissions and fuel consumption include [...] "Genset" [...] switching locomotives and hybrid Green Goat designs. <b>Genset</b> locomotives use multiple high-speed diesel engines and generators (generator sets), rather than a single medium-speed diesel engine and a single generator. Green Goats are a type of hybrid switching locomotive utilizing a small diesel engine and a large bank of rechargeable batteries. Switching locomotives are of particular concern as they typically operate in a limited area, often in or near urban centers, and {{spend much of their}} time idling.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis is {{an investigation of}} dierent fault detection systems that canbe used for marine diesel electric power plants. The motivation of this thesis is to develop fault detection systems {{that are capable of}} detectinggovernor and AVR actuator faults for a marine diesel electric power plant. Faster detection ofthese types of faults reduces the risk of blackout, and might also enable more ecient operation ofmarine diesel electric power systems. The studied system is a diesel electric power system consisting of three parallel connected <b>gensets.</b> The <b>gensets</b> share a common load sharing system and are run in droop mode. The <b>gensets</b> produceelectric power, to supply the consumers on the vessel. A failure in the Governor or AVR, mightcause all <b>gensets</b> to disconnect and hence cause a system blackout. Since diesel electric powersystems are common for DP vessels, a blackout is a severe situation. If a failure occurs in onegenset, this will inuence the operation of the other connected <b>gensets.</b> The failure source mighttherefore be dicult to detect. Better fault detection systems, might therefore enable faster andmore reliable protection of the power system. In this thesis three fault detection systems are investigated. One of the fault detection systemsis commonly used for marine power systems, and is based on the governor and AVR droop-curves. The two other fault detection systems are based on a simplied model of a marine diesel electricpower system. The rst is based on an analytical redundancy relation derived from the systemmodel. The other fault detection system, is based on a nonlinear Luenberger-type observer. To verify the performance of the fault detection systems, they are implemented in Matlab/Simulink. For this purpose, a more advanced power plant model is developed and implemented in Simulink. Simulations are run for several normal and faulty simulation modes. The fault detection systemsperform well for all simulation modes, and are capable to detect the faults within reasonable time. ii...|$|R
40|$|One {{potentially}} large {{source of}} underutilized distributed generation (DG) capacity exists in single-phase standby backup <b>gensets</b> on farms served from single-phase feeder laterals. Utilizing the excess capacity would require interconnecting to the utility system. Connecting single-phase <b>gensets</b> to the utility system presents some interesting technical {{issues that have}} not been previously investigated. This paper addresses several of the interconnection issues associated with this form of DG including voltage regulation, harmonics, overcurrent protection, and islanding. A significant amount of single-phase DG can be accommodated by the utility distribution system, but there are definite limitations due to the nature and location of the DG. These limitations may be more restrictive than is commonly assumed for three-phase DG installed on stronger parts of the electric distribution system...|$|R
