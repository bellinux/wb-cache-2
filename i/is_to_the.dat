5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The {{equations of motion}} of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> students' advantage {{to compete in the}} lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the façade that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E

5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min.

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Banquo is in a {{third of}} the play's scenes, as both a human and a ghost. As {{significant}} as he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plot, he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross, a Scottish nobleman who survives the play. In the second scene of the play, King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, bravely led his army against invaders, fighting side by side. In the next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the Three Witches, who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, sceptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{that are}} {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves. Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs. However, shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.|$|E
