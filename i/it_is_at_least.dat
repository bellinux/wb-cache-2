5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> (<b>at</b> <b>least)</b> partially unknown.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about a bear's hearing, but {{scientists}} concluded that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> {{as good as a}} human's. Some scientists believe that bears may even be able to detect ultrasonic sounds as well.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{analytical}} index is usually hard to evaluate directly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> obviously an integer. The topological index {{is by definition}} a rational number, but it is usually not at all obvious from the definition that it is also integral. So the Atiyah–Singer index theorem implies some deep integrality properties, as it implies that the topological index is integral.|$|E

25|$|Chicago Rockford International Airport (RFD) in Rockford, Illinois {{has also}} marketed {{itself as an}} {{alternative}} for congestion at O'Hare. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a 1-1/2-hour trip to Rockford from the Chicago Loop. Currently {{there is no direct}} transportation service from downtown Chicago or O'Hare to Rockford airport, but airline service at the airport continues to grow. Larry Morrissey, the current mayor of Rockford, has pushed for a high-speed rail connection between the two airports to make the Rockford airport a more convenient alternative to O'Hare.|$|E
25|$|By 1944, all forty {{volumes of}} the First Encyclopedia of Tlön are {{discovered}} and published in a library in Memphis. The material then becomes accessible worldwide, and immensely influential on Earth's culture, science and languages. By the time Borges concludes the story, presumably in 1947, the world is gradually disintegrating and transforming into Tlön. Borges then turns to an obsession of his own: a translation of Sir Thomas Browne's Urn Burial into Spanish. Arguably {{it is no more}} important than Tlön, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> of his world.|$|E

25|$|Since the Indo-Iranians {{built their}} first kingdom in Balkh (Bactria, Daxia, Bukhdi) some {{scholars}} {{believe that it}} was from this area that different waves of Indo-Iranians spread to north-east Iran and Seistan region, where they, in part, became today's Persians, Tajiks, Pashtuns and Baluch people of the region. The changing climate has led to desertification since antiquity, when the region was very fertile. Its foundation is mythically ascribed to Keyumars, the first king of the world in Persian legend; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> certain that, at a very early date, it was the rival of Ecbatana, Nineveh and Babylon.|$|E
25|$|After the {{break-up}} of Rodinia about 800Ma, the continents may have formed another short-lived supercontinent around 550Ma. The hypothetical supercontinent is {{sometimes referred to}} as Pannotia or Vendia. The evidence for it is a phase of continental collision known as the Pan-African orogeny, which joined the continental masses of current-day Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. The existence of Pannotia depends on the timing of the rifting between Gondwana (which included most of the landmass now in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent) and Laurentia (roughly equivalent to current-day North America). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> certain {{that by the end of}} the Proterozoic eon, most of the continental mass lay united in a position around the south pole.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of sexual dimorphism in heterodontosaurids has long centered on Abrictosaurus. Tusks are a sexually dimorphic trait in many modern mammals, including musk deer, walrus, Asian elephants and many pigs, with tusks being present primarily in males. The lack of tusks in UCL B54 led to suggestions {{that it was}} female; perhaps even a female of another species. The discovery of caniniforms in UCL A100 showed that A. consors also has this 'male' characteristic, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a valid species in its own right. However, UCL B54 may actually be a juvenile, based on its short face and unfused sacral (hip) vertebrae. Therefore, the lack of tusks could be a juvenile trait instead of a secondary sexual characteristic, weakening the case for sexual dimorphism.|$|E

25|$|The thick fur is reddish-{{brown on}} top of the head, dark roan brown on the body, and mottled white on the underbelly. The face is lighter in color than the body, and the muzzle and chin are white. Two {{prominent}} buff whitish streaks run {{on either side of the}} nose between the eyes. The ears are rounded. The eyes are unusually far forward and close together, compared with other cats, giving the felid improved stereoscopic vision. The teeth are adapted for gripping onto slippery prey, and the jaws are relatively powerful. These features help the flat-headed cat to catch and retain aquatic prey, to which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> as well adapted as the fishing cat. Legs are fairly short. Claws are retractable, but the covering sheaths are so reduced in size that about two-thirds of the claws are left protruding.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets {{in the sense of the}} traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E
25|$|Cole Porter's musical Kiss Me, Kate is an {{adaptation}} of Taming of the Shrew. The music and lyrics are by Porter and the book is by Samuel and Bella Spewack. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partially based on the 1935/1936 Theatre Guild production of Taming of the Shrew, which starred husband and wife Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, whose backstage fights became legendary. The musical {{tells the story of}} a husband and wife acting duo (Fred and Lilli) attempting to stage The Taming of the Shrew, but whose backstage fights keep getting in the way. The musical opened on Broadway at the New Century Theatre in 1948, running for a total of 1,077 performances. Directed by John C. Wilson with choreography by Hanya Holm, it starred Patricia Morison and Alfred Drake. The production moved to the West End in 1951, directed by Samuel Spewack with choreography again by Holm, and starring Patricia Morrison and Bill Johnson. It ran for 501 performances. As well as being a box office hit, the musical was also a critical success, winning five Tony Awards; Best Authors (Musical), Best Original Score, Best Costume Design, Best Musical and Best Producers (Musical). The play has since been revived numerous times in various countries. Its 1999 revival at the Martin Beck Theatre, directed by Michael Blakemore and starring Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell, was especially successful, winning another five Tonys; Best Actor (Musical), Best Costume Design, Best Director (Musical), Best Orchestrations, and Best Revival (Musical).|$|E

500|$|Narihira {{was once}} widely {{considered}} {{the author of}} the work, but scholars have come to reject this attribution.

The protagonist of the work was likely modelled on him. [...] The work itself was likely put together in something resembling its present form by the middle of 10th century, and took several decades starting with Narihira's death.|$|E
