2500|$|Butcher's debut memoir, Visiting Hours: A Memoir of Friendship and Murder, was {{published}} in April 2015 by Penguin-Random House imprint Blue Rider Press. It recounts her struggle to reconcile her friendship with her college friend Kevin Schaeffer, who violently murdered his girlfriend after a psychotic break. The book was featured on NPR's Weekend <b>Edition</b> <b>Sunday</b> with Rachel Martin, WAMC's The Roundtable, and Poets & Writers Magazine. The New York Times Sunday Review of Books writes that [...] "at {{the heart of this}} story, beyond Butcher's search to understand the incomprehensible, lies our societal failure to recognize serious depression as the potentially fatal illness that it is..." [...] and that [...] "her research offers a tragic portrait of the turn of events that left one young woman dead and another forever changed." [...] (The New York Times Sunday Review of Books, July 15, 2015) NPR's Rachel Martin describes the book as [...] "a haunting meditation on human fragility." [...] (NPR, March 30, 2015). The Star Tribune writes that the book is [...] "riveting and visceral..." [...] and that [...] "Butcher is unflinching in her self-examination and masterful at it." [...] (The Star Tribune, May 4, 2015) Kirkus Reviews describes the book as [...] "gripping and poignant" [...] (Kirkus Reviews, January 1, 2015), Biographile writes that it is [...] "enthralling, thought provoking, and deeply empathetic," [...] (Biographile, April 9, 2015), and Glamour writes that it is [...] "emotional, powerful, and oddly enough, beautiful."

After Vega was named senior White House correspondent, Llamas was named sole weekend anchor in January 2017, as the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and <b>Sunday</b> <b>editions</b> ended once again.|$|R
