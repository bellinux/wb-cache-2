This finding provides the first {{empirical support for}} several qualitative studies exploring the benefits of participation in workplace team sport [10 – 13].

The analysis {{is based on}} action research (AR) related document studies, surveys, interviews and observations on the employees from these companies. The study emphasizes on collaboration between employers and employees, and the employees ’ understanding and implementing of industrial democracy into their daily work and the real outcomes of the implementations. Both sampled companies are project members of Value Creation 2010 (Verdiskaping 2010), which is an action research based project implemented industrial democracy into the local business companies. The analysis <b>indicates</b> <b>employees</b> ’ same expectations and wishes on industrial democracy, but differences on their practices, used tools and situations. One best practice has been noticed as implementing cross-personnel teams, named as Resource Groups (RG) in a sampled company and received particularly positive benefits. This RG approach has nevertheless similar nature and functions as quality circles in TQM practice early 80 s, but RG concept rather focuses on organizational development than merely quality issues...|$|E
40|$|Formally sanctioned {{flexible}} working conditions are now common in Australian workplaces. While large organisations have policies for part-time work, career breaks, and leave options, research <b>indicates</b> <b>employees</b> may still suffer employment disadvantage {{if they use}} them (French and Sheridan 2010; Lyonette and Crompton 2008). This paper examines this issue for a lesser known population: professional and managerial employees in small accounting firms (employees), particularly those working fewer than 35 hours per week and those who took career breaks. Results are drawn from a survey of all CPA Australia members working in small firms. Unsurprisingly, given that women undertake more family and household work (ABS 2009; Burgess and Strachan 2005), {{more women than men}} worked part-time, and women had taken longer career breaks. Arrangements for part-time work and other flexible options tended to be local, informal and reliant on individual managers ‘ support. Analysis of quantitative and qualitative responses revealed differing motivations and difficulties for women and men working part-time. While both women and men typically intended to return to full-time work, 53 % of women considered that working part-time was detrimental to their long-term career prospects, compared with 22 % men. While a similar percentage of women and men were concerne...|$|E

40|$|Increased equity {{participation}} by employees has attracted substantial interest for {{its potential to}} affect both economic outcomes (e. g., worker and firm performance) and social outcomes (e. g., wealth and income inequality). This paper summarizes the findings from over 50 large-sample empirical {{studies that have been}} done on employee ownership and broad-based stock option plans in the past 25 years, covering studies on plan adoption, employee attitudes and behaviours, firm performance, and employee wages and wealth. The results from these studies <b>indicate</b> <b>employee</b> ownership is linked to better outcomes on average but employee ownership clearly does not automatically improve worker and firm outcomes given that there are both positive and neutral findings. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} the conditions under which employee ownership improves economic outcomes, to examine worker and employer concerns and the trade-offs they are willing to make, and to explore the further potential of these systems...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with employees from Drakensberg Power Station, in Kwazulu Natal. Twenty-three non-supervisory employees were interviewed, and six supervisors partook in a focus group. The purpose was to gain insight into the experiences and perceptions of employees about the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), by exploring factors influencing utilisation and investigating the extent of employee awareness of the EAP, to recommend appropriate modifications to the service. Findings <b>indicate</b> <b>employees</b> are aware of the service, but unfamiliar with its purpose and functioning. They are not aware of how to access the service. The utilisation is affected by the lack of visibility of the service, the lack of awareness of family members about the services and concerns about confidentiality.
