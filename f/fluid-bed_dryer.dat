5000|$|A high-shear {{granulator}} is {{a process}} array consisting of an inline or batch high-shear mixer and a <b>fluid-bed</b> <b>dryer.</b> In a granulation process, only the solid component of the mixture is required. Fluid is used only {{as an aid to}} processing. The high-shear mixer processes the solid material down to the desired particle size, and the mixture is then pumped to the drying bed where the fluid is removed, leaving behind the granular product.|$|E
40|$|High-shear {{granulated}} lactose granulates were dried in it <b>fluid-bed</b> <b>dryer</b> {{at various}} conditions. Granules {{were characterized by}} water content and size analysis. It is shown that the drying process is very dynamic in terms of growth and breakage phenomena. Granular size heterogeneity, composition and water content determine the granule behavior upon drying. Large granules consist of small primary particles and contain more water than small granules that consist of large primary particles. This differentiates the drying rate and extent of size reduction of the different granule size classes. The results enable it critical evaluation of process control and process monitoring. Understanding of granule behavior and continuous monitoring Of the fluid-bed drying process enables process and product optimization. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|Globally, {{blood and}} rumen {{contents}} {{are the major}} abattoir wastes. In developing countries, {{a high proportion of}} the blood obtained from slaughtered animals ends as waste {{due to the lack of}} facilities for drying to produce blood meal. Industrial processing of blood by drum, flash, or spray drying produces good-quality blood meal but requires high capital outlay on heavy equipment as well as central slaughtering and collection of blood. Rumen contents have about 85 g/kg of water content and constitute a disposal problem as their processing involves high investment and operating costs. Methods reported for processing rumen contents include field spreading or landfill, ensiling, drying using gas-fired rotary <b>dryers,</b> <b>fluid-bed</b> <b>dryers,</b> solar dryers, or by pressing to reduce the water content. These methods are not yet feasible in developing countries where slaughtering is mainly done in small and scattered units, which makes collection of large quantities of blood and rumen contents difficult. In addition, electricity and water supply are either lacking or irregular in most developing countries. Therefore, the evolution of acceptable processing technologies for abattoir wastes is important (Makinde and Sonaiya 2010).|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} batch <b>fluid-bed</b> <b>dryer</b> {{was developed}} for handling small samples of tea for experimental batch manufacture, and this dryer required a means of stopping drying when the process was complete. A control system was devised which requires only the initial weight of the sample to be entered into the controller. The system then takes full control, using only an inlet and exhaust temperature measurement. A simulation model was used to explore the operating region of the dryer, and how the various disturbances affected the drying time. A relationship was found between time to a transition temperature and time to completion which enabled a simple algorithm to be developed, suitable for implementation on a microcontroller. The method {{was found to be}} substantially independent of variables such as sample moisture content and ambient air conditions, as well as inlet temperature, over the range normally experienced. The algorithm was tested in practice and found to give adequate control, substantially better than the manual system used previously...|$|E
