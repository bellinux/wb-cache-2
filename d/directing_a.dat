5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I figured I would give <b>directing</b> <b>a</b> shot.

5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were <b>directing</b> <b>a</b> path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

5|$|The film's idea {{originated}} in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. At that time, he was joking about a housefly seeking revenge on a human {{in a conversation with}} his son S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American boy dies in an attempt to free his family from slavery and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing Maryada Ramanna (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of <b>directing</b> <b>a</b> film that was distinct from any other. He decided to make Eega a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil– each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled Naan Ee, was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil cinema. The film was presented by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions.|$|E

5|$|After this, the 2/14th was {{committed}} to the advance into the Markham Valley and Finisterre Range, {{in the vanguard of}} the 21st Brigade's advance from Kaiapit to Dumpu in late September and early October. Moving through the 2/16th Battalion's position and advancing on to Marawasa, the 2/14th left the Markham Valley and proceeded into the Ramu Valley. The 2/14th then moved on the 2/16th's right flank, protecting it from any Japanese attacks that might have eventuated from the north. On 4 October 1943, the battalion reached Wampun village. It was there that the battalion's commanding officer, Honner, was seriously wounded when he moved beyond the main defensive position in order to personally carry out a reconnaissance of the surrounding area.

40|$|Finding motifs is {{important}} for understanding {{the structure of a}} network in terms of its building blocks. A network motif is a sub graph that appears significantly more often in a real network than expected in randomised networks. This paper looks at motif detection for a special class of <b>directed</b> networks: <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic networks. Normally, randomised networks are obtained using the switching algorithm. This algorithm preserves the in-degree and out-degree of each node. However, it does not preserve the <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic nature of <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic networks. Karrer and Newman introduced an algorithm that does preserve the <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic property but which may create multiple edges. This paper introduces alternative null-models that maintain the degree sequences, <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic property and do not introduce multiple edges. It is shown that there are explicit formulas for the number of occurrences of each possible 3 -node pattern in such random networks. Even though the different random network models result in networks with different properties, the patterns that are keyed as network motifs in three real-world <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic networks do not depend on the choice of null-model. However, when using the switching model as a null-model, sometimes anti-motifs are found that contain directed cycles...|$|R
