25|$|Hitchcock {{went down}} to his room to sleep. Three times he heard <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> only to find no one there. After finding another cadet drunk, Hitchcock saw Davis head over to room No. 5 where {{thirteen}} cadets were partying. Davis, seeing Hitchcock's arrival, warned the other cadets. The captain entered the room, ordering one of the cadets to open up another cadet's footlocker, but the cadet refused. Hitchcock ordered no more disorder, left the room, and started looking for Thornton around 04:50.|$|E
500|$|After the war Beric {{became a}} clerk in the Gents clock factory. The family lived in a terraced house on Lead Street in the centre of Leicester, an area that was {{demolished}} in the mid-1950s {{as part of the}} city's slum clearance. When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the council estates the post-war Labour government built. [...] "To say we were skint," [...] he wrote in 1993, [...] "is like saying it is a little chilly at the North Pole." [...] He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house peering through windows. His mother never explained that it was about the rent; she just told Icke to hide. He wrote in 2003 that he still gets a fright when someone <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
500|$|Puccini's {{score is}} built around a series of motifs which recur through the opera, {{generally}} representing characters, situations and moods though sometimes without specific associations. The opening motif is a rapid burst of rhythmic music, described by Greenfield as of [...] "almost Stravinskian sharpness", which quickly transforms into a mock-solemn dirge depicting the hypocritical grief of the Donati relatives. This juxtaposition of the humorous and the solemn pervades the opera; critic Ernest Newman suggests that it [...] "keeps us perpetually suspended between the comic and the tragic". Other principal motifs include the theme associated with the lovers Rinuccio and Lauretta, introduced in Rinuccio's first solo [...] "Salvati! Salvati!", and a short, formal woodwind statement which represents Donati's will. Rinuccio sings the name [...] "Gianni Schicchi" [...] to a jaunty four-note phrase which becomes Schicchi's personal motif, and it is heard again as Schicchi <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> before his first appearance. The best-known theme in the opera, that associated with Lauretta, is introduced {{in the second part}} of Rinuccio's aria [...] "Avete torto". The theme is briefly played on clarinet and violin as Lauretta enters with Schicchi, before its full expression in O mio babbino caro.|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere, barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a {{disturbance}} outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by. He attempts to leave discreetly, but Clara follows {{him to a}} coach. Not wishing {{to become involved in}} matters, the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara's memories with just a touch. Before they can do so, they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting. Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory, she will forget {{how to deal with the}} snowmen. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS. Clara follows him and <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers. Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer. She learns that Latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny, who takes her to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E

2500|$|A {{traditional}} ceremony {{during the}} funeral {{is when the}} procession of mourners arrives {{at the gates of}} the Capuchin Church, under which the Imperial Crypt lies, and the Herald <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> A Capuchin then asks [...] "who demands entry?" [...] The Herald responds with the name and title of the deceased. The Capuchin then responds [...] "we don't know him/her." [...] The same procedure is repeated once. Only on the third attempt, when the Herald responds with [...] "a sinful, mortal human being", are the gates opened and the dead Habsburg admitted into the Crypt. In 1989, Otto's mother, Zita, was first introduced with all her titles, and the second time introduced as [...] "Zita, Her Majesty the Empress and Queen".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{residents}} said no fire alarms went {{off when the}} fire started {{and that they were}} alerted to the fire only by people screaming for help or <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and not by a fire alarm. Another resident said they were alerted to the fire by the sound of an alarm and the sight of smoke. Others reported that they survived by ignoring the [...] "stay put" [...] advice given by council notices: a directive instructing residents to remain in their flat in case of fire. The emergency services originally repeated the [...] "stay put" [...] advice to residents while the fire was spreading; they later reversed this advice, but by then it was more difficult to exit the building.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next day}} Woody gives Norm {{a job with}} the city. Rebecca marries Don but {{secretly}} regrets it, feeling he is too good for her. Cliff is promoted to postal assistant supervisor after giving Marty gifts. Sam and Diane walk in and announce their engagement. His friends disapprove. Having enough of their disapproval, and going years without a family, Sam leaves the bar with Diane. On the plane, they begin to reconsider their decision to be together again. As the flight is delayed, they return to the airport terminal and amicably agree to part ways. Diane goes to Los Angeles, and Sam returns to Cheers to see his friends again. While Sam and his gang celebrate the reunion, Rebecca announces happily that Don has {{a job with the}} sewer department and leaves excitedly with the tickets for their honeymoon trip. After the rest of the gang head home, Norm stays behind and tells Sam that he knew he would return to Boston for his [...] "one true love", saying: [...] "You'll always come back to her." [...] After Norm leaves, someone (Bob Broder) <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Sam replies, [...] "Sorry, we're closed," [...] then walks over and straightens a picture of Geronimo hanging on the back wall, and then exits into the corridor toward the pool room.
