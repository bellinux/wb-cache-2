5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only <b>functionally</b> <b>independent</b> measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E
25|$|Tertiary {{structure}} of MTs is also highly heterogeneous. While vertebrate, echinoderm and crustacean MTs show a bidominial structure with divalent metals as Zn(II) or Cd(II) (the protein is folded {{so as to}} bind metals in two <b>functionally</b> <b>independent</b> domains, with a metallic cluster each), yeast and procariotyc MTs show a monodominial structure (one domain with a single metallic cluster). Although no structural data is available for molluscan, nematoda and Drosophila MTs, it is commonly assumed that the former are bidominial and the latter monodominial. No conclusive data are available for Plant MTs, but two possible structures have been proposed: 1) a bidominial structure {{similar to that of}} vertebrate MTs; 2) a codominial structure, in which two Cys-rich domains interact to form a single metallic cluster.|$|E
25|$|A new {{sample from}} the Gogo Formation in the Canning Basin of Western Australia has {{provided}} evidence regarding the morphological features of the visceral jaw elements of Bothriolepis. Using the sample, {{it is evident that}} the mental plate (a dermal bone that forms {{the upper part of the}} jaw) of antiarchs is homologous with the suborbital plate found in other placoderms. The lower jawbone consists of differentiated blade and biting portions. Next to the mandibular joint are the prelateral and infraprelateral plates, which both are canal-bearing bones. The palatoquadrate lacks a high orbital process and was attached only to the ventral part of the mental plate, proving that the ethmoidal region of the braincase (the region of the skull that separates the brain and nasal cavity) was in fact deeper than originally believed. In addition to the above listed sample from the Gogo Formation, several other specimens have been found with mouthparts held in the natural position by a membrane that covers the oral region and attaches to the lateral and anterior margins of the head. Bothriolepis has a jaw in which the two halves are separate and in the adult are <b>functionally</b> <b>independent.</b>|$|E

25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among <b>functionally</b> <b>independent</b> elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} concerning modularity exists in neuroscience because there is evidence for specific areas (e.g. V4 or V5/hMT+) and the concomitant behavioral deficits following brain insult (thus taken as evidence for modularity). In addition, evidence shows other areas are involved and that these areas subserve processing of multiple properties (e.g. V1) (thus taken as evidence against modularity). That these streams have the same implementation in early visual areas, like V1, is not inconsistent with a modular viewpoint: to adopt the canonical analogy in cognition, {{it is possible for}} different software to run on the same hardware. A consideration of psychophysics and neuropsychological data would suggest support for this. For example, psychophysics has shown that percepts for different properties are realized asynchronously. In addition, although achromats experience other cognitive defects they do not have motion deficits when their lesion is restricted to V4, or total loss of form perception. Relatedly, Zihl and colleagues' akinetopsia patient shows no deficit to color or object perception (although deriving depth and structure from motion is problematic, see above) and object agnostics do not have damaged motion or color perception, making the three disorders triply dissociable. Taken together this evidence suggests that even though distinct properties may employ the same early visual areas they are <b>functionally</b> <b>independent.</b> Furthermore, that the intensity of subjective perceptual experience (e.g. color) correlates with activity in these specific areas (e.g. V4), the recent evidence that synaesthetes show V4 activation during the perceptual experience of color, as well as the fact that damage to these areas results in concomitant behavioral deficits (the processing may be occurring but perceivers {{do not have access to}} the information) are all evidence for visual modularity.|$|E

For two-dimensional and for conformally flat three-dimensional spaces with nondegenerate potentials we have worked out the structure of the classical systems and shown that the quadratic algebra always closes at order 6. Here we describe the quantum analogs of these results. We show that, for nondegenerate potentials, each classical system has a unique quantum extension. We also correct an error in an earlier paper in the series (that does not alter the structure results) and we elucidate the distinction between superintegrable systems with bases of <b>functionally</b> linearly <b>independent</b> and <b>functionally</b> linearly dependent symmetries...|$|R

2500|$|Ergodicity of a {{continuous}} dynamical system means that its trajectories [...] "spread around" [...] the phase space. A {{system with a}} compact phase space which has a non-constant first integral cannot be ergodic. This applies, in particular, to Hamiltonian systems with a first integral I <b>functionally</b> <b>independent</b> from the Hamilton function H and a compact level set X = {(p,q): H(p,q) = E} of constant energy. Liouville's theorem implies {{the existence of a}} finite invariant measure on X, but the dynamics of the system is constrained to the level sets of I on X, hence the system possesses invariant sets of positive but less than full measure. A property of continuous dynamical systems that is the opposite of ergodicity is complete integrability.|$|E

40|$|A {{description}} of Arytera pollen based on light and scanning electron microscopic observations is presented. Four aperture types and two ornamentation types (one {{divided into two}} subtypes) can be distinguished. The commonest aperture types are colporate and parasyncolporate; {{each of the other}} two types occurs in a single species. The main ornamentation types are rugulate and striate-rugulate; the latter has small or large lumina. Polymorphism occurs in both characters in several species. A cladistic analysis of Arytera shows two distinct evolutionary trends in the pollen: 1) aperture system from parasyncolporate to colporate, and 2) ornamentation from striate-rugulate with small lumina to striate-rugulate with large lumina. The plesiomorphic state of the character ornamentation remains uncertain. The result obtained contributes to the doubt whether primitively colporate pollen occurs within the subfamily Sapindoideae. In contrast to the general view of evolution in Sapindaceae pollen, the aperture system of Arytera pollen {{did not appear to be}} more conservative than the ornamentation.
