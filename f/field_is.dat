25|$|Some of the {{simplest}} physical <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> vector force <b>fields.</b> Historically, {{the first time that}} <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> taken seriously was with Faraday's lines of force when describing the electric field.

5|$|Ganymede's {{magnetic}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> probably {{created by}} convection within its liquid iron core. The meager magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> buried within Jupiter's much larger magnetic field and would show {{only as a}} local perturbation of the field lines. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone). Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether the satellite has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Given that Ganymede is {{completely}} differentiated {{and has a}} metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> probably generated {{in a similar fashion}} to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior. The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external <b>field</b> <b>is</b> caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when {{one end of a}} molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge.

5|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> the local gradient of the electric potential.

25|$|From {{a general}} point of view, the various fields in (3-dimensional) vector {{calculus}} are uniformly {{seen as being}} k-vector fields: scalar <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 0-vector <b>fields,</b> vector <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 1-vector <b>fields,</b> pseudovector <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 2-vector <b>fields,</b> and pseudoscalar <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 3-vector <b>fields.</b> In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields (scalar/vector/pseudovector/pseudoscalar corresponding to 0/1/n1/n dimensions, which is exhaustive in dimension 3), so one cannot only work with (pseudo)scalars and (pseudo)vectors.|$|R
50|$|The Gullfaks oil <b>field</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 1978.

5|$|A finite <b>field</b> <b>is</b> a set {{of numbers}} with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite <b>field</b> <b>is</b> the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, {{they can also be}} defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
5|$|A hollow {{conducting}} body carries all its {{charge on}} its outer surface. The <b>field</b> <b>is</b> therefore zero at all places inside the body.

40|$|AbstractOptical full-field {{measurement}} methods are now widely applied in various domains. In general, the displacement <b>fields</b> can <b>be</b> directly {{obtained from the}} measurement, however in mechanical analysis strain <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> preferred. To extract strain fields from noisy displacement <b>fields</b> <b>is</b> always a challenging topic. In this study, a finite element method for smoothing displacement fields and calculating strain <b>fields</b> <b>is</b> proposed. An experimental test case on a holed aluminum specimen under tension is applied to validate this method. The heterogeneous displacement <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> measured by digital image correlation (DIC). By this proposed method, the result shows that the measuring noise on experimental displacement <b>fields</b> can <b>be</b> successfully removed, and strain <b>fields</b> can <b>be</b> reconstructed in the arbitrary area...|$|R

5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} {{toroidal magnetic field}} to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal <b>field</b> <b>is,</b> correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal <b>field</b> <b>is</b> at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E
