40|$|In Japan, many {{concrete}} bridges {{along the}} coastline have suffered corrosion {{due to the}} chloride attack from seawater and airborne salt. Therefore, now, several researches on corroded RC structures have been ongoing around the world. Especially, as a basic research, many researchers have studied on the numerical and experimental method to evaluate static load resistant capacity of RC beams with corroded reinforcements. However, there has been almost no research to evaluate <b>impact</b> load <b>resistant</b> capacity. Of course, {{it is important that}} <b>impact</b> load <b>resistant</b> capacity is clarified, if the possibility of acting of impact load including in natural disaster on corroded RC structures is dealt with. With a background like this, this paper describes an experimental investigation of the structural behavior of corroded RC beams. To be precise, in this study, RC beams with corroded reinforcement by using electrolytic corrosion method were made, and both of static loading test and repeated impact test for those RC beams were conducted in order to clarify the static and <b>impact</b> load <b>resistant</b> capacity of them. As a result, we could get some findings. At first, through repeated impact tests (which has 1. 0 m/s impact velocity and a 100 kg steel weight), the number of impacts to the failure of corroded RC beams were less than half of healthy RC beams. It was also found that fracture pattern was completely different due to some axial cracks by corrosion. In addition, even though the corrosion rate is same level, the <b>impact</b> load <b>resistant</b> capacity reduce greatly compared to the static load resistant capacity because of the existence and pattern of cracks due to corrosion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe European Union’s {{attention}} {{to the problem of}} antibacterial resistance will soon reach a 10 -year mark, but the rates of resistance in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are still increasing. This review focuses on the clinical <b>impact</b> of <b>resistant</b> Gram-positive bacteria on patients. Multiple drug resistance in pneumococcal infections will lead to more treatment failures and higher mortality, which so far have been seen with penicillins and pathogens with high-level resistance. Several studies have demonstrated higher mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay and higher costs associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, in comparison with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infections. Similarly, vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infections have a negative impact with respect to mortality, length of hospital stay and costs, in comparison with infections due to vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Several distinctive prophylactic and therapeutic approaches have to be undertaken to successfully prevent the clinical consequences of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive bacteria.

40|$|Abstract: Although the epicentres of {{probiotic}} {{research in}} the past decade have been Japan and Europe, researchers in the Asia-Pacific region have actively contributed to the growing understanding of the intestinal microbial ecosystem, and interactions between gut bacteria, diet and health of the human host. A number of new probiotic strains have been developed in the region that have been demonstrated to have beneficial impacts on health in animal and human trials, including improved protection against intestinal pathogens and modulation of the immune system. Probiotics targeted to animals, including aquaculture, feature heavily in many Asian countries. Developments in probiotic technologies have included microencapsulation techniques, antimicrobial production in fermented meats, and synbiotic combinations. In particular, the <b>impact</b> of <b>resistant</b> starch on the intestinal environment and fermentation by intestinal bacteria has been intensively studied and new probiotic strains selected specifically for synbiotic combinations with resistant starch.

Increasingly, antibiotic resistance {{is seen as an}} ecological problem. This includes both the ecology of resistance genes and that of the resistant bacteria themselves. Little is known about the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics and disinfectants on environmental bacteria, especially with respect to resistance.
