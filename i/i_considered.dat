5|$|Despite this triumph, the {{downfall}} of Kourkouas, {{as well as of}} his friend and protector, Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos, was imminent. The two eldest surviving sons of Romanos I, co-emperors Stephen and Constantine, were jealous of Kourkouas and had in the past tried to undermine him, albeit without success. Following the success of Kourkouas in the East, Romanos <b>I</b> <b>considered</b> marrying his trusted general into the imperial family. Kourkouas's daughter Euphrosyne was to be wedded with the emperor's grandson, the future Romanos II (r. 959–963), the son of his son-in-law and junior emperor Constantine VII. Although such a union would effectively cement the loyalty of the army, it would also strengthen the position of the legitimate Macedonian line, represented by Constantine VII, over the imperial claims of Romanos's own sons. Predictably, Stephen and Constantine opposed this decision and prevailed upon their father, who was by this time old and ill, to dismiss Kourkouas in the autumn of 944.|$|E

25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted in a way he thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and <b>I</b> <b>considered</b> to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake of these very men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went beyond me in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and said Tom Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, said he might have a lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E

25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, <b>I</b> <b>considered</b> as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things.

The squadron remained in the area until 16 June, when a lookout on Bellerophon spotted a large fleet to the east-south-east. This was the Brest fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, two frigates, two brigs and a cutter, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} contains four stand-alone studies, chapters 2 through 5. In chapter 1, I highlight commonalities {{among the}} studies. 	In chapter 2, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> {{the principle of}} structural balance - "The {{friend of a friend}} is a friend, the enemy of a friend is an enemy, the friend of an enemy is an enemy, and the enemy of an enemy is a friend. " <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> Harary's (1954) result that this principle can only be satisfied in a world consisting of two inimical friendship cliques. And <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> recent studies that show that when individuals in a structurally imbalanced world change ties one by one following the principle, they do not necessarily end up in a structurally balanced world. I prove that if multiple ties can be changed simultaneously, then a structurally balanced world is guaranteed. 	In chapter 3, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> Burt's (1992) argument of "structural holes" that unconnected parts of a social network are niches for brokerage. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> Burt's suggestion that those aware of brokerage benefits end up occupying structurally advantaged network positions. I show how this statement crucially depends on the unawareness of these benefits by others. If everyone strives for structural holes, no one ends up with a structural advantage. 	In chapter 4, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> the extensive laboratory evidence on the relationship between the structure of small exchange networks and expected exchange rates. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> a theory that reasonably predicts this relationship in a handful of networks. I show that if individuals add ties that increase expected earnings from exchange more than they cost and delete all other ties, then networks emerge that distribute exchange benefits equally. 	In chapter 5, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> the old immigrant assimilation model of a monotonic process. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> recent work in the direction of an alternative model. I propose an alternative model that follows up on this work and adds minimal complexity to the old model. In this model, quite assimilated migrants further assimilate, while not so assimilated migrants reverse-assimilate. Using longitudinal survey data, I show that the model is empirically competitive.
