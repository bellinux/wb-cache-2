500|$|William IV had a {{short but}} eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the {{ascendancy}} of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated {{a reduction in the}} political influence of the Crown and of the King's influence with the people. During the reign of George III, the King could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the people to vote in favour of the new administration. Such {{was the result of a}} dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the Fox-North Coalition, and in 1807, after the dismissal of Lord Grenville. But when William IV dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Sir Robert Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch's ability to influence the opinion of the people, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, [...] "I have my view of things, and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have done my duty." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{was written}} by Al Jean and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. The episode features several other references to popular culture. For example, the song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical West Side Story. The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for The Cable Guy (1996), Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), a model of the RMS Titanic from Titanic (1997), an alien similar to those from Mars Attacks! (1996), models of a TIE fighter, an X-wing fighter and C-3PO from the Star Wars saga, as well as [...] "the coffee mug" [...] from the film Heartbeeps (1981) and [...] "the cane" [...] from Citizen Kane (1941), which is not a real prop. [...] "Citizen Kane" [...] is also referenced in the script with the line [...] "People will think what <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> think when you tell me what to tell them to think!" [...] Also there's a reference to Glengarry Glen Ross, with a desperate salesman (like Jack Lemmon in the film) as Lisa is touring the local paper earlier in the episode.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, it IS a queer hour, isn't it?' replied Crowl, {{who was not}} best {{pleased at}} the {{prospect}} of losing his fire; 'and they are queer-looking people, too, all covered with rain and mud. Shall <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go away?' ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{some women}} did aspire to the [...] "WAG" [...] look. Mrs Rooney noted that [...] "apparently {{more and more}} women are getting into debt because they try to shop and party like a footballers wife. If I heard of anyone doing that, <b>Id</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get a grip". Sunday Times {{columnist}} India Knight observed, while waiting in an airport queue, that [...] "its as if a low-level wannabe footballers wife vibe that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor edifying has become the norm ... I saw this phenomenon en masse". Among other features, Knight identified [...] "enough pink glitter to satisfy the girliest of five-year-olds", massive handbags and huge designer sunglasses.|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't! ever so {{many folks}} have taken roots away, {{but they never}} thrive in gardens as they do on the hills where they belong. So <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> leave the dear bushes alone, and {{come up here and}} enjoy 'em in their own place. You might keep a plant of it in your hot-house, and it would blow I dare say; but it would never be half so lovely as my acres of them, and I guess it would only make you sad, seeing it so far from home, and pale and pining," [...] {{answered}} Becky, with her eyes on the green slopes where the mountain-laurel braved the wintry snow, and came out fresh and early in the spring.|$|R
5000|$|In an author's note, Manning-Sanders says of {{the passing}} down of the tales: [...] "A widow woman lived in a cottage by the sea. ...

6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} you say. The tax on tea, the {{shutting}} {{the port of}} Boston, and other steps, have brought larger bodies of the king's troops among us, than have been usual. Boston, as you probably know, has had a strong garrison, now, for some months. About six weeks since, the commander-in-chief sent a detachment {{out as far as}} Concord, in New Hampshire, to destroy certain stores. This detachment had a meeting with the minute-men, and blood was drawn. A running fight ensued, in which several hundreds have been killed and wounded; and I think I know both sides sufficiently well, to predict that a long and bloody civil war is begun. These are facts you should know, and accordingly <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E

"Well, not quite, perhaps; but I {{never can}} {{get to talk to}} her, and I know it is a terrible {{sacrifice}} to her to live here at all, and I won't have her forced into a style of thing against her conscience. If they come <b>to</b> me, <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take Mr. Bowater." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Children {{are always}} asking me what advice I can give <b>them</b> on trying <b>to</b> be a writer. <b>I</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{do a lot}} of reading, read and study {{creative}} writing, then start writing and keep writing and then they can be a writer too. Someday they will make it if they don’t give up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we do buy a {{good many}} books, first and last," [...] said the Colonel, who {{probably}} had in mind the costly volumes which they presented to one another on birthdays and holidays. [...] "But I get about all the reading I want in the newspapers. And when the girls want a novel, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> {{get it out of}} the library. That's what the library's for. Phew!" [...] he panted, blowing away the whole unprofitable subject. [...] "How close you women-folks like to keep a room! You go down to the sea-side or up to the mountains for a change of air, and then you cork yourselves into a room so tight you don't have any air at all. Here! You girls get on your bonnets, and go and show Mr. Corey the view of the hotels from the rocks." ...|$|R
60|$|All right--advertise {{me for the}} new volume. I {{send you}} {{herewith}} a sketch which will make 3 pages of the Atlantic. If you like it and accept it, you should get it into the December No. because I shall read it in public in Boston the 13th and 14th of Nov. If it went in a month earlier {{it would be too}} old for me to read except as old matter; and if it went in a month later it would be too old for the Atlantic--do you see? And if you wish to use it, will you set it up now, and send me three proofs?--one to correct for Atlantic, one to send to Temple Bar (shall <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> use it not earlier than their November No.) and one to use in practising for my Boston readings.|$|E

"I had {{run away}} from a monastery, so had you; I hated the monks, so did you; I liked to tell stories,--since I found good to shut my mouth <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> myself all day long, {{sometimes}} all night too. When I found out you liked to hear them, I loved you all the more. Then {{they told me not}} to speak to you; I held my tongue. I bided my time. I knew you would be outlawed some day. I knew you would turn Viking and kempery-man, and kill giants and enchanters, and win yourself honor and glory; and I knew I should have my share in it. I knew you would need me some day; and you need me now, and here I am; and if you try to cut me down with your sword, I will dodge you, and follow you, and dodge you again, till I force you to let me be your man, for with you I will live and die. And now I can talk no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou be'st surely enough awake," [...] {{answered}} the old man; [...] "but {{there are other}} matters yet to be told. My Lord thinketh, as others of us do--Lord George and myself--that {{it is now time}} for thee to put away thy boyish follies, and learn those things appertaining to manhood. Thou hast been here a year now, and hast had freedom to do as thou might list; but, boy,"--and the old warrior spoke seriously, almost solemnly--"upon thee doth rest matters of such great import that did <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> thee thou couldst not grasp them. My Lord deems that thou hast, mayhap, promise beyond the common of men; ne'theless it remaineth yet to be seen an he be right; it is yet to test whether that promise may be fulfilled. Next Monday I and Sir Everard Willoughby take thee in hand to begin training thee in the knowledge {{and the use of the}} jousting lance, of arms, and of horsemanship. Thou art to go to Ralph Smith, and have him fit a suit of plain armor to thee which he hath been charged to make for thee against this time. So get thee gone, think well over all these matters, and prepare thyself by next Monday. But stay, sirrah," [...] he added, as Myles, dazed and bewildered, turned to obey; [...] "breathe to no living soul what I ha' told thee--that my Lord is thy friend--neither speak of anything concerning him. Such is his own heavy command laid upon thee." ...|$|E

60|$|My dear Friend,--I {{well know}} you feel, as you say, for her {{once and for}} me now. Isa Blagden, perfect in all {{kindness}} to me, will have told you something, perhaps, and one day I shall see you {{and be able to}} tell you myself as much as I can. The main comfort is that she suffered very little pain, none beside that ordinarily attending the simple attacks of cold and cough she was subject to, had no presentiment of the result whatever, and was consequently spared the misery of knowing she was about to leave us: she was smilingly assuring me that she was 'better,' 'quite comfortable, if I would but come to bed,' to within a few minutes of the last. I think I foreboded evil at Rome, certainly from the beginning of the week's illness, but when I reasoned about it, there was no justifying fear. She said on the last evening 'It is merely the old attack, not so severe a one as that of two years ago; there is no doubt I shall soon recover,' and we talked over plans for the summer and next year. I sent the servants away and her maid to bed, so little reason for disquietude did there seem. Through the night she slept heavily and brokenly--that was the bad sign; but then she would sit up, take her medicine, say unrepeatable things to me, and sleep again. At four o'clock there were symptoms that alarmed me; I called the maid and sent for the doctor. She smiled as I proposed to bathe her feet, 'Well, you are determined to make an exaggerated case of it!' Then came what my heart will keep till I see her again and longer--the most perfect expression of her love to me within my whole knowledge of her. Always smilingly, happily, and with a face like a girl's, and in a few minutes she died in my arms, her head on my cheek. These incidents so sustain me that <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> her beloved ones as their right: there was no lingering, nor acute pain, nor consciousness of separation, but God took her to Himself as you would lift a sleeping child from a dark uneasy bed into your arms and the light. Thank God! Annunziata thought, by her earnest ways with me, happy and smiling as they were, that she must have been aware of our parting's approach, but she was quite conscious, had words at command, and yet did not even speak of Peni, who was in the next room. The last word was, when I asked, 'How do you feel?' 'Beautiful.'...|$|E

5000|$|In February 2008, Cook had a {{contentious}} interview with actor Clive Swift. [...] "I'm quite aggrieved," [...] Swift told him. [...] "Why should I do this? I'm not getting paid, am I?"

When Cook asked Swift - {{best known for his}} portrayal of Richard Bucket in BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances - whether people shout [...] "Richard" [...] at him in the street, the actor replied: [...] "Sometimes. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fuck off."

5000|$|The name keisei sanshoku is a paraphase {{from the}} Song Dynasty Chinese poet Su Shi, wherein he {{experiences}} {{the sound of}} the valley stream as the preaching of the dharma and the mountain as the body of the Buddha.
