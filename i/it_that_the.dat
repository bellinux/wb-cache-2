5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persian king (who at {{the time}} would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E

Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - {{as seen in the}} goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E

5|$|Mythology has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{forests of}} Vajjabhumi (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities. Some authors have called Birbhum {{by the name}} Kamkoti which relates to its tantric heritage. Tantrics, {{including}} the Vajrayana, the Shaktas, and the Buddhists established many temples for tantra sadhana rituals and Shakti worship. Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith, Bakreshwar, Kankalitala, Fullara near Labhpur, Sainthia and Nalhati. One of the famous Shakti worshippers of Tarapith was Bamdev, popularly known as Bama Khyapa.|$|E

5|$|One account has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans paid Bogdan-Pitești {{the cost}} of paper and printing, which had been {{hitherto}} provided, for free, by Cantacuzino. Bogdan-Pitești (and German funds) were probably involved in financing a new platform, Cronica, launched by Arghezi and Gala Galaction in February 1915. In October of that year, with probable German support, Bogdan-Pitești, Arghezi and Galaction set up another Germanophile newspaper, Libertatea ("Freedom"), presided upon, for a short while, by N. Fleva. According to one account, Fleva had earlier been approached to take over as Seara manager by German envoys Brociner and Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, but, realizing the implications, had refused.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the eighteenth}} century, the Russian Orthodox Church did not assign any {{particular}} symbolism to the exterior {{shape of a}} church. Nevertheless, onion domes are popularly believed to symbolise burning candles. In 1917, noted religious philosopher Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoy argued that the onion shape of Russian church domes may not be explained rationally. According to Trubetskoy, drums crowned by tapering domes were deliberately scored to resemble candles, thus manifesting a certain aesthetic and religious attitude. Another explanation has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> onion dome was originally regarded as a form reminiscent of the edicula (cubiculum) in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna saw to <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E

5|$|Several legends about Jovan Vladimir {{have been}} {{recorded}} in western Macedonia. One has it that, after he was beheaded, he brought {{his head to the}} Monastery of StJohn of Bigor. On a hill above the village of Pesočani in the Municipality of Debarca, there is a locality called Vladimirovo, at which some ruins can be seen. The locals claimed that Vladimir was born there, and brought his severed head there. The Church of StAthanasius near Pesočani, now in ruins, is reputed to have been built by Vladimir. People from the region gathered there each year {{on the eve of his}} feast day. They lit candles on the remains of the church's walls, and prayed to the saint. Tradition has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Monastery of StNaum had a bell tower named after the saint, in the foundation of which a portion of his relics was placed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|St Nicholas Church, {{near the}} river Thames, has a 15th-century tower, {{although}} {{the remainder of the}} church was rebuilt by J.L. Pearson in 1882–84. Monuments in the churchyard mark the burial sites of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth and William Kent, the architect and landscape designer; the churchyard also houses a mausoleum (for Philip James de Loutherbourg) designed by John Soane, and the tomb of Josiah Wedgwood's business partner, Thomas Bentley, designed by Thomas Scheemakers. One of Oliver Cromwell's daughters, Mary Fauconberg, lived at Sutton Court and is buried in the churchyard. Enduring legend has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body of Oliver Cromwell was also interred with her, though as the Fauconbergs did not move to Sutton Court until 15 years after his disinterment, it is more likely he was reburied at their home at Newburgh Priory. Private Frederick Hitch VC, hero of Rorke's Drift, is also buried there.|$|E

5|$|The Dominican Order had {{its origins}} in the reformist {{ideology}} of Dominic de Guzmán, later Saint Dominic. By 1219, Dominic had established houses as far apart as Paris, Bologna, Madrid and Segovia; at his death in 1221, there were 21 houses. Expansion of the order continued into England as houses were established at Oxford in 1221 and London in 1224. There were five houses in England by 1230, by which time the Order was poised to enter Scotland. Later tradition had <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Order entered Scotland in 1230, encouraged by King Alexander II and William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews.

5|$|Wiesenthal was {{nominated}} for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, the fortieth anniversary {{of the end of}} the war. Rumour had <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Nobel Committee would give the prize to a Holocaust-related candidate. Fellow Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel, also nominated, began a campaign in hopes of winning the prize, travelling to France, Ethiopia and Oslo for speaking tours and humanitarian work. Rabbi Hier of the Wiesenthal Center urged Wiesenthal to lobby for the prize as well, but other than delivering a lecture in Oslo, Wiesenthal did little to promote his candidacy. When Wiesel was awarded the 1986 prize, Wiesenthal claimed the World Jewish Congress must have influenced the Committee's decision, a claim the WJC denied. Biographer Tom Segev speculates that the loss may have been because of the negative publicity over the Waldheim affair.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} both Colla Ciotach and the Macfie chief lived on Colonsay, with Colla Ciotach {{residing}} at Kiloran and Macfie at Dùn Eibhinn. During {{this time the}} two feuded. Judging by the many hiding places which bear his name, such as leab' fhalaich Mhic a Phì ("MacPhee's Hiding Place"), Macfie was chased {{from one to another}} for quite sometime. Finally, in 1623, Malcolm Macfie was chased from Colonsay and pursued to Eilean nan Ròn (south-west of Oronsay). There, on the south-western corner of Eilean nan Ròn, called an t Eilean Iarach, he was spotted and taken by the MacDonalds. Popular lore has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Macfie chief was finally discovered when his hiding place amongst the seaweed was given away by a gull. As it hovered over Macfie's position, Colla Ciotach's men were alerted by its cry and spotted the clan chief on a ledge of rock {{at the edge of the}} sea. After being apprehended, the chief was then tied to a stone and summarily shot. Colla Ciotach, and several of his followers, appear in the Council Records in 1623 as being accused of killing the Macfie chief. Because of the death of their chief the Macfies finally lost control of Colonsay. The island then passed to the Macdonalds, as Colla Ciotach took the island for himself, and held it peacefully for many years.|$|E

5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
