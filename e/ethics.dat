5|$|American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism, {{political}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, {{the modern}} debate between rationalism and empiricism, {{and the influence}} of natural law as influences on the development of Kant's <b>ethics.</b> Other philosophers have argued that Kant's parents and his teacher, Martin Knutzen, influenced his <b>ethics.</b> Those influenced by Kantian <b>ethics</b> include philosopher Jürgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that <b>ethics</b> should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive. Michael Stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship, while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations.

40|$|China {{has been}} {{promoting}} bilingual education in its minority <b>ethic</b> regions since the 1980 s. However, in practice, {{out of the}} 55 minority <b>ethic</b> groups in China, only 30 have been observed to be implementing bilingual education. Moreover, the ways and forms of implementing bilingual education differ among these 30 minority <b>ethic</b> groups. This paper attempts to analyze this bilingual education phenomenon among the minority <b>ethic</b> groups based on 4 factors : (1) the population size of the minority <b>ethic</b> groups, (2) {{the presence or absence}} of minority self-governance, (3) {{the presence or absence of}} <b>ethic</b> written language, and (4) whether or not the ethnic group belongs to the national academic community. Analysis results show that whether an <b>ethic</b> group implement bilingual education is largely determined by whether the <b>ethic</b> group has its own <b>ethic</b> written language-those having their own <b>ethic</b> written language are implementing bilingual education, while those without are not. On the other hand, the ways and forms of implementation are largely determined by whether or not the <b>ethic</b> group belongs to the national academic community. <b>Ethic</b> groups belonging to the national academic community employ the Chinese language (Mandarin) as the instruction medium and teach their own <b>ethic</b> language as an academic subject, while those not belonging to the community use their <b>ethic</b> language as the instruction medium and teach the Chinese language as a subject. In summary, while China has been promoting bilingual education among its minority <b>ethic</b> groups, whether to implement and how to implement bilingual education is a question that has led to different answers and actions are further more influenced by the specific <b>ethic</b> culture (language) concerned as well as the minority-majority relationship between the <b>ethic</b> groups and the Chinese race...|$|R

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse <b>ethics</b> that he claims is a descendant of Kantian <b>ethics.</b> He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian <b>ethics,</b> discourse <b>ethics</b> is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's <b>ethics.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This essay {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} claim that competition in medicine destroys the moral integrity of the traditional patient-physician relationship. The author argues that the traditional patient-centered <b>ethic</b> is indefensible on moral grounds, and {{that it should be}} jettisoned in favor of a fiduciary <b>ethic.</b> A fiduciary <b>ethic</b> is found to provide the best defensible account of the patient-physician relationship because it takes seriously the roles economic efficiency, competition, and respect for individual self-deter-mination play in fashioning moral health care delivery. Key Words: competition, patient-physician relationship, fiduciary <b>ethic,</b> patient-centered <b>ethic.</b> Recently many authors have argued that increased competition in the field of health care is morally objectionable. In support of this claim, some have held that increased competition will destroy the traditional patient-centered <b>ethic.</b> 1 Typical defenses of a more competitive health care field have countered that increased competition will not harm this <b>ethic.</b> 2 Here I make a more radical defense of increased competition. I argue that the traditional <b>ethic</b> is not worth preserving. A normal fiduciary <b>ethic</b> is morally preferable to the traditional patient-centered <b>ethic</b> (hereafter patient <b>ethic).</b> While many criticisms of increased competition in the health care field have been made, most have been decisively refuted (Brock and Buchanan, 1986 J. The argument from the destruction of the patient <b>ethic</b> is, to my mind, the only argument that has eluded refutation. While technically all I will offer here is a refutation of this remaining objection, I see myself as putting th...|$|R

Questions asked in the study were: (1) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> of justice or an <b>ethic</b> of care for male protagonists involved in moral decision making? (2) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> of justice or an <b>ethic</b> of care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making? (3) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> of justice or an <b>ethic</b> of care for male protagonists involved in moral decision making? and (4) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> of justice or an <b>ethic</b> of care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making? Content analysis was used as the method of collecting data. The sample consisted of 194 novels written from 1989 to 1998, 53 of which contained a moral dilemma. A discussion of the novels included examples of moral dilemmas, alternative solutions, dilemma resolutions, and resolutions based upon care or justice. Analysis of the data revealed: (1) Female writers employ an <b>ethic</b> of care and an <b>ethic</b> of justice for male protagonists involved in moral decision making. (2) Female writers prefer an <b>ethic</b> of care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making. (3) Male writers prefer an <b>ethic</b> of justice for male protagonists involved in moral decision making.

5|$|Process <b>ethics,</b> Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} <b>ethics.</b> In considering collectivist environmental <b>ethics,</b> Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems.

The primary difference between process <b>ethics</b> and collectivist environmental <b>ethics,</b> however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian <b>ethics</b> as {{closer to}} the virtue <b>ethics</b> of Aristotle than Kant's <b>ethics.</b> He presented virtue <b>ethics</b> as freedom for excellence, which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of <b>ethics,</b> because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian <b>ethics.</b>|$|E
