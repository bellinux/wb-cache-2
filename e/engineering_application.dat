25|$|To {{compensate}} for the discrepancy, the frequency standard on board each satellite is given a rate offset prior to launch, making it run slightly slower than the desired frequency on Earth; specifically, at 10.22999999543MHz instead of 10.23MHz. Since the atomic clocks on board the GPS satellites are precisely tuned, it makes the system a practical <b>engineering</b> <b>application</b> of the scientific theory of relativity in a real-world environment. Placing atomic clocks on artificial satellites to test Einstein's general theory was proposed by Friedwardt Winterberg in 1955.|$|E

2500|$|Gradation affects many {{properties}} of an aggregate. [...] It affects bulk density, physical stability and permeability. [...] With careful {{selection of the}} gradation, {{it is possible to}} achieve high bulk density, high physical stability, and low permeability. [...] This is important because in pavement design, a workable, stable mix with resistance to water is important. [...] With an open gradation, the bulk density is relatively low, {{due to the lack of}} fine particles, the physical stability is moderate, and the permeability is quite high. [...] With a rich gradation, the bulk density will also be low, the physical stability is low, and the permeability is also low. [...] The gradation can be affected to achieve the desired properties for the particular <b>engineering</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, multiwing chaos {{generation}} has seen promising advances and becomes an active research field today. It {{is well known that}} there is a gap between theoretical design and <b>engineering</b> <b>applications</b> in multiwing chaos generation. That is, most theoretical designs of multiwing chaotic attractors with mathematical proofs or numerical verification have rather complex expressions; however, most <b>engineering</b> <b>applications</b> of multiwing chaotic attractors without theoretical supports have simple expressions. To bridge the gap between theoretical design and <b>engineering</b> <b>applications</b> in multiwing chaos generation, this paper introduces a novel practical approach for generating grid multiwing butterfly chaotic attractors from the multipiecewise L system by constructing heteroclinic loops. It should be particularly pointed out that the designed multiwing chaotic attractors exhibit typical heteroclinic chaos from the heteroclinic Shil&# 039;nikov theorem and also have clear potential <b>engineering</b> <b>applications.</b> The proposed method can be easily extended to the generalized Lorenz system family...|$|R
