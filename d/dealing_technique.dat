False <b>deals</b> are <b>techniques</b> which appear to deliver cards fairly, when actually the cards delivered are predetermined or known to the performer. False <b>dealing</b> <b>techniques</b> include: second <b>dealing,</b> bottom dealing, middle dealing, false counts (more or less cards are dealt than expected), and double dealing (the top and bottom cards of a small packet are dealt together).|$|R

Risa taught Rio and Rina her <b>dealing</b> <b>techniques</b> during their childhoods, and was the {{previous}} MVCD, having collected all 13 Gates. She disappeared from public eyes and disguised herself as Joker, a masked Gate Holder holding the #2 Gate, to hide herself from the Casino Guild and to protect Rio, and later challenges Rio to a Gate Battle {{to see if she}} is worthy of challenging Rina again. It is revealed by Rina that she allegedly had an affair with her father, which resulted in Rina's mother falling into a coma.

This rich data set is underutilized in the analysis performed by Exame 500, rankings and relative performance being assessed in a naïve fashion. This study seeks to provide an enhanced view of the sectoral performance of the Portuguese economy in the period 1989 - 1999 using the Data Envelopment Analysis (<b>DEAl</b> <b>technique.</b> Additionally, the relative performance of national to foreign-owned companies and public to private companies is assessed. An analysis of the results seeks to understand why certain sectors perform better than others, and how national/ foreign ownership and public/ private objectives matter. The results are interpreted with particular reference to the economic background of the period. Some final comments are presented discussing the usefulness of DEA and possible revisions of the technique {{as well as other}} limitations of the study...|$|R

Janusz Starzyk developed an algorithm for computing reducts using strong equivalence and the law of expansion on the data. However, implementation of this algorithm is cumbersome for huge volume of data. This paper <b>deals</b> with a <b>technique</b> for obtaining the reduct of the entire system by partitioning it into two with respect to records and obtaining the reducts of the two subsystems and the ‘between reducts’. Further, it also <b>deals</b> with a <b>technique</b> for combining the reducts computed at the clients to obtain global reducts.

40|$|Whether for {{pathological}} examination or for fundamental biology studies, different classes of biomaterials and biomolecules are each measured {{from a different}} region of a typically heterogeneous tissue sample, thus introducing unavoidable sources of noise {{that are hard to}} quantitate. We describe the method of DNA-encoded antibody libraries (DEAL) for spatially multiplexed detection of ssDNAs and proteins as well as for cell sorting, all on the same diagnostic platform. DEAL is based upon the coupling of ssDNA oligomers onto antibodies which are then combined with the biological sample of interest. Spotted DNA arrays, which are found to inhibit biofouling, are utilized to spatially stratify the biomolecules or cells of interest. We demonstrate the <b>DEAL</b> <b>technique</b> for (1) the rapid detection of multiple proteins within a single microfluidic channel, and, with the additional step of electroless amplification of gold-nanoparticle labeled secondary antibodies, we establish a detection limit of 10 fM for the protein IL- 2, 150 times more sensitive than the analogue ELISA; (2) the multiplexed, on-chip sorting of both immortalized cell lines and primary immune cells with an efficiency that exceeds surface-confined panning approaches; and (3) the co-detection of ssDNAs, proteins, and cell populations on the same platform...|$|R
