5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks.

Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
