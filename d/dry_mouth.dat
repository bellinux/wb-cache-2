5|$|Treatment of meth mouth usually {{attempts}} to increase salivary flow, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes. Toothpaste with fluoride {{is very important}} to the restoration of dental health. Only prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition. Sialogogues, drugs that increase the amount of saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat <b>dry</b> <b>mouth</b> and protect against dental health problems. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat <b>dry</b> <b>mouth</b> caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (<b>dry</b> <b>mouth).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for <b>dry</b> <b>mouth,</b> as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral {{yohimbine}} (14 mg) on salivary secretion was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Yohimbine significantly increased salivary secretion {{when compared with}} placebo. This effect was significant from 60 min until 180 min after administration under our experimental conditions. Yohimbine (or alpha 2 -adrenoceptor blocking agents) could have a potential interest {{in the treatment of}} <b>dry</b> <b>mouths...</b>|$|R

50|$|D'Annunzio {{was known}} as a lover of women of all ages, so one cannot exclude the {{possibility}} that the woman in question, whose rose-like <b>dried</b> <b>mouth</b> the poet was writing about, was in her late forties or even older. The text does not belong to the old Seventeenth/Eighteenth century Neapolitan lyric tradition, and was specially written for Tosti by Gabriele D'Annunzio {{in the first half of}} the 1900s.|$|R
5|$|Three-quarters {{of people}} with LEMS also have {{disruption}} of the autonomic nervous system. This may be experienced as a <b>dry</b> <b>mouth,</b> constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a <b>dry</b> <b>mouth.</b> A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of <b>dry</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E

40|$|Oral {{nutritional}} supplement drinks (ONS) are beverages high in dairy proteins that are prescribed to individuals {{at risk of}} malnutrition. Consumption of ONS is poor in elderly care facilities, with patients commenting that the sensory attributes of these drinks reduce their enjoyment and willingness to consume. <b>Mouth</b> <b>drying</b> is an attribute of ONS found to build with repeated consumption, which may further limit liking of these products. This study investigated the sources of drying sensations by sequential profiling, with a trained sensory panel rating a range of model milk systems and ONS over repeated sips and during after-effects. Sequential profiling found that fortification of milk with both caseinate and whey protein concentrate significantly increased the perception of <b>mouth</b> <b>drying</b> over repeated consumption, increasing by between 35 and 85 % over consumption of 40 mL. Enrichment of ONS with either whey protein concentrate or milk protein concentrate to a total protein content of 8. 7 % (wt/wt) resulted in whey and casein levels of 4. 3 : 4. 4 % and 1. 7 : 7. 0 % respectively. The product higher in whey protein was substantially more <b>mouth</b> <b>drying,</b> implying that whey proteins {{may be the most}} important contributor to <b>mouth</b> <b>drying</b> in ONS. However, efforts to mask <b>mouth</b> <b>drying</b> of protein-fortified milk by increasing sweetness or fat level were unsuccessful at the levels tested. Increasing the viscosity of protein-fortified milk led to a small but significant reduction in <b>mouth</b> <b>drying.</b> However, this approach was not successful when tested within complete ONS. Further analysis is required into the mechanism of protein-derived <b>mouth</b> <b>drying</b> to mask negative sensations and improve the enjoyment and consumption of protein-rich ONS...|$|R
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, <b>dry</b> <b>mouth,</b> and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia, {{also known}} as <b>dry</b> <b>mouth</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>mouth</b> syndrome, is dryness in the mouth, which may be {{associated}} with a change in the composition of saliva, or reduced salivary flow, or have no identifiable cause.|$|E

5000|$|Petit Rouge is {{primarily}} {{found in the}} Valle d'Aosta region of northwest Italy between Piedmont and the Alps separating Italy from France and Switzerland. In general, altitude determines which varieties of grapes may be grown in a particular location, with reds growing at lower elevations and whites at higher elevations. However, despite its high altitude and mountainous location, nearly 90% of the wine in the Valle d'Aosta is red or rosé [...] with Petit Rouge playing a considerable role {{in many of the}} blends produced under the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) designation of the region. This is because the variety thrives during the hot, <b>dry</b> <b>mouths</b> of the summer, allowing time to develop sufficient sugar levels and physiological ripeness.|$|R
40|$|High protein dairy {{beverages}} {{are considered}} to be <b>mouth</b> <b>drying.</b> The drying sensation {{may be due to the}} product protein content; however the mechanism of this <b>mouth</b> <b>drying</b> is uncertain. This study investigated the potential adhesion of milk proteins to porcine oral mucosal tissues and their resistance to wash out with simulated saliva was monitored using fluorescence microscopy. Cadein was found to be more adhesive to porcine mucosa then lactogloubulin. Some investigation into the reason for this difference in mucoadhesion was conducted by thiol-content analysis, rheology and zeta-potential measurements. The higher viscosity of casein solution and smaller zeta-potential is believed to be responsible for its better retention on mucosal surfaces. These findings suggest that casein and whey protein are both capable of binding and eliciting <b>mouth</b> <b>drying</b> in high protein dairy beverages...|$|R

60|$|A boatman turned {{where he}} sat on the gunwale, lifted up his hand, said {{something}} that was not a blessing, and the boats creaked on through the twilight. The broad Indian river, that looked more like a chain of little lakes than a stream, was as smooth as glass, reflecting the sandy-red sky in mid-channel, but splashed with patches of yellow and dusky purple near and under the low banks. Little creeks ran into the river in the wet season, but now their <b>dry</b> <b>mouths</b> hung clear above water-line. On the left shore, and almost under the railway bridge, stood a mud-and-brick and thatch-and-stick village, whose main street, full of cattle going back to their byres, ran straight to the river, and ended in a sort of rude brick pier-head, where people who wanted to wash could wade in step by step. That was the Ghaut of the village of Mugger-Ghaut.|$|R
