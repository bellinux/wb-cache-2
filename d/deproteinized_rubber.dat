5000|$|John Twiss Blake (c. 1901-June 26, 1987) was a {{research}} scientist at the Simplex Wire and Cable Co. in Boston, Massachusetts who, along with Charles R. Boggs, found that proteins present in natural rubber were responsible for water absorption. [...] Blake and Boggs showed that the proteins could be isolated by repeated centrifugal action on liquid latex. In 1926 Simplex applied for a patent on the <b>deproteinized</b> <b>rubber.</b> This {{became the basis for}} a new product family of lightweight, moisture-proof Anhydrex-insulated power and communication cables. He made significant contributions to understanding various degradation mechanisms of rubber, including the effects of water absorption, exposure to light, ozone, and microbes.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{remaining}} {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) used in washing steps on further leaching of proteins from the <b>deproteinized</b> <b>rubber</b> films was investigated. High-Ammonia Natural Rubber Latex (HANRL) was diluted with 0. 01 % w/v potassium hydroxide solution to obtain about 30 % dry rubber content (DRC) and it is called diluted NRL. The untreated NRL was directly casted to a film (sample 0). Sample 1 was prepared by centrifugation of diluted NRL at 5000 rpm for 1 min. Sample 1 - 2 was prepared by washing Sample 1 with 0. 5 %wt SDS solution. Sample 1 - 3 was prepared by washing Sample 1 - 2 with 0. 1 %wt SDS solution. After that they were casted into films. The dried films were checked for the extractable protein (EP) content by modified Lowry method and nitrogen content according to SMR: Bulletin No. 7 - 1992. The EP content of Sample 1 film was less than the untreated (Sample 0) one but the EP content was increased after washing with 0. 5 %wt SDS solution and then dropped slightly after washing again with 0. 1 %wt SDS solution. In contrast, nitrogen content and FTIR spectra confirmed that {{the total amount of}} proteins in films was decreased when they underwent more treating steps. This finding suggested that although overall protein content decreased, the remaining SDS on the films could facilitate further leaching of EP from the film surface when it was in contact with extraction medium (PBS or synthetic sweat) under condition with shear force. The use of this deproteinized film should, therefore, be done with care...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{proteins}} from natural rubber through a batch process was studied by the incubation of the rubber latex with urea {{in the presence}} of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Under suitable conditions, the total nitrogen content of <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (DPNR) decreased from 0. 38 to 0. 02 wt % after incubation for 10 min; this was {{similar to that of the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>deproteinized</b> with a proteolytic enzyme for 12 h. For applications, continuous incubation and centrifugation were individually investigated by the use of a semicircular channel and a continuous centrifuge, respectively, to scale up DPNR preparation.

The presence of the grafted polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) on the rubber backbone was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The effects of monomer concentrations on curing characteristics and mechanical properties were studied. It {{was found that the}} cure time and scorch time were increased with increasing monomer concentration whereas the torque max-min value was slightly decreased. It was also noted that the increase in the monomer concentration resulted in stiffer rubber with increased modulus and reduced elongation at break...|$|R
40|$|The graft {{polymerization}} of Styrene and Methyl methacrylate (MMA) onto <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex (DPNR) {{was carried out}} using ammonium peroxy disulfate (N 2 H 8 O 8 S 2) as an initiator. The suitable reaction conditions based on the higher monomer conversion was determined. The degree of grafting and the copolymers composition of the resultant SMMA-DPNR were obtained using H- 1 NMR Spectroscopy. As expected, composition of styrene in DPNR was {{higher than that of}} MMA due to the higher reactivity ratio of styrene monomer as compared to MMA monomer and the structure of the NR backbone. The mechanism of seeded emulsion polymerization leading to graft copolymer of styrene and MMA onto NR was studied and elucidated...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} modified <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (DPNR) prepared by graft copolymerization with various styrene contents was investigated at {{a wide range}} of temperatures. Graft copolymerization of styrene onto DPNR was performed in latex stage using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHPO) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) as redox initiator. The mechanical properties were measured by tensile test and the viscoelastic properties of the resulting graft copolymers at wide range of temperature and frequency were investigated. It was found that the tensile strength depends on the grafted polystyrene; meanwhile the dynamic mechanical properties of the modification of DPNR meaningfully improved with the increasing of both homopolystyrene and grafted polystyrene compared to DPNR. The dynamic mechanical properties of graft copolymer over a large time scale were studied by constructing the master curves. The value of bT has been used to prove the energetic and entropic elasticity of the graft copolymer...|$|R
40|$|A good {{dispersion}} of silica in a rubber vulcanizate is important as it influences the filler-to-rubber interaction and consequently the final properties. This article presents {{an investigation into}} the morphology of silica-reinforced natural rubber (NR) in the presence and absence of a silane coupling agent, bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT). Micro- and nano-dispersion morphologies of silica in NR and <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (DPNR) are studied by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Using a special network visualization technique based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM), insight into the silica and rubber interaction in the NR and DPNR is gained. In the absence of silane, vacuoles around the silica particles are formed {{as a result of a}} weak filler–polymer interaction, whereas the presence of silane leads to strong filler-to-rubber bonding, which prevents formation of vacuoles. Improvement of the micro-{{dispersion of}} silica in the NR and DPNR vulcanizates with the use of TESPT is observed from AFM phase imaging. The correlation between the filler-to-rubber interaction as analyzed by TEM and AFM and bound rubber contents as well as the Payne effect is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Double {{networks}} were prepared from guayule <b>rubber</b> (GR), <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (DPNR), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), and their properties compared to conventional “single networks ” {{having the same}} crosslink den-sity. Substantial residual strains (> 150 %) were obtained in all double networks, whereby the modulus parallel to the residual strain was enhanced. For the two strain-crystallizing elastomers, the fatigue resistance of the double networks (for extensions parallel to the residual strain) was higher than for their single network counterparts. Moreover, the guayule rubber, which is more strain-crystallizable than DPNR, exhibited the greater enhancement. For the amorphous SBR, on the other hand, the network structure had an insignificant effect on the fatigue life. These results demonstrate that longer mechanical fatigue lifetimes in double network rubbers are a consequence of their intrinsic orientation. This provides the capacity to retain crystallinity {{at the front of}} growing cracks, {{even in the absence of}} stress. The origin of the improved fatigue resistance is similar to the mechanism responsible for the better performance of strain-crystallizing rub-bers subjected to non-relaxing cyclic deformations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The blended film of <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex (DNRL) with hydroxypropyl {{methylcellulose}} (HPMC) and dibutylphthalate (DBP) provided good properties that suitable for pharmaceutical applications. However, this film had successfully been confirmed in transdermal use only for high skin permeable drugs. In this study, this film was further modified {{to look forward}} on the delivery of a low permeable drug. Glycols, one group of chemical penetration enhancer, were investigated to blend in this film {{in order to enhance}} the low permeable drug through the skin. Various concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20 parts per hundred of rubber (phr)) of ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) were blended with DNRL/HPMC/ DBP mixtures before film construction by solution-casting technique. The modified films were evaluated in thickness, tensile strength, peel strength, tack adhesive, swelling and erosion ratios, moisture uptake, and compatibility. These blended films provided good characters in elasticity, adhesive properties, hydrophilicity, and compatibility. Their thickness could be controlled to be uniform. These new blended films were suitable to use in the further study for low permeable drug delivery through the skin...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermal history}} and in {{particular}} the mixing dump temperature is a parameter of paramount importance in mixing rubber and silica with a silane coupling agent in order to achieve proper silanization of silica and to avoid premature scorch reactions. In this work, the influence of mixing dump temperature on the performance of silica reinforced Natural Rubber (NR) is investigated. The investigation also includes the effect of non-rubber constituents, primarily proteins in NR, by using <b>deproteinized</b> Natural <b>Rubber</b> (DPNR) and synthetic polyisoprene (IR). The vulcanization properties and rubber-to-filler interactions of silica reinforced NR in presence and absence of a silane coupling agent are highlighted. With increasing mixing dump temperature, the silanization reaction between silica and silane coupling agent proceeds further. At sufficiently high dump temperature, filler-filler interactions in the NR-silica compounds are reduced and silica-rubber interaction improved as evidenced by a drop in the Payne effect and increment in chemically bound rubber. It is demonstrated that NR and IR compounds mixed till above the optimum dump temperature exhibit cure reversion and reduction in tensile properties. On the other hand, DPNR-silica vulcanizates show slightly more constant physical properties...|$|R
40|$|The graft {{copolymerization}} of styrene and methyl methacrylate (MMA) on to <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (DPNR) latex was carried out. The effect of monomer concentrations on grafting efficiency, thermal and mechanical properties was studied. The synthesized graft copolymers {{were characterized by}} proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) and the highest grafting efficiency was found at 20 wt % monomer concentration. At low monomer concentration (10 wt %) the grafting was not significant and at 30 wt %, the grafting efficiency was slightly decreased. The thermal properties of graft copolymers were analyzed using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The degradation temperature (Tdeg) of the graft copolymer wasincreased {{with the increase in}} monomer concentration which indicates the improvement in thermal stability. The DSC result showed improvement in miscibility between the components as the monomer concentration increased. The mechanical properties of gum and filled modified NR were also investigated in terms of tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation at break. The tensile strength and elongation at break decreased with an increase in monomer concentration while tensile modulus increased as the monomer concentration increased...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLiquid {{natural rubber}} (LNR) with a {{molecular}} weight Mn = 16 × 103 was {{prepared by the}} depolymerization of <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex (DPNR). The liquid natural rubber (LNR) was characterized by FTIR and H’NMR spectroscopic analysis. LNR was premixed with the epoxy resin (EP) and cured with a diamine curing agent for 1 h at 100 °C and post cured at 110 °C, for 2 h in air oven. The modified EP containing different contents of LNR (5, 10, 15 and 20 phr) were evaluated. Thermal, mechanical and morphology properties were determined. The fracture toughness (KIC) of both unmodified and modified EPs were determined on static loaded single edge notched (SEN-B) specimens at room temperature. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the modified EPs were decreased with increasing LNR content. The strengths and modulus of EPs were slightly reduced with the incorporation of LNR. The effect was also reflected in the {{significant increase in the}} tensile strain of modified EP. Fracture toughness of the EP was observed to increase with the presence of LNR. The toughening effect became more apparent as the testing speeds were increased from 1 to 500 mm/min.

Controlled {{degradation}} of <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> by oxidative method using cobaltous {{leading to the}} formation of telechelic liquid natural rubber (TLNR) {{has been the subject of}} study in the current work. Hydroxyl-terminated natural rubber (HTNR) having number-average molecular weights (Mn) below 10, 000 gmol- 1 were synthesized at temperatures 60 °C using Cobalt bis(acetyl acetonate) (Co) in the presence of ethanol and Sodium borohydride. The HTNR were characterized structurally by using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). From the FTIR and GPC analysis, one hour reaction showed the lowest Mn around 6691 gmol- 1 comparable to Hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) which were 7708 gmol- 1. As the reaction time increases the Mn also increase up to 8 hours of reaction. FTIR indicated that the synthesized HTNR contained hydroxyl end groups. The study showed the optimum percentage of Cobalt bis(acetyl acetonate) is 5 % which produce the lowest molecular weight. Next, the HTNR underwent crosslinking reaction with isophore diisocyanate (IPDI). Then, metal fuel (aluminium powder, Al), oxidizer (ammonium perchlorate, AP) and HTNR were mixed together and went through compression process to produce solid rocket propellant. Burning rate obtained from HTNR samples were 2. 78 mms- 1 which were equivalent to HTPB samples which is 2. 94 mms- 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Deproteinization {{of natural}} rubber was {{achieved}} in the latex stage. The structure of <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (DPNR) was characterized by {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} (FTIR). The thermo degradation of DPNR was studied by thermogravimetry analysis (TG) under air atmosphere and nitrogen atmosphere. The kinetic parameters apparent activation energies (Ea) of the thermal decomposition reaction been calculated from the TG curves using the method described by Broido. And the results were compared with the thermo degradation of natural rubber (NR) under the same conditions. The effect of proteins in natural rubber latex on thermal/ thermo-oxidative stability of NR was discussed. The results show that: the absorptions of the proteins in DPNR at 1546 cm- 1, compared to NR, become significantly weaker, nearly disappear, which indicates most of proteins has been removed from NR. The thermo degradation of DPNR in nitrogen atmosphere is a one-step reaction. The initial degradation temperature (T 0), the maximum degradation temperature（Tp ） and the final degradation temperature（Tf）as well as the Ea of DPNR are higher than those of NR, which indicates that DPNR represents a better thermal stability than NR under nitrogen atmosphere. Thermo-oxidative degradation of DPNR and NR are two-step reaction. The characteristic temperatures (T 0, Tp and Tf) of DPNR are lower than those of NR. Th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProperties of <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (DPNR) were {{investigated}} {{in order to}} apply the DPNR latex as non-allergy vulcanized rubber thin film products. Removal of proteins from natural rubber was made by incubation of high ammonium natural rubber latex (HA-NR) with urea 0. 1 wt%, 1 hour {{in the presence of}} surfactant at room temperature (DPNR). The nitrogen content of the DPNR was reduced to 0. 05 wt%, which was lower than 0. 45 wt% of HA-NR under the test condition. The reduction of protein content can be confirmed by observation a chemical structure through FT-IR technique. It is suggesting that the urea treatment is an effective method to remove protein from rubber latex. Then, physical properties of the DPNR latex {{were investigated}}. Amount of water soluble protein was observed through modified lowry method and it was found that water soluble protein content after incubation HA-NR with urea was reduced to 15 g/g (DPNR) from 4, 245 g/g (HA-NR). It was found that VFA number of DPNR was lower than that of HA-NR due to lower amount of protein presence in rubber latex. The particle size and charge of rubber latex was examined by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential to compare between un-vulcanized latex and vulcanized latex.

40|$|<b>Deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex (DPNR) was {{prepared}} using KAO protease enzyme to digest proteins from natural rubber low ammonia concentrated latex (NR-LA). Polystyrene latex (PS) was synthesized by emulsion polymerization technique for blending with natural rubber. The maximum fraction of PS blended NR-LA or DPNR {{used to obtain}} a homogenous film was 20 % w/w. The 300 % modulus of PS blended NR film was increased before and after aging at 100 ºC for 22 hrs. The tensile strength and elongation at break were increased at NR/PS = 95 / 5 w/w and tended to decrease as PS blended fraction increased. DPNR films had a lower friction coefficient than NR-LA films. PS blended NR-LA or DPNR would decrease the friction coefficient of films. The rubber-surfaced friction is reduced. The extractable protein of NR-LA film was higher than 200 μg/g whereas that of DPNR film was lower than 50 μg/g. PS blended NR-LA and DPNR could reduce the extractable protein to less than 60 μg/g and 30 μg/g, respectively. The physical properties of PS blended NR-LA met ASTM D 3577 and ASTM D 3578 standards for dipping products of surgical gloves and examination gloves at the maximum fraction of PS 15 % w/w and 20 % w/w, respectively, whereas PS blended DPNR only met ASTM D 3577 standard at the maximum fraction of PS < 5 % w/w...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the effects of drying {{temperature}} on the properties of <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex (DNRL) /starch composite films. These composite films were prepared by simple mixing and then drying at different temperatures of 50, 60 and 70 o C. Various parameters such as types (potato, sago, bean, corn, tapioca, rice, and glutinous starches), amounts (5 - 20 part per hundred of rubber (phr)) and water-dispersed concentrations (5 - 50 %) of starch blended were evaluated. It was found that only some DNRL/starch composite formulations could be prepared as the completely homogeneous films. Drying temperature affected the degree of starch gelatinization that confirmed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) technique. The DNRL composite films of 20 phr of all 7 starch types could be formed at 50 and 60 o C, while those of 20 phr sago, bean, corn, and rice starch could be formed at 70 o C. Some of these films were difficult to be the completely dry films at 70 o C due to their more degree of gelatinization of starch on the surface films which inhibited the evaporation of water inside the films. However, only some DNRL/starch composites showed the homogeneous film under cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Their compatibilities were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and DSC.

This study {{aimed to}} prepare the {{nicotine}} chewing gums for smoking cessation using <b>deproteinized</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex (DNRL) as gum bases due to its highly flexible property. The formulations were produced by the conventional heat melting and kneading methods. The experimental design was used to obtain the optimum 3 gum base formulations. Each formulation composed of olive oil as a plasticizer; sodium carboxymethylcellulose as an adsorbent; xylitol, mannitol and saccharin sodium as sweeteners instead of sugar. Gum base 1 and gum base 2 had the same sweetener amount but gum base 2 had the lower plasticizer amount, while gum base 1 and gum base 3 had the same plasticizer amount but different sweetener amount. Nicotine was added into each 3 gum bases (NCT 1 - 3). The results showed no significant difference of appearance and taste. Their physicochemical properties were as following: pH of 8. 45, 8. 46, 8. 54, hardness of 39. 80, 36. 28, 33. 14 Shore A, initial modulus of 0. 090, 1. 260, 0. 065 MPa, %elongation of 286, 403, 489 %, drug content of 63. 62, 70. 95, 72. 70 %, and drug release when 500 times for force clamping of 48. 72, 45. 72, 67. 74 %, respectively. After storage {{at room temperature for}} 1 month, NCT 1 and NCT 2 showed unchangeable appearance, but NCT 3 showed the slightly liquefied film and much sticky due to hygroscopic property of its sweetener.

40|$|The {{field of}} polymer-nanoclay {{composite}} {{has attracted a}} lot of attention in materials studies due to the dramatic improvement on polymers characteristics. For example mechanical and thermal properties, chemical resistance as well as the reduced gas permeability. However, structural changes and the mechanisms that may contribute to these improvements are not fully understood. In this work, the study on polymer nanoclay composite concentrates on the effects of OMON inclusion within different polymer matrix systems. The matrixes are a series of natural rubbers (Standard Malaysia Rubber – Latex grade (SMRL); <b>Deproteinized</b> Natural <b>Rubber</b> (DPNR) and Epoxidized Natural Rubber (ENR- 50)), plasticized Polyvinyl chloride (pPVC) and Polyethylene (PE). OMON is a renewed Montmorillonite (Mon) clay mineral, where chemical modifications carried out had changed the organophobic property of this mineral into organophylic. XRD analyses demonstrate the intercalation of polymeric chains, showing the increase in OMON basal spacing d 001 from 1. 840 nm to 3. 864 nm. From the FTIR spectra of polymer-OMON composites, matrix-OMON silicates interaction is shown with the appearance of (Si-O-R) band and the changes in SiH (SiH and SiH) vibrations. Investigation on the improved matrix-OMON interactions within polymer-OMON composites concentrates on their thermo-electrical and mechanical responses. TSC measurement is chosen to carry out the thermo-electrical studies, which involves instrumentation of TSC system. The high sensitivity of TSC technique is capable to detect various dipoles and space charges relaxations, as shown with the emergence of ,  and  peaks. Observations and analyses on  and  OMON peaks reveal the effects of matrix-alkyl and matrix-silicate interactions on methylene groups (CH 2) and alkyl chains (CH 2) n within OMON gallery in the composites. Decomposition on TSC peaks confirm the involvement of various distributed relaxation processes. It also reveals the existence of molecular-ion deep traps with high activation energy E (> 4 eV). Analyses on pre-exponential factor n from N-fitting method distinguish a range of dipole relaxations. It gives characteristic relaxation time n that suggest the occurances of dipole (10 - 10 s to 10 - 13 s), dipole-segmental (10 - 14 s to 10 - 17 s) and segmental (10 - 18 s to 10 - 28 s) relaxation modes. Several n (10 + 1 s to 10 - 4 s) from experimental TSC peaks also confirm the cooperative relaxation around the glass transition temperature Tg. Abstract Analyses and observations on some basic mechanical properties generated from tensile test demonstrate structural effects on the entire composite system. Various matrix-alkyl chains and matrix-silicate interactions induce interfacial adhesion, interparticle bridging flocculated and stacking layer structure, which influence the elasticity modulus Young Y, Tensile strength max and Maximum elongation max.
