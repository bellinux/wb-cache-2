Alimohammadi's wife said, [...] "I heard the explosion just when I closed the door." [...] Mossad officials also reportedly concluded that the attacks were [...] "too dangerous" [...] for valuable intelligence operatives in Iran. The organisation has since reportedly instructed its Iranian spy network to concentrate on finding evidence of Iranian breaches of its nuclear-restriction agreements.|$|E

As a new judge, Higginbotham still encountered racism. On his first day on the district court, he parked his car in the area reserved for judges, and was yelled at by a guard [...] "Hey, boy!"

Higginbotham responded by saying [...] "I understand, and that's why <b>I</b> <b>parked</b> there." [...] The guard said [...] "Oh, you're Judge Higginbotham. Welcome to the Court."

50|$|Cathal {{has worn}} a chest mounted camera (a Microsoft SenseCam) since 2006 which takes several {{pictures}} every minute, he also records his location (using GPS) and accelerometer data with each image. Cathal {{now has a}} database of over 12 million images, and currently produces about a terabyte of personal data a year.Cathal and his researchers use information retrieval algorithms to segment his personal image archive into “events” such as eating, driving, etc. New events are recognized {{on a daily basis}} using machine learning algorithms.In an interview with The Economist Cathal said that “If I need to remember where I left my keys, or where <b>I</b> <b>parked</b> my car, or what wine I drank at an event two years ago... the answers should all be there.” It was noted that while searching by date and time is easy, more complex searches within images such as looking for brand names and objects with complex form factors, such as keys, is difficult. The ultimate aim of Cathal's research is to create a search engine to allow complex searches of such image databases.|$|E
5000|$|Carr {{began taking}} {{whatever}} precautions {{he could to}} keep Whitey and Weeks off his tail. [...] "The key to staying alive, I quickly figured out, was to avoid becoming a creature of habit. Wiseguys (or anyone else) who don’t mix up their routines {{are the ones who}} inevitably get caught 'flat-footed,' to use the old expression. I drove home a different way every evening. If possible, when <b>I</b> <b>parked,</b> I backed into the space so that, if I had to, I could flee more quickly. I stopped meeting face-to-face with anyone I didn't know. I stayed out of bars, especially in Southie. Occasionally I'd sleep somewhere other than my house. The local cops kept an eye on my house in the pre-dawn hours. Slowly the noose began to tighten around Whitey's neck and I relaxed somewhat. Whitey vanished in late 1994, but Weeks was still lurking about. At a tanning salon, he bragged to a Herald photographer that he knew that I had lived next to a graveyard. He mentioned nothing about any C-4 or high-powered rifles, but when he was arrested in 1999 his indirect threats against me were included in a DEA detention warrant." [...] “I was always looking over my shoulder,” Carr explained four years after Whitey's arrest. “The day he went missing, I was driving down the street, and on the radio they said he had disappeared. For the first time in ten years, I didn’t have to look over my shoulder.” ...|$|E

5000|$|On 12 November, {{having been}} persuaded to leave Aragón by the anarchist leader Federica Montseny {{on behalf of}} the government, Durruti led his militia to Madrid to aid in the defense of the city. On 19 November, he was shot while leading a counterattack in the Casa de Campo area. (See also Battle of Madrid.) According to author Abel Paz in his 1976 book Durruti: The People Armed, Durruti was hit by distant gunfire coming from the area around the Clinical Hospital in the University City (Madrid), which had been taken over by Nationalist forces. After a fight to regain control and contact was re-established with troops cut off from communications, Durruti {{returned}} temporarily to the Miguel-Angel barracks to issue orders. A message from Liberto Roig arrived informing Durruti that the Clinical Hospital {{was in the process of}} being evacuated. Alarmed, he asked his chauffeur, Julio Grave, to get his car and leave immediately for the hospital. His chauffeur gives the following testimonial: [...] "We passed a little group of hotels which are at the bottom of this avenue de la Reina Victoria and we turned towards the right. Arriving at the big street, we saw a group of militiamen coming towards us. Durruti thought it was some young men who were leaving the front. This area was completely destroyed by the bullets coming from the Clinical Hospital, which had been taken during these days by the Moors and which dominated all the environs. Durruti had me stop the car which <b>I</b> <b>parked</b> in the angle of one of those little hotels as a precaution. Durruti got out of the auto and went towards the militiamen. He asked them where they were going. As they didn't know what to say, he ordered them to return to the front. The militiamen obeyed and Durruti returned towards the car. The rain of bullets became stronger. From the vast red heap of the clinical hospital, the Moors and the Guardia Civil were shooting furiously. Reaching the door of the machine, Durruti collapsed, a bullet through his chest." ...|$|E

40|$|While I {{was living}} in Wisconsin, there were countless mornings and afternoons when I drove a truck up and down, back and forth, hauling manure from a {{conventional}} dairy operation. The first time I visited the dairy after driving through endless fields of genetically modified corn and soy, <b>I</b> <b>parked</b> on the driveway of the farmhouse. Red and pink geraniums greeted me on the windowsill. Halved oak barrels, filled with flowers, delineated parts of the driveway, {{and the air was}} filled by the mooing of the heifers, kept in the barn behind the house. Crossing the road toward the main barn, which looked more like a warehouse, I again was met by flowery windowsills. Now it was the mooing from the calves in their hutches, tidily aligned, that filled the air. The place gave an impression, despite its size and form, that someone cared for its aesthetics and animals. The owner of the farm was just finishing feeding the calves with her “milk taxi ” pasteurizer dispenser. Warmly greeting me, she was very friendly and was happy to give away some manure. That was one thing they had enough of, she said. Manure, without a doubt, was one thing this dairy had plenty of. It even had a full time employee named José — a young worker from Mexico — whose main job was to manage this “waste”. It was when I began to meet his world and the conditions of the milking cows that I gained a completely different impression of the farm, th...|$|E
