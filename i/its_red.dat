5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum {{contains}} a pigment named calostomal {{that is responsible}} for <b>its</b> <b>red</b> color. The chemical structure is all-trans-16-oxohexadeca-2,4,6,8,10,12,14-heptaenoic acid.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>its</b> <b>Red</b> Line connection, Porter Square {{can serve}} as a {{temporary}} inbound terminus for the Fitchburg Line service when commuter rail service is disrupted between Porter and Boston's North Station. It served this role during the 2004 Democratic National Convention, when North Station was closed for a week for security purposes, and during Green Line Extension construction in 2015 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{common in}} its large range, {{and with its}} {{population}} stable, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a Least Concern on <b>its</b> <b>red</b> list of threatened species.|$|E

5|$|The Ohio Burgee is the {{official}} flag of the U.S. state of Ohio. Ohio's swallowtail flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. <b>Its</b> <b>red,</b> white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's triangular canton is suggestive of the state's name.|$|E
5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. <b>Its</b> <b>red</b> stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may fluff <b>its</b> <b>red</b> back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in {{what appears to be}} a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male in an act of apparent aggression.|$|E
50|$|Gigondas {{is known}} for its power rather than its elegance. Some parts of the {{appellation}} are warmer than Châteauneuf-du-Pape, bringing the generous Grenache grape close to fortified strength in alcohol. While some rosé wine is produced, the appellation draws its prestige from <b>its</b> <b>reds.</b>|$|R

5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because <b>its</b> <b>red</b> colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
5|$|In Costa Rica, President José María Figueres {{declared}} a state of emergency due to flooding in that country. He sought $15million in aid from the Inter-American Development Bank. The country's government handled relief efforts through <b>its</b> <b>Red</b> Cross and federal and non-governmental organizations. The government of Cuba issued an appeal to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for financial assistance; as a result, the agency provided $30,000, and the United Nations Development Programme provided $50,000. The government of Luxembourg sent $37,000 worth of construction materials, and the European Union sent $443,000 to the country.|$|E
5|$|Mars (1.5AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is smaller than}} Earth and Venus (0.107 Earth masses). It has an {{atmosphere}} of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. <b>Its</b> <b>red</b> colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be captured asteroids.|$|E

5|$|NGC 6543 {{is a high}} {{northern}} declination deep-sky {{object and}} is near the apparent position of the North Ecliptic Pole. It has the combined magnitude of 8.1, with high surface brightness. Its small bright inner nebula subtends an average of 16.1 arcsec, with the outer prominent condensations about 25 arcsec. Deep images reveal an extended halo about 300 arcsec or 5 arcmin across, that was once ejected by the central progenitor star during <b>its</b> <b>red</b> giant phase.|$|E
5|$|North Michigan Avenue is a six-lane {{two-way street}} that is {{serviced}} by Chicago Transit Authority public buses along the Magnificent Mile that connect {{the area to}} the entire Chicago metropolitan area. It is also serviced by seasonal trolley service along the street, and {{the foot of the}} Magnificent Mile is serviced by seasonal water transit services. Two blocks west along State Street, the Chicago 'L' rapid transit services the street via <b>its</b> <b>Red</b> Line. Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|On {{the planet}} Krypton, using {{evidence}} {{provided to the}} Council by scientist Jor-El, the attempted insurrectionists General Zod, Ursa, and Non are sentenced to the Phantom Zone. For this, Zod swears revenge on Jor-El and his family. Jor-El, despite his eminence, is unable to convince the Council that Krypton will soon be destroyed when <b>its</b> <b>red</b> supergiant sun goes supernova. To save his infant son, Kal-El, Jor-El launches him in a spaceship to Earth, a planet with a suitable atmosphere where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton's sun explodes, destroying the planet.|$|E

5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got <b>its</b> <b>red</b> breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|The SS196SR was {{introduced}} in 2005 {{and it is now}} discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge. It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max bullet which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500m/s (1,650ft/s) when fired from the Five-seven. The polycarbonate tip used in the V-Max bullet acted as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the bullet. The SS196 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when fired from the Five-seven. The SS196 could be identified by <b>its</b> <b>red</b> polymer tip.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other tropicbirds by <b>its</b> <b>red</b> bill in combination with its white tail streamers. The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upperwing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill. Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upperparts than juveniles of other species. In flight, the royal tern can {{be confused with the}} adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former's less direct flight pattern and its lack of tail streamers.|$|E

5|$|This {{species may}} be {{confused}} with the related flame robin (P.phoenicea) and scarlet robin (P.boodang), but the male can be distinguished by <b>its</b> <b>red</b> crown (white in the other two species) and smaller size; furthermore, the male flame robin has dark grey rather than black upperparts. Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish tinge of the crown and whiter underparts.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. <b>Its</b> <b>red</b> muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of <b>its</b> <b>red</b> giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
