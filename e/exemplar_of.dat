5|$|New Age {{literature}} often {{refers to}} benevolent non-human spirit-beings {{who are interested}} in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, guardian angels, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts. New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors. The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> a spiritually advanced human being.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Staines's report, the Admiralty {{decided to}} take no action. In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams's various stories of {{the foundation of the}} Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a detailed study of the settlement's development.|$|E

Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, {{as well as new}} development in southern China under the Open Door Policy introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre along with London and New York City, a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> Laissez-faire market policy.|$|E
40|$|Inductive {{learning}} {{refers to}} learning categories and concepts from <b>exemplars</b> <b>of</b> those categories or concepts. Such learning, {{which is a}} fundamental component of human cognition, enables us to classify never-before-encountered examples as instances of a given category or concept. How, though, should the <b>exemplars</b> <b>of</b> different categories, such as pictures of different species of butterflies, be presented {{in order to enhance}} inductive learning? The prevailing view has been that <b>exemplars</b> <b>of</b> a given category should be presented close together in time to highlight the commonalities that define that category, but Kornell and Bjork (2008) [...] to their surprise and against participants' intuitions [...] found that interleaving, not blocking, the <b>exemplars</b> <b>of</b> separate to-be-learned categories enhanced inductive learning. These findings, together with results from subsequent studies, suggest that the opportunity interleaving provides to contrast <b>exemplars</b> <b>of</b> different categories, such as an Admiral butterfly versus an Elfin butterfly, may be key to optimizing inductive learning. The eight experiments reported in this dissertation, which involved having participants learn species of butterflies, families of birds, the handwriting styles of different individuals, and the styles of different artists, were designed to clarify the roles of contrast processing (encoding differences between <b>exemplars</b> <b>of</b> different categories) and commonality processes (encoding commonalities across the exemplars within a category). Overall, the results obtained suggest that contrast processing and commonality processing are both critical, but that contrast processes occur automatically, whereas noticing commonalities is a deliberate and conscious process in category learning. Importantly, interleaving <b>exemplars</b> <b>of</b> different categories appears not only to facilitate contrast processing, but also, under some circumstances, commonality processing. Finally, it appears that learners [...] even when they know about the benefits of interleaving and the importance of contrast processing for achieving category learning [...] cannot effectively engage in contrast processing as a self-initiated study strategy without the aid of an interleaved presentation schedule. The present findings help to provide a more complete picture of the processes involved in feature extraction and category generalization. From a practical standpoint, the results also have implications for enhancing category learning in educational settings, where such learning is prevalent and critical to mastery and achievement...|$|R

5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> sexual dimorphism in insects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> Puuc-style {{architecture}} is Uxmal. The style {{developed in the}} Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.|$|E
5|$|The hamlet was {{designed}} by John Nash, master of the Picturesque style. He had worked for Harford on other buildings. The hamlet is the first fully realised <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> the garden suburb and was the inspiration for virtually all garden suburbs that followed. The cottages are all unique and include brick chimneys and dormer windows with some having thatched roofs. They are examples of the picturesque, an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin. An oval path links the cottages and encircles the village green, which has a sundial at its centre. The cottage gardens are planted in a Victorian cottage garden style.|$|E

5|$|As a senator, McGovern was an <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> modern American liberalism. He became most {{known for}} his outspoken {{opposition}} to the growing U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy. The subsequent McGovern–Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly {{increasing the number of}} caucuses and primaries and reducing the influence of party insiders. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based 1972 presidential campaign found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of Thomas Eagleton undermined McGovern's credibility. In the general election McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history. Re-elected Senator in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in a bid for a fourth term in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E

5|$|The first {{newspaper}} {{to be published}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina was Bosanski vjestnik, a political-informative and educational weekly edited by Sopron and printed in Serbian Cyrillic. It had a pro-Serb inclination, though it generally promoted a unitary Bosnian nation, in accordance with the Ottoman policy in the province. The official gazette, the weekly Bosna, was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations. Another weekly issued by the printing house was Sarajevski cvjetnik, which fiercely defended the Ottoman regime and polemicised with Serbian and Austrian newspapers that criticised it. Bosna and Sarajevski cvjetnik were bilingual, printed half in Ottoman Turkish and half in Serbo-Croatian in the Cyrillic script. The printing house produced a number of elementary school textbooks, including the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic, following Vuk Karadžić's book published in Vienna in 1827. Other books include a collection of Bosnian Serb lyric folk poetry, an Ottoman Turkish grammar, and several Jewish religious books. The first printed <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> Bosnian Aljamiado literature was also published by the Vilayet Printing House. It produced around 50 books and booklets altogether, most of them being concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation.|$|E
5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an <b>exemplar</b> <b>of</b> why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E
