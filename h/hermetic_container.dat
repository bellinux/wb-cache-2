Since the analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed showed no significant difference between the weight loss in the two systems, it could be explained that the simultaneous ingestion by insects and moisture ingress in non-hermetic system might have contributed to the little difference in weight compared to the hermetic system which was not the case of the hermetic system which experienced little moisture ingress and minimal insect infestation.

40|$|AbstractPostharvest {{insect pests}} {{threaten}} the nutritional and financial security of smallholder {{farmers in the}} developing world. Hermetic storage, a technology that protects grain against insects by blocking their supply of oxygen, alleviates the problem of insect-caused losses. PICS (Purdue Improved Crop Storage) bags represent one hermetic technology that improves food availability and incomes of farmers. The polyethylene liners of PICS bags are sometime damaged during use, acquiring small holes or tears. Observations in the laboratory and field suggest that insect development remains localized around {{the point where the}} bag is damaged. We hypothesized that the grain within a <b>hermetic</b> <b>container</b> that has minimal localized damage (such as an insect hole), helps retard leakage of oxygen into the bag and contributes to limiting insect damage and to the overall protective effect. To test this hypothesis, we filled 4  cm dia. by 10  cm long PVC pipes with Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) infested cowpeas and sealed them with caps having a single, insect-sized hole in its center. A vertical tube positioned above the cowpea-filled PVC pipe was filled with one of three different grains (sesame, sorghum, and maize) to different depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 50  cm). Seed size and grain barrier depth significantly reduced the level of bruchid damage to the stored cowpea in the PVC container. Smaller sized grains used for the barriers retarded insect development more effectively than larger sized grains, while deeper grain depth was more effective than shallower barriers. The grain held in a <b>hermetic</b> <b>container</b> contributes in a small, but significant, way to the effectiveness of the containers...|$|E

The surprising effectiveness of hermetic storage for preserving grain against insect pests has long been linked with the depletion of oxygen in the <b>hermetic</b> <b>container</b> and with the parallel rise in carbon dioxide. With. C. maculatus, low oxygen (hypoxia) leads to cessation of larval feeding activity, whereas elevated levels of carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) {{have little or no}} effect on feeding.

C. maculatus eggs, larvae, and pupae subjected to hypoxia eventually die after exposures of various duration. The cause of death is desiccation resulting from an inadequate supply of water.

It uses descriptive statistics to track the trends in adoption of cowpea storage technology compared to previous studies and Firth logistic regression to identify important factors in adoption. The interviews indicate that regionally about 46 % of respondents use some type of hermetic storage for their cowpeas and about 44 % of the quantity of cowpea stored on farms is in <b>hermetic</b> <b>containers.</b> Both the percentage of respondents and the percentage of stored quantity fall slightly short of the 50 % benchmark hypothesized. The 2010 e 2012 estimates compare to about 30 % of cowpea quantity stored in <b>hermetic</b> <b>containers</b> in 2003 e 2004. Regionally, the most commonly used <b>hermetic</b> storage <b>container</b> is the triple layer Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) bag. In PICS villages, local unavailability is the most common reason for not using the bags. The logit analysis shows that living in a village with PICS activities {{is the single most important}} factor explaining adoption of the technology. In six of the nine regressions participation in the demonstrations was also positive and a statistically significant determinant of adoption. For someone living in a PICS village and participating in the activities the combined effect is highly influential.

40|$|Introduction Low {{melting point}} metals are often {{encapsulated}} in a <b>hermetic</b> <b>container,</b> irradiated and the container transferred to hot-cell for material removal and processing. An important process {{of this kind}} is the production of 82 Sr from rubidium (melting point: 39. 5 °C.) This new concept departures completely form the encapsulated targets approach and allows an almost continues production by the irradiation of the bulk metal. As well, eliminated is the target transfer. By placing the target material dissolution chamber right in the target station, only the dissolution product is pumped to the hotcell for further processing. Material and Methods Some of the disadvantages of the encapsulated target are: 1. 	Complicated transfer system that is ex-pensive to install, slow and prone to failures. 2. 	Complex and expensive encapsulation procedure. 3. 	Loss of production time during the lengthy target changing. 4. 	Capsule geometry is constrained by the encapsulating process and transfer demands compromising heat transfer and beam power. To avoid the difficulties of liquid metal handling, metal salts are often used instead (rubidium chloride is one example). This creates other problems and limits the beam currents and production yields. In the system described, the liquid metal is transferred (by gravity) from a bulk container to an irradiation chamber. The chamber, made out of nickel-plated silver, holds the correct quantity of rubidium for one irradiation run. Because of the geometry of the chamber and the efficient cooling, up to 40 KW of beam power can be delivered to the target. The chamber is equipped with thermocouples and a liquid-metal level detector and is entirely of welded/brazed construction. The alloy foil that forms the beam window is electron-beam welded to the chamber front ring. At the end of irradiation the irradiated liquid metal is gravity fed into a reaction chamber situ-ated below the irradiation chamber, and a new load of fresh rubidium released into the irradia-tion chamber. The liquid-metal transfer and the irradiation components are shown on FIG. 1, and the sectional view on FIG. 2. Appropriate chemicals (n-butanol {{in the case of}} rubidium) are delivered to the reaction chamber and the irradiated metal dissolved. The liquid dissolution product is transferred back to the hotcell. Since all steps of the reaction involve liquids, only small diameter tubes connect the target station with the hotcell. The transfer is fast and simple. The bulk liquid-metal storage container can be constructed to hold enough material for 10 or more runs. When empty, it is replaced with a pre-loaded one. The container is connected to the target system with one coupling and the exchange takes a short time. A robotic bottle exchange can be implemented if desired. The station is equipped with its own vacuum system, beam diagnostic (consisting of a four-sector mask) and a collimation. The target chamber and each of the beam intercepting components are electrically insulated to allow beam current monitoring. Constructed entirely out of metal and ceramic the target core assembly does not suffer from radiation damage. The use of aluminum, silver and alumina reduce component activation. Results and Conclusion A large part of the station design is based on the well proven construction of high current solid target system and is using the same, or similar components. Test was performed to optimize the liquid-metal transfer and the chamber filling with the correct volume, while leaving some room for expansion. A process for niobium coating of sliver is investi-gated. Niobium is known to provide good corro-sion resistance against liquid metals.

30|$|In general, the usable {{proportion}} of grains in the <b>hermetic</b> <b>containers</b> remained fairly constant {{as compared to}} the non-hermetic containers. These changes were mainly {{due to the fact that}} the hermetic system operated under the principle of gradual depletion of oxygen and the generation of carbon dioxide through the respiratory activities of insects and the grains [9, 10, 12, 17]. The population of insects dropped steadily which, in effect, controlled the destruction of whole grains. The sharp increase in the percentage of unwholesome grains in the non-hermetic system was mainly because no preventive measures were made available to terminate the activities of insects. The environmental conditions surrounding the grains ensured that sufficient oxygen was always available for the insects to comfortably respire and ingest the grains [17].|$|R

Ten treatments comprising 5 storage devices in two moisture regimes (11 % and 9 %) replicated thrice and laid out in Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Data on temperature, relative humidity (RH), germination, electrical conductivity (EC), seed moisture content (MC) were collected bimonthly. The conventional containers were found liable to the external environmental condition whereas the hermetic structures observed with controlled RH level below 40 % in all combinations. Electrical conductivity (EC) for seed vigor showed that <b>hermetic</b> <b>containers</b> provide higher seed vigor than the conventional ones. Up to 4 months all treatments were found statistically at par for germination. A significant difference was observed in each treatment after 4 months where PICS bag & Super grain bag showed best germination followed by metal bin while fertilizer bag & earthen-pot showed poorer and poorest germination respectively till one year. Almost all treatments with lower MC showed better results than the treatments with higher MC. A negative correlation (R 2 = 69. 7 %) was found between EC and Germination.

30|$|From {{the results}} presented, the high {{moisture}} content {{observed in the}} non-hermetic grains compared to the hermetically stored grains {{was due to the}} exchange of moisture between the grains and its surrounding since they were left unclosed. The steep rise in moisture content in the non-hermetic containers began from the fifth week up to the eighth week. From the eighth week, a gentle rise in the moisture content of grains was observed. The steady rise in moisture content in the non-hermetically stored grains from the eighth week up to the twelfth week as observed in Fig.  1 was principally due to the dry season (also known as harmattan season) in the country which occurs in January every year, where the relative humidity in the atmosphere decreased from 82 % in December to 78 % in January; therefore, moisture absorption by the grains was minimal. Although the <b>hermetic</b> <b>containers</b> were very efficient in controlling moisture content, there was some slight increase in the moisture (0.22 %) which could mainly be due to the respiratory activities of insects within the containers or moisture ingress because the caps were not completely airtight. After 12  weeks of storage, the hermetically stored grains recorded final moisture content of 11.90 % which is good enough to prevent formation of molds. This conclusion was made with reference to studies by other researchers which reported that if grains are dried to 14 % moisture or less, minimal or no fungi formation is observed [9, 10, 17].|$|R

40|$|A {{high-performance}} design, and fabrication {{and growth}} processes {{to implement the}} design, have been devised for encapsulating a hydrated salt in a container that both protects the salt and provides thermal conductance between the salt and the environment surrounding the container. The unitary salt/container structure is known in the art as a salt pill. In the original application of the present design and processes, the salt is, more specifically, a hydrated paramagnetic salt, {{for use as a}} refrigerant in a very-low-temperature adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR). The design and process can also be applied, with modifications, to other hydrated salts. Hydrated paramagnetic salts have long been used in ADRs because they have the desired magnetic properties at low temperatures. They also have some properties, disadvantageous for ADRs, that dictate the kind of enclosures in which they must be housed: Being hydrated, they lose water if exposed to less than 100 -percent relative humidity. Because any dehydration compromises their magnetic properties, salts used in ADRs must be sealed in <b>hermetic</b> <b>containers.</b> Because they have relatively poor thermal conductivities in the temperature range of interest (< 0. 1 K), integral thermal buses are needed as means of efficiently transferring heat to and from the salts during refrigeration cycles. A thermal bus is typically made from a high-thermal-conductivity met al (such as copper or gold), and the salt is configured to make intimate thermal contact with the metal. Commonly in current practice (and in the present design), the thermal bus includes a matrix of wires or rods, and the salt is grown onto this matrix.

Means of barrel oxygen content, ending number of live weevils per kg of maize, test weight (TW), moisture content (MC), temperature and humidity were significantly different between the hermetic and non-hermetic storage treatments. Broken corn and foreign material (BCFM) and mechanical damage (MD) were not significantly different. Hermetically sealed metal barrels for maize storage can control maize weevils and may be an effective storage option for smallholder farmers...|$|R

Hermetic post-harvest maize storage is an attractive non-chemical control strategy for maize weevil,Sitophilus zeamais (Motsch.), which is the principal cause of insect damage to stored maize grain. Laboratory experiments were conducted on instrumented <b>hermetic</b> and non-hermetic <b>containers</b> to measure effects of temperature (10 vs. 27 °C) and maize moistures (6. 3 to 16 %) on maize weevil biology and mortality rate, and to quantify weevil oxygen consumption. Ten days weevil mortality was significantly higher in hermetic vs. non-hermetic storage, in 6. 3 % moisture maize vs. 16 %, and at 27 °C storage temperature vs. 10 °C. Oxygen depletion results allow estimation of days to 100 % adult weevil mortality as a function of weevil infestation level, storage temperature and maize moisture for East Africa conditions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} duration of storage of soybean meal (SBM) on variables that define the quality of the protein fraction. Urease activity, protein dispersibility index (PDI), KOH protein solubility (KOHsol), and trypsin inhibitor activity were determined. In experiment 1, 8 samples of SBM, ranging in CP content from 55. 4 to 56. 5 % DM, were collected from a US crushing plant at weekly intervals and analyzed at arrival to the laboratory and after 30, 60, 90, and 120 d of storage. In experiment 2, 7 samples of SBM, ranging in CP content from 49. 0 to 55. 0 % DM, were collected from different Argentinean crushers and analyzed at arrival and after 24, 48, 80, and 136 wk of storage. In both experiments, samples were stored in <b>hermetic</b> glass <b>containers</b> in a laboratory room at 12 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 70 ± 3 %. Duration of storage did not affect urease activity or trypsin inhibitor activity values in either of the 2 experiments. However, PDI values decreased linearly with time of storage in both experiments (P menor que 0. 001). Also, KOHsol decreased linearly (P menor que 0. 05) with duration of storage in experiment 2 (long-term storage) but not in experiment 1 (shorter term storage). Therefore, PDI values might not be adequate to compare protein quality of commercial SBM samples that have been stored for different periods of time. The KOHsol values are less affected by length of storage of the meals under current commercial practices...|$|R

As a result, subsistence farmers lose their crop to pests and are forced to dispose of their maize for a low price right after harvest thus, robbing them of profit and food {{for the rest of}} the year. The objective of this research was to develop information to enable utilization of recycled sanitary <b>hermetic</b> maize storage <b>containers.</b> Use of these containers will allow farmers to preserve their maize for as long as they wish, using locally available resources. A market survey found edible oil containers available for sale and re-use in markets in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. A laboratory study compared three cleaning methods (oil drain+ 45 °C water(A), oil drain+ 90 to 100 °C water(B), oil drain+ 90 to 100 °C water + soap(C)) for cleaning soybean oil contaminated 20 L HDPE containers. Research results, indicate that using “C” will clean the containers to a cleanliness level comparable to a new container. This is an encouraging result in light of the edible oil containers available for sale and re-use in East African markets. A Ugandan field study also tested the efficacy of recycled <b>containers</b> for <b>hermetic</b> storage, and confirmed that hermetic storage using these containers is lethal to maize weevils, while preserving the quality of stored maize...|$|R
40|$|Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) G. Don, African locust bean, {{is one of}} the 34 known {{species of}} the genus Parkia whose centre of origin is South America. It is an {{agroforestry}} tree species spread throughout the African sudanian savannas, from Senegal in the West to Uganda in the East. P. biglobosa is also an important socio-economic species in high demand by local communities for its multiple amenities and uses (food, traditional medicine and pharmacy, preservation and improvement of soil fertility, rites and customs, etc.). Such an importance engenders several diverse research programmes on this species that have been undertaken in West Africa. However, the species remains under pressure {{as a result of its}} over-exploitation by human population, shortage of rainfall and inappropriate agricultural practices, leading to the degradation and/or lack of regeneration of P. biglobosa parklands in many zones. In this context, the present study was undertaken in order to understand the reproductive biology and the genetic diversity of P. biglobosa, which are essential for the elaboration of an efficient strategy for sustainable use and conservation of genetic resources. We investigated the mating system of the species in the semi-arid zones of Burkina Faso. Two populations were selected in Bissighin and Nagaré, with 153 and 209 trees, respectively, and were weekly monitored during two seasonal cycles of fruit formation. The floral phenological survey revealed relatively high synchronism index values of 0. 78 for Nagaré and 0. 79 for Bissighin. This was an indication that although the fruiting period lasts over about 5 months, the majority of the trees flowered synchronously in these two populations. The phenological observations have highlighted a seasonal profile of P. biglobosa, which mainly occurs in the dry season, like most of the sudanian savannah species. The high values of multilocus outcrossing for both, family level and within populations (tm = 0. 941 and 0. 981), suggest that the species presents partial self-incompatibility, which is also a common feature in many hermaphrodite species. Genetic (protandry, self-incompatibility) and environmental (elevated level of floral synchronism) factors could explain such high values of multi-locus outcrossing. We demonstrated that there was a weak parental relationship between the trees that were analyzed (low tm- ts values, between 0 and 0. 086). The paternity correlation (rp = 0. 299 for Bissighin and 0. 502 for Nagaré) showed that each tree was pollinated by only two or three pollen donors, probably involving bees as the main pollinators. The study of P. biglobosa genetic diversity using enzymatic electrophoresis allowed us to determine intra- and inter-population variations, the structure and genetic distances between populations. Open pollinated seeds collected from 1658 trees of 64 populations in 11 western and central African countries were analyzed and the genetic control of five enzymatic systems coding for 8 polymorphous locus with 33 alleles was thus elucidated. We obtained high values of intra-population genetic diversity, with mean number of alleles per locus (A = 4. 13), with the percentage of polymorphism (P = 100 %), and with the expected heterozygosity (He = 0. 34). The great value of gene flow (Nm = 1. 61) and the low genetic differentiation between populations (Fst = 0. 13) indicate that there was an important rate of gene exchange between the populations and that the genetic diversity of the species was also great within populations. The genetic distances were also low (between 0 and 0. 240), indicating that the populations were similar enough to belong to the same genetic group. The actual genetic diversity and genetic structure of P. biglobosa might have resulted from its evolutionary history without a bottleneck sequence, from the reproductive biology with high flowering synchronism and outcrossing rates, and from the fact that farmers had had developed P. biglobosa parkland systems through years, hence facilitating gene flows between populations. The storage conditions of P. biglobosa seeds in CNSF seed bank were assessed in order to ensure better conservation of these genetic resources. Methods for optimum germination were identified for stored seeds, using both the commercial lots aged between 0 and 20 years that were collected in Burkina Faso, and the seeds of 23 populations (c. 11 years old) from West and Central Africa that were selected because of their high levels of genetic diversity. The germination results of these seeds, chemically scarified with sulphuric acid, showed no significant effects of the storage periods. The same optimum pre-treatment and duration, initially identified and recommended by CNSF for this species can be applied independent of the age of seeds between 0 and 20 years. This physiological study revealed variations of seed moisture content (MC) during their storage at 4 °C in the CNSF seed bank, partly explained by inappropriate handling of seeds (without any special precautions), i. e. the regular openings of plastic bags during sub-samples withdrawing of seeds within the cold room at > 75 % RH. Because of the partial porosity of P. biglobosa seed integuments, the remaining seeds in the bags therefore re-equilibrate within this high RH condition and so increase their actual MC. Subsequently, the seed viability decreases due to elevated metabolic activity, despite the fact that they can maintain great longevity (95 % germination after 11 years storage at 4 °C) when they are properly dried and conserved in <b>hermetic</b> <b>containers.</b> The constructed water sorption isotherm for this species showed that the recommended level of ≤ 5 % MC corresponds to about 10 % RH for P. biglobosa. We suggested monitoring and handling procedures for conserving seeds in order to improve their longevity during storage. Analyses of reproductive and genetic parameters, in association with eco-geographical and anthropological factors, allowed us to sample 11 representative «ideal» populations in West Africa for ex-situ long term conservation of seeds of the species. We have also recommended the association of in-situ conservation of these populations in the parklands, which success will depend on the common efforts of local communities, conservationists, technicians and politicians. Considering the genetic parameters of the species in Burkina Faso, its geographic distribution, the phyto -geographic division of the country, and according to the 'law of diminishing returns', we have selected 10 populations in Burkina Faso that can be used to collect seeds for the purposes of national planting programmes and for their long term conservation in CNSF seed bank, in agreement with the state of the art. In addition, for each population 15 individuals are suitable to capture maximum genetic variation and can be systematically sampled. The urgent need to take coordinated actions for sustainable use and conservation of threatened and important genetic resources of the sudanian and sudano-sahelian species, led us to propose sampling guidelines for better seed collections. Because many scientific disciplines are involved in the conservation of genetic resources and species are distributed across national boundaries, we suggest multi-disciplinary teams at national levels and scientific cooperation at regional level in order to generate and share information and experiences that are necessary for elaborating efficient strategies for sustainable management of genetic resources. This thesis offers new perspectives and approaches for the conservation of P. biglobosa resources. It informs on the population characteristics that are important for capturing the maximum genetic diversity of the species. The sustainable use and conservation of genetic resources of the recommended «ideal» populations in Burkina Faso as well as in the West African region compel a strengthened collaboration between all stakeholders. The application of best practices in seed laboratory provides more chances to maintain viability and prolong longevity of seeds, and so guaranty the long term ex-situ conservation of the species. We hope that all these results will improve and guide conservation programmes, not only for Parkia biglobosa, but also will inspire works on important sudano-sahelian species for their efficient conservation. The sustainability of conservation and uses of plant genetic resources for the actual and future generations will then be guaranteed...|$|R
