They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

Pollard explained his rationale in a 1954 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "I just got fed up... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't give me {{much of a chance}} to play... I carried the ball only 23 times in 12 games last year, so something had to be wrong." ...|$|E

After the war, she joined the Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, a national public policy advocacy group that included Bette Davis, Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart in its Hollywood chapter.

And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> had to be Communists." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, Robyn {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with Swedish magazine [...] that she would release three albums during 2010. She noted that it had been five years since she released her last effort, Robyn (2005), and that she had not been in the studio [...] "properly" [...] since then. She explained that {{she did not want to}} wait until all the songs had been recorded; she rather wanted to split up the songs in three different releases. She chose to name the trilogy Body Talk after a gay club in London that a friend of hers owns, commenting that the title [...] "tickles [...] imagination". In June 2010, the first in the trilogy, Body Talk Pt. 1, was released, and was quickly followed by the announcement of Body Talk Pt. 2. The album's lead single, [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and the track [...] "Indestructible", were among the first songs to be recorded for the trilogy.

Yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.|$|R

[...] Later in the program, it was discovered that the earlier news reports had been in error; Browne said, [...] "I don't think there's anybody alive, maybe one... I just don't think they are alive", adding, subsequently, that she [...] "didn't believe that they were alive... I did believe that they were gone." ...|$|E

So <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> didn't want to publicize anything about me." [...] Perron then states that Lane [...] "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can actually believe that it's easy enough to do it in a year.
