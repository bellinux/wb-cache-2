5000|$|In 1953 Oyama {{opened his}} own karate dojo, named Oyama Dojo (form of Gōjū-ryū), in Tokyo but {{continued}} to travel around Japan and the world giving martial arts demonstrations, including the fighting and killing of live bulls {{with his bare hands}} (sometimes grabbing them by the horn, and snapping the <b>horn</b> <b>off).</b> His dojo was first located outside in an empty lot but eventually moved into a ballet school in 1956. The senior instructors under him were T. Nakamura, K. Mizushima, E. Yasuda, M. ishibashi, and T. Minamimoto. [...] Oyama's own curriculum soon developed a reputation as a tough, intense, hard-hitting but practical style which was finally named Kyokushinkai (Japan Karate-Do Kyokushinkai), which means 'the ultimate truth,' in a ceremony in 1957. He also developed a reputation for being 'rough' with his students, as the training sessions were grueling and students injuring themselves in practice fighting (kumite) was quite common. Along with practice fighting that distinguished Oyama's teaching style from other karate schools, emphasis on breaking objects such as boards, tiles, or bricks to measure one's offensive ability became Kyokushin's trademark. Oyama believed in the practical application of karate and declared that ignoring 'breaking practice is no more useful than a fruit tree that bears no fruit. As the reputation of the dojo grew students were attracted to come to train there from inside and outside Japan and the number of students grew. Many of the eventual senior leaders of today's various Kyokushin based organisations began training in the style during this time. In 1964 Oyama moved the dojo into the building that would from then on serve as the Kyokushin home dojo and world headquarters. In connection with this he also formally founded the 'International Karate Organization Kyokushin kaikan' (commonly abbreviated to IKO or IKOK) to organise the many schools that were by then teaching the kyokushin style.|$|E

40|$|Removing {{the horns}} of cattle when they arrive at feeding {{facilities}} is a common practice to reduce injury to other cattle. Bruising on carcasses of cattle that have been housed in pens containing horned cattle increases noticeably. Horned feeder cattle marketed in Arkansas regional livestock auction barns received average discounts of $ 3. 23 /cwt in 2005, giving producers the incentive to dehorn their cattle before marketing. Three common techniques (tipping, dehorning, and banding) are utilized {{in the field to}} remove or reduce horn length in beef cattle. Tipping is the practice of removing the tip of the horn such that the diameter of the horn is approximately 1 to 1. 5 inches in diameter. Dehorning is mechanically cutting the <b>horns</b> <b>off</b> {{at the base of the}} horn near the head. The use of high-tension rubber bands to dehorn cattle has recently been implemented in some cattle feeding facilities. The band restricts blood circulation to the horns, resulting in necrosis, and the <b>horns</b> eventually fall <b>off.</b> This study was conducted to establish baseline data on behavior and feedlot performance in cattle dehorned using these techniques...|$|R

5000|$|Generally, a martial artist {{engaged in}} {{breaking}} will practice by repeatedly hitting hard surfaces. Masutatsu Oyama, a famous breaker {{who was known}} for breaking the <b>horns</b> <b>off</b> bulls, would use trees. In karate, a device called a makiwara is used; this device has found more popular use by practitioners of other martial arts today. In the past, Shaolin and other earlier martial artists would use {{many different types of}} devices in order to condition themselves, not always for simply breaking, but using the same concepts used today. For instance, there is Iron Palm, Iron Shin, Iron Shirt, Iron Head, and other types of training which center around conditioning various parts of the body so they could withstand or give blows such as what is seen today in martial arts breaking. Many Chinese systems also are of the school of thought that [...] "internal energy" [...] or Chi is used when breaking, which is not dependent upon muscle strength and body weight.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} in dehorning technology is {{use of a}} caustic dehorning paste. The paste is used on calves at less than two days old.

The paste kills the growth ring of the horn and then the <b>horn</b> falls <b>off</b> like a scab when it is healed.
