In this paper, for the context of veterinary epidemiology, we review the main proposals, precision, repeatability, reproducibility, and intermediate precision, in agreement with ISO (international Organization for Standardization) practice, generalize these by placing them within the linear mixed model framework, which we then extend to the generalized linear mixed model setting, so that both Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data can be employed. Similarities and differences are discussed between the classical ANOVA (analysis of variance) approach and the proposed mixed model settings, on the one hand, and between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases, on the other hand. The new proposals are applied to five studies in three diseases: Aujeszky's disease, <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> leucosis (EBL) and bovine brucellosis.

The aim of this experiment was to study the effectivity of PCR and AGID methods to detect <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> leukosis virus in Indonesia. Samples of peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) were collected from cattles those with and without showing clinical signs. A total of 307 blood and serum samples were tested against BLV using PCR and AGID tests, while 21 semen samples which were from similar animals for blood collection were collected only for PCR test.

40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and tumors from cattle with <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> leukosis (EBL) was examined by immunohistochemistry using {{a panel of}} monclonal antibodies against leukocyte differentiation molecules of EBL. The lesions in lymph nodes could be divided into three types based {{on the extent of}} infiltration and proliferation of neoplastic cells with provirus and differential expression of leukocyte differentiation molecules. The number of B-B 2 +, sIgM+ cells was reduced in frequency in follicles during the neoplastic cell proliferation. CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive a/ @ T cells and y/ 6 T cells positive for WC 1 (workshop cluster designation) were also reduced in frequency in areas infiltrated with neoplastic cells. Almost all neoplastic cells were B-B 2 - and IgM-positive. However, there were a few B-B 2 - and/or IgM-negative cells or cells stained faintly in all cases. WCI + cells were not observed in tumor tissues. However, CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells were observed throughout tumor tissues, suggesting a role for these cells in tumor immunity.

Blood samples were obtained from animals belonging to seven rural properties which were followed up on a yearly basis, from 1992 to 1995. A total of 140 serum samples were analyzed in 1992. Of these, 24 (17. 1 %) reacted positively, 21 (15. 0 %) were suspect and 95 (67. 9 %) were negative. In 1993, of the 122 samples tested 25 (20. 5 %) were positive, 8 (6. 6 %) were suspect and 89 (72. 9 %) were negative. In 1994, of the 135 samples tested, 45 (33. 3 %) were positive, 19 (14. 1 %) were suspect and 71 (52. 6 %) were negative. Finally, 119 samples of serum were investigated in 1995, 60 of which (50. 4 %) were positive, 11 (9. 2 %) were suspect and 48 (40. 4 %) were negative.

A differentiation observed between the population numbers of CD 19 + B lymphocytes and CD 2 + T lymphocytes as well as the CD 8 + T lymphocyte sub-population was found to be significant between cows with different genotypes of AcP. Moreover, a correlation was found between the polymorphism of AcP and EBL incidence in cows with reference to the number and percentage of CD 19 + B lymphocytes (AcP polymorphism x EBL interaction). A significant differentiation in the profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes was observed between EBL-positive and EBL-negative cows as well as over the first three months after calving.

We evaluated the bladder of twenty Nelore cows with bracken fern intoxication using a flexible endoscope to describe the lesions present and we performed a rapid urine test with a chemical multiple-reagent commercial strips (Combur test Roche® – Swiss) to check the degree of haematuria; then we correlated both results with the Spearman statistical test. All cows presented lesions in their bladder walls and the urine was visually reddish and positive for haematuria in the strips. Urine dipstick has shown to correlate with bladder lesion number. In the bladders of the euthanised animals, multiple sub-mucosal reddish nodules and multiple ecchymotic haemorrhages were seen macroscopically, and one bladder had a larger tumour with a 3 cm diameter, which was determined to be a haemangioma by analysing the histopathology.
