5|$|The third door is a vestry door further right, {{leading to}} the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of {{uncertain}} age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick chimney stack.). The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> lean-to structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between {{the east end of}} the north transept and the original priests' vestry.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E

Macau's version was brought by Portuguese colonizers. The Portuguese egg tart made its way to Hong Kong, where it was influenced by British custard tarts. They are a bit more glassy and smooth.|$|E

25|$|Volvat {{took its}} name from {{pharmacist}} Harald Thaulow (1815–81), who owned the farm during his lifetime. The name <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> simplification of his surname backwards. From the 1900s the area was regulated for housing, making it an interesting site for the tram company Akersbanerne. The Røa Line past Volvat opened on 7 November 1912, and a station was built at ground level av Volvat.|$|E
25|$|Inland grizzlies may eat fish too, {{most notably}} in Yellowstone grizzlies eating Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout. The relationship with cutthroat trout and grizzlies is unique {{because it is the}} only example where Rocky Mountain grizzlies feed on spawning salmonid fish. However, grizzly bears themselves and invasive lake trout threaten the survival of the trout population and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> chance that the trout will be eliminated.|$|E

25|$|The {{competition}} {{winner was}} the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola, with the on-site work {{directed by the}} Italian-born architect Romaldo Giurgola, with a design which involved burying most of the building under Capital Hill, and capping the edifice with an enormous spire topped by a large Australian flag. The façades, however, included deliberate imitation {{of some of the}} patterns of the Old Parliament House, so that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> resemblance despite the massive difference of scale.|$|E
25|$|If {{another blow}} to the head occurs after a {{concussion}} but before its symptoms have gone away, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> risk of developing the serious second-impact syndrome (SIS). In SIS, the brain rapidly swells, greatly increasing intracranial pressure. People who have repeated mild head injuries over a prolonged period, such as boxers and Gridiron football players, are at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (or the related variant dementia pugilistica), a severe, chronic disorder involving a decline in mental and physical abilities.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{thoracic}} appendages resemble each other, but {{the first}} eleven pairs are best developed. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> tendency to regional specialization and the first pair of legs is unlike the rest. It is an elongated, cheliped-like structure with a sensory function, while all the other appendages aid in feeding, respiration, and locomotion. In females, the eleventh pair of legs is modified into brood pouches. The many legs posterior to the eleventh pair move the spent feeding and respiratory currents away.|$|E
