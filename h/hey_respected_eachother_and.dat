40|$|Abstract—Future {{smart cities}} are {{expected}} to be very large and complex ecosystems, where interactions among the various involved entities may lead to emergent behaviours (system of systems characteristic). Managing better the energy footprint is one of those challenging goals, and the smartgrid may provide a key tool in achieving that. We expect that smart city neighbourhoods will be more autonomous and able to manage more efficiently and dynamically their energy by taking into consideration local resources, prosumption and needs of their stakeholders. Additionally {{they will be able to}} interact with <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> enable the smart city to dynamically take advantage of its optimal resource usage. We explore here directions that we follow in order to realize this view with the help of the smartgrid infrastructure, prosumer interactions, enterprise energy services and neighbourhood energy marketplaces.

The probability of failureassociated with a prescribed criterion (e. g. the maximal interstoreydrift ratio exceeding a prescribed threshold) is represented as afunction of {{the intensity of the}} earthquake ground motion (e. g. peakground acceleration or spectral acceleration). The classical approachconsists in assuming a lognormal shape of the fragility curves. In thispaper, we introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish thefragility curves without making any assumption, namely the binnedMonte Carlo simulation approach and kernel density estimation.

I have used ethnographic research methods of observation, participation, conversations, interviews, context research and analysis of written texts. My aim has been to research the meaning of the sacred in the lives of contemporary shamanic practitioners, by using a theoretical framework from psychology of religion made by Paloutzian (2005). By using this frame I have focused on practitioners understanding of spiritual beliefs and ultimate concerns. As to view how these come forth in expressions of self-definition, values, goals, purposes and attitudes. My conclusions have been that contemporary shamanism is viewed as a spiritual understanding of the world that is expressing itself differently within cultural practices and geographical spaces. It is a worldview that is connecting people through shared beliefs and understandings. These understandings create strong values on how we should act with <b>eachother,</b> nature <b>and</b> our own self, as we are viewed as belonging to each other in a spiritual perspective. These values come in conflict with social and political structures built on other values and attitudes. Practitioners speak of a call for change in structures, the need of understanding our history and our belonging with <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> nature for our own wellbeing and our world to survive. As some engage in social activism and other social engagements, others view their goal as to”walk in beauty”(Gaup 2007) ...|$|R

But that demands that the involved people choose a constructive solution where both parts cooperate, understand <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> can see how themselves have contributed in developing the conflict.

Thus, {{the majority of the}} people we connect with on a day to day basis are friends and acquaintances.

These and many other factors are part of the reason we avoid strangers, but are we doing so wrongfully? Studies have shown that there are many benefits in everyday interaction with strangers, some of which are an estimated increase in happiness and letting people seemingly forget about previous grievances. There have been few studies regarding communication between strangers on social platforms, though. In order to try and tap into these many benefits, this study intends to find out how we can design mobile social application to promote strangers to interact. To help us explore this field of research we used a place-centered low-fidelity prototype application called StiQuick, in combination with qualitative focus groups. Our results show that the main concerns for developing a place-centered social platform for the promoting of communication between strangers, come down to three guidelines; flexibility, purpose, and security...|$|R

Introduction / Literature review [...] 2. Methods [...] 3. Results [...] 4. Discussion [...] 5. Conclusions. Palaeontological {{studies are}} helpful {{not only for}} {{understanding}} how communitiesinteracted in the past, but also for testing ecological models in deep time. Macropods have a rich fossil record {{and there are many}} living species, making them optimal for palaeoecological studies. Character displacement between closely related coexisting species is a developing ecological topic and testing for it in evolutionary time can enhance our understanding of the processes lying behind it. Using length and width measurements of dentary molars I looked for the presence of displacement in modern and Pleistocene communities of kangaroos using Willams’ V-test. Results indicated that there was little to no character displacement and so the hypothesis that this phenomenon enabled kangaroos to coexist was rejected. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed some significant variation for modern and extinct kangaroos but not enough to support displacement. This conclusion brings forward more questions about kangaroo palaeoecology: how do these species coexist? Was competition not as strong as we thought? Did coexisting Pleistocene kangaroos use resource partitioning like modern species do? Further studies of kangaroo ecology, both in modern communities and Pleistocene, will yield greater insights into how species interact with <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> how their evolutionary history has been shaped.

40|$|In an E-SCAN DC {{resistivity}} experiment a {{large amount}} of common source pole-pole potential data from many sources over a pre-designed survey grid are collected. The large number of DC potentials and the spatial configuration in which they are collected invite the development of new imaging and inversion methods. We present three one-pass inversion algorithms. They are based upon the linearized equation for the D C potential under the Born approximation and the assumption that the conductivity model consists of perturbations to a uniform background conductivity. Two algorithms are presented for imaging and inverting for 2 -D conductivity models. The first is based upon the theory of charge accumulation in the D C resistivity experiment, in which a sparse representation of the accumulated charge densities due to all current sources is recovered so as to image the structural boundaries. The second method inverts directly for an approximate conductivity model having a minimum structure. Both methods employ linear programming techniques. For 3 -D problems, a fast algorithm is developed using a convolutional representation of the surface pole-pole apparent resistivity. It decomposes the 3 -D inverse problem into a sequence of 1 -D inversions in the wavenumber domain. These 1 -D problems are independent of <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> can be solved efficiently. The final spatial domain conductivity model is obtained by inverse Fourier transforming. Despite the Born approximation, this algorithm seems to work for large conductivity contrasts and a certain amount of near-surface variation in conductivity.

The standard theory of metastatic colonization usuallyassumes that secondary tumours, once established at a distant site, grow independently from <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> from the primary tumour. Using a mathematical model describing the metastaticpopulation dynamics under this assumption, we challenged the theory against our data thatincluded: 1) dynamics of primary tumour cells in the kidney and metastatic cells in the lungs,retrieved by green fluorescent protein tracking, and 2) magnetic resonance images (MRI) informingon the number and size of macroscopic lesions. While the model could fit the primary tumour andtotal metastatic burden, the predicted size distribution was not in agreement with the MRIobservations. Moreover, the model was incompatible with the growth rates of individual metastatictumours. To explain the observed metastatic patterns, we hypothesised that metastatic foci derivedfrom one or a few cells could aggregate, resulting in a similar total mass but a smaller number ofmetastases. This was indeed observed in our data and led us to investigate the effect of spatialinteractions on the dynamics of the global metastatic burden. We derived a novel mathematicalmodel for spatial tumour growth, where the intra-tumour increase in pressure is responsible for theslowdown of the growth rate. The model could fit the growth of lung metastasis visualized bymagnetic resonance imaging. As a non-trivial outcome from this analysis, the model predicted thatthe net growth of two neighbouring tumour lesions that enter in contact is considerably impaired (of 31 % ± 1. 5 %, mean ± standard deviation), as compared to the growth of two independent tumours. Together, our results have implications for theories of metastatic development and suggest thatglobal dynamics of metastasis development is dependent on spatial interactions between metastaticlesions...|$|R

Moreover, the complexity of processor chips {{is proportional to the}} number of transistors embedded into a single chip. Making the transistors smaller is not only beneficial for making more complex and faster chips, it also lowers the power consumption of these chips. In the early years of computing, a computer could easily fill a whole room whereas today cellphones with a multitude of the power of these early computers match in the palm of your hand. Moreover, {{with the use of a}} variety of standard technologies like infrared, bluetooth and wifi we can connect these miniaturised devices in a mobile ad hoc network. With the rise of these technologies, the dream of Weiser [66] where persons are surrounded by a cloud of small devices cooperating with <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> adapting themselves to their context is getting closer. These small connected computing units, dubbed ambient devices, have characteristics which are significantly different from the conventional devices. One of these characteristics is that connections cannot be assumed stable, this stems from the fact that these devices are mobile and can leave a certain area in any moment in time. The development of context-aware applications coping with frequently occurring disconnections is a subject of various research projects. Adapting applications to change their behaviour according to their context can be done by making use of conventional languages, however as shown by Turing every language proven to be Turing complete is as powerful as any other Turing complete language. We do not argue this fact but put forward the expressive power of the language and maintainability of the written code.

This is made through a large diversity of organisations and actors of various kind with a large range of activities and goals. For the best possible efficiency it could be assumed that these actors should gain from cooperating and working together since their overall intentions are the same. This is not the case though and for this there are several different reasons. It do occur civil-military relations in a couple of areas of operation and the purpose of this study was to explore in which of these the relations are more or less suitable; politics and diplomacy, security, humanitarian aid, reconstruction and peacebuilding. This was done through analyses of litterature on the subject and through a few interviews with experienced personell. The material is derived from scientific research, individual and independent reports but also from statements and comments from those who have actually been on the field. The study also investigated how the links and relations in those networks the actors on the field theater belong to can explain the problems and possibilities. There is no clear answer of which area of operation is most suitable for civil-military relations, but the areas for security and reconstruction have the best possibilities to succeed in achieving their goals if coordination and education about long term consequences are dealt with. The humanitarian aid is the area that is most riskful to perform cooperation within since it could be harmful for the relations of participating actors as well as for the long-term peacebuilding. It is necessary in certain situations though. The need for further coordination and education is emphasized to be held in the arenas that preceeds the field work. This is also what the result from the network analysis gives. All links between actors are important in the field area of an international operation, wether they are strong or weak. They give the possibility to bring the organisations together and increase the knowledge about <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> also create an understanding for the different types of organisations goals and methods.

40|$|International audienceSpace {{and time}} {{concepts}} cannot be defined independently of each other; thus, {{there is a}} mathematical link between the corresponding parameters describing our physical world. An expression of this link is met in that, to-day, assessments {{of space and time}} standards are both derived from one single phenomenon, light movement, whose velocity is decided at an arbitrary mathematical value. A way to describe the space-time-associated reality is done by means of a phase-space frame where the position of the entities are represented with <b>respect</b> to <b>eachother</b> without the need of a special time parameter. The “extraction” of a single time parameter from this frame is done by favoring, among all the physical entities, one that is assumed to be moving by itself (e. g. the photon), the position of which defines the time. Because time is related to position, one may give a pre-temporal significance to a three-dimensional spatial parameter. Three-dimensional pre-time, to which is associated three-dimensional space parameter through a tensorial duality, allows a straightforward expression of the consequences of space-time duality, particularly for frame transformations, with space and time parameters on an equal footing. If one wants to have a suitable connection between the physical descriptions of phenomena both in a mobile frame and in a rest one, the same ratio of space to time standards must be taken in both frames. As a result, effects similar to Lorentz transformation are obtained; they may be understood as picturing a non-Euclidean metrics for the mobile frame as represented in the rest frame. They may also be conceived as uncertainty relations connecting the values of time and space standards to that of light velocity...|$|R

In this context,Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) together with local governments and private companies,play a key role for implementing innovative solutions, to make smart cities a reality. In this context, theInternet of Things (IoT) is an enabler for {{a broad range of}} applications and services. The IoT goes through alarger and larger set of heterogeneous devices able to join the Internet spread within the cities among thecitizens. It now makes sense to consider the scenario of these heterogeneous devices interconnected to <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> to exploit their synergy by involving their sensing and actuation resources in the Cloud. Nevertheless, there are still some challenges to face such as: 1) the interoperability among different ICTsystems; 2) a huge amount of data to be processed provided in real-time by the IoT devices deployed inthe smart systems; 3) the significant fragmentation deriving from the multiple IoT architectures andassociated middleware; 4) heterogeneous resources mashup, namely how to orchestrate resources of thevarious Clouds. Concerning the last item, the concept of IoT, with underlying physical objects abstractedaccording to thing-like semantics, seems a valid starting point for the orchestration of the variousresources. In this context, the Cloud concept could play the role to connect the IoT with the Internet of Peoplethrough the Internet of Services, by the means of a horizontal integration of various silos. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the Cloud of Things (CoT), starting from the traditional Cloud computing concept (Section 2). The CoT concept goes beyond the interconnection and hyperlink of things. It is a horizontal integration of different IoT networks silos and the associated cloud computing. Thedevelopment of the convergence of diverse IoT platforms and Clouds goes through implementedabstraction, virtualization and management of things. A precise design of these mechanisms will permit thedevelopment of a technological-agnostic architecture, where the integration and deployment of diversedevices and objects can be considered by neglecting their underlying architecture. Based on the requirements a smart city should fulfill (Section 3), we show how the combination of IoT and CoT can make the cities smarter and more sustainable. We illustrate the Cloud of Things concept through the description of the VITAL architecture developed in the framework of the FP 7 VITAL project, a CoT-based architecture, able to meet many critical requirements of a smart city, and we will show how this platform can be considered to bridge different and heterogeneous IoT silos and be effective solution to be applied for the realization of a smart city (Section 4) ...|$|R

Towards {{the core of the}} anticlines and deeper down in the crust the geometrical relations, as construction will show, necessitate a deviation from this principle and either thrusting or plastic thickening of the rocks must take place. The concentric habit for larger units will therefore be partly lost. The most satisfactory treatment of this problem would be a mathematical analysis of the principal normal stresses in a fold, applied to measured properties of the rocks involved. We are still far removed from this ideal solution. De Sitter therefore requested Kuenen to co-operate in an experimental investigation that was intended to elucidate some of the mechanical features of folding and to test the convictions won from the study of folds in nature. The actual experiments were carried out by Kuenen in his laboratory at Groningen. By frequent intercourse, however, de Sitter took an active part in guiding the research. This report embodies the more relevant results. Theoretical considerations have been reduced to a minimum in order to give, as far as possible, an unbiased exposition of the experimental data. Before entering on a description of the experiments some terms and conceptions that will find frequent use must first be discussed. By stress and strain are meant respectively: force per unit surface and deformation in terms of relative displacement...|$|R

The impacts of MT usage in work are shown to be significant; improving the productivity, responsiveness, effectiveness and flexibility of companies, while reshaping the work place organization and making employees accessible on a 7 / 24 basis. However, there are great differences {{in terms of the}} types and levels of these impacts on organizations and individuals as the industry, region/country changes. Moreover, not much is known about the effects of MTs in developing countries like Turkey where there is a rapidly increasing mobile penetration (mobile phone and internet subscription rates) which is a critical infrastructure component of mobile working. Turkey has quite an advanced banking industry that has went through serious industrial restructuring. Banking industry has always been among the early adapters and first users of new information and communication technologies, as well as first appliers of new organizational development and human resource management techniques. In the last few years, mobile technologies has become key technologies for banks and accordingly, the usage of mobile devices by banking professionals for work purposes increased. As happened in other new information technologies and human resources systems, experiences of banking industry in mobile technology usage at work-place can provide best practices or lessons for practitioners form other industries. This study tries to provide insights on the perceptions of employees in the Turkish banking industry, about the impact of these technologies on their work practices and on their private lives. A structured survey is carried out with 107 white collar professionals from 5 major retail banks in Turkey. By conducting Factors Analysis and correlation analysis, 8 main factors are identified that represents the impacts of MT usage for work purposes and their interrelations with <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> demographic factors are explored. Findings reveal that intensity of mobile device usage is still not high in banking industry. Employees perceive the positive impacts of mobile working on information and knowledge supply chain, time management of their organization,. Time management is one of the issues occurred due to mobile working. Attention and focus on meetings and interviews seems to be challenged due to parallel usage of mobile devices in meetings. There are correlations between feeling "Control, pressure, demand for responsiveness and workload" and intensity of mobile device usage and continous accessibility. Similarly, improvements in information and knowledge/flow and meeting organizations are correlated to the impacts of mobile working on productivity, quality and work-life balance. Research showed that the perceptions of employess about the implications of mobile work on "productivity, effectiveness and work-life balance" and "Attention and Focus on Group work like Meetings and Interviews" vary by gender, and on "Multitasking and work-shifting" vary by age. Education level also affects the perception on "Productivity, effectiveness and work-life balance". Hence the policy makers and managers and they also must consider the demographics of the employees when designing and implementing systems about mobile working in banking industry.

40|$|This paper - „Possibilities for {{studying}} reception. Based on {{the reception of}} text that contains a charge” – dealt {{with the question of}} how different methods are suitable for reception studies. In order to make any conclusions, three types of experiments were conducted. All of them used students as participants. The total number of participants was 40. In the first type of experiment a self-written narrative of the given story by the participants, a questionnaire with semantic differential and a group-discussion were used as methods in order to study reception (number of participants in this experiment: 21). The second one used a questionnaire with semantic differential and a group-discussion (number of participants in this experiment: 9). The third one included a questionnaire with semantic differential and an in- depth interview (number of participants in this experiment: 10). The conclusions based on those experiments were as follows: • using an in-depth interview doesn’t make it possible to judge the impact that other people may have on the participant, but it gives the most thorough answers per person to the questions asked by the researcher, • a group that includes people, who are befriended, gives good results when used in group-discussion. These people are already used to speak out in front of <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> one can imagine, that in a everyday-situation people discuss articles they have read foremost with their friends or aquaintances, • by a group-discussion thoughts of introvert individuals might be left unheard, because other participants will not {{give them a chance to}} talk, • questions about reading-habits of the participant are more useful asked orally than in a questionnaire, • using a commentarium before the reception experiments, proved to be a good opportunity to form hypotheses for judgements given by the participants, • no firm conclusions can be made about the participants personal judgements based on their written narratives. The participants seem to focus on retelling the facts provided in the lead, • the semantic differential is effective only when the participants predicate their judgements. Otherwise the numbers will be hard to explain. Based on the three variations of the reception experiment it is my personal belief that in terms of methodology the best possible combination is as follows: discourse analysis of the story + analysis of the commentarium + questionnaires using the semantic differential + in-depth interviews + group experiments. Having used a text containing a charge (SLÕL „Imik sai kodus raskeid vigastusi) in its original form and a version altered using the criteria of objectivity by in-depth interviews and group interviews I concluded, that participants tended to take an accusing attitude towards the mother of the child in both cases. The altered text seemed boring to the participants. It could not touch them on a personal level like the original text did. It also appeared, that opinions are affected by previous experience...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{underlying}} pathophysiology of unipolar and bipolar {{depression is}} receiving growing interest from researchers. One {{of the most}} prominent venues is the cytokine hypothesis. Because unipolar and bipolar depression are hard to differentiate from one other (especially in an early stage), {{there is a need for}} understanding the underlying etiology and pathophysiology. The present study aimed to define the difference between current depressive patients with and without manic symptoms at baseline and follow-up and healthy controls by measuring inflammatory markers. Methods: Baseline measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) were performed in a large group of currently depressed patients (N= 957) assesd by Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument CIDI and healthy controls (N= 430). Then the presence of manic symptoms was assessed using Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) on baseline and 2 year follow-up. Based on the MDQ groups were formed and the mean inflammatory marker values were compared with <b>eachother,</b> before <b>and</b> after adjustment for possible confounding factors (sociodemographics, lifestyle and disease-related factors). Results: After adjustment for possible confounders, no significant difference was found between depressed patients with and without manic symptoms and controls in the cross-sectional analyses. However, the prospective analyses showed that high CRP levels in currently depressed men predict the development of manic symptoms in follow up (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: These findings show that high levels of CRP in currently depressed men may predict the onset of manic symptoms at follow-up. ...|$|R

The present workstudies {{possibilities}} to obtain better conditions for regeneration of the transectedspinal cord in rats, conditions under which spinal cord grafts are able toestablish structural and functional connections with "natural" targets, andeffects {{of a series of}} neurotrophic factors on spinal cord graft survival andgrowth. Recognizing that the spinal cord is normally under tension, leading toseparation of the stumps after transection, stump approximation through verte-bral shortening was studied. While complicated by the need for better vertebralcolumn stabilization measures, and while regeneration of descending 5 HT fiberswas not improved in comparison to spinal cord transection alone, animals inwhich the spinal cord transection was combined with vertebral shorteningshowed modest, but significantly improved, hindlimb motor function comparedto spinal cord transection only. To further elucidate establishment of spinal cordconnectivity, grafts of spinal cord tissue to the anterior chamber of the eye werecombined with either cortex cerebri or another spinal cord graft. Both cortexcerebri and spinal cord were able to establish functional excitatory inputs to themature spinal cord graft, suggesting that fetal cerebral cortex or spinal cord tis-sue grafted to the adult injured spinal cord might establish similar connections. Graft growth was not influenced in these double-graft situations, suggestingthat the spinal cord did not exert any major trophic effects on itself or on cortexcerebri. When instead fetal spinal cord and fetal skeletal muscle were combinedin the eye chamber, the two tissues exerted reciprocal trophic effects upon <b>eachother,</b> <b>and</b> stimulation of the spinal cord graft elicited specific muscle contrac-tions. Spinal cord grafts were also able to exert a trophic, neuron-rescuing effecton fetal cografts of dorsal root ganglia. To elucidate trophic effects exerted by skeletal muscle on spinal cord grafts,single spinal cord grafts to the eye chamber were treated with two trophic fac-tors abundantly present in skeletal muscle, namely GDNF and NT 4. Effects ofthese factors were compared to the possible effects of NGF, BDNF, NT 3 andCNTF. GDNF exerted marked trophic effects on survival and growth of spinalcord grafts both in terms of graft volume and graft morphology, manifest as sur-vival of a larger number of neurons and a less pronounced gliosis. Remarkably,GDNF exerted strong effects also on postnatal grafts obtained from 1 -, 8 - or 14 -day-old donors. All neurotrophins except NGF stimulated spinal cord grafts. BDNF was able to stimulate prenatal grafts while NT 4, assumed to act uponthe same set of receptors as BDNF, exerted strong stimulatory effects on post-natal grafts only. CNTF also stimulated postnatal grafts. Taken together, the data demonstrate that several known neurotrophic factorsexert potent stimulatory effects of spinal cord grafts. The use of neurotrophicfactors extends the time window within which spinal cord tissue can be graftedwell into the second postnatal week. It is predicted that treatments with neuro-trophic factors or, particularly combinations of neurotrophic factors such asGDNF and NT 4, should also enhance survival of immature spinal cord tissuegrafted to the adult injured spinal cord. It is further predicted that treatmentwith combinations of neurotrophic factors might have neuroprotective effectsand/or enhance regeneration in the adult injured spinal cord.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} {{the most common form of}} cancer in women {{worldwide}} and the second leading cause of cancer death. It is a heterogeneous disease and is subdivided into different subtypes, all with different treatment responses and survival outcomes. Luminal breast cancers are characterised by the expression of oestrogen receptor and generally have a good prognosis. More aggressive tumours are marked by the presence of growth stimulating receptor tyrosine kinase HER 2 (HER 2 -like breast cancer) or the absence of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER 2 (triple-negative breast cancer,TNBC). The latter is the most aggressive form and is difficult to treat due to lack of treatment targets. This thesis aimed to explore possible prognostic and predictive biomarkers in different subtypes and study their role in breast cancer. To this aid, breast cancer tumours of pre- and post-menopausal patients enrolled in two cohorts were analysed for gene copy numbers and expression of proteins involved in cell proliferation. Gene copy numbers of receptor tyrosine kinases MET and EGFR, Met’s ligand HGF, and protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN 2 were determined by droplet digital PCR or quantitative PCR in both cohorts. Met, phosphorylated Met (pMet), HGF, and PTPN 2 protein expression levels were analysed with immunohistochemical staining in the pre-menopausal cohort. Moreover,the role of the aforementioned proteins was investigated in breast cancer cell lines. Amplification of MET, HGF, and EGFR in breast tissues was found to be low (5 - 8 %). These three genes, all located on chromosome 7, were found to be strongly correlated with <b>eachother</b> <b>and</b> to be associated with shortened distant recurrence-free survival. High protein expression of Met, pMet, and HGF was found in 33 %, 53 %, and 49 % of the breast tumours. MET and EGFR were found to be more often amplified in TNBC disease, correlating with worse survival. Moreover, stromal expression of HGF was associated with shorter survival in TNBC. EGF stimulation in TNBC cell line MDA-MB- 468 led to inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Partial knockdown of EGFR caused TNBC cells to proliferate and migrate more upon EGF treatment, mirroring EGFR inhibitor resistance. Knockdown of Met had in part the opposite effects, indicating that Met inhibitors might be useful in the treatment of TNBC. The increase in proliferation and migration upon EGFR depletion could be counteracted with simultaneous knockdown of EGFR and Met, indicating that dual inhibition of these proteins might be a future treatment option in TNBC. Copy loss of PTPN 2 was reported in 15 % of the cases in both pre- and post-menopausal cohorts. Low cytoplasmic PTPN 2 protein expression was found in half of the cases. Loss of PTPN 2 gene or protein was associated with a shorter distant recurrence-free survival in Luminal A and HER 2 -positive tumours, not in TNBC, suggesting a subtype-related prognostic value of PTPN 2. Subtype relevance of PTPN 2 was further implied by in vitro analyses. Whereas PTPN 2 knockdown had no observed effect on TNBC cell lines, knockdown in the Luminal A cell line MCF 7 inhibited Met phosphorylation and promoted phosphorylation of Akt, a key regulator of cellular proliferation and survival. The cell growth and survival regulating RAS/MAPK pathway remained unaffected. Knockdown in the HER 2 -positive cell line SKBR 3 led to increased Met phosphorylation and decreased RAS/MAPK-related Erk phosphorylation as well as EGF-mediated transcription factor STAT 3 phosphorylation. These results indicate that the role of PTPN 2 in breast cancer is subtype-related and needs to be further investigated for future treatment options...|$|R

By mainly using Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan and Jimmy Vulovic I manage to find the voice of the story, how it’s told and what it contains. There is a deeper meaning behind the details that King has selected for his story, for example the colors is not randomly chosen but have a point and a deeper sense behind them.
