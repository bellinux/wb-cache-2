40|$|The {{results of}} the tandem {{commissioning}} as initial high voltage tests and beam injection experiments on BINP proton tandem-accelerator are given. The ac-celerator {{is intended to be}} used in facilities generat-ing resonant gamma rays for explosives detection and epithermal neutrons for boron neutron-capture ther-apy of brain tumors. A magnetically coupled DC voltage multiplier derived from an industrial ELV-type electron accelerator is used as a high voltage source for the accelerator. A dc high-current nega-tive ion source has been developed for injection into the tandem. In the tandem accelerator there is set of nested potential electrodes with openings which form a channel for accelerating the negative hydrogen ion beam and subsequently accelerating the proton beam after stripping in the gas target. The electrodes are connected to a high voltage <b>feedthrough</b> <b>insulator</b> to which required potentials are applied from the high voltage power supply by means of a resistor voltage divider...|$|E
40|$|Helium {{permeates}} through glassy {{materials such}} as the fused silica used in <b>feedthrough</b> <b>insulators</b> in the endcaps of the SNO Neutral-Current Detectors. Dushman and Lafferty [1] provide a graph of the permeation rate through various glasses (their Fig. 9. 20). The rate for a given material follows a relationship of the form, log 10 (K) = α + β, T where α and β are constants, and T is the absolute temperature. The permeation rate K is in units of STP cm 3 per second and scales as follows...|$|R
50|$|When {{mounting}} the TSP in the chamber, {{a number}} of important considerations must be made. First, it is desirable that the filament can deposit on a large area. However, one must take care that the titanium is not deposited onto anything it can damage. For example, electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> containing ceramic <b>insulators</b> will fail if the titanium forms a conducting film which bridges the ceramic insulator. Samples may become contaminated by titanium if they have line-of-sight to the pump. Also, titanium is a very hard material, so titanium film which builds up {{on the inside of the}} chamber may form flakes which fall into mechanical components (typically turbomolecular pumps and valves) and damage them.|$|R
