5|$|After Zhou and Lin {{negotiated}} Stalin's approval, Peng {{attended a}} conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered {{the first wave of}} Chinese soldiers—in total more than 260,000 men—to cross into Korea on the night of October 19. On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign. From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty-eighth parallel. Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel in order to fulfill Mao's political objectives for the war. About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign, but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 – June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops, but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th parallel. In the evaluation of Korean War historian Roy <b>Edger</b> Appleman, Peng's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng's successful campaigns, from October–December 1950, were fought under Mao's direction, but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January–May 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao's instructions. Modern scholars reject this interpretation, and credit Peng with both the successes and failures of the war.|$|E

25|$|By the 1900s {{the company}} had {{challenges}} making ends meet. The company therefore in 1905 initiated a program to totally revamp its operations. The three head saw mills were demolished and replaced with a new, steam-powered head saw mill adjacent to the <b>edger</b> mill. The pulp mill was expanded to handle 15,000 tones annually, powered by the new Tistedalsfossen Power Station. Finally a new chemical pulp mill was to be built at Kaken. A complicating factor for the power station was that the company only owned {{about two-thirds of the}} waterfall rights. Finally the Tista Canal was built, allowing direct access from Kaken to the port.|$|E

2500|$|Citing {{other law}} cases, the judge {{dismantled}} the Richards' arguments. Part of the rationale {{was that the}} original owners of Richards' mill started the operation with one saw. In 1911, {{the year of the}} suit, the mill had many saws, shingle and lath mills, an <b>edger</b> and other various appliances. The addition of the number of saws and other pieces of equipment enabled an obvious increase in pollution, which the court argued, surpassed Richards' rights. Further damages had already been paid from 1896 to 1903, for damages and to cover the expense of disposing of the refuse, termed [...] "driftwood" [...] by witnesses consulted in the case. This provided an indication of guilt. Hunter won the suit, Richards was ordered to pay $200 in retribution and was required by order of an injunction to refrain from depositing refuse into the stream. Richards' was give four months to alter his mill to address the refuse situation. This action resulted in the installation the first sawdust burner in the Province of Ontario.|$|E
2500|$|Secondly, Ritchie {{also held}} that Parliament {{did not intend}} the Canadian Bill of Rights to {{fundamentally}} change or alter any constitutional scheme such as those contained in the Indian Act and, in particular, those provisions which constitute a [...] "necessary structure [...] [...] [...] for the internal administration {{of the life of}} Indians on Reserves and their entitlement to the use and benefit of Crown lands"? It was a widely accepted convention, he argues, that an Act, in which Parliament exercises its constitutional functions, can only be changed or amended [...] "by plain statutory language expressly enacted for the [...] purpose." [...] With respect to this case, he contended that Parliament did not intend to amend the Indian Act with the [...] "use of broad general language directed at the statutory proclamation of the fundamental rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Canadians [...] [...] [...] Citing the case of Barker v. <b>Edger</b> with approval and applying the Privy Council's reasoning in that case, Ritchie concluded that the Canadian Bill of Rights, likewise, did not and cannot amend the Indian Act. For good measure, Ritchie also noted that Justice Pigeon came to similar conclusion in Drybones.|$|E

On February 13, May solved the mystery when he noted a set of footprints leading off from caribou tracks in the middle of the frozen river. Johnson had been following their tracks to hide his own, but had to strike off the path to set up camp at night. Following the trail over the next few days, the RCMP rounded a bend on the river on February 17 to find Johnson in the middle of the trail again, unable to dodge for the bank without his snowshoes on.
