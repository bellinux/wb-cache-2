5|$|The Tupolev Tu-75 was a {{military}} transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, as was a similar airliner, the Tu-70, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS {{decided it would be}} cheaper to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin <b>Il-12</b> transports.|$|E
5|$|The Tu-70 was {{completed}} in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer's trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was traced to a design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying the problem and fixing it prolonged the manufacturer's trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a higher priority and Aeroflot had no requirement for the type, being fully satisfied with its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin <b>Il-12</b> airliners.|$|E
25|$|<b>IL-12</b> {{is another}} {{cytokine}} both suppressed and enhanced by thalidomide and its analogs. When monocytes are stimulated by lipopolysaccharides, <b>IL-12</b> production is suppressed but during T-cell stimulation the production is enhanced.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 663 <b>Il-12s</b> were manufactured. The {{aircraft}} was later improved into the Ilyushin Il-14.|$|R
50|$|Of the 663 <b>Il-12s</b> produced, 49 {{have been}} lost in {{accidents}} {{with a total of}} 465 fatalities.|$|R
50|$|From 1960 to 1971 the 478th Training Aviation Regiment, {{initially}} flying Ilyushin <b>Il-12s</b> and Il-14s, {{was stationed}} at the airfield. It moved in 1971 to Petrovsk in Saratov Oblast.|$|R
25|$|This {{regulation}} of cytokines appear to occur via the p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway. Usually, the p38 within the dendritic cell expresses TLR 4 (toll-like receptor 4), which is activated through the ligand LPS (lipopolysaccharide). This causes the p38 MAPK to be phosphorylated. This phosphorylation activates the p38 MAPK to begin producing IL-10 and <b>IL-12.</b> When the dendritic cells are chronically exposed to morphine during their differentiation process then treated with LPS, {{the production of}} cytokines is different. Once treated with morphine, the p38 MAPK does not produce IL-10, instead favoring production of <b>IL-12.</b> The exact mechanism through which the production of one cytokine is increased in favor over another is not known. Most likely, the morphine causes increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Transcriptional level interactions between IL-10 and <b>IL-12</b> may further increase the production of <b>IL-12</b> once IL-10 is not being produced. This increased production of <b>IL-12</b> causes increased T-cell immune response.|$|E
25|$|The innate {{system works}} with the {{adaptive}} immune system to mount a response against the DNA encoded protein. CpG-S sequences induce polyclonal B-cell activation and the upregulation of cytokine expression and secretion. Stimulated macrophages secrete <b>IL-12,</b> IL-18, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ, while stimulated B-cells secrete IL-6 and some <b>IL-12.</b>|$|E
25|$|CTL {{responses}} can {{be enhanced}} by co-inoculation with co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 or B7-2 for DNA vaccines against influenza nucleoprotein, or GM-CSF for DNA vaccines against the murine malaria model P. yoelii. Co-inoculation with plasmids encoding co-stimulatory molecules <b>IL-12</b> and TCA3 were shown to increase CTL activity against HIV-1 and influenza nucleoprotein antigens.|$|E
50|$|From 1960 to 1971 the 478th Training Aviation Regiment, {{initially}} flying Ilyushin <b>Il-12s</b> and Il-14s, {{was stationed}} at the Borisoglebsk. It moved in 1971 to Petrovsk. It {{was part of the}} Balashov Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots. It was reduced in size in 1994, and disbanded in 1998.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 the Vladivostok Airport was {{constructed}} {{next to the}} town of Artyom with commercial flights began in the summer of 1932. In the decade after the war planes Po-2 and W-2 are widely used in air-chemical works and coastal exploration fish in the service of geologists and forests patrolling. Passenger flights on the Moscow - Vladivostok route took place in 1948 using Ilyushin <b>Il-12s.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1945, the Tajik Department of Civil Air Fleet (TU GVF) {{received}} new Lisunov Li-2 and Junkers Ju-52 aircraft. The {{first flight}} by {{the crew of}} the Li-2 aircraft was operated on the route Stalinabad - Moscow. In the 1950s and 1960s aviation in Tajikistan {{was one of the most}} developed sectors of the national economy of the Republic. From 1951, Antonov An-2s were utilized in the fleet of the Tajik Department of Civil Air Fleet and in 1954 Ilyushin <b>Il-12s</b> were introduced by which the first flight on the route Stalinabad - Sochi was operated. Between 1956 and 1964, Ilyushin Il-14, Ilyushin Il-18 and Antonov An-6 (high-altitude version of the An-2) aircraft joined the fleet, as well as Mil Mi-4 helicopters.|$|R
25|$|A 2007 study {{reported}} {{the impact of}} the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (<b>IL-12),</b> which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory <b>IL-12</b> receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{was displayed}} at the 1947 air display at Tushino where it led a formation of <b>Il-12</b> airliners. Later it was fitted with a towing shackle and used for flight tests of the heavy Ilyushin Il-32 glider, as {{it was one of}} the few aircraft available powerful enough to tow the glider. It was flown well into the early 1950s although its ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, {{which include}} {{interleukin-1}} (IL-1), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (<b>IL-12),</b> Interferon-gamma (IFN-Gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth {{as well as}} neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as macrophages, as well as glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research {{for the treatment of}} anxiety-related disorders.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{recorded}} fatalities aboard Aeroflot aircraft {{during the decade}} rose to 1059; likewise, 104 of its aircraft were written off in accidents or incidents, split into one Antonov An-10, 11 Antonov An-2s, two Avia 14Ps, 28 Ilyushin <b>Il-12s,</b> 14 Ilyushin Il-14s, one Ilyushin Il-18, 42 Lisunov Li-2s, 3 TS-62s, and 2 Tupolev Tu-104s. Most of the fatal accidents took place within {{the borders of the}} Soviet Union. The reluctance the Soviet government had for publicly admitting the occurrence of such events might render these figures higher, as fatal events tended to be admitted only when there were foreigners aboard the crashed aircraft, the accident took place in a foreign country, or they reached the news for some reason.|$|R
25|$|In general, type I and II interferons are {{responsible}} for regulating and activating the immune response. Expression of type I and III IFNs can be induced in virtually all cell types upon recognition of viral components, especially nucleic acids, by cytoplasmic and endosomal receptors, whereas type II interferon is induced by cytokines such as <b>IL-12,</b> and its expression is restricted to immune cells such as T cells and NK cells.|$|E
25|$|It {{inhibits}} {{production of}} interleukin (<b>IL)-12,</b> interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This {{results in a}} shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection {{is believed to be}} a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.|$|E
25|$|Th1 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by <b>IL-12,</b> IL-2 and their effector cytokine is IFN-γ. The main effector cells of Th1 immunity are macrophages {{as well as}} CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN-γ CD4 T cells. The key Th1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-γ secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-γ can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity. Tuberculin reaction or Type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.|$|E
25|$|Initially, a T. gondii {{infection}} stimulates {{production of}} IL-2 and IFN-γ by the innate immune system. Continuous IFN-γ production {{is necessary for}} control of both acute and chronic T. gondii infection. These two cytokines elicit a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell mediated immune response. <b>IL-12</b> is also produced during T. gondii infection to activate natural killer (NK) cells. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for T. gondii, which it scavenges from host cells. IFN-γ induces the activation of indole-amine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), two enzymes {{that are responsible for}} the degradation of tryptophan. Immune pressure eventually leads the parasite to form cysts that normally are deposited in the muscles and in the brain of the hosts.|$|E
25|$|How these {{different}} methods operate, {{the forms of}} antigen expressed, and the different profiles of T-cell help is not understood. It was thought that the relatively large amounts of DNA used in IM injection {{were responsible for the}} induction of TH1 responses. However, evidence shows no dose-related differences in TH type. The type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells can differentiate to secrete <b>IL-12</b> (which supports TH1 cell development) or IL-4 (which supports TH2 responses). pDNA injected by needle is endocytosed into the dendritic cell, which is then stimulated to differentiate for TH1 cytokine production, while the gene gun bombards the DNA directly into the cell, thus bypassing TH1 stimulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} of {{determining}} that morphine may affect the immune system was to establish that the opiate receptors known to be expressed on cells of {{the central nervous system}} are also expressed on cells of the immune system. One study successfully showed that dendritic cells, part of the innate immune system, display opiate receptors. Dendritic cells are responsible for producing cytokines, which are the tools for communication in the immune system. This same study showed that dendritic cells chronically treated with morphine during their differentiation produce more interleukin-12 (<b>IL-12),</b> a cytokine responsible for promoting the proliferation, growth, and differentiation of T-cells (another cell of the adaptive immune system) and less interleukin-10 (IL-10), a cytokine responsible for promoting a B-cell immune response (B cells produce antibodies to fight off infection).|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide and its immune-modulating analogs {{alter the}} {{production}} of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, <b>IL-12</b> and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The analogs are believed to inhibit {{the production of}} TNF-α, where the analogs are up to 50.000 times more potent in vitro than the parent drug thalidomide. The mechanism is believed to be through enhanced degradation of TNF-α mRNA, resulting in diminished amounts of this pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted. This explains the effect of thalidomide when given to ENL patients, as they commonly have high levels of TNF-α in their blood and in dermatological lesions. In contrast, in vitro assay demonstrated that TNF-α is actually enhanced in T-cell activation, where CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were stimulated by anti-CD3 which was later confirmed in an early phase trials involving solid tumors and inflammatory dermatologic diseases.|$|E
25|$|In current research, the {{significant}} relationship between immune factors and hangover severity is the most convincing among all factors so far studied. An imbalance of the immune system, in particular of cytokine metabolism {{has been identified as}} playing a role in the pathophysiology of the hangover state. Especially the hangover symptoms nausea, headache, and fatigue have been suggested to be mediated by changes in the immune system. The concentration of several cytokines {{have been found to be}} significantly increased in the blood after alcohol consumption. These include interleukin 12 (<b>IL-12),</b> interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Some pharmacological studies such as on tolfenamic acid and Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) have also indicated an involvement of the immune system. These studies suggest that the presence and severity of hangover symptoms can probably be reduced by administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor such as aspirin or ibuprofen.|$|E
25|$|The {{first flight}} of the Il-18 was made on 18 August 1946, in a sixty-passenger configuration, even though the turbosuperchargers for its engines had not been fitted. To save time Sergey Ilyushin gave the order to {{commence}} flight tests without them. However, this proved to be in vain because the manufacturer's flight tests were not concluded until 30 July 1947 as the turbo-superchargers were not delivered in a timely manner. Other problems were the short time between overhauls for the ASh-73TKs, initially only 25 hours, and the disintegration of one engine on 25 June 1947. Flight characteristics were docile and the passenger cabin proved {{to be far more}} comfortable than those of the Lisunov Li-2, the C-47 Skytrain or the <b>Il-12.</b> It had a comfortable margin of power that allowed it to continue to cruise if one or even two engines weren't running. Its engines were in short supply as they were needed to power the Tupolev Tu-4 and they were not yet reliable enough for economical use so the aircraft was canceled.|$|E
500|$|The Il-32 {{made its}} first flight on 20 August 1948, towed by a twin-engined Ilyushin <b>Il-12,</b> but the <b>Il-12</b> was not {{powerful}} enough to tow a fully loaded glider and the four-engined Il-18 airliner prototype was adapted to tow it from 20 September. During these flight tests it reached a cruising speed of [...] {{at an altitude of}} [...] and a weight of [...] The flight tests were satisfactory and preparations were made to begin series production, but the lack of suitable tugs was a problem. None of the Soviet four-engined aircraft that could be used were either in production or available. Both the Tupolev Tu-70 and Il-18 airliners had been canceled, as had the Tu-75 transport, and the Tu-4 was dedicated to the strategic bombing mission. Experiments were made with a pair of Il-12s towing the Il-32, but this was both difficult and risky for all involved. The Il-32 was therefore canceled for lack of a proper tug.|$|E
2500|$|In vitro, {{apremilast}} reduces PDE4 activity {{leading to}} an increase in cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations in immune and non-immune cell types, partially inhibiting the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ IL-2, <b>IL-12</b> and IL-23 [...] and elevating the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The inhibition potency of apremilast in TNF-α production is similar to lenalidomide.|$|E
2500|$|... β-Glucans {{found in}} the cell walls of yeast contain a 1,3 carbon {{backbone}} with elongated 1,6 carbon branches A series of human clinical trials in the 1990s evaluated the impact of PGG-glucan on infections in high-risk surgical patients. In these studies, PGG-glucan significantly reduced complications. Orally administered yeast-glucan was reported to decrease the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 cytokines responsible for the clinical manifestation of allergic rhinitis, while increasing the levels of <b>IL-12.</b>|$|E
2500|$|MS {{patients}} are also {{known to be}} CD46 defective, and this leads to Interleukin-10 (IL-10) deficiency, being this involved in the inflammatory reactions. Levels of IL-2, IL-10, and GM-CSF are lower in MS females than normal. IL6 is higher instead. These findings {{do not apply to}} men. This IL-10 interleukin could be related to the mechanism of action of methylprednisolone, together with CCL2. Interleukin <b>IL-12</b> is also known to be associated with relapses, but this is unlikely {{to be related to the}} response to steroids ...|$|E
2500|$|Parr {{returned}} to Korea as an F-86 pilot with the 335th Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing from May to September 1953, managing {{to shoot down}} a total of ten enemy aircraft, all while flying F-86 Sabres, during the last 7 weeks of the war. On July 27, 1953, {{the day of the}} armistice, then Captain Parr scored the last aerial 'kill' of the [...] Korean War by shooting down an unarmed Soviet Navy Ilyushin <b>Il-12</b> transport aircraft. All 21 passengers including 3 medical staff were killed.|$|E
2500|$|Except in neonates, a {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{should always be}} done before administering BCG. [...] A reactive tuberculin skin test is a contraindication to BCG. [...] Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, {{not because of the}} common misconception that tuberculin reactors [...] "are already immune" [...] and therefore do not need BCG. [...] People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people [...] who have <b>IL-12</b> receptor pathway defects.|$|E
2500|$|Passenger {{flights from}} Vladivostok to Moscow began using Ilyushin <b>Il-12</b> airliners in 1948. Five years later, in 1953, the Antonov An-2 {{commenced}} service, becoming a significant educational tool for Vladivostok Air, allowing pilots to amass {{experience in a}} number of different flight-related activities, while carrying several thousand passengers. Taking over the workload of the Po-2, [...] the An-2 [...] "Annushka" [...] became a nearly irreplaceable aircraft for Vladivostok Air's agricultural charters. Vladivostok Air also began basic use of the Lisunov Li-2 aircraft, which would continue to operate regular passenger flights from Ozernye Klyuchi Airport to Khabarovsk for the next 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|The Il-18 was {{developed}} to meet Aeroflot's need for a high-altitude, long-range aircraft to fly its long-haul national and international routes. It was conceived as a cantilever low-wing monoplane, powered by four Charomskii ACh-32 diesel engines, as initially used in the Ilyushin <b>Il-12,</b> with a tricycle landing gear. To improve the wing's lift-to-drag ratio and the aircraft's maximum speed, the wing was given a very high aspect ratio of 12. It was intended to operate from both paved and unpaved runways with a length of less than [...] Its main wheels were larger than normal to handle the rough surfaces. The pressurized fuselage was circular in cross-section, which provided room for cargo and baggage compartments under the cabin floor. A variety of seating plans were under consideration, ranging from 66 seats to 27 sleeping berths, but no decision had been made before it was canceled.|$|E
2500|$|Th2 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against extracellular [...] parasites including helminths. They are triggered by IL-4 and <b>IL-12,</b> and their effector cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13. The main effector cells are eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells {{as well as}} B cells, and IL-4/IL-5 CD4 T cells. The key Th2 transcription factors are STAT6 and GATA3. IL-4 is the positive feedback cytokine for Th2 cells differentiation. Besides, IL-4 stimulates B-cells to produce IgE antibodies, which in turn stimulate mast cells to release histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene to cause broncho-constriction, intestinal peristalsis, gastric fluid acidification to expel helminths. IL-5 from CD4 T cells will activate eosinophils to attack helminths. IL-10 suppresses Th1 cells differentiation and function of dendritic cells. [...] Th2 overactivation against autoantigen will cause Type1 IgE-mediated allergy and hypersensitivity. Allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma belong to this category of autoimmunity. [...] In addition to expressing different cytokines, Th2 cells also differ from Th1 cells in their cell surface glycans (oligosaccharides), which makes them less susceptible to some inducers of cell death.|$|E
50|$|<b>IL-12</b> {{is linked}} with autoimmunity. Administration of <b>IL-12</b> to people {{suffering}} from autoimmune diseases was shown to worsen the autoimmune phenomena. This {{is believed to be}} due to its key role in induction of Th1 immune responses. In contrast, <b>IL-12</b> gene knock-out in mice or a treatment of mice with <b>IL-12</b> specific antibodies ameliorated the disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>IL-12</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the activities of natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. <b>IL-12</b> mediates enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. There also seems to be a link between IL-2 and the signal transduction of <b>IL-12</b> in NK cells. IL-2 stimulates the expression of two <b>IL-12</b> receptors, IL-12R-β1 and IL-12R-β2, maintaining the expression of a critical protein involved in <b>IL-12</b> signaling in NK cells. Enhanced functional response is demonstrated by IFN-γ production and killing of target cells.|$|E
