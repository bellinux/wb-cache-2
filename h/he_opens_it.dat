5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} door of a student. When <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E
500|$|Themes of {{religious}} salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is experiencing his most desperate moment {{of confusion and}} despair, he opens the drawer of his desk and finds a Gideon Bible. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> [...] "randomly" [...] to , and reads from it: [...] "And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill." [...] This passage reflects Barton's inability {{to make sense of}} his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been [...] "cut in pieces"), as well as the [...] "hopes and dreams" [...] of [...] "the common man". Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a [...] "little entertainment" [...] to [...] "divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines".|$|E
2500|$|Associate Justice Frank Murphy, {{with whom}} Justice Rutledge concurs, {{delivers}} the most impassionate opinion. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> by asking whether the California Alien Land Law {{is consistent with}} the Constitution of the United States, whether a state can prohibit aliens from acquiring land, and whether such prohibition is permitted by the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Murphy answers that the “negative answer to those queries is dictated by the uncompromising opposition of the Constitution to racism, whatever cloak or disguise it may assume.” He calls the California Alien Land Law “nothing more than an outright racial discrimination. As such, it deserves constitutional condemnation.” ...|$|E

2500|$|When Homer arrives {{home to find}} Ned {{waiting for}} him, Homer {{declares}} that Ned will never take him alive. A long Parkour chase ensues, ending with the two on a beam suspended high over the ground. Homer wails that he loved Ned, but Ned counters that Homer mostly hated him. Homer scoffs {{that it was only}} because Ned holds onto his resentments. Homer jumps onto another beam, but Ned fails to land on it, gripping onto the edge of the beam. He begs Homer for help, which causes Homer to flash back to all the good times he and Ned had together; Homer finally helps Ned, but ends up tumbling {{over the edge of the}} beam himself. Shrieking, he and Ned end up landing in a pool of wet cement– which unfortunately sets before they can get out. Chief Wiggum arrives to put Homer away, but in jail, Homer has been sentenced to a short stay. On the last night of his sentence, he receives a cake from Marge to [...] "help get him through his sentence". <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> to find a regular pink and white frosted sheet cake that simply says [...] "to the love of my life". At the same time, Sideshow Bob escapes from the Springfield Penitentiary.|$|E
60|$|Now Mr. Toad's {{mouth is}} very big indeed, and when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> to laugh <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> very wide indeed.|$|E
60|$|Another soft {{knock at}} the outer door attracts his {{attention}} as he goes down-stairs. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> to Mr. Jasper, holding in his hand the pupil’s hat.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> {{and found}} eleven five-pound notes {{and a little}} paper sack bulging with sovereigns.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> hurriedly, {{his face}} {{suddenly}} lit up by expectation; {{but it was}} Dr Porhoët.|$|R

6000|$|But GEORGE {{has crossed}} to the curtained door; <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> and [...] says: [...] "Clare!" [...] Receiving no answer, he goes in. PAYNTER [...] {{switches}} up the electric light. His face, turned towards the [...] curtained door, is apprehensive.|$|E
6000|$|We follow Maso {{across the}} ante-chamber {{to the door}} on the left-hand, through which we pass as <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> He merely looks in and nods, while a clear young voice says, [...] "Ah, you are come back, Maso. It is well. We have wanted nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Allonby lurched unsteadily to the door, {{and held}} his hand up as <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

After a while [...] JOHN comes back, very quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... (Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats {{pinned on}} his head, appears {{weighted}} {{to one side}} by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> and shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... [He hurries to the door, {{anxious to}} get away with his booty. When <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> he is confronted with a dainty and exquisitely clean young Japanese lady in a simple blue cotton kimono printed cunningly with small white jasmine blossoms. Mrs. Pearce is with her. He gets out of her way deferentially and apologizes]. Beg pardon, miss.|$|E

60|$|Now a new terror seizes him. Has he money {{enough to}} reach London? Has he his purse at all? Too dreadful to find himself stopped short, on the very brink of deliverance! A cold {{perspiration}} breaks from his forehead, as he feels in every pocket. Yes, his purse is there: but he turns sick as <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> and dare hardly look. Hurrah! Five pounds, six--eight! That will take him as far as Paris. He can walk; beg {{the rest of the}} way, if need be.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; he won't let me {{send for}} one. He says it's o' no use, an' he couldn't {{afford to pay}} for one. An' oh! you've no notion what a miser that poor young man is.

I could see that when he brought it here, an' there's no clo'es in it, that I can see, when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> to get at the few pence he wants now an' again.

6000|$|... "The {{stimulus}} (object) {{to which}} the child often responds, a box, e.g. by movements such as opening and closing and putting objects into it, may serve to illustrate our argument. The nurse, observing that the child reacts with his hands, feet, etc., to the box, begins to say 'box' when the child is handed the box, 'open box' when the child opens it, 'close box' when he closes it, and 'put doll in box' when that act is executed. This is {{repeated over and over}} again. In the process of time it comes about that without any other stimulus than that of the box which originally called out the bodily habits, he begins to say 'box' when he sees it, 'open box' when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> etc. The visible box now becomes a stimulus capable of releasing either the bodily habits or the word-habit, i.e. development has brought about two things: (1) a series of functional connections among arcs which run from visual receptor to muscles of throat, and (2) a series of already earlier connected arcs which run from the same receptor to the bodily muscles.... The object meets the child's vision. He runs to it and tries to reach it and says 'box.'... Finally the word is uttered without the movement of going towards the box being executed.... Habits are formed of going to the box when the arms are full of toys. The child has been taught to deposit them there. When his arms are laden with toys and no box is there, the word-habit arises and he calls 'box'; it is handed to him, and <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> and deposits the toys therein. This roughly marks what we would call the genesis of a true language-habit."(pp. 329-330).* ...|$|E
60|$|Then Cruelty {{rose out of}} {{his chair}} and elbowed his way to the door. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> and looked out.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a letter}} lying on the table. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> It was, as he had expected, from the count.|$|R
60|$|By {{the last}} post came {{a letter from}} General Pendyce. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> with fingers as shaky as his brother's writing.|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the whole}} I {{recommend}} you to persevere; {{you are doing}} very well." [...] Mr. Scalper's next proceeding is peculiar. He takes from the cupboard a roll of twine, about fifty feet in length, and attaches one end {{of it to the}} neck of the bottle. Going then to one of the windows, <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> leans out, and whistles softly. The alert ear of Policeman Hogan on the pavement below catches the sound, and he returns it. The bottle is lowered {{to the end of the}} string, the guardian of the peace applies it to his gullet, and for some time the policeman and the man of letters remain attached by a cord of sympathy. Gentlemen who lead the variegated life of Mr. Scalper find it well to propitiate the arm of the law, and attachments of this sort are not uncommon. Mr. Scalper hauls up the bottle, closes the window, and returns to his task; the policeman resumes his walk with a glow of internal satisfaction. A glance at the City Hall clock causes him to enter another note in his book.|$|E
6000|$|Just {{as he is}} solving {{this problem}} upon {{principles}} of the highest morality, it occurs to him suddenly {{that he has not}} written his Saturday article; and that there is only about an hour to do it in. He wildly calls to somebody (probably the gardener) to telephone to somewhere for a messenger; he barricades himself in another room and tears his hair, wondering what on earth he shall write about. A drumming of fists on the door outside and a cheerful bellowing encourage and clarify his thoughts; and he is able to observe some newspapers and circulars in wrappers lying on the table. One is a dingy book catalogue; the second is a shiny pamphlet about petrol; the third is a paper called The Christian Commonwealth. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> anyhow, and sees {{in the middle of a}} page a sentence with which he honestly disagrees. It says that the sense of beauty in Nature is a new thing, hardly felt before Wordsworth. A stream of images and pictures pour through his head, like skies chasing each other or forests running by. [...] "Not felt before Wordsworth!" [...] he thinks. [...] "Oh, but this won't do... bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang... night's candles are burnt out... glowed with living sapphires... leaving their moon-loved maze... antique roots fantastic... antique roots wreathed high... what is it in As You Like It?" ...|$|E
60|$|When a man {{who hates}} cats wakes {{up in the morning}} and finds a little squirming kitten on his breast, or puts his hand into his ulster-pocket and finds a little half-dead kitten where his gloves should be, or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among his dress-shirts, or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh {{strapped}} on his saddle-bow and shakes a little squawling kitten from its folds when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> or goes out to dinner and finds a little blind kitten under his chair, or stays at home and finds a writhing kitten under the quilt, or wriggling among his boots, or hanging, head downwards, in his tobacco-jar, or being mangled by his terrier in the veranda,--when such a man finds one kitten, neither more nor less, once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or should be, he is naturally upset. When he dare not murder his daily trove because he believes it to be a Manifestation, an Emissary, an Embodiment, and half a dozen other things all out of the regular course of nature, he is more than upset. He is actually distressed. Some of Lone Sahib's co-religionists thought that he was a highly favoured individual; but many said that if he had treated the first kitten with proper respect--as suited a oth-Ra-Tum-Sennacherib Embodiment--all this trouble would have been averted. They compared him to the Ancient Mariner, but none the less they were proud of him and proud of the Englishman who had sent the Manifestation. They did not call it a Sending because Icelandic magic was not in their programme.|$|E
