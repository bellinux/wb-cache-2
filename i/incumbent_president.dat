Ferraro became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee {{in addition to being}} the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements.

Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, <b>incumbent</b> <b>President</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% {{of the popular}} vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin.|$|E
5|$|As President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes {{had caused}} heated {{tensions}} within the Republican Party.

Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880, and had announced at his 1877 inauguration {{that he would not}} run for a second term. Without an <b>incumbent</b> <b>president</b> in the race, the rival factions within the Republican Party, the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the <b>incumbent</b> <b>president</b> were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future. An interim government is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an <b>incumbent</b> <b>President,</b> the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested.
