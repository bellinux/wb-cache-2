Traditional stock-recruitment models consider all mature fish as equivalent contributors to the spawning stock biomass. In this study we examine the effects of discounting first-time spawners on the stock-recruitment relation-ship of two species with varying life histories: Georges Bank haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), a fast maturing gadoid, and Gulf of Maine witch flounder (<b>Glyptocephalus</b> <b>cynoglossus),</b> a slow maturing pleuronectid. Proportions of first-time spawning haddock ranged from 3 to 62 percent of the spawning stock biomass during 1963 – 96.

During {{the period of}} food transition, when the food supply and light condition are optimal, temperature can be a key determinant for fish survival (McGurk 1984; Kamler 1992; Gardeur et al. 2007; Ma 2014).

Ma (2014) suggests that there is a temperature-sensitive period during early ontogeny where mortality is likely to occur in fish larvae. In the present study, lower survival was observed when fish were reared at 33  °C than at other temperatures, suggesting the importance of temperature for golden pompano larval rearing. In the present study, the fish density was reduced at high temperatures due to high mortality, which may contribute to temperature-dependent fish growth in this study.|$|E

All species tend to increase prey intake at those places and times when benthic abundance of prey common to their diets increases. Visual predators (flounders) show different functional responses towards increased prey abundances than non-visual predators (ocean pout).

40|$|Danish seining is an {{important}} fishing method used to harvest demersal species. Knowledge about the size selectivity of different demersal species {{with this type of}} fishing gear is therefore of importance for managing the exploitation of marine resources. However, there are only limited data on size selection in cod ends in this fishery. Sea trials were therefore carried out to collect size selectivity data for Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua, Haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, and Witch Flounder <b>Glyptocephalus</b> <b>cynoglossus</b> for a diamond-mesh cod end. For all three species, the data were best described by a double logistic selection curve, implying that two different size selection processes occur in the cod end. The double selection process could be explained by an additional selection process occurring through slack meshes. The results imply that the escapement of 46 % and 34 % of the larger Atlantic Cod and Haddock (those above 48 cm), respectively, would be through wide-open or slack meshes. Since these mesh states are only likely to be present in the latest stage of the fishing process (e. g., when the cod end is near the surface), a large fraction of the bigger fish probably escaped near the surface, which might influence their likelihood of survival. Furthermore, based on the models established for explaining the experimental size selection, we were able to predict the effect of changing the mesh size on cod end size selection in the Danish seine fishery...|$|E

Only three species contained these parasites: American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Witch flounder (<b>Glyptocephalus</b> <b>cynoglossus).</b> Also the condition, age distribution and weight-length relationship was measured on these fish species. There was a geographical difference in the percentage of infected fish between the middle and inner part of the Oslofjord, as most nematodes were found in the middle part of the fjord.

These hypotheseswere tested in the field by comparing a trawl with regular bottom-tendering wire bridles and the same trawl with floating synthetic bridles in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery. As expected, {{no statistically significant differences}} in catch rates and size were found for the targeted northern shrimp (146. 3 + 10. 58 kg h 21 control vs. 140. 8 + 9. 35 kg h 21, p 0. 13). Total finfish bycatch was reduced by 14. 9 %, and the difference was statistically different (p 0. 01).

40|$|During {{the fishing}} process, fish {{react to a}} trawl {{with a series of}} {{behaviours}} that often are species and size specific. Thus, a thorough understanding of fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear and a scientific understanding of the ability of different gear designs to utilize or stimulate various behavioural patterns during the catching process are essential for developing more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly trawls. Although many behavioural studies using optical and acoustic observation systems have been conducted, harsh observation conditions on the fishing grounds often hamper the ability to directly observe fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear. As an alternative to optical and acoustic methods, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to catch data to extract detailed and quantitative information about species- and size-dependent escape behaviour in towed fishing gear such as trawls. We used catch comparison data collected with a twin trawl setup; the only difference between the two trawls was that a 12 m long upper section was replaced with 800 mm diamond meshes in one of them. We investigated the length-based escape behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), witch flounder (<b>Glyptocephalus</b> <b>cynoglossus),</b> and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt) and quantified the extent to which behavioural responses set limits for the large mesh panel's selective efficiency. Around 85 % of saithe, 80 % of haddock, 44 % of witch flounder, 55 % of lemon sole, and 55 % of cod (below 68 cm) contacted the large mesh panel and escaped.

One nominal in-group, Platichthys bicoloratus, is {{shown to be a}} derived out-group taxon. Two other out-group taxa used are Parophrys vetulus and Atheresthes stomias. Monophyly of glyptocephalines is suggested by the results of minimum distance clustering of shape, as well as asymmetrical jaw dentition and mi-serial arrangement of jaw teeth; loss of ural neural arch; median number of rays on fifth hypural greater than two; and median number of parhypural rays greater than three. Two monophyletic groups are identified within glyptocephalines: Clade M, Embassichthys and Microstomus; and Clade G, Tanakius and Glyptocephalus. Each clade includes a primitive monotypic genus and a derived genus with three species. The most recent speciation event in each clade separated an Atlantic species from a western Pacific species. One trans-Pacific dispersal event is hypothesized for the ancestor of Clade G and one recent trans-Arctic dispersal is hypothesized for both clades. The trans-Pacific dispersal probably occurred during the Miocene. The trans-Arctic dispersal probably occurred during the Pliocene. The western North Pacific or North Pacific is the most likely the center of origin of glyptocephalines, since this area possesses the most primitive taxa. Some ontogenetic data are discussed to corroborate glyptocephaline monophyly and phylogenetic relationships. Relative timing of ontogenetic events and ontogenetic shape changes corroborate generic groupings.

The performance of larvae in relation to prey availability can provide insight into larval behavioural ecology, highlight factors that promote survival at sea, and aid in construction of appropriate feeding strategies during larviculture. In the first study, witch flounder larvae were exposed to a range of prey densities (250 - 16000 prey per liter) and their behaviour was recorded during feeding trials. Larvae were also reared at a range of prey densities (2000 - 8000 prey per liter) and their growth and survival were monitored. The foraging behaviour of witch flounder was not as affected by variation in prey availability as are other species. Larvae appear to have low prey requirements as they exhibit low foraging activity. Growth and survival of witch flounder in culture is relatively robust to changes in prey availability. The ability to forage when prey is more or less abundant may be a response to the extended larval period of this species. In the second study, yellowtail flounder larvae were reared at a constant high prey density (8000 prey per liter) and fed at high prey density at different feeding frequencies (1, 2, and 4 per day). Larval behaviour, growth and survival were monitored. The consumption rate of larvae was highest in the treatments fed 1 and 2 times per day. Growth and survival of larvae fed 2 and 4 times per day were similar to that of larvae fed continuously. It is concluded that two feedings per day at high prey density is adequate for the culture of yellowtail flounder. Pulse feeding may be an efficient strategy for larval rearing...|$|E
40|$|The witch {{flounder}} (<b>Glyptocephalus</b> <b>cynoglossus),</b> or grey sole, {{as it is}} commonly known, {{is a member of}} the family Pleuronectidae (right eye flounders) and is found in the Northwest Atlantic near Hamilton Bank off southern Labrador, southward over Newfoundland banks, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine, to Cape Lookout, NC. The {{witch flounder}} has become increasingly important commercially since the 1940 's. There was heavy exploitation of witch flounder by foreign ships in the early 1970 's but with the introduction of Canada's 200 -mile limit in 1977, foreign fishing for the species was reduced and Canada's take increased. [...] This study focused on the adaptation of wild witch flounder to captivity and the development of a captive broodstock. Areas of concentration focused on growth and maturation, with emphasis on the reproductive biology (pattern of oocyte development, endocrinology and gamete analysis) of the witch flounder. This information will be used to help determine whether the witch flounder is a good candidate as an aquaculture species. [...] The reproductive cycle of both the male and female witch flounder is characterized by distinct seasonal variations and fluctuations in plasma sex steroids associated with reproductive activity. As seen in other teleosts, the circulating levels of sex steroids increased as gamete maturation and gonad growth proceed, reaching peak levels during spawning. [...] Oocyte size-class frequency distributions of witch flounder demonstrate the presence of just a single clutch of progressively developing vitellogenic oocytes, indicating group-synchronous development, by far the most common reproductive strategy in teleosts. [...] Male witch flounder produce low volumes of viscous milt and sperm is only available for five months of the year (April [...] August). This correlates with spawning events in the female witch flounder, with ovulated eggs from late June to late August...|$|E

40|$|Nematodes from 361 {{fish from}} 15 species were {{collected}} between August 2010 and March 2012 at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær {{in the outer}} Oslofjord. The study focused on the infection levels of the three most abundant nematode species, Hysterothylacium aduncum, Anisakis simplex and Contracaecum osculatum, in the three flatfish species American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (<b>Glyptocephalus</b> <b>cynoglossus)</b> and common dab (Limanda limanda). When all nematode and fish species were pooled the percentage of infected fish (i. e prevalence), {{the average number of}} nematodes per fish (i. e. abundance) and the average number of nematodes per infected fish (i. e. the intensity) were significantly higher at Langøya than at Torbjørnskjær. While H. aduncum and C. osculatum had higher abundances at the western site, A. simplex was more abundant at the eastern site. Among the three flatfish species, American plaice had a relatively high prevalence both at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær (55 and 53 % respectively). Witch flounder was only infected at Langøya (59 %) and mainly with H. aduncum (53 %). Common dab had a high prevalence at Langøya (80 %) and rather low at Torbjørnskjær (15 %). However, since the sample size was small for witch flounder at Torbjørnskjær (n = 4) and for common dab at Langøya (n = 5), these results are likely to be biased. This study also supports the general view that there is a large fluctuation in the nematode populations in the outer Oslofjord. The previously observed decrease of A. simplex seems to continue. C. osculatum and H. aduncum are getting more widespread in the Oslofjord. In addition, my data contain the first recording of the flatfish nematode Cucullanus heterochrous at Langøya, suggesting that also this species is expanding in the Oslofjord. The lengths of the nematodes were used to investigate whether the three flatfishes are suitable hosts for the three nematode species. American plaice and witch flounder are good transport and final hosts for H. aduncum. American plaice seemed to be suitable transport host for C. osculatum as well. Despite the fact that A. simplex is known to have a pelagic life-cycle with Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as the main transport host, my observations show that it can also use the benthic common dab as transport host in the outer Oslofjord. The number of nematodes per witch flounder and common dab had a random distribution (Poisson distribution). However, the number of Pseudoterranova decipiens per American plaice was highly over-dispersed. It is likely that a combination of different factors, especially the feeding ecology and habitat preferences of the fish, is the cause for the observed infestation patterns. In addition, American plaice and witch flounder harboured a more diverse parasite fauna than common dab. Finally, the length measurements indicate that there may be some interspecific interaction between the nematodes...|$|E
40|$|Data from EU-Spain (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) {{bottom trawl}} surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area (2002 – 2011) were {{analyzed}} to examine {{patterns on the}} South of Grand Banks (NAFO Div. 3 NO) of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity in relation to depth. The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92. 6 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 300 m. Five assemblages were identified. Two shallow assemblages {{were found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 150 and include yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), moustache sculpin (Triglops murrayi), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and web sculpin (Hemitripterus americanus). Assemblage II (Shallow) includes the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m and comprises Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American angler (Lophius americanus), wolfish (Anarichas lupus) and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). Assemblage III (Intermediate) contains the depth strata between 301 and 600 m. Redfish (Sebastes spp.), spotted wolfish (Anarhichas minor), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), Northern wolfish (Anarhichas denticulatus), white hake (Urophycis tenuis), witch flounder (<b>Glyptocephalus</b> <b>cynoglossus)</b> and longfin hake (Phycis chesteri) were included in the intermediate assemblage. Finally, we found two deep clusters: Assemblage IV (Deep) contains the depths between 601 and 1000 m, and Assemblage V (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) formed Assemblage IV. Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemnitzii), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborean) and longnose chimera (Harriotta raleighana) made up the deepest assemblage. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Yellowtail flounder appears to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod and American plaice that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the fishing effort in the deep waters of the Grand Banks, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
