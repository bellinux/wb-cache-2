The fins extend beyond the hull of the vessel below the waterline and alter their angle of attack depending upon <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and rate-of-roll of the vessel. They operate similar to airplane ailerons. Cruise ships and yachts frequently use this type of stabilizer system.|$|E
5000|$|Racing yachts try {{to reduce}} the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, {{allowing}} them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs {{tend to have a}} very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35 knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are [...] "single handed" [...] races, where one person alone must control the yacht.|$|E

Configurations of rectangular wing and delta wing are considered, and performance of endplates and ailerons during banking are also studied. The study shows that righting moment increase nonlinearly with <b>heeling</b> <b>angle,</b> and endplates enhance the righting. The asymmetric aerodynamic distribution along span of wing with <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> introduces adverse yaw moment. Heeling in ground effect with small ground clearance increases the vertical aerodynamic force and makes WIG craft climb. Deflections of ailerons introduce lift decrease and a light pitching motion.

50|$|One of {{the less}} obvious causes of {{broaching}} is an oscillation developed when running downwind. When running dead downwind, the sails are set with an angle of attack of nearly 90 degrees to the wind. The high angle of attack causes turbulent bubbles to form on the leeward side of the sail, and when there is insufficient attached flow to keep these bubbles attached to the sail, they separate. The sudden separation of a turbulent bubble drops the lift of the sail to nearly nothing, which causes the boat to rock slightly. At angles of attack near 90 degrees, lift can generate on the leech, or trailing edge of the sail. As the boat rocks due to separation of turbulent bubbles, a constructive interference is formed, as bubbles begin to shed from alternating sides of the sail. Once started, the oscillation builds quickly, especially in modern ultra-light displacement centerboard boats and sportsboats, which lack the damping effects of a large keel. Once this oscillation reaches a certain point, the extreme change in <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> will cause the boat to broach. Spinnakers generate lift from the top, rather than the side, and thus they are less prone to this form of broaching than other modern sail types. Square rigged vessels also generate lift from the tops of their sails, which in fact, combined with the large keels they traditionally use, makes them immune {{to this type of}} broaching.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of forward speed and <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> on the bare hull lift component of roll damping. The effect {{of the presence of}} a rudder was also studied. Experiments were performed on two ship models with different hull characteristics. One of the models was also tested fitted with a rudder to investigate the effect of the rudder. The experiments were conducted in calm water with the ship model restrained from moving freely in any of the six directions. Models were oriented in different combinations of fixed heel angles and yaw angles, and towed at various forward speeds. The lift force and moment acting on the ship hull were measured and the lift coefficient and moment arm were calculated. [...] Experimental results show that the lift coefficient is a nonlinear function of the angle of attack. It is also dependent on <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and forward speed. The moment arm was found to be a nonlinear function of both <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and forward speed. Its value decreases as <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> increases. An empirical formula was derived from the experimental results to determine the equivalent linear damping coefficient for lift roll damping. The empirical formula shows that the equivalent linear damping coefficient is a nonlinear function of forward speed. The lift roll damping will increase with increasing forward speed. On the other hand, increasing <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> leads to a decrease {{in the value of the}} equivalent linear damping. Comparison between the empirical formula and Ikeda's formula indicates that Ikeda's formula underestimates the equivalent linear damping. The discrepancy increases with increasing forward speed.

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the current method for calculating a ship's vertical centre of gravity following inclining experiments is limited when considering magnitude of applied <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and accuracy achieved for certain hull-forms due to the assumption of unchanged metacentre position when the vessel is heeled.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{forces are}} usually {{computed}} numerically or measured in a wind tunnel. These forces {{may be used}} to predict the performance of a yacht at full-scale. The aim of this project was to develop a new method to measure the forces and moments directly at full-scale. The theory was that by simultaneously measuring the shape of the sails and the pressures around them the force normal to the surface could be derived by summation of the product of the pressure, unit normal vector and the relevant area of the discretised sail shape. A code was written for the interpolations of the discrete shape and pressure measurements to the full sail shapes and pressures over them. The shape was then discretised and the pressure at the centre of each cell was assumed constant over it. The results were validated through testing at model-scale. The calculated forces and moments were compared directly to the results obtained from a force balance on which the model yacht was mounted. The results were also used in a VPP to assess the accuracy when predicting <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and boat speed. The first test was conducted on a set of semi-rigid sails with surface mounted pressure taps. A study of the pressure distributions found using a VLM was used to optimise the pressure tap locations. The results were encouraging; however it appeared that the interference on the flow caused by the taps resulted in large under-predictions of the forces and moments. This lead to a second round of model testing using sails with internal pressure taps leaving the sail surfaces smooth. The results showed good agreement, although there was still a significant under-prediction of the drive force. Full-scale testing was carried out using a purpose built pressure measuring system.

40|$|A common {{practice}} during {{the design of}} a sailing yacht is to assume an ideal environment. The wind is constant in intensity and direction and the sea is calm. In this situation, an equilibrium between the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces and moments can be found. The equations of equilibrium are thus solved to find the best setup (combination of sails, sail trim, etc.) in order to achieve the maximum boat speed. This procedure is the core of a 'traditional' Velocity Prediction Program (VPP), which was first introduced in 1976. Since then many improvements have been made and nowadays VPPs are capable of dealing with the most diverse designs. However, in nearly forty years of life, the nature of these programs has not changed and, still, important dynamic effects caused by the real environment, are not taken into account. Investigating the performance of a yacht taking into account these effects, is far from easy. Indeed, the equations of equilibrium should be replaced by the more complicated equations of motion which need to be solved in the time domain. However, in recent years, the dynamic characteristics of a yacht sailing in waves and shifting winds (real environment) have become a more popular topic in the sailing yacht community. In the wake of the increasing interest towards this subject, the present work aims to investigate some important dynamic aspects. The effect of the surge motion and of the <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> on the motions of heave and pitch, and on the mean added resistance, are studied by means of towing-tank tests. These are performed on two models of series 4 of the Delft Systematic Yacht Hull Series. Then, time-domain simulations are performed to study the effect of a pitch-induced oscillating aerodynamic force on the seakeeping of yachts sailing upwind in waves. The aerodynamic force is calculated using a quasi-steady as well as an unsteady method, whereas the hydrodynamic {{part of the problem is}} tackled using a strip-theory program which is capable of considering asymmetric hull shapes (e. g. hulls with a <b>heeling</b> <b>angle).</b> The results show that surge has a small influence on the motions and on the mean added resistance alike. The <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> on the other hand, prove to have a large effect on the seakeeping of the models. This effect can be qualitatively predicted by the strip-theory program, although the trend is not always correct. Finally, in same cases, the aerodynamic force significantly affects the pitch and heave motions and this results in a considerable reduction of the added resistance in waves.

By keeping speed constant interpolation is avoided in the very non-linear resistance-speed relation, reducing considerably the required number of CFD computations. Another reduction is obtained by a special technique for avoiding interpolation in leeway. Systematic CFD computations are carried out to find the optimum trim versus heel at the speeds 2, 3, 4, 5 knots. Using this relation the required wind speed at the four boat speeds can be expressed as a function of heel only. The <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> corresponding to the smallest wind speed is the best. Knowing this, and the corresponding optimum trim, the position of the sailor is computed. It turns out that the predicted best positions correspond well with practical experience. However, the results highlight the benefit of a small heel in higher winds, which often is regarded as undesired by sailors...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe dynamic and static {{response of the}} proposed NPS ocean instrument platform in investigated by developing and solving linear differential equations of motion of the tower in surge, heave and pitch. The motion is expressed as a response spectrum which directly proportional to a wave spectrum as the exerting force. The analysis is made for various configuration of the lateral restraining cables using both a five point and nine point mooring system. For all configurations, the heave response of the tower {{is found to be}} {{less than one percent of}} wave height. The stability of the tower in pitch is found to be considerably improved after shifting from a five point mooring system to a nine point mmooring system and optimizing the location of the cable attachment points. Using this design, a significant wave height of 7. 7 feet is found to produce a significant pitch of 5. 4 degrees, a significant surge of. 97 feet, and a 5. 28 foot excursion of the lower platform on the tower. All oscillations well be superimposed on any <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> of the tower which may exist due to steady wind forces. The angle of heel for a wind of 20 mph is evaluated to be 1. 9 degrees.

50|$|The {{stability}} of a buoyant object {{at the surface}} is more complex, and it may remain stable even if the centre of gravity is above the centre of buoyancy, provided that when disturbed from the equilibrium position, the centre of buoyancy moves further to the same side that the centre of gravity moves, thus providing a positive righting moment. If this occurs, the floating object {{is said to have}} a positive metacentric height. This situation is typically valid for a range of <b>heel</b> <b>angles,</b> beyond which the centre of buoyancy does not move enough to provide a positive righting moment, and the object becomes unstable. It is possible to shift from positive to negative or vice versa more than once during a heeling disturbance, and many shapes are stable in more than one position.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} girth {{measurements}}, all measurements were basically point measurements. This {{meant that the}} hull was often locally distorted to maximise or minimise a measurement locally, with minimal effect to the surrounding hull. This gave a characteristic bumped look to many boats, particularly {{at the point of}} maximum beam and in the stern. Also, as stability was only measured at very low <b>heel</b> <b>angles</b> (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing <b>angles</b> of <b>heel.</b> Interestingly, low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer.|$|R
40|$|Different {{numerical}} {{methods have}} been applied to the evaluation of slamming loads on a typical ship bow section, for which experimental data of drop tests has been made available within MARSTRUCT thematic network. Experimental data cover different drop cases, with variable speed and different <b>heel</b> <b>angles.</b> Numerical techniques adopted are a commercial CFD VOF program and Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics Method (SPH) currently under development at DINAV; results from both methods are presented and compared with available experimental data, allowing to make an assessment of these different techniques and to stress their relative merits and shortcomings. Regarding SPH, most of calculations are performed using a conventional treatment of boundaries with repulsive forces, while a few tests have been performed with a novel boundary treatment which adopts variable smoothing length ghost particles (VSLGP), with promising results in terms of computational efficiency...|$|R
