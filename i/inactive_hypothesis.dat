40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The Ca 2 + pump or Ca 2 +-ATPase {{of cardiac}} sarcoplasmic reticulum, SERCA 2 a, is {{regulated}} by phospholamban (PLB), a small inhibitory phosphoprotein that decreases the apparent Ca 2 + affinity of the enzyme. We propose that PLB decreases Ca 2 + affinity by stabilizing the Ca 2 +-free, E 2 ·ATP {{state of the}} enzyme, thus blocking the transition to E 1, the high Ca 2 + affinity state required for Ca 2 + binding and ATP hydrolysis. The purpose of this dissertation research is to critically evaluate this idea using series of cross-linkable PLB mutants of increasing inhibitory strength (N 30 C-PLB < PLB 3 < PLB 4). Three hypotheses were tested; each specifically designed to address a fundamental point in the mechanism of PLB action. 	Hypothesis 1 : SERCA 2 a with PLB bound is catalytically inactive. The catalytic activity of SERCA 2 a irreversibly cross-linked to PLB (PLB/SER) was assessed. Ca 2 +-ATPase activity, and formation of the phosphorylated intermediates were all completely inhibited. Thus, PLB/SER is entirely catalytically <b>inactive.</b> 	<b>Hypothesis</b> 2 : PLB decreases the Ca 2 + affinity of SERCA 2 a by competing with Ca 2 + for binding to SERCA 2 a. The functional effects of N 30 C-PLB, PLB 3, and PLB 4 on Ca 2 +-ATPase activity and phosphoenzyme formation were measured, and correlated with their binding interactions with SERCA 2 a measured by chemical cross-linking. Successively higher Ca 2 + concentrations were required to both activate the enzyme co-expressed with N 30 C-PLB, PLB 3, and PLB 4 and to dissociate N 30 C-PLB, PLB 3, and PLB 4 from SERCA 2 a, suggesting competition between PLB and Ca 2 + for binding to SERCA 2 a. This was confirmed with the Ca 2 + pump mutant, D 351 A, which is catalytically inactive but retains strong Ca 2 + binding. Increasingly higher Ca 2 + concentrations were also required to dissociate N 30 C-PLB, PLB 3, and PLB 4 from D 351 A, demonstrating directly that PLB competes with Ca 2 + for binding to the Ca 2 + pump. 	Hypothesis 3 : PLB binds exclusively to the Ca 2 +-free E 2 state with bound nucleotide (E 2 ·ATP). Thapsigargin, vanadate, and nucleotide effects on PLB cross-linking to SERCA 2 a were determined. All three PLB mutants bound preferentially to E 2 state with bound nucleotide (E 2 ·ATP), {{and not at all}} to the thapsigargin or vanadate bound states. 	We conclude that PLB inhibits SERCA 2 a activity by stabilizing a unique E 2 ·ATP conformation that cannot bind Ca 2 +...|$|E

50|$|First {{published}} in 1989 Stochastic diffusion search (SDS) {{was the first}} Swarm Intelligence metaheuristic. SDS is an agent-based probabilistic global search and optimization technique best suited to problems where the objective function can be decomposed into multiple independent partial-functions. Each agent maintains a hypothesis which is iteratively tested by evaluating a randomly selected partial objective function parameterised by the agent's current hypothesis. In the standard version of SDS such partial function evaluations are binary, resulting in each agent becoming active or <b>inactive.</b> Information on <b>hypotheses</b> is diffused across the population via inter-agent communication. Unlike the stigmergic communication used in ACO, in SDS agents communicate hypotheses via a one-to-one communication strategy analogous to the tandem running procedure observed in Leptothorax acervorum. A positive feedback mechanism ensures that, over time, a population of agents stabilise around the global-best solution. SDS is both an efficient and robust global search and optimisation algorithm, which has been extensively mathematically described. Recent work has involved merging the global search properties of SDS with other swarm intelligence algorithms.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} an {{incidence}} of mental stress of college students. The thesis {{is not only}} focused on the present, {{but also on the}} degree of mental stress and the factors that affect the degree of stress. The first objective is to analyse the incidence and impact of mental stress at students of the faculty. A partial objective is to describe the relation of physical activity and mental load, as many authors state that physically active individuals are mentally more resistant. Furthermore, to determine how many students suffer from a particular degree of depression and whether students sought professional help. The practical part deals with the analysis of individual questions from the questionnaire, which are graphically presented in the form of graphs. In this section it is also stated the evaluation of standardized part of the questionnaire, the division of students into groups according to the SDS index and evaluation of hypotheses using statistical processing by method of multiple regression analysis by using the freely available Gretl program. For the purposes of the research two hypotheses were formulated: H 1 : Mental stress is present at the first-year students of bachelor's degree. H 2 : The degree of mental load varies among physically active and <b>inactive</b> students. These <b>hypotheses</b> were statistically evaluated using multiple regression analysis in freely available Gretl program and according to the results they were confirmed or disproved. The results of this thesis can be used for the needs of the faculty, which can obtain a comprehensive view on the impact of the faculty environment on the students' mental status. Studying at university is not only an instrument to gain professional knowledge and qualification in the field of study, but also the social environment where you can get a lot of contacts...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study dealing with active and {{inactive}} L. D. S. couples and their comparative Marital adjustment. The couples were selected from the geographic areas of Enterprise and Logan, Utah, and Preston, Idaho. Respondents consisted of couples who {{had at least one}} child, but no children beyond high school age. Their religiosity was determined by the bishop of the L. D. S. Ward of which they were a member. The bishop considered such factors as attendance at regularly scheduled church meetings and contributions made in the form of tithes in determining whether a couple was considered active or inactive. The sample consisted of 40 active couples and 20 <b>inactive</b> couples. <b>Hypotheses</b> tested in this study were (1) L. D. S. couples who are active in church activities have a higher degree of marital adjustment than those couples who are inactive. (2) L. D. S. couples who are active will rate their marriages as happier on the continuum scale of happiness than will couples who are inactive. (3) Church activity of the part of both husband and wife contributes to the rapport and marital success of the couple. (4) Couples who are least active will be less likely to participate in the study; therefore their marriage adjustment may not be discovered. In testing the hypotheses subjects were given a modified marital adjustment inventory used by Locke, plus questions pertaining to church activity and a set of background questions. The questionnaires were given directly to the subjects by the investigator or were sent by mail to subjects with a letter of instructions. Findings of this study appeared to indicate that active couples had a better marital adjustment. Adjustment scores for active couples ranged from a low of 71 to a high of 123 with an arithmetic mean of 107. 80. Adjustment scores for inactive couples ranged from a low of 60 to a high of 121 with an arithmetic mean of 99. 15. A 2 ̆ 2 t 2 ̆ 2 ratio of 3. 86 was obtained, which is significant at the level of. 01 level of significance. It is to be noted that when adjustment scores of active husbands were compared with inactive, the difference was not so significant. It only approached significance at the. 05 level of significance; still active husbands had somewhat higher adjustment scores the arithmetic mean of active husbands was 108. 45 compared with 100. 95 which was the arithmetic mean for inactive husbands. The difference between active and inactive wives was more significant. Active wives had an arithmetic mean of 107. 15 as compared with 97. 35 for the inactive. This difference approached significance at the. 01 level of significance. A conclusion of the study is, church activity appears to be a factor contributing to the happiness of the couples and to the adjustments of their marriages...|$|R

The α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated pressor responses elicited by B-HT 920, TL- 99, DP- 6, 7 -ADTN, and B-HT 958 were potentiated by Bay k 8644, reflected by a leftward shift {{and an increase in}} the maximum of the log dose-pressor response curves. The α 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated effects elicited by cirazoline, methoxamine, (-) -amidephrine, St 587, (-) -phenylephrine and Sgd 101 / 75 were less enhanced by Bay k 8644. Only a leftward shift of the dose-response curves was observed, which was most pronounced for (-) -phenylephrine and Sgd 101 / 75. The α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated pressor components of (-) -noradrenaline were similarly distinguished by Bay k 8644 as observed for the selective α 1 - or α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists. Effects of Bay k 8644 on the increase in diastolic pressure mediated by B-HT 920, St 587 and cirazoline were also studied after pretreatment with the calcium entry blocker nifedipine. After additional pretreatment with nifedipine the potentiation by Bay k 8644 observed for B-HT 920 and St 587 was more pronounced. The presence of nifedipine had no effect on the interaction between Bay k 8644 and cirazoline. It is concluded that Bay k 8644 behaves as a mirror image of nifedipine. The observation that Bay k 8644 enhances α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated pressor effects more effectively than - α 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated increases in diastolic pressure is in accordance with the hypothesis of the more pronounced calcium dependency of α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated pressor responses. The data obtained for St 587 and (-) -phenylephrine are in apparent contradiction to the finding that the pressor responses to the former drug are more markedly inhibited by calcium entry blockade than those of the latter. It is suggested that St 587 employs calcium channels which are already maximally modulated and that (-) -phenylephrine makes use of calcium channels which are in a rather <b>inactive</b> state. The <b>hypothesis</b> is put forward that the intrinsic activity of α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists reflects their ability to bring calcium channels in an active state...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} {{that women are more}} likely to make {{positive}} lifestyle changes, such as exercise, during pregnancy. Women, with healthy, low-risk pregnancies, free from complications, can participate in exercise throughout pregnancy based on guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and the American Heart Association (AHA). Maternal exercise has been shown to benefit pregnant women and their children. Previous research on women that are active prior to pregnancy demonstrates exercise during pregnancy is associated with improved heart health measures, evidenced by lower HR and increased ejection fraction, in infants. However, we do not know if these benefits occur for children from women that were inactive before pregnancy. This study will address this gap by determining if heart function of infants is improved in unfit women that begin exercising during pregnancy. We hypothesize that one-month old infants of unfit women who exercise during pregnancy will have higher stroke volume, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction, lower heart rate and similar cardiac output compared to one-month old infants of unfit women that did not exercise while pregnant (controls). To test this <b>hypothesis,</b> <b>inactive</b> pregnant participants were randomized into either exercise or control group. Women in the exercise group participated in moderate intensity exercise for 50 minutes, 3 times per week from 16 weeks pregnancy until delivery; non-exercisers received no exercise intervention. After delivery, a standard (blinded) echocardiographic recording was performed on all one-month infants. Infants were classified as active or quiet activity state by a pediatric cardiologist blinded to group randomization. Data was analyzed using multiple t-test, with an alpha level set a priori at p < 0. 05. Statview software was used to complete the analyses. Current findings show lower heart rate (HR) of infants from unfit women that exercised during pregnancy compared to one-month infants of unfit controls (p= 0. 06). Infants of unfit exercisers also have trends of increased stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and fractional shortening in the quiet state. Cardiac output is similar in the exercise and control groups. Our current findings suggest that exercise during pregnancy, regardless of activity prior to pregnancy, may provide similar heart benefits as children of women previously healthy and trained prior to pregnancy. Ultimately, this study is the first step to begin to demonstrate that exercise during pregnancy, regardless of the mother’s prior activity levels, is the earliest intervention to decrease heart disease risk. This research is pivotal in encouraging all women, regardless of previous activity level, to begin exercise during pregnancy in order to improve the heart health for their child...|$|R
