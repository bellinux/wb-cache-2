40|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{pulmonary edema}} (NPPE) immediately after general anesthesia {{is a rare}} yet life threatening complication. It is caused by an increased fluid in the interstitial spaces and alveoli due to forced inspiratory efforts against tightly closed glottis and was described since 1977. The resulting pulmonary edema can appear {{within a few minutes}} after airway obstruction or in a deferred way after several hours, but rarely have frank pulmonary hemorrhage such as in this case. The clinical manifestations are potentially serious, but normally respond well to treatment with supplemental oxygen, positive pressure mechanical ventilation and diuretics.

50|$|Using a {{combination}} of imaging technologies, Aspelund's group found that meningeal lymphatic vessels drain down (and eventually out of) the skull along the dural venous sinuses and meningeal arteries. Meningeal lymphatic vessels also drained out of the skull alongside cranial nerves and through the cribriform plate. Molecular profiling indicated that the vessels are by all standards conventional lymphatic vessels: they express high levels of PROX1, LYVE1, PDPN and VEGFR3, but low levels of PECAM1.

40|$|Abstract. Indirect {{computed}} tomography lymphography (CT-LG) {{could be used}} to determine the regional spread of cancer and assess lymphatic function by the interstitial delivery of diagnostic agents. Few studies have been reported on its use in pyriform sinus carcinoma. The aim {{of the present study was}} to establish the rabbit VX 2 tumor as a model for pyriform sinus carcinoma and to observe its neck <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis by indirect CT-LG. VX 2 tumor tissue suspension was transplanted into the pyriform sinus submucosa of 15 rabbits under direct laryngoscope. Rabbits were randomly placed into one of three groups, each comprised of five rabbits. Observation of the tumor growth and neck <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases were taken on days 14 (group 1), 21 (group 2) and 28 (group 3) following transplanta-tion using the method of indirect CT-LG. VX 2 tumors were transplanted successfully in all rabbits. <b>Deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were enhanced clearly in indirect CT-LG. The contrast agent filling defected appeared on the metastasis <b>nodes</b> while the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> without metastasis was smooth. The metastasis rates of <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were 100 % in all three groups on CT-LG. The CT attenuation value of CT-LG reached peak values of 400 and 600 Hu at 1 and 3 min after the injec-tion, which then decreased gradually. In this study, CT-LG could demonstrate the internal architecture of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and their lymphatic vessels, and therefore may have the advantages of radiological methods such as B ultrasound, CT, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography...|$|R

The US and CT scans revealed lymphadenopathy in the right upper <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The patient was cytologically diagnosed with the parathyroid carcinoma. Then, right modified neck dissection was performed 9  months after the operation. Given that prophylactic irradiation therapy has a low evidence level {{and has not been}} established, we suggested the patient undergo radiation therapy, but he refused.

40|$|In {{patients}} with {{head and neck}} malignancy, knowledge of the lymphatic pathways relevant to tumor location is important for treatment preparation, both in radiation therapy and in surgery.

The <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> mainly placed along the jugulo carotid vessels, have been intensively reviewed in radiology and classified by well-established levels. The more superficial groups, notably the occipital, parotid, mastoid, facial and superficial <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> groups were not well recognized in the radiology literature, probably because of their less frequent involvement in the more predominant pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosal malignancy, and seem to have been forgotten.

40|$|The prototypic migratory {{trail of}} tissue-resident {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) is via lymphatic drainage. Since {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) lacks classical lymphatic vessels, and antigens and cells injected into both the CNS and cerebrospinal fluid have been found in <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> it was thought that CNS-derived DCs exclusively used the cerebrospinal fluid pathway to exit from tissues. It has become evident, however, that DCs found in peripheral organs can also leave tissues via the blood stream. To study whether DCs derived from microglia and bone marrow can also use this route of emigration from the CNS, we performed a series of experiments in which we injected genetically labeled DCs into the striata of rats. We show here that these cells migrated from the injection site to the perivascular space, integrated into the endothelial lining of the CNS vasculature, and were then present in the lumen of CNS blood vessels days after the injection. Moreover, we also found these cells in both mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and spleens. Hence, microglia- and bone marrow-derived DCs can leave the CNS via the blood stream...|$|R

40|$|During tumor {{progression}} {{a strong}} immunosuppression is developed and {{is believed to}} be the major reason why immunotherapy fails. This suppression is induced in response to factors produced from tumor cells, but can also be induced after immunotherapy. NO has been shown to play a major role in this suppression both in patients with gliomas and colon carcinomas. The aim of this thesis is to clarify the role of the NO mediated immunosuppression in rats with intra-hepatic colon carcinomas and intra-cerebral gliomas, and to clarify whether inhibition of NO inducing enzyme, iNOS, would diminish this suppression and improve the anti-tumor immunotherapy. In study I-IV we investigated both unspecific and specific iNOS inhibitors, and we could show that the specific iNOS inhibitors were superior in enhancing immune responses, including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, as well as nitrite reduction. The specific iNOS inhibitor mercaptoethylguanidine, MEG, was the most effective inhibitor. MEG in combination with IFN-? based immunotherapy prolonged the survival and increased the cure rate three fold of rats with intra-cerebral gliomas. Interestingly, the inhibition of NO by MEG was time dependent, and the prolonged survival was achieved only when MEG was administered after more than one immunization. The prolonged survival seemed to be dependent on enhanced local and systemic immune responses. MEG treatment significantly increased the lymphocyte numbers both in the spleen and in the tumor draining <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (the <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes).</b> In the <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> MEG treatment increased CD 4 + T cells but not the B cells, suggesting a skewing toward a Th 1 immunity, which is important during tumor eradication. Furthermore, MEG treatment decreased the auto-reactive and the suppressive CD 8 +CD 25 + T cells. In the colon carcinoma model, we showed that additional suppressive mechanism exists, which is mediated by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). The inhibition of both NOS and COX increased immune responses six times as compared to inhibition of each enzyme alone. Finally, treatment with MEG in combination IL- 18 /IFN-? reduced tumor volume by 50 % in rats with colon carcinomas. MEG has been shown to inhibit production of both iNOS and COX, which might explain its superior effects compared to the other NOS inhibitors. Thus we have been able to show that immunotherapy using tumor cells genetically modified to produce cytokines could be used to eradicate established tumors, however, only when combined with therapies that minimize the immune suppression developed during tumor progression...|$|R
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) is a monoclonal disorder, {{characterized by a}} progressive proliferation of functionally incompetent B lymphocytes. There is increased evidence of association between CLL and skin cancers, including the uncommon Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Case presentation A case report of an 84 -year old male, who presented with an aggressively recurrent form of MCC on the lower lip, on the background of an 8 -year history of untreated CLL. During the recurrences of MCC, coexisting regional lymphadenopathy, posed {{a problem in the}} differential diagnosis and treatment of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement. Histopathology and immunoistochemistry showed that submandibular lymphadenopathy coexisting with the second recurrence of MCC, was due to B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma. The subsequent and more aggressive recurrence of the skin tumor had involved the superficial and <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Surgical excision followed by involved field radiation therapy has been proven effective for both malignancies. Conclusion MCC has a high incidence of regional lymphadenopathy at presentation (12 – 45 %) and even when it arises on the background of chronic leucemia, lymphadenopathy at presentation should be managed agressively with elective <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection.

40|$|Both {{physiological}} and non-physiological {{studies have demonstrated}} the existence of CSF-drainage from the subarachnoid space into the <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the rat. In this study, we describe the distribution of red blood cells and their degradation by macrophages (erythrophages and siderophages) in <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{in relation to the}} survival time after ?Controlled Cortical Impact Injury?(CCII). <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were taken bilaterally from submandibular, <b>deep</b> <b>cervical,</b> lumbar paraaortic, inguinofemoral and popliteal sites in 38 Sprague-Dawley rats after CCII. Furthermore, the olfactory tract and the brainstem were dissected to examine the pathways of red blood cells within the subarachnoid space. Erythrophagocytosis and siderophagocytosis were visualized by hematoxylin & eosin, Goldner?s trichrome and Prussian blue reaction. Additionally, macrophages were immunohistochemically characterized by monoclonal ED 1 antibody. To distinguish <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sinus from <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> vessels, immunohistochemistry for cytoskeletal proteins was used. Red blood cells are visible in the marginal sinus of the <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (consisting of superficial and deep nodes) as soon as 10 min after brain injury. After 16 h, the lumbar paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> showed the presence of red blood cells, too. Only one hour after appearance, erythrocytes had attached to macrophages in cervical and lumbar sites. Ingestion and digestion were seen immediately and until the third day post trauma. Then siderophages and iron pigment appeared in the medullar sinus. Adjacent to the olfactory tract {{as well as to the}} brainstem, erythrocytes were identified in the subarachnoid space. The time intervals concerning the presence of erythrocytes in the draining <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are identical to those discussed in other studies. This fact confirms the assumption that these red blood cells originate from traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage at the brain injury site. The drainage of subarachnoid hemorrhage into cervical and lumbar paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was demonstrated in this pathophysiological model of experimental trauma. </body...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} made to {{determine}} the main route by which radio-iodinated albumin reaches <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> from cerebrospinal fluid (c. s. f.) in the anaesthetized rabbit. Other factors, influencing drainage through this pathway, have been investigated. After single injection of [125 I]albumin into a lateral ventricle of control rabbits, a mean of 14. 8 % of the radioactivity lost from brain-c. s. f. was recovered during 6 hr in the lymph of the cannulated jugular trunk of one side. Injection of kaolin into the olfactory fossa or sealing of the cribriform plate with cyanoacrylate glue reduced the recovery of [125 I]albumin to 3. 3 % and 1. 9 % respectively at 2 - 3 weeks after the procedure designed to block the cribriform plate. This confirms the traditional view that the major connexions between c. s. f. and <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> is via prolongations of subarachnoid space around the olfactory nerves, leading into the interstitial spaces of the nasal submucosa. The dense lymphatic plexus in this tissue is known to drain into the retropharyngeal (<b>deep</b> <b>cervical)</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Constant infusion of artificial c. s. f. into a lateral ventricle at 10 microliters/min or 30 microliters/min, in order to approximately double or quadruple flow through the system respectively, decreased the recovery of intraventricular [125 I]albumin to 8. 1 % and 6. 9 % respectively. It also appeared that the increased c. s. f. pressures induced forced relatively more radioactivity from inside the skull into the c. s. f. spaces of the spinal cord. Maintaining the rabbit prone but at 20 degrees from the horizontal caused recoveries of [125 I]albumin in lymph of 17. 6 % (head-up position and 6. 6 % (head-down). The amounts of radioactivity in nose and spinal cord markedly increased and decreased respectively in the head-down position. They changed in the opposite directions in the head-up position. The amounts of [51 Cr]EDTA, [125 I]metrizamide and [14 C]inulin in <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> were negligible after intraventricular injection. Estimations of the ratio of [51 Cr]EDTA/[125 I]albumin in various tissues on the pathway into lymph, together with measurements of arterio-venous fluxes across the retropharyngeal nodes, indicate that [51 Cr]EDTA passed from c. s. f. /lymph into blood within both the nose and the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R
