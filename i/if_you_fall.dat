500|$|On April 1, 2005, the {{official}} Tool website announced, as an April Fools' Day prank, that [...] "Maynard has found Jesus" [...] {{and would be}} abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently. Kurt Loder of MTV contacted Keenan via email {{to ask for a}} confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation. When Loder asked again, Keenan's response was simply [...] "heh heh". On April 7, {{the official}} site revealed that it was a hoax. During an interview Keenan later stated, [...] "It was April Fools'. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> for that on April Fools' Day, there's nothing I can do for you." [...] He has been part of other April Fools' pranks related to Tool, including one in which he was said to be in critical condition after a tour bus accident.|$|E

2500|$|Satan says, “All {{these things}} I {{will give you}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> down and do an act of worship to me.” Jesus replies [...] "Get away, Satan! It is written: 'The Lord, your God, shall you worship and him alone shall you serve.'" [...] (referencing Deuteronomy 10:20). Readers are {{intended}} to recognize that although Satan and God's power could ultimately achieve similar things, it {{is the source of}} Satan's power that drives Jesus from sin.|$|E

50|$|Here {{lies the}} poet Hipponax. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are a scoundrel, do not {{approach}} the tomb; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are honest and from worthy stock, {{sit down in}} confidence and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like, <b>fall</b> asleep.|$|R

60|$|P. S. General Pope thinks <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> back {{it would}} be much better towards York River than towards the James. As Pope now has charge of the capital, please confer with him through the telegraph.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot doubt it, David. You {{have done}} great things for Israel; {{no one in}} these latter days has risen like <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>fallen,</b> <b>you</b> were young, and strangely tempted.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>if</b> ever <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> {{into any}} need or trouble,' said the elder, 'call me thrice, and I {{will come and}} help you; only you must not call me until {{you are in the}} utmost need.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must hold}} {{it to the}} last, Hepburn, and then, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, <b>fall</b> back to Wurtzburg; even a day's delay will enable me to call {{in some of the}} {{detachments}} and to prepare to receive Tilly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> in, I {{will pull}} you out. Young maids should not run {{about the country}} without a gentleman {{to take care of}} them. Should they, sister?" [...] cried the doughty seven years' old champion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it’s this way," [...] {{said the}} mate, coughing; [...] "they’ve sent you to sea {{to get you}} out of this fellow’s way, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> in love with {{somebody}} on the ship they’ll send you home again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, mother, {{you hear}} what he says,' she interposed, in her stern voice, and with an {{impatient}} action of her head; 'try him once more, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> out with him again, ruin him, if you like, and have done with him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, Fred; {{there you}} tax me too far. What {{might have come}} of my heart <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hadn't <b>fallen</b> in my way, who can say? I love Will Belton dearly, and hope that you may do so--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Carley," [...] he replied, laughing. [...] "What do {{you want}} to do? The day is at your disposal. I wish it were June. Then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>fall</b> in love with West Fork you'd be no good." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Here I {{will stay}} {{and watch for}} you, lord Macumazana," [...] he answered, [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> into a snare, am I able to swim through the water like a fish, or to fly through {{the air like a}} bird to free you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I'm off to Baden. Come {{and join}} me, then you'll {{be out of}} harm's way; [...] for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> in love with J.M. (and you can't escape if you stay [...] where she is), you will incur the trifling {{inconvenience}} of having [...] your brains blown out by ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1.

6000|$|... "Nay, {{you shall}} {{not go on}} your feet, my child," [...] said Mother Brown-Breast; [...] "your friend Golden-Wing shall carry you. Call him hither, that I may seat <b>you</b> rightly, for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>fall</b> off my heart would break." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was like}} you. But we'll go in. This is our secret, Jim. Nobody would believe <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> let <b>fall</b> a hint {{as to what}} really happened, {{and there are many}} reasons why you shouldn't. I think you said nobody else could have suspected?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Run fast," [...] {{said the}} Scarecrow to the Lion, [...] "and {{get out of}} this deadly flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>fall</b> asleep <b>you</b> are too big to be carried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it. But remember, our quarrel commences here. If I fall by your hand, {{you shall}} {{not use it}} to clear her character: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> by mine, you shall not be called a martyr. I am sorry {{it has come to}} this; but amen, the sooner now, the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, master, that {{it would}} be well for you to leave your armour behind you.

6000|$|... "That's nothing," [...] {{came the}} answer. [...] "Wait till {{you hit the}} Canyon. You'll have to cross a raging torrent on a sixty-foot pine-tree. No guide-ropes, nothing, and the water boiling at the sag of the log to your knees. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> with a pack on your back, there's no {{getting out of the}} straps. You just stay there and drown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} {{continue}} the hunt, while I go home. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> should <b>fall</b> in with 'em tell Henry how matters stand. But, Mr. Risley, let me caution you not to be rash, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> catch sight of Mrs. Risley {{in the hands of}} the redskins. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> give them the chance they'll burn you at the stake--and it won't help her a bit either." ...|$|R

"Good-morning, Sir Gervaise," [...] {{called out}} this noble captain; [...] "I'm {{glad to see}} you looking so well, after our long cruise in the Bay; I {{intended}} to have the honour to inquire after your health in person, this morning, but they told me you slept out of your ship.

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "You {{may play}} about {{wherever}} you are sure it is safe.

6000|$|... "All {{that is true}} enough, but I've a notion, notwithstanding.

6000|$|... "All kinds," [...] {{answered}} Jerry, nonchalantly {{scratching his}} stubby beard. [...] "There's {{an army of}} I.W.W.'s comin' in from eastward.

60|$|MAGGIE. John, I {{make you}} a solemn promise that, in {{consideration}} of the circumstances of our marriage, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should ever <b>fall</b> in love I'll act differently from other wives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] said Martin. [...] "I {{have always}} known you hasty, wild, and inconsiderate, rude, and prompt {{to speak at the}} volley and without reflection; but now, methinks, your bearing, without losing its natural fire, has {{something}} in it of force and dignity which it had not before.
