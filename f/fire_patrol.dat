Early functions of the Bureau included the Fire Prevention Parade and a contest to select Miss Flame, a beauty queen to reign over the weeks activities.

The Fire Prevention Parade was held the first Monday in October, and a tradition that is carried on today since the fifties.

50|$|The Ministry's {{entrance}} into the field of aviation started with hiring Laurentide Air Services to carry out <b>fire</b> <b>patrols</b> however the government soon realized it could save money by carrying out the operations itself and formed the Ontario Provincial Air Service, (O.P.A.S.) in February 1924 with 13 second hand Curtiss HS-2L flying boats that had been originally built for the US Navy. The OPAS was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} aircraft for the discovery and extinguishing of forest fires. Initially this involved carrying warnings of fires back to existing <b>fire</b> <b>patrols,</b> to be extinguished by teams that travelled by canoe or overland but soon they began landing firefighters (never more than a few at a time due to the limited carrying capacity of the aircraft available) with a hand operated water pump near a fire. As a part of this program the OPAS completely rebuilt damaged aircraft before they began building a number of aircraft under license to meet their requirements such as the Buhl Air Sedan, and later provided considerable input {{on the development of the}} de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter and finally were central to the invention of the water bomber. The first water bomber was an OPAS DHC Beaver with a tank mounted on the float designed to dump the water out quickly. This had followed unsuccessful experiments with bags of water.|$|R

The Americans were surprised that the Viet Cong did not attack this base to try to hinder their artillery fire.|$|R
