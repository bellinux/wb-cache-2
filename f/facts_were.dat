25|$|In the 15 page {{statement}} of facts {{filed by the}} government along with the plea agreement, the government stated that Petraeus had provided Broadwell access to documents containing Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information, had later moved those documents to his personal residence and stored them in an unsecured drawer, and had deliberately and intentionally lied to Federal investigators about both providing Broadwell access to the documents and their improper storage.

25|$|During the Nazi German {{occupation}} {{many citizens}} of German descent in Poland {{registered with the}} Deutsche Volksliste.

These <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> later used by the Allied politicians as one of the justifications for expulsion of the Germans. The contemporary position of the German government is that, while the Nazi-era war crimes resulted in the expulsion of the Germans, the deaths due to the expulsions were an injustice.|$|E

25|$|After the Moch–Marshall {{meeting of}} September 23, 1950, in Washington, the United States started {{to support the}} French Union effort politically, logistically and financially. Officially, US {{involvement}} did not include use of armed force.

Two US pilots were killed in action during the siege at Dien Bien Phu the following year.

25|$|However, the cartographic {{evidence}} of before 1996 is so mixed {{that the only}} safe conclusion one can draw from it is that neither of the two governments ever bothered to enforce a consistent representation of whatever legal opinions they held with respect to these islands, {{in the work of}} their cartographic state agencies. It {{should also be noted that}} several of the maps cited as evidence by the two governments displayed confusion over what the geographic <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> in the first place (displaying some islets in the wrong places, confusing the names of some islands, or even displaying islands that do not exist).|$|E

25|$|He reigned about 14 years (130–116 BC). He was a {{child at}} his succession, {{and for this reason}} the power was kept by his mother who acted as his regent. At some point her mother seems to have {{poisoned}} all of Ariarathes’ five brothers; but the infant king was saved by people loyal to the dynasty and had Nysa killed. These <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> a good pretext for his maternal uncle King Mithridates V Euergetes of Pontus (150 BC–120 BC), for trying to assert control over the country. For this he married Ariarathes to his maternal cousin Laodice of Cappadocia, his first daughter. Laodice bore Ariarathes one daughter and two sons: Nysa who married King Nicomedes III Euergetes of Bithynia; Ariarathes VII Philometor and Ariarathes VIII Epiphanes.|$|E
25|$|Other believers {{maintain}} that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances already. They believe more of its science — {{if not all of}} it — will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and found them unconvincing. Some arise because the book {{is said to have been}} written by the revelators by 1935, but then was not published until 1955. Discoveries from science during the two intervening decades can be perceived as prophetic by believers, while skeptics think such <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> added prior to publication. For instance, the catalytic role that carbon plays in the sun's nuclear reactions is described in the book, though Hans Bethe's announcement of the discovery was not made until 1938.|$|E

40|$|Facts {{exist in}} {{a wide array of}} {{varieties}} and they raise a lot of philosophical questions. The relationship between law and <b>fact</b> can <b>be</b> investigated in different perspectives. A statement of <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> any statement in which an event is described as occurred in the domain of the real world. Statements concerning <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> a matter of choice and construction, but above all they can be proven to be true or false. The <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> not meaningful in itself, but only when it is bound up with a set of concepts, epistemological assumptions, linguistic conventions, shared values, general rules of experience, that gives it meaning. We deal with semantic, categorical, social or institutional constructions. Legal reasoning concerns both facts and norms. Their meaning is the result of their entering into a reciprocal correspondence. Reconstruction of facts and interpretation of law cannot be separated. In judicial contexts <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> the point of reference of a procedural machinery concerning evidence. Such <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> selected, determined and verified according to their relevancy in the case. A statement describing a <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> true when and insofar as it has been confirmed by the evidence presented to the court...|$|R
25|$|While Russell wrote a {{great deal}} on ethical subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to {{philosophy}} or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> objective, but known only through intuition; that they were simple properties of objects, not equivalent (e.g., pleasure is good) to the natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see Naturalistic fallacy); and that these simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analysed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to agree with his philosophical hero, David Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with subjective values that cannot be verified {{in the same way as}} matters of fact.|$|E
25|$|The general {{disorganization}} of {{law enforcement}} in the state convinced {{the members of the}} Legislature that a thorough revision of the public security system was in order, and with that purpose it hired the services of a consulting firm from Chicago. The resulting report yielded many worrying conclusions, but the basic underlying <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> simple: the criminality levels in Texas were extremely high, and the state's means to fight them were underfunded, undermanned, loose, disorganized and obsolete. The consultants' recommendation, besides increasing funding, was to introduce a whole reorganization of state security agencies; especially, to merge the Rangers with the Texas Highway Patrol under a new agency called the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). After deliberating, the Legislature agreed with the suggestion. The resolution that created the new state law enforcement agency was passed in 1935, and with an initial budget of $450,000, the DPS became operational on August 10.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} claimed that special {{relativity}} cannot handle acceleration, which {{would lead to}} contradictions in some situations. However, this assessment is not correct, since acceleration actually {{can be described in}} the framework of special relativity (see Acceleration (special relativity), Proper reference frame (flat spacetime), Hyperbolic motion, Rindler coordinates, Born coordinates). Paradoxes relying on insufficient understanding of these <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> discovered {{in the early years of}} relativity. For example, Max Born (1909) tried to combine the concept of rigid bodies with special relativity. That this model was insufficient was shown by Paul Ehrenfest (1909), who demonstrated that a rotating rigid body would, according to Born's definition, undergo a contraction of the circumference without contraction of the radius, which is impossible (Ehrenfest paradox). Max von Laue (1911) showed that rigid bodies cannot exist in special relativity, since the propagation of signals cannot exceed the speed of light, so an accelerating and rotating body will undergo deformations.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{against the}} strong theory {{and for the}} weak theory, Searle insists, [...] "it could not be the case, as some have maintained, that all <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> {{institutional}} social <b>facts,</b> that there <b>are</b> no brute <b>facts,</b> because the structure of institutional facts reveals that they are logically dependent on brute facts. To suppose that all <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> institutional social would produce an infinite regress or circularity {{in the account of}} institutional facts. In order that some <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> institutional, there must <b>be</b> other <b>facts</b> that <b>are</b> brute physical, biological, natural. This is the consequence of the logical structure of institutional facts.".|$|R

25|$|Though all the {{communities}} had had partial success with gaining interest from African-Americans none {{had had to}} deal strongly with opposition in such matters {{and none of them}} had made a point of focusing on it as a priority. A national policy among Bahá'ís had started to form from work of Gregory meeting with Bahá'ís at Fisk University in 1934, a spiritual assembly in Nashville was elected in 1935, and a regional conference was proposed in 1936 to include a visit from the National Assembly. The development encountered the question of a high-profile series of integrated meetings. Indeed, one of the hotel's hosting one of the six resulting meetings objected and the Bahá'ís appeared to relent. W. E. B. DuBois noticed and initially was misinformed {{of the nature of the}} resolution to which then secretary of the national assembly Horace Holley responded that the <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> not as DuBois understood them and that it was the hotel that had relented at the last minute - however a policy had been stated that, short of out of control reactions, integrated meetings should be held but in the case of over-reactions segregated meetings could be held with a longer term goal of fully integrated ones theoretically. But in this case the situation was avoided by the change in judgement of the hotel. All of the shifting options became mute when in 1938 a final policy was voiced - published under the title Advent of Divine Justice by Shoghi Effendi with a frank and prolonged discussion of the problem of race prejudice underscoring the short-term requirement and long term goal of complete integration and freedom from racial prejudice. All meetings were to be integrated and individuals to seek to adjust their habits in the matter. In addition, a matter of policy began that in tie votes in elections minorities were to be automatically given approval of the position. One result was the formation of a Race Unity Committee in 1940 with Louis Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a White descendent of abolitionists. A situation in the Atlanta Bahá'í community was resolved with integration even to the point of letting White people leave the religion if they couldn't accept the standard. Correspondence among South Carolinian communities buzzed with the development.|$|E

50|$|Mental facts {{include such}} things as perceptions, feelings, and judgments.

40|$|What is {{the ontological}} status of facts? Are facts {{linguistic}} or extra-linguistic entities?
