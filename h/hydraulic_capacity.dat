40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental TechnologyBiological {{wastewater}} treatment {{is often used}} in conjunction with primary treatment to reduce the constituents in wastewater. It is normally necessary to separate the biomass from the treated wastewater {{in order to meet the}} effluent discharge standards. Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) is a biofilm process where plastic carriers carrying the biomass are moving along with the wastewater and typically operating with low concentration of suspended solids in pure biofilm systems. Salsnes Filters AS (SF) is a Norwegian company specializing in design, manufacturing and supply of patented fine mesh filter machines for treatment of primary wastewater and looking to expand use of their products for the separation of biofilm solids following biofilm processes. This study describes an overall assessment of the performance of SF sieve cloths for separation of biofilm solids with and without pre-flocculation from a Norwegian municipal {{wastewater treatment}} plant, Nordre Follo Renseanlegg. The particles in the reactor effluents were characterized with a Malvern Mastersizer and with SF sieves for particle size distribution (PSD). Preliminary jar test trials were performed in order to obtain an optimal dosage of flocculant, mixing and flocculation conditions for subsequent pilot scale testing. The efficiency of two flocculants (cationic polymer based flocculant Superfloc C 496 and polyaluminium hydroxide based flocculant, PAX XL- 60) was evaluated at pilot scale flocculation. 10 different SF sieve cloth with light opening ranging from 11 μm to 500 μm were tested. The results indicate that PSDs vary according to the organic loading on the individual reactors with higher organic loading resulting in smaller particle volumes and the particle size peaked around 100 μm in diameter. The results also indicate SF sieves can be used for MBBR biofilm solids separation with and without pre-flocculation. SS and COD removal efficiencies of SF sieves cloths for unflocculated reactor effluent increased with increasing HRT, decreased organic loading and decreasing light opening of the sieves. The formation of a mat on the sieve cloth during filtration was found to lead to reduced SS removal for some sieves and the mat were found to be clogged quickly after formation. Higher <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities</b> lead to lower SS removal efficiencies in most cases and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities</b> decreased with decreasing light opening. Flocculation changed the particle size characteristics of the reactor effluent and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities</b> of the sieve cloths. Flocculating with Superfloc C 496 shifted PSD towards larger size range and the SS removal efficiency improved for SF sieves in the larger light opening ranges but resulted in reduced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities.</b> Flocculating with PAX XL- 60 increased the percentage of smaller particle sizes, lowered overall SS removal efficiencies with negative removal in the larger light opening ranges and lowered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities.</b> Online characterization of flocculation enabled the flocculation time during pilot scale flocculation studies to be optimised. It was found that with Superfloc C 496, the minimum flocculation time for the maximum floc size to be achieved is 6 minutes whereas with PAX XL 60, the minimum flocculation time is 9 minutes. Image analysis of the flocs also suggest stirrer design and flocculant have an influence on the shape and structure of the flocs...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} geophysical case studies {{with the aim}} to highlight the possibilities to study and monitor hydrogeological processes in the subsurface, including transport processes in fractured or in porous media. The presentation emphasizes two geoelectrical methods, namely electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) which images the electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface and self-potential (SP) whose measured signal is directly sensitive to groundwater fluxes. The first case study concerns the geophysical identification and characterization of large hydraulically-active fractured areas in calcareous synclines {{and in particular the}} assessment of the joint use of ERT and SP to set up new piezometers in fractured limestone. This assessment shows that piezometers drilled inside less resistive areas and/or in negative SP anomalies presented high <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities.</b> Inversely, piezometers drilled inside more resistive zones and/or outside an SP anomaly presented low <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities.</b> The SP anomaly related to preferential flow in fractures was thus demonstrated for the first time. All these fractures information, obtained with geophysics, improved the conceptualization and calibration of the groundwater flow model of the calcareous valley. A seasonal monitoring of SP signals proved to be a successful methodology to better understand the hydrodynamics of calcareous aquifers and in particular to follow the seasonal drawdown of the water table in the calcareous valley. Different methodologies to delineate the main groundwater flow direction were also tested. The latter can be achieved for example by drawing an SP map showing the main hydraulic gradients or by monitoring a salt tracer test with ERT to highlight preferential flow in fractures. The second case study concerns the ERT monitoring of a shallow geothermal test conducted in a porous medium (sand). The main objective {{of this study was to}} derive temperature from a series of electrical resistivity images since the electrical resistivity is directly sensitive to temperature changes. This field work demonstrates that surface electric resistivity tomography can monitor heat injection and storage experiments in shallow aquifers providing a number of practical applications, such as the monitoring or the design of shallow geothermal systems or the use of heated water to replace salt water in tracer tests. Through these two different case studies, this presentation also emphasizes in a practical way on the importance of data inversion and image appraisal since these issues are crucial to quantitatively study hydrogeological processes...|$|R
40|$|Urban greenspaces {{are highly}} sought after by {{citizens}} for their beauty, recreation, and ecosystem services. These greenspaces {{come at a}} cost, however. The arid conditions of the Snake River Plain can require large volumes of irrigation to grow, especially if plants are not native and/or are not “water-wise”. City planners have {{a good understanding of}} the amount of water which enters (e. g., precipitation and capturing of aquifer water) and leaves (e. g., via sewage treatment plants) an urban watershed, yet little is understood about how much water leaves via plant transpiration and evaporation. Quantifying these plant water-losses is a critical first step in managing water budgets, but such tests rarely occur. To address this knowledge gap we measured the <b>hydraulic</b> transport <b>capacity</b> in waterwise and non-waterwise species in both irrigated and nonirrigated sites in Pocatello. To do this, ring width and conduit density and diameter in cross-sections of branch segments were measured. We hypothesized that non-waterwise plants would have xylem traits characteristic of greater <b>hydraulic</b> transport <b>capacity</b> compared to waterwise plants.

50|$|Compared with ditches, tunnels had the {{important}} advantage {{that the water}} flowing through them underground could not freeze up.

50|$|Sewage {{treatment}} is less effective when sanitary waste is diluted with stormwater, and combined sewer overflows occur when runoff from heavy rainfall or snowmelt exceeds the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacity</b> of sewage treatment plants.

The decision between a {{combined sewer system}} or two separate systems is mainly based on need for sewage treatment and cost of providing treatment during heavy rain events. Many cities with combined sewer systems built prior to installing sewage treatment have not replaced those sewer systems.|$|E

The great divide in maximal ability to exchange CO 2 for water between leaves of nonangiosperms and angiosperms forms the mechanistic foundation for speculation about how angiosperms drove sweeping ecological and biogeochemical change during the Cretaceous. However, there is no empirical evidence that angiosperms evolved highly photosynthetically active leaves during the Cretaceous.

However, the upper limits of DV typical of modern megathermal rainforest trees first appear during a second wave of increased DV during the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition.

40|$|Movement {{of water}} from soil to {{atmosphere}} by plant transpiration can feed precipitation, but {{is limited by the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>capacities</b> of plants, which have not been uniform through time. The flowering plants that dominate modern vegetation possess transpiration capacities that are dramatically higher than any other plants, living or extinct. Transpiration operates {{at the level of the}} leaf, however, and how the impact of this physiological revolution scales up to the landscape and larger environment remains unclear. Here, climate modelling demonstrates that angiosperms help ensure aseasonally high levels of precipitation in the modern tropics. Most strikingly, replacement of angiosperm with non-angiosperm vegetation would result in a hotter, drier and more seasonal Amazon basin, decreasing the overall area of ever-wet rainforest by 80 per cent. Thus, flowering plant ecological dominance has strongly altered climate and the global hydrological cycle. Because tropical biodiversity is closely tied to precipitation and rainforest area, angiosperm climate modification may have promoted diversification of the angiosperms themselves, as well as radiations of diverse vertebrate and invertebrate animal lineages and of epiphytic plants. Their exceptional potential for environmental modification may have contributed to divergent responses to similar climates and global perturbations, like mass extinctions, before and after angiosperm evolution...|$|R
