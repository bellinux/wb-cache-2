40|$|Huanglongbing (HLB) is {{severely}} impacting Florida citrus. Productivity declines in many HLB-affected genotypes, often with greatly thinned canopies. Fruit size and quality are often adversely affected as the disease advances. HLB was assessed in diverse cultivars in commercial groves with high HLB-incidence. ‘Temple’ {{had the lowest}} HLB symptoms and Liberibacter (Las) titer, while ‘Murcott’ and ‘Minneola’ had the highest. The USDA Ft. Pierce, FL farm is managed to reveal genotype responses to HLB. Some current cultivars and hybrid seedlings demonstrate resistance/tolerance, at least to strain(s) of Las present. C. trifoliata is the best documented citrus resistance source with Las titers suppressed even when C. trifoliata is grafted onto severely-infected rootstocks. Some cultivars and hybrids have abundant foliage symptoms, but <b>full</b> <b>canopies</b> and seemingly normal fruit set and size. In 3 -years of data from a replicated trial of ‘Triumph’(T), ‘Jackson’(J), ‘Flame’(F), and ‘Marsh’(M), HLB symptoms were severe in all trees and Liberibacter titers were similar. However, F&M were almost completely defoliated in some years while T&J had <b>full</b> <b>canopies.</b> Cumulative fruit/tree was greater for T&J (255 & 220) than for F&M (29 & 66). T&J fruit met commercial standards and had normal size but F&M fruit were unacceptable with many small and misshapen. Evidence mounts that useful resistance/tolerance to HLB is present in cultivated citrus {{and this is a}} focus of the USDA citrus breeding program...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{energy crops}} {{is one of}} the {{possibilities}} of using temporarily, respectively persistent unused agricultural land. In Slovakia, 44 % (1, 064, 625 ha) of secondary and other land of the total land fund can be use also for establishment plantations of energy crops. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the impact of the planting material energy crop Miscanthus on canopied growth and productivity of the growth. Mortality of the individuals and the ability of the individuals to create aboveground organs in the year of the establishment and dynamics biomass production in the following years have been assessed. The growth of fast-growing crop Miscanthus was established on a field experimental basis. Two genotypes: Miscanthus × giganteus (planting materials were rhizomes) and Miscanthus sinensis Tatai (planting materials were in vitro seedlings) have been observed. Relatively high mortality of the individuals (31 %) was confirmed in rhizomes plantation. In the first year of cultivation, the growth of the Miscanthus × giganteus created clusters with total average number 26. 07 stems per cluster with count yield biomass 11. 10 t*ha- 1 within the research area. The growth of the Miscanthus sinensis Tatai was <b>full</b> <b>canopied</b> at the end of the growing period in the year of its establishment.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between scenic beauty grade and measured tree indicators was studied through evaluation of 427 photos of individual Pinus tabulaeformis trees {{by using the}} scenic beauty estimation (SBE) method. Thirteen indices to reflect trunk, crown and stem-to-canopy ratios of individual trees were evaluated by invited students. Results showed that students preferred large diameters at breast height, <b>full</b> <b>canopies</b> and straight stems or some trees with minor crook stems. Tree height had a minor contribution to individual tree quality. Correlation analysis and factor analysis were employed to select indices and to integrate them into a comprehensive index. The stepwise method of nonlinear model incorporation of four comprehensive indices—tree crown form, stem-crown coordination, tree growth and stem for—were proven valuable in order to evaluate the scenic beauty of individual trees...|$|R

40|$|Globally, many {{forests and}} {{woodlands}} are in decline. The marked loss of canopy foliage typical of these declines results in reduced foraging resources (e. g. nectar, pollen, and insects) and, subsequently, can reduce habitat quality for woodland birds. In south-west Western Australia, patches of Eucalyptus wandoo woodlands {{have shown a}} decline in condition since at least 2002. We investigated how changes in E. wandoo condition affect the woodland bird community. Foraging activities of three bird species were recorded for 20 sites in Dryandra State Forest and Wandoo Conservation Park either by conducting watches on focal trees ('sitting' method), or following individuals through the woodland ('following' method). Condition assessments of trees used by the birds were compared with those for trees available at the study site. Weebills (Smicrornis brevirostris; canopy insectivore) displayed preference for healthy trees (low amounts of canopy dieback), whereas rufous treecreepers (Climacteris rufa; bark-foraging insectivore) preferred trees with {{a higher proportion of}} dead branches. Yellow-plumed honeyeaters (Lichenostomus ornatus; insectivore/nectarivore) foraged in older, larger E. wandoo trees having <b>full</b> <b>canopies</b> with few signs of tree decline.

40|$|Individual tree {{detection}} algorithms {{can provide}} accurate measurements of individual tree locations, crown diameters (from aerial photography and {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) data), and tree heights (from lidar data).

We evaluated the performance of two fundamentally different automated tree detection and measurement algorithms (spatial wavelet analysis (SWA) and variable window filters (VWF)) across a <b>full</b> range of <b>canopy</b> conditions in a mixed-species, structurally diverse conifer forest in northern Idaho, USA. Each algorithm performed well in low canopy cover conditions (50 %) conditions. The results presented herein suggest that future algorithm development is required to improve individual tree detection in structurally complex forests. Furthermore, tree detection algorithms such as SWA and VWF may produce more accurate results when used in conjunction with higher density lidar data...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{variation in}} bird species richness, abundance and guild composition along an agricultural gradient in New Guinea, {{and looked for}} any additive influence of habitat heterogeneity on these variables. The study {{was based on a}} grid of survey plots, six plots wide and 24 plots long with the long axis running from a settlement 2. 4 km through active and abandoned agricultural plots towards a large area of forest. Each circular survey plot (25 m radius) was assigned to a broad habitat type, ten habitat measures taken, and birds counted for 1 h in each plot. Principal component analysis (PCA) habitat axis 1 described an axis of decreasing forest alteration (larger trees, greater tree densities, <b>fuller</b> <b>canopy)</b> that was positively correlated with distance from the settlement. Bird richness and abundance were highest at intermediate disturbance levels (plots with mid-range axis 1 scores). Proportions of insectivores and frugivores increased with decreasing forest alteration, while proportions of nectarivores decreased. We calculated three measures of habitat heterogeneity by comparing each plot's PCA score to those of eight neighbouring plots (50 – 110 m away). These measures reflected how different the plot was to its neighbours, how variable the habitat was around the plot, {{and the degree to which}} the plot bordered less disturbed forest. We related these measures to plot bird variable scores independently, and to residuals following regressions of bird scores against PCA scores. Heterogeneity measures had no significant influence on abundance or richness measures, but there were greater proportions of frugivores in plots showing a given degree of habitat alteration if they bordered more pristine habitat. While we readily identified differences in bird communities along the agricultural gradient, the influences of habitat heterogeneity were not striking for birds at this fine scale...|$|R
50|$|Data for {{comparison}} of habitat changes {{are available from}} two studies; one by French (1976) and one by Dodd (1989). Ninety-one of the same sites were surveyed in both studies. (Each study also surveyed additional sites not visited by the other study.) Of these 91 sites, 54 appeared similar to earlier descriptions, 19 had improved habitat conditions, and 18 were adversely affected by timber cutting since 1976. Of the 19 sites judged to have improved, 18 had been cleared of trees or had been selectively cut prior to French's survey but have since regrown a <b>full</b> tree <b>canopy.</b> (None of these improved sites had been mechanically prepared for replanting.) In addition to these 91 sites, 14 others examined in the latest survey were damaged by timber cutting; their status in 1976, however, was unknown.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to sitting and waiting, herons may feed more actively. They may walk slowly, around {{or less than}} 60 paces a minute, snatching prey when it is observed. Other active feeding behaviours include foot stirring and probing, where the feet are used to flush out hidden prey. The wings {{may be used to}} frighten prey (or possibly attract it to shade) or to reduce glare; the most extreme example of this is exhibited by the black heron, which forms a <b>full</b> <b>canopy</b> with its wings over its body.|$|E
50|$|Jasminum polyanthum is {{naturalized}} in Australia and New Zealand. It can {{be regarded}} as an invasive species in these regions. This species of jasmine spreads rapidly as it can grow from any small section of stem material. The stems layer profusely and runners spread long distances. It is highly shade tolerant and can flower under a <b>full</b> <b>canopy.</b> It forms dense ground cover, preventing the growth of native seedlings, and smothers all other vegetation up to mid-canopy level. Spread into established forest, for instance in New Zealand, is rapid.|$|E
50|$|Ecological {{secondary}} succession occurs in four distinct phases: First, rapid colonization of cleared land by {{species such as}} herbs, shrubs, and climbers as well as seedlings from pioneer tree species occurs and this can last up to three years.

Non-pioneer heliophilic (sun-loving) tree species then add to the biomass and species richness as well as shade tolerant species and this can last 75 to 150 years. Finally, shade-tolerant species regain <b>full</b> <b>canopy</b> stature indefinitely until another major disturbance occurs.|$|E

Data from distributed temperature sensing (DTS) in-stream measurements for three cloud-free days in August 2007 over a 1260 m stretch of the Boiron de Morges River in southwest Switzerland were used to calibrate and validate a physically based one-dimensional stream temperature model. Stream temperature response to three distinct riparian conditions were then modeled: open, in-stream reeds, and forest cover. Simulation predicted a mean peak stream temperature increase of 0. 7 °C if current vegetation was removed, an increase of 0. 1 °C if dense reeds covered the entire stream reach, and a decrease of 1. 2 °C if a mature riparian forest covered the entire reach.
