40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the behaviour of fragmenting coals during <b>devolatilization</b> in conditions relevant to fluidized bed combustion. To achieve this objective, a mathematical model has been developed for <b>devolatilization</b> of a single fragmenting coal particle. This model incorporates heat transfer to and within the coal particle, <b>devolatilization</b> reactions, mass transfer of volatiles, pressure build up inside the coal particle, and devolatilization-induced fragmentation. Prior to the development of the model for a fragmenting coal particle, two simpler models for coal <b>devolatilization</b> have also been developed, namely the simple model for a fragmenting coal particle and the model for a nonfragmenting coal particle. The first model was used for a factorial evaluation and the second model was used to select parameters for the model for a fragmenting coal particle by comparing with experimental data on nonfragmenting coals. It has been found that factorial experimental design can be used to select significant factors affecting <b>devolatilization</b> of fragmenting coals. In order of significance, factors affecting the <b>devolatilization</b> time are coal particle diameter, internal heat transfer, bed temperature and chemical kinetics; while factors affecting the number of fragmentations are diameter of coal particle, diameter of coal pores and volatile viscosity. This agrees with the results of a parametric study using the model for a fragmenting coal particle. The model for a fragmenting coal particle has fitted well the experimental data on <b>devolatilization</b> time and the timing of fragmentation.
