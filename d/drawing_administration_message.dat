5000|$|Persuasive discursive {{activity}} {{included the}} propagation and repetition {{of a few}} key messages consistently over time, {{with the aim of}} misdirecting public attention from the silence-generating activities. Key Bush <b>Administration</b> <b>messages</b> were that detainees were evil, dangerous terrorists; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British <b>Administration</b> <b>messages</b> were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair <b>Administrations).</b> These key <b>messages</b> were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including press conferences and media interviews, authorised leaks, real-time reporting, official investigations and public inquiries) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once-secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth-telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full accountability is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that justice has been served, all-the-while being constant targets of manipulation.|$|R
50|$|The system console, {{computer}} console, root console, operator's console, {{or simply}} console is the text entry and display device for system <b>administration</b> <b>messages,</b> particularly {{those from the}} BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger.

System consoles are generalized to computer terminals, which are abstracted respectively by virtual consoles and terminal emulators. Today communication with system consoles is generally done abstractly, via the standard streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr), but there may be system-specific interfaces, for example those used by the system kernel.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years we have {{witnessed}} an explosive growth in the usage of media streaming applications. The newly appeared audio/video applications are becoming increasingly popular in IP networks, while in mobile environment the limited bandwidth and the higher error rate arise in spite of its popularity. Retransmission-based error recovery is considered inappropriate for multimedia applications, because of its latency. However, this solution can be attractive because it requires minimal network bandwidth, processing cost and efficiently improves the quality. Despite its latency, retransmission can be used successfully in many cases, especially if playout buffering is employed. Only the successfully retransmitted packets will improve the quality parameters of the multimedia stream, therefore it is worth to examine which packets should be retransmitted. In this paper a source controlled selective retransmission algorithm is presented with a decision algorithm based on the actual RTT and sending rate determined by the TFRC. In our scheme the transmitter determines the playout delay caused by the playout buffer using the proposed Flood method. The needed information about the network congestion state and the network delay are provided by the TFRC (TCP Friendly Rate Control) algorithm. Our proposal does not need additional <b>administration</b> <b>messages</b> because the decision procedure and its inputs are at the transmitter. The obtained results show that significant quality improvement can be achieved with the proposed selective retransmission scheme...|$|R
