40|$|The BO 105 <b>IBC</b> <b>demonstrator</b> of EUROCOPTER Deutschland (ECD) {{has shown}} the {{successful}} application of 2 /rev blade root actuation for significant blade vortex interaction (BVI) noise reduction during flight tests. In order to evaluate and assess advanced BVI noise control concepts, plant models are required for a sophisticated controller design. However, modelling the dynamic behaviour of the plant based on extensive CFD calculations is practically not feasible. Due to their special capabilities with respect to non-linear behaviour, the selection of neural networks {{for this kind of}} modelling task is a reasonable alternative. The paper focuses on the application of neural networks for BVI system identification purposes, presenting an overview of combined research activities by the “Institut für Statik und Dynamik der Luft- und Raumfahrtkonstruktionen (ISD) ” and ECD. Two methodologies are outlined to achieve this goal: On the one hand a black box approach is used, whereby neural networks are trained to reproduce the pressure output of a specific Kulite that was gathered during the open loop flight test campaign in 1998. Based on the assumption of plant periodicity, a system identification approach is discussed using series of small neural networks for the representation of one rotor revolution. The clustered networks show good mapping ability concerning the interpolation of pressure data for various IBC phase angles. On the other hand, a grey box approach comprises physical knowledge about the mechanism of BVI, includin...|$|E
