40|$|When {{publishing}} {{the results of}} the recapitalization exercise, the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Authority reported that <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> had been successfully recapitalized and was now in a much stronger position, with a much strengthened capital base and overall resilience. 9 ̆ 1 <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> have made significant progress in boosting their capital positions and in strengthening the overall resilience of the <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system 9 ̆ 2, said Andrea Enria, Chairman of the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Authority. 9 ̆ 1 More than 8 ̆ 0200 bn has been injected into the <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system 9 ̆ 2, he continued, and <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> 9 ̆ 1 are now in a better shape to finance the real economy 9 ̆ 2 (EBA 2012 c: 1). Our analysis questions this assessment. The recapitalization orchestrated by the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Authority was based on a capital assessment methodology that has been subject to considerable scholarly criticism. 1 The methodology of basing regulatory capital requirements on risk-weighted assets is a less reliable indicator of banks 9 ̆ 2 soundness and resilience than much simpler ratios of capital to total assets (Acharya et al. 2011). The paper therefore compares the assessments undertaken by EBA 9 ̆ 6 all of which are based on risk-weighted assets 9 ̆ 6 with data on leverage ratios, defined as equity capital to total assets...|$|R

40|$|Large {{and growing}} {{international}} financial linkages between East and West {{have altered the}} nature of the stability risks faced by <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> systems, increasing susceptibility to contagion. This paper aims to identify potential risks of cross-border contagion using a sample of large Western and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>banks.</b> We assume that contagion risk is associated with extreme co-movements in a market-based measure of bank soundness, controlling for common underlying factors. We also find evidence that contagion risk across <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> heightened significantly during the recent crisis. Contagion among Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> with the highest market share in Eastern Europe and from this group to Eastern <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> shows the largest increase in our sample. We find also evidence of contagion spreading from Eastern <b>European</b> <b>banks,</b> but this effect seems to reflect a broader phenomenon of contagion from emerging markets to banks in advanced countries exposed to these markets. Finally, our findings offer only mixed evidence of the existence of a direct ownership channel in the transmission of contagion.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of national banking {{systems in the}} <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system {{and the absence of}} consolidated supervision creates the premises for a series of interrogations whose essence is the same: Is it possible to discuss about a Pan <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> System? The starting point in answering this question was the efforts to create a single banking market, which took place in 1973 - 1999, and the impact of integration on the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Industry. Among the most representative aspects, it must be emphasized the necessity of consolidating banking supervision at an European level, considering that the International Banking Community studies the problematic of banking regulations at a global level. The two dimensions of the prudential and <b>European</b> <b>bank</b> supervision device – the geographic and the institutional – demand the creation of a structural reform in order to ensure the functioning of a Pan <b>European</b> system of <b>banking</b> supervision and regulations. The considerations on the Consolidation of <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Supervision draws into discussion the Financial Supervision Authority which has generalized as an applicable model in numerous European countries and has been mentioned as an alternative of Pan <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> supervision. In the process of the integration of the banking sector, the Basel II Accord represents an opportunity in reaching a convergence of national regulations and practices in matters of risk management, considering that these actions are in line with the preoccupations of realizing a Pan <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system. Thus, the creation of Pan <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system involves actions in more directions: legal, institutional, operational meant to ensure the consolidation of banking supervision...|$|R

50|$|The usual {{reference}} rate for euro denominated interest rate products, however, is the Euribor {{compiled by the}} <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Federation</b> from a larger bank panel. A euro Libor does exist, but mainly, for continuity purposes in swap contracts dating back to pre-EMU times. The Libor is an estimate and is not intended in the binding contracts of a company.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{solutions}} to the euro crisis {{is based on a}} partial diagnosis that overemphasises the lack of enforcement of existing fiscal rules. Europe’s leaders should rather address the euro area’s inherent weaknesses revealed by the crisis. At the core of euro-area vulnerability is an impossible trinity of strict no-monetary financing, bank-sovereign interdependence and no co-responsibility for public debt. This Policy Contribution assesses the corresponding three options for reform: a broader <b>European</b> Central <b>Bank</b> (ECB) mandate, the building of a <b>banking</b> <b>federation,</b> and fiscal union with common bonds. None will be easy. The least feasible option is a change to the ECB’s mandate; changing market perceptions would require the ECB to credibly commit overwhelming forces, and the ECB is simply {{not in a position to}} make such a commitment. The building of a <b>banking</b> <b>federation,</b> meanwhile, involves reforms that are bound to be difficult. Incremental progress is likely, but a breakthrough less so. This leaves fiscal union. It faces major obstacles, but a decision to move in this direction would signal to the markets and ECB a commitment to stronger Economic and Monetary Union. One possibility would be to introduce a limited, experimental scheme through which trust could be rebuilt...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether discretionary provisioning by Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is driven by income smoothing or credit risk considerations. We find evidence that discretionary provisioning by Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is driven by income smoothing incentives in the post-financial crisis period, particularly, among listed banks. Also, we observe that discretionary provisioning is significantly influenced by credit risk factors, mainly, non-performing loans and loan growth. Also, we find that discretionary provisioning by Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is procyclical with fluctuations in the economic cycle. Overall, the implication of the findings is that discretionary provisioning among Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is driven by both income smoothing and credit risk considerations...|$|R
