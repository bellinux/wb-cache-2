This study aimed to compare the accuracy of the AI derived from a capacitance pressure platform relative to ink footprints. Area measurements (heel, midfoot, forefoot, hallux and lesser toes) were acquired simultaneously from ink footprints and a pressure platform. Difference between paired values revealed relative measurement error. The platform overestimated heel area (2. 2 %), but underestimated midfoot area (10. 2 %), and lesser toe area (17. 7 %). The mean AIs were 0. 206 (platform) and 0. 230 (ink prints). The pressure platform closely estimated contact areas for the heel and forefoot. Midfoot areas were underestimated sufficiently to bias the AI towards lower values. Therefore, the AI derived from a capacitance pressure platform {{is not the same as}} that from an ink footprint, and the two should not be used interchangeably.

Surgical excision with intralesional steroid injection along with compression therapy has the least recurrence rate. Various types of devices are available for pressure therapy. Pressure applied by these devices is uncontrolled and is associated with the risk of pressure necrosis. We describe here a simple and easy to use device to measure pressure applied by these clips for better outcome. Objectives: To devise a simple method to measure the pressure applied by various pressure clips used in ear keloid pressure therapy. Materials and Methods: By using a <b>force</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>resistor</b> (FSR), the pressure applied gets converted into voltage using electrical wires, resistors, capacitors, converter, amplifier, diode, nine-volt (9 V) cadmium battery and the voltage is measured using a multimeter.

Results: The pressure applied by different clips was variable. The spring clips were adjustable by slight variation in the design whereas the pressure applied by binder clips and magnet discs was not adjustable.

A Flexi-Force <b>Force</b> <b>Sensitive</b> <b>Resistor</b> (FSR) is attached {{to one of the}} claws of the gripper and interfaced to a notebook computer using Arduino Uno microcontroller.

Instrumental methods have an advantage in that they may be used for ambulatory monitoring. The aim {{of the present study was}} to describe and evaluate a new instrumental method based on a <b>force</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>resistor</b> and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pcc) for the assessment of FOG. Nine patients with Parkinson's disease in the "on" state walked through a corridor, passed through a doorway and made a U-turn. We analyzed 24 FOG episodes by computing the Pcc between one "regular/normal" step and the rest of the steps. The Pcc reached ± 1 for "normal" locomotion, while correlation diminished due to the lack of periodicity during FOG episodes. Gait was assessed in parallel with video. FOG episodes determined from the video were all detected with the proposed method. The computed duration of the FOG episodes was compared with those estimated from the video. The method was sensitive to various types of freezing; although no differences due to different types of freezing were detected. The study showed that Pcc analysis permitted the computerized detection of FOG in a simple manner analogous to human visual judgment, and its automation may be useful in clinical practice to provide a record of the history of FOG...|$|E
40|$|Lower limb {{prostheses}} {{are developed}} to assist amputees in restoring mobility {{functions such as}} walking, sit-to-stand, stair ascent/descent, and ramp climbing. Although the current prostheses are equipped with sensors, actuators, controllers, and mechanical structures, they require improvements to mimic {{the function of the}} natural limbs. The first challenge in prosthetic development is to monitor the amputee/prosthesis interaction by using sensors built into the socket. This interaction helps in detecting the gait phases and events, in addition to develop new control strategies for prostheses, which may enhance the amputees’ comfort. The second challenge is to develop a knee prosthetic mechanism that could imitate the functions of the natural knee. To accomplish the aims of this thesis, studies were undertaken consecutively. First, the technology of the knee prosthesis was studied to understand the functionality of its components. The technology review showed that the sensory system requires enhancement, in particular, a new sensory system can be added-on to the mechanical sensors to sense the user’s intent, identify the transition between phases, and improve the control performance of the prosthesis. Based on this study, the piezoelectric bimorph (PB) was selected as the sensing element while a linear motor was selected as the most appropriate actuator. Next, the PB was validated as a sensing element by finding out its characteristics for the intended application. The static and dynamic characteristics of the PB were investigated and tested as an in-socket sensor with a transfemoral amputee to check its ability to sense the movement of the knee prosthesis. Moreover, the PB was tested as an actuation element in an application named microgripper that was capable of grasping a small object. Also, the PB was compared with a <b>force</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>resistor</b> (FSR) as an in-socket sensor for a transfemoral amputee performing activities such as walking, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. The PB could track the knee angle at most of the activities, while the FSR {{could be used as a}} trigger sensor at different movements. In the second stage, the focus was on the actuation system and mechanical structure of the knee prosthesis. It was found that, the mechanical actuation system needs improvement in terms of the normal range of motion and the power generation in activities that require extra torque and power. Therefore, a new design of knee prosthesis mechanism that contains a linear actuation system was presented and modeled using a physical modelling tool. The mechanism was physically simulated and controlled using PID controller at activities of daily living (ADL). Finally, an overall control framework of the knee mechanism using in-socket sensor was presented to guide the researchers to develop a knee prosthesis that could be controlled using in-socket sensors. In conclusion, the study demonstrates the possibility of using the piezoelectric bimorph as an in-socket transducer. Furthermore, a knee prosthesis mechanism was successfully designed, modelled, and tested at ADL. Further, clinical trials are recommended for the knee mechanism upon future development. Moreover, more subjects with different types of sockets may be tested towards improving the functionality of the knee prosthesi...|$|E

The gait data is passed into an intelligent fuzzy inference system managed by custom defined fuzzy rules to be classified into four stance phases (heel strike, flat foot, heel lift, toe push-off), and three swing phases (initial flexion, terminal flexion, and terminal extension). After the fuzzy system was trained using data from five healthy subjects, the system's representative gait classification root mean squared error dropped from 0. 2975 to 0. 1200, showing a much improved ability to categorize human gait, despite its varied nature. The system represents a robust tool, which {{can be used in a}} clinical environment for the analysis of human gait in rehabilitative applications such as rule based control generation for functional electrical stimulation, and gait quality analysis...|$|R
