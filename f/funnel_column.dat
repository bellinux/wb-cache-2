40|$|Two {{different}} methods for the extraction and assay of plastoquinones A, B, C and D from chloroplasts of green {{plants have been}} described. The long procedure involves separation of aqueous and lipid phases of extract in a separatory <b>funnel,</b> <b>column</b> chromatography, purification on thin-layer plates, and spectrophotometric assays for quantitative determination of the various plastoquinones. The short procedure is based on spotting lipid extracts from chloroplasts on thin layer plates and comparing leucomethylene blue spots of unknown quinones {{with a series of}} spots produced by known amounts of the 4 standard plastoquinones on the same plate...|$|E

5000|$|His last escort mission resulted, on December 2, 1942, in the Battle of Skerki Bank: his convoy (composed of the {{transport}} ships Aventino, Aspromonte, Puccini and KT 1), escorted by three destroyers (Da Recco, Folgore and Camicia Nera) and two torpedo boats (Procione and Clio), was attacked {{during the night}} by the British Force Q, consisting of the light cruisers Aurora, [...] Sirius and Argonaut and the destroyers Quiberon and Quentin. On Cocchia's orders, the entire escort launched a determined counterattack, but could not prevent {{the destruction of the}} convoy; Da Recco, after two unsuccessful attacks with guns and torpedoes, closed in on Force Q to launch a third attack, but the accidental ignition of fuel oil contained in the forward <b>funnel</b> originated a <b>column</b> of sparks, that gave away the position of the ship. Accurate British fire immediately crippled Da Recco, igniting her forward magazines; {{more than half of the}} crew was killed or wounded, including Cocchia, who suffered severe burns, especially on his face. Temporarily blinded, he had to give up the command to his executive officer; he was initially hospitalized at the hospital in Torrebianca (Trapani), and had to spend the next three years in a number of clinics, undergoing numerous surgery operations in an attempt to mitigate the damage caused by the fire. He was permamently disfigured; for his determined defense of the convoy against superior forces he was awarded Gold Medal of Military Valor.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, Brig. Gen. William H. French's division of the II Corps prepared to move forward, subjected to Confederate artillery fire that was descending on the fog-covered city of Fredericksburg. General Burnside's orders to Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner, commander of the Right Grand Division, was to send [...] "a division or more" [...] to seize the high ground {{to the west of the}} city, assuming that his assault on the southern end of the Confederate line would be the decisive action of the battle. The avenue of approach was difficult—mostly open fields, but interrupted by scattered houses, fences, and gardens that would restrict the movement of battle lines. A canal stood about 200 yards west of the town, crossed by three narrow bridges, which would require the Union troops to <b>funnel</b> themselves into <b>columns</b> before proceeding. About 600 yards to the west of Fredericksburg was the low ridge known as Marye's Heights, rising 40–50 feet above the plain. (Although popularly known as Marye's Heights, the ridge was composed of several hills separated by ravines, from north to south: Taylor's Hill, Stansbury Hill, Marye's Hill, and Willis Hill.) Near the crest of the portion of the ridge comprising Marye's Hill and Willis Hill, a narrow lane in a slight cut—the Telegraph Road, known after the battle as the Sunken Road—was protected by a 4-foot stone wall, enhanced in places with log breastworks and abatis, making it a perfect infantry defensive position. Confederate Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws initially had about 2,000 men on the front line of Marye's Heights and there were an additional 7,000 men in reserve on the crest and behind the ridge. Massed artillery provided almost uninterrupted coverage of the plain below. General Longstreet had been assured by his artillery commander, Lt. Col. Edward Porter Alexander, [...] "General, we cover that ground now so well that we will comb it as with a fine-tooth comb. A chicken could not live on that field when we open on it." ...|$|R
