5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England {{broke away from the}} {{authority}} of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called <b>John,</b> <b>did</b> convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, {{but the rest of the}} family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|<b>John</b> <b>did</b> {{not return}} to the crusaders in Egypt for several months. According to a letter from the prelates in the Holy Land to Philip II of France, lack of funds kept John from leaving his kingdom. Since his nephew Walter IV was {{approaching}} the age of majority, John surrendered the County of Brienne in 1221. During John's absence from Egypt, Al-Kamil again offered to restore the Holy Land to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in June 1221; Pelagius refused him. John returned to Egypt and rejoined the crusade on 6 July 1221 at the command of Pope Honorius.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, as {{the allied}} Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha. The Spanish contingent under Don <b>John</b> <b>did</b> {{not reach the}} Ionian Sea until September, meaning that the Ottomans enjoyed numerical superiority for a time, but the Ottoman commander {{was well aware of}} the inferiority of his fleet, constructed in haste of green wood and manned by inexperienced crews. He therefore actively avoided to engage the allied fleet in August, and eventually headed {{for the safety of the}} fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|De Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which {{presented}} Innocent {{with two}} {{candidates for the}} office. In an effort to reach a compromise, the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206; Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy. The monks then elected Stephen Langton, with Innocent's approval. <b>John</b> <b>did</b> not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over {{the rights of the}} king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. Innocent placed an interdict on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to excommunicate John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the only English bishops not in exile or dead. But it was not until 1213, when Innocent began to support John's deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.|$|E

25|$|Charles <b>John</b> <b>did</b> {{not limit}} his {{activities}} {{to that of}} the family firm and was chairman of Boiler Insurance and Steam Power Co. Ltd. in September 1880, when an extraordinary general meeting held in King Street, Manchester resolved to liquidate the company and sell its business and assets. He was also a director of the Manchester Ship Canal Company and had been a director of the Steam Boiler Assurance Co. Ltd.|$|E
25|$|In 1407, Louis of Orléans {{was murdered}} in the rue Vieille du Temple in Paris. <b>John</b> <b>did</b> not deny responsibility, {{claiming}} that Louis was a tyrant who squandered money. Louis' son Charles, the new Duke of Orléans, turned to his father-in-law, Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, for support against John the Fearless. This resulted in the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War, which lasted from 1407 until 1435, beyond Charles' reign, though the war with the English was still in progress.|$|E

25|$|By this point, Elton John was {{starting}} to lose interest in Sedaka. Members of John's inner circle, jealous of Sedaka's success, worked to undermine the friendship by telling John falsehoods about Sedaka. Consequently, {{when it was time}} to renegotiate Sedaka's contract with Rocket, <b>John</b> <b>did</b> not offer Sedaka the amount of money he was looking for, and he did not promote Steppin' Out as extensively as he had Sedaka's Back and The Hungry Years. Sedaka subsequently left Rocket and signed with Elektra Records.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} Fredericton (the former Fort Anne) as the colonial capital shocked and dismayed the {{residents}} of the larger Parrtown (Saint John). The reason given was because Fredericton's inland location meant it was less prone to enemy (i.e. American) attack. Saint <b>John</b> <b>did,</b> however, become Canada's first incorporated city and for over a century was one of the dominant communities in British North America. Saint John in 1787-91 was home to the American traitor Benedict Arnold. He was an aggressive businessman who sued a great deal and had a negative reputation by the time he quit and went to London.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria made overtures to John, {{offering}} the renounce his nation’s {{obedience to the}} Patriarch of Constantinople, and place his kingdom under the ecclesiastical authority of the popes at Rome. John sent two legates, who only made {{it as far as}} Constantinople, but whose letters urging Simeon {{to come to terms with}} the Byzantine Empire were delivered to him. However, <b>John</b> <b>did</b> confirm Simeon’s title of Tsar (emperor), and it was John’s representatives who crowned Simeon’s son Peter I of Bulgaria as Tsar in 927. Finally, John sent a legate to act as intermediary to attempt to stop a war between the Bulgarians and Croatians.|$|E

25|$|None of John's {{three other}} sons would marry in his lifetime.

Only Infante Pedro would live long enough to marry, but <b>John</b> <b>did</b> not live long enough to see it. Infante Pedro married the daughter of his older brother King José I, Princess Maria Francisca, Princess of Brazil, on 6 June 1760. When Princess Maria became Queen Maria I of Portugal upon the death of her father, King José I (John's son), Prince Pedro became King Pedro III, following Portuguese royal law that if the consort of a queen regnant produced children with the queen regnant, he would become king of Portugal jure uxoris.|$|E
25|$|Cokayne {{received}} few commissions under Henry V, {{although they}} did include the important commissions of array for Warwickshire in May 1418 and March 1419. He is not known to have {{played a part in}} Henry V's campaigns in France, although his son, also <b>John,</b> <b>did</b> serve in France under Richard Grey, 4th Baron Grey of Codnor. Instead he continued his private local warfare. In August 1419 he used armed force to seize manors on the Derbyshire-Leicestershire border belonging to John Finderne, including Stretton en le Field. Finderne had acted as a lawyer for the Duchy of Lancaster and it appears that Cokayne was now making a habit of harassing its local officials. Under examination by the king's council, he claimed that he and others had an interest in Stretton, but the local coroner was ordered to return it to Finderne's control.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Alexius I brought John II Comnenus to power. By now, the Seljuq Turks had {{fractured}} and became loosely allied to each other. During {{this time the}} Sultanate of Rum was busy fighting off their former allies, the Danishmends. John Comnenus {{was able to use}} this to his advantage as he undertook a series of campaigns in Anatolia and Syria. John successfully captured the southern coast of Anatolia as far as Antioch, defeated an attempt by the Gabras family to form a breakaway state in Trebizond, and recaptured the ancestral home of the Comnenus family at Kastamonu. Despite this, Turkish resistance was strong and <b>John</b> <b>did</b> not capture the Seljuk capital at Konya, nor were all of his conquests held - the city of Gangra, captured by John in the 1130s, was lost again as the emperor had left it with a garrison of just 2,000 men.|$|E

25|$|GHQ {{moved back}} from Le Cateau to St Quentin on 25 August. French {{had a long}} {{discussion}} with Murray and Wilson (25 August) as to whether, the BEF should stand and fight at Le Cateau, a position which had been chosen for both I and II Corps to hold after they had retreated {{on either side of}} the Forest of Mormal. II Corps had been harried by German forces as it retreated west of the forest and Wilson and Murray were concerned about the risk of encirclement from the left. Sir <b>John</b> <b>did</b> not agree but wanted to fall back as agreed with Joffre, and hoped that the BEF could pull out of the fight altogether and refit behind the River Oise. Besides concern for his men, he was also worried that he was exposing his small force to the risk of destruction which Kitchener had forbidden. Wilson issued orders to Smith-Dorrien to retreat from Le Cateau the next day.|$|E
25|$|<b>John</b> <b>did</b> {{accompany}} Frederick to the mainland, but Frederick was not well-received there; {{one of his}} few supporters was Balian, Lord of Sidon, who had {{welcomed the}} crusaders the year before and now acted as an ambassador to the Ayyubids. The death of al-Mu'azzam negated the proposed alliance with al-Kamil, who along with his brother al-Ashraf had taken possession of Damascus (as well as Jerusalem) from their nephew, al-Mu'azzam's son an-Nasir Dawud. However, al-Kamil presumably {{did not know of}} the small size of Frederick's army, nor the divisions within it caused by his excommunication, and wished to avoid defending his territories against another crusade. Frederick's presence alone was sufficient to regain Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and a number of surrounding castles without a fight: these were recovered in February 1229, in return for a ten-year truce with the Ayyubids and freedom of worship for Jerusalem's Muslim inhabitants. The terms of the treaty were unacceptable to the Patriarch of Jerusalem Gerald of Lausanne, who placed the city under interdict. In March, Frederick crowned himself in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but because of his excommunication and the interdict Jerusalem was never truly reincorporated into the kingdom, which continued to be ruled from Acre.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1918 Ellen was {{thinking}} of selling Preston Manor to Brighton Corporation; years of feuding with her son had left a legacy of bitterness. Charles and Ellen were probably influenced by their friend Henry Roberts, Director of the Royal Pavilion, but they also feared that if <b>John</b> <b>did</b> inherit he would demolish the house or {{turn it into a}} girls' school. In 1925 Charles bought Preston Manor from his wife's trustees and made provision in his will that, subject to the respective life interests of himself and Ellen, Preston Manor and four acres of adjoining land should pass to Brighton Corporation by deed of gift on the condition that it be preserved in its historic condition and be used as a museum with exhibits relevant to Brighton and Sussex. The frontage to Preston Road and Preston Drove was purchased by the Corporation for the sum of £5,000 (although the sale was not completed until after Charles and Ellen died). Also in 1925 Charles and Ellen were given the honorary freedom of Brighton and in 1929 Charles was made a baronet in recognition of his years of public service. Sir Charles and Lady Ellen Thomas-Stanford continued to live at Preston Manor until their deaths in 1932. Charles died in March having willed to the Corporation 'all my books, documents, ancient deeds and papers relating exclusively or primarily to the County of Sussex'. (The rest of his library went to the National Library of Wales). Ellen died in November, bequeathing to the corporation the furniture and contents of the house.|$|E
