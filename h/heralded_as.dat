5|$|Arctic Monkeys are a British indie {{rock band}} from Sheffield, England. Formed in 2002, Arctic Monkeys {{currently}} consists of Alex Turner on lead vocals and guitar, Jamie Cook on guitar, Matt Helders on drums and backing vocals, and Nick O'Malley on bass guitar and backing vocals, a position formerly held by Andy Nicholson. The band's initial popularity came from fan-made demo tapes and online file sharing, and were <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the}} first acts to come to the public attention via the Internet. Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a change {{in the way in which}} new bands are promoted and marketed. The band eventually signed to the independent record label Domino Records.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, {{the railway}} network came to Milford, linking {{it to the}} Haverfordwest line and beyond. In 1866, work was {{completed}} on an additional extension which provided access to the docks and ship-breaking yard {{on the eastern side}} of the town. Between 1875 and 1886 The Great Eastern was a permanent fixture at Milford Docks, remaining there for lengthy repairs. Her arrival into the docks was <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> an example of the scale of vessel which the town could expect to attract.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the English {{bacteriologist}} Frederick Twort discovered {{a group of}} viruses that infect bacteria, now called bacteriophages (or commonly phages), and the French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten {{with the development of}} penicillin. The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Shining Armor, Princess Celestia and {{the others}} {{apologize}} to Twilight for not believing her, and Princess Celestia commends Twilight Sparkle, for it was her instincts and conviction to them that ultimately saved the day; she is <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> the one, true hero. The wedding ceremony is quickly rescheduled, with Twilight eagerly overseeing preparations for a much happier and profoundly appreciative Cadance. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom"). During the ceremony and the reception, Twilight's ingering anxiety of losing touch with her brother is finally put to rest when Shining confesses that he persuaded Cadance to accept his proposal when he mentioned she would gain Twilight as a sister-in-law. Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister for all she has done and the siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E

5|$|Shakira {{embarked}} on The Sun Comes Out World Tour in late 2010, to promote She Wolf {{along with her}} ninth studio album Sale el Sol. Shakira's official website first announced the three initial venues of the North American leg of the tour, on 3 May 2010, and subsequently 22 more venues were listed. After a special tour preview show held in Montreal, Canada, on 2 August 2010, the North American leg of the tour commenced at Uncasville, Connecticut, on 17 September, and closed at Rosemont, Illinois, on 29 October 2010. The initial dates for the European leg of the tour were announced on 28 June 2010, and subsequently 22 more shows were listed. The European leg of the tour was planned to commence at Lyon, France, on 16 November, and end in London, England, on 20 December 2010. The tickets for the initial dates of the European leg were soon sold out, and Shakira extended the tour into 2011, beginning by announcing a show at Paris, France; venues at countries such as Croatia, Russia, Spain and Switzerland were soon added. The Latin American leg of the tour {{was a part of}} the Pop Festival, which was <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> an initiative to bring international music stars to Latin America. Initial tour dates for the leg were announced on 3 December 2010, and soon venues at countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico were added to the tour dates.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} antifeminism has varied {{across time and}} cultures, and antifeminism attracts both men and women. Some women, {{like those in the}} Women's National Anti-Suffrage League, campaigned against women's suffrage. Emma Goldman, for example, was widely {{considered}} antifeminist during her fight against suffragism in the US. Decades later, however, she was <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> a founder of anarcha-feminism.|$|E

Frequently <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> {{a nuclear}} {{commercial}} {{model for the}} world, today it's locked in a national debate over a partial nuclear phaseout.

25|$|The cathedral's {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid by Empress Catherine II and Austrian Emperor Joseph II, during Catherine's Crimean journey on , which was <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> the official date of founding the city. Nevertheless, the cathedral as originally designed {{was never to}} be built. The site for the Potemkin palace was bought from retired Cossack yesaul (colonel) Lazar' Globa, who owned much of the land near the city. Part of Lazar' Globa's gardens still exist and are now called Globa Park.|$|E
25|$|Feng Xiaogang's The Dream Factory (1997) was <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> {{a turning}} point in Chinese movie industry, a hesui pian (Chinese New Year-screened film) which {{demonstrated}} the viability of the commercial model in China's socialist market society. Feng has become the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era. Almost all his films made high returns domestically while he used ethnic Chinese co-stars like Rosamund Kwan, Jacqueline Wu, Rene Liu and Shu Qi to boost his films' appeal.|$|E

Steelcase manufactured the furniture for the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin, which was also designed by Wright and is recognized as a landmark building. Because of those ties, Steelcase purchased and restored the property in the 1980s. The restoration has been <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> one of the most accurate and complete of any Wright restoration. The home is used by Steelcase for special events and {{is open to the public}} for tours.|$|E
25|$|The second semi-final, {{played at}} The County Ground, Derby, {{was reduced to}} 42 overs per side due to rain. India posted a score of 281/4, with Harmanpreet Kaur scoring 171 (not out) from 115 balls, {{including}} seven sixes. This was the highest individual score in the knockout stages of a World Cup, and was widely <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the greatest}} ever World Cup innings. In response, Australia was bowled out for 245, leaving India the victors by 36 runs.|$|E

25|$|In 1606 King Henry IV {{nominated}} Richelieu {{to become}} Bishop of Luçon. As Richelieu {{had not yet}} reached the canonical minimum age, it was necessary that he journey to Rome for a special dispensation from the Pope. This secured, Richelieu was consecrated bishop in April 1607. Soon after {{he returned to his}} diocese in 1608, Richelieu was <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> a reformer. He became the first bishop in France to implement the institutional reforms prescribed by the Council of Trent between 1545 and 1563.|$|E
25|$|As {{to other}} works of art, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica in 1937, taking {{inspiration}} from the bombing of Guernica, and in Leonardo da Vinci's The Battle of Anghiari. Guernica, like many important Republican masterpieces, was featured at the 1937 International Exhibition in Paris. The work's size (11ft by 25.6ft) grabbed much attention and cast {{the horrors of the}} mounting Spanish civil unrest into a global spotlight. The painting has since been <b>heralded</b> <b>as</b> an anti-war work and a symbol of peace in the 20th century.|$|E

A number of metropolitan stores sold out of the range as soon as 10 minutes after opening, and items from the collection soon began appearing for sale on eBay at inflated prices. Another Stella McCartney collection was released in October 2010, to lesser fanfare.|$|E
