5|$|Eddy was widowed {{when she}} was 22 years old and pregnant, after which she {{returned}} to live in her father's home. Her son was raised there {{for the first few}} years of his life, looked after by <b>domestic</b> <b>staff</b> because of Eddy's poor health. The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy alleges that she allowed him to be adopted when he was four. According to Eddy, she was unable to prevent the adoption, but McClure's implied otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing {{for the owners}} of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female <b>domestic</b> <b>staff</b> had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of {{the gates of the}} great country houses. With both fortunes and staff depleted many owners of country houses now fought a losing battle to retain them.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of King George VI in 1952, the Duchess of Edinburgh {{inherited}} the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. Browning and his staff became redundant, as the Queen was now served by the large staff of the monarch. The <b>domestic</b> <b>staff</b> remained at Clarence House, where they continued to serve the Queen Mother. The remainder were reorganised as the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh, with Browning as treasurer, {{the head of the}} office, moving into a new and larger office at Buckingham Palace. Like the Duke they served, the office had no constitutional role, but followed his sporting, cultural and scientific interests. Browning became involved with the Cutty Sark Trust, set up to preserve the famous ship, and in the administration of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. In June 1953, Browning and Du Maurier attended the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
50|$|In a {{high-profile}} 2015 case, Deepan Budlakoti, a stateless man born in Ottawa, Ontario, was {{declared not to}} be a Canadian citizen because his parents were employed as <b>domestic</b> <b>staffs</b> by the High Commissioner of India in Canada and their contracts, which came with recognized diplomatic statuses, legally ended two months after his birth, {{despite the fact that they}} started to work for a non-diplomat well before their contracts ended and before Budlakoti was born.|$|R

5|$|On 26 January 1569, Mary {{was moved}} to Tutbury Castle {{and placed in the}} custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his {{formidable}} wife Bess of Hardwick. Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House, all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea. Mary was permitted her own <b>domestic</b> <b>staff,</b> which never numbered less than 16, and needed 30 carts to transport her belongings from house to house. Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets, as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ("In my end lies my beginning") embroidered. Her bedlinen was changed daily, and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of 32 dishes served on silver plates. She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision, spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent much of her time doing embroidery. Her health declined, perhaps through porphyria or lack of exercise, and by the 1580s, she had severe rheumatism in her limbs, rendering her lame.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s saw {{considerable}} {{social change}} in Brasenose, with more post-graduate attendees and fewer <b>domestic</b> <b>staff.</b> In 1974 BNC {{was one of the}} first men's colleges to admit women as full members, the others being Jesus College, Hertford, St Catherine's, and Wadham.|$|E

Maintenance and upkeep includes groundskeeping, <b>domestic</b> <b>staffing</b> and catering and is paid by Patrimonio Nacional. This amount doesn't include King's yacht Fortuna (maintained by Patrimonio Nacional) nor other expenses such as transportation which are paid by the army.

25|$|Bradlee, {{the second}} of three children, {{grew up in a}} wealthy family with <b>domestic</b> <b>staff.</b> With his brother, Freddy, and sister, Constance, he learned French, took piano lessons, and went to the symphony and the opera.

25|$|Despite its {{ideological and}} moral decline, Germany enjoys a high {{standard}} of living, with its citizens living off the produce of their European satellite states and freed from physical labour by thousands of Polish, Czech and Ukrainian workers. The European nations export high quality consumer goods to Germany (noted imports are domestic electronics from Great Britain) while also providing services, such as an SS academy at Oxford University and imported <b>domestic</b> <b>staff.</b> Hitler's personal tastes in art and music remain the norm for German society.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper floor}} {{contained}} the sleeping accommodation, lavatories, bathrooms, dressing rooms and children's rooms {{for the large}} Strousberg family. The central hot water system, a feature which {{only a handful of}} buildings in Berlin in the late 1860s possessed, was an indication of the building's modernity. Examples of the luxurious, but classically inspired interior decoration {{can be seen in the}} designs for the bathroom, where Roman Pompeii style wall paintings graced the walls (right). The more senior <b>domestic</b> <b>staff</b> – the nanny and governess – were also housed on the upper floor.|$|E

25|$|Julia {{seemed to}} believe that blacks were not fully equal to whites, but she refused to lend any support to white supremacists, {{including}} her brother Louis Dent. She strongly encouraged blacks on the White House <b>domestic</b> <b>staff</b> to buy land in the District {{while it was still}} cheap, in order to ensure their future financial security. She also decided to greet anyone properly dressed—regardless of race—who attended her afternoon receptions, but never questioned why blacks failed to call on her. The simple answer was that White House security prevented them from doing so.|$|E
25|$|Patti's last marriage, in 1899, was to Baron Rolf Cederström (1870–1947), a priggish, but handsome, Swedish aristocrat {{many years}} her junior. The Baron {{severely}} curtailed Patti's social life. He cut down her <b>domestic</b> <b>staff</b> from 40 to 18, but {{gave her the}} devotion and flattery that she needed, becoming her sole legatee. After her death, he married a much younger woman. Their only daughter, Brita Yvonne Cederström (born 1924), ended up as Patti's sole heir. Patti had no children, but was close to her nieces and nephews. The two-time Tony Award-winning Broadway actress and singer Patti LuPone is a great-grand niece and namesake. Drummer Scott Devours is her 3rd great nephew. The Welsh opera singer Lisa Lee Dark is her 4th great-grand niece through her marriage to the French tenor Ernesto Nicolini.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{reorganization}} of the White House <b>domestic</b> <b>staff,</b> Moynihan was offered the position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations (then held by career diplomat Charles Woodruff Yost) on November 17, 1969; after initially accepting, he decided to remain in Washington when the Family Assistance Plan stalled in the Senate Finance Committee. On November 24, 1970, he refused a second offer from Nixon due to potential familial strain and ongoing financial problems; depression stemming from the repudiation of the Family Assistance Plan by liberal Democrats; and the inability to effect change due to static policy directives in a tertiary role behind Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Henry Kissinger and United States Secretary of State William P. Rogers. Instead, he commuted from Harvard as a part-time member of the United States delegation during the ambassadorship of George H.W. Bush.|$|E
