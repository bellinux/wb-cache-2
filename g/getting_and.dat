We elucidated the interaction between <b>Get</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> 5 <b>and</b> investigated their interaction with <b>Get</b> 3 <b>and</b> a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, Sgt 2. Based on co-immunoprecipitation <b>and</b> crystallographic studies, <b>Get</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> 5 formed a tight complex, suggesting that they constitute subunits of a larger complex. In contrast, although Get 3 interacted physically with the Get 4 -Get 5 complex, low amounts of Get 3 co-precipitated with Get 5, implying a transient interaction between <b>Get</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> 4 -Get 5. Sgt 2 also interacted with Get 5, although the amount of Sgt 2 that co-precipitated with Get 5 varied. Moreover, GET 3, <b>GET</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>GET</b> 5 interacted genetically with molecular chaperone YDJ 1, suggesting that chaperones might also {{be involved in the}} insertion of tail-anchored proteins...|$|R

500|$|The Court {{held that}} despite not {{mentioning}} the words [...] "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with “persons” or “transferees” considers the “persons” or “transferees” {{to be the}} ones getting the gun {{at the end of the}} day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. [...] "Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by." [...] The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares about the person that is buying the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms “person” and “transferee,” to mean “the man at the counter”, you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms “person,” and “transferee,” to mean “the man <b>getting,</b> <b>and</b> always meant to get, the firearm”.|$|E
500|$|At {{about the}} same moment that Patterson sighted the Japanese ships and went into action, the Japanese floatplanes overhead, on orders from Mikawa, dropped aerial flares {{directly}} over Canberra and Chicago. [...] Canberra responded immediately, with Captain Frank Getting ordering an increase in speed, a reversal of an initial turn to port, which kept Canberra between the Japanese and the Allied transports, and for her guns to train out and fire at any targets that could be sighted. [...] Less than one minute later, as Canberras guns took aim at the Japanese, Chōkai and Furutaka opened fire on her, scoring numerous hits within a few seconds. Aoba and Kako joined in with gunfire, and within the next three minutes Canberra took up to 24 large caliber hits. Early hits killed her gunnery officer, mortally wounded <b>Getting,</b> <b>and</b> destroyed both boiler rooms, knocking out power to the entire ship before Canberra could fire any of her guns or communicate a warning to other Allied ships. [...] The cruiser glided to a stop, on fire, with a 5- to 10-degree list to starboard, and unable to fight the fires or pump out flooded compartments {{because of lack of}} power. Since all of the Japanese ships were on the port side of Canberra, the damage to the ship's starboard side occurred either from shells entering low on the port side and exiting below the waterline on the starboard side, or from one or two torpedo hits on the starboard side. [...] If torpedoes did hit Canberra on the starboard side, then they may have come from a nearby Allied ship, and at this time the U.S. destroyer Bagley was the only ship {{on that side of the}} Australian cruiser and had fired torpedoes moments earlier.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{many states}} and cities banned the {{exhibition}} of the Johnson-Jeffries film. The movement to censor Johnson's victory took over the country within {{three days after the}} fight. It was a spontaneous movement. Two weeks after the match former President Theodore Roosevelt, an avid boxer and fan, wrote an article for The Outlook in which he supported banning not just moving pictures of boxing matches, but a complete ban on all prize fights in the US. He cited the [...] "crookedness" [...] and gambling that surrounded such contests and that moving pictures have [...] "introduced a new method of money <b>getting</b> <b>and</b> of demoralization". The controversy surrounding the film directly motivated Congress to ban distribution of all prizefight films across state lines in 1912; the ban was lifted in 1940.|$|E

[...] In response to an open letter from the ABCFM demanding an apology, Twain penned [...] "To My Missionary Critics," [...] which offered no apologies, although it ended by acknowledging that missionaries no doubt mean well. The essay, originally entitled [...] "The Case of Rev. Dr. Ament, Missionary," [...] was published in the North American Review in April 1901. According to Fitch, [...] "To My Missionary Critics" [...] (1901) recapitulates the charges mounted against Reverend William Ament in [...] "To the Person Sitting in Darkness" [...] and underscores Twain's contempt for the American-Christian missionaries' role in imperialism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the match, {{many former}} Australian players {{called for the}} tour to be abandoned, citing {{the safety of the}} team. Nevertheless, the series {{continued}} and Lawry's men received a positive welcome upon arrival for the Fifth Test in Madras. Lawry made 33 as Australia batted first and made 258, taking a 95-run lead. He then fell for 2 as Australia collapsed for 153 in the second innings to give the hosts an opening, but they won the match in just over three days by 77 runs to clinch the series 3–1, but Lawry's team left India with Australia's reputation severely dented. Perhaps {{as a result of the}} controversy, Lawry could only manage 239 runs at 34.14 for the series. On reflection, Lawry stated [...] "It was the toughest tour I've ever been on.

2500|$|Cougar Town {{opened to}} mixed reviews from critics. Metacritic gave the series 49 out of 100 {{based on the}} pilot episode, from the 21 reviews it collected, and a user score of 4.5 out of 10 based on 46 votes. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot episode a B, commenting that the show mixes [...] "clinical realism (when did you last hear a C-section scar used as a punchline?) with ridiculous slang (a new boob job is {{referred}} to as gorilla heads), Cougar Town is so brashly vulgar, it's endearing". Tucker also wrote that [...] "the entire show is about <b>getting</b> <b>and</b> having sex... Cougar is so single-minded that this obsession itself becomes funny". Variety stated that the show [...] "does feed into the dual sense of insecurity and self-empowerment that women harbor about getting older ... though, the execution here is consistently about as subtle as a kick to the groin". Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara said that the [...] "maddening thing about Cougar Town is that it isn't completely unfunny or uncharming". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger feels that [...] "Cougar Town is still finding itself, but it's already much better than the title would suggest [...] the show [...] "has to walk a very careful line between making fun of the cougar concept and embracing it" [...] although based on the two episodes [...] "Cougar Town is self-aware enough to pull that off". USA Today was also favorable, saying that the show has [...] "the right cast and good writing".|$|E

Gender inequity in the world of comedy deserves all the overdue attention it's <b>getting,</b> <b>and</b> more. But there are matters of craft, wit (no matter how crude the jokes) and timing that transcend chromosomes." [...] Richard Roeper of The Chicago Sun Times praised the performances of the cast, particularly Schumer, Hader, Quinn, and James. He also called Schumer's performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. [...] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, stating, [...] "Judd Apatow's latest is rough around the edges, but his focus on a female protagonist refreshes a genre in sore need of change". Ian Crouch, writing for The New Yorker, singled out LeBron James' performance for praise, writing that [...] "it seems safe to declare that he has given the greatest motion-picture acting performance by an active professional basketball player of all time." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, saying, [...] "Beneath all of his bad-boy shtick, Apatow's always been a pretty conventional moralist. But Schumer gives their raunchy rom-com enough of her signature spikiness to prevent it from ever feeling predictable." [...] Jacob Hall of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying, [...] "Schumer raises Apatow's game beautifully. Her biting, pitch-black wit and his penchant for character-driven comedy go together like gin and tonic." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying [...] "Sweet is not how Schumer wants Trainwreck to go down. She wants to explode rom-com clichés and replace them with something fierce and ready to rumble. Done." ...|$|E
