5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, {{and published in}} its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E

25|$|The {{compactness}} theorem {{states that}} {{a set of}} first-order sentences has a model {{if and only if}} every finite subset of it has a model. This implies that if a formula <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms, then it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of some finite number of those axioms. This theorem was proved first by Kurt Gödel {{as a consequence of the}} completeness theorem, but many additional proofs have been obtained over time. It is a central tool in model theory, providing a fundamental method for constructing models.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, a theorem is a {{statement}} that has been proved {{on the basis of}} previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{concurrent}} {{logic programming}} {{is based on}} message passing and consequently {{is subject to the}} same indeterminacy as other concurrent message-passing systems, such as Actors (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). Carl Hewitt has argued that, concurrent logic programming is not based on logic in his sense that computational steps cannot be logically deduced. However, in concurrent logic programming, any result of a terminating computation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of the program, and any partial result of a partial computation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of the program and the residual goal (process network). Consequently, the indeterminacy of computations implies that not all logical consequences of the program can be deduced.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} creationists have blurred the {{boundaries}} between their disputes over {{the truth of the}} underlying facts, and explanatory theories, of evolution, with their purported philosophical and moral consequences.

25|$|A {{theory is}} {{consistent}} {{if it is}} not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. A theory is complete if, for every formula in its signature, either that formula or its negation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of the axioms of the theory. Gödel's incompleteness theorem shows that effective first-order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete.|$|E
25|$|For {{refutation}} tableaux, {{the objective}} is to show that the negation of a formula cannot be satisfied. There are rules for handling each of the usual connectives, starting with the main connective. In many cases, applying these rules causes the subtableau to divide into two. Quantifiers are instantiated. If any branch of a tableau leads to an evident contradiction, the branch closes. If all branches close, the proof is complete and the original formula <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> truth.|$|E

25|$|Formal theorems {{consist of}} {{formulas}} {{of a formal}} language and the transformation rules of a formal system. Specifically, a formal theorem is always the last formula of a derivation in some formal system each formula of which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of the formulas that came before it in the derivation. The initially accepted formulas in the derivation are called its axioms, and are the basis on which the theorem is derived. A set of theorems is called a theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a proof is formalized {{in the field of}} {{mathematical}} logic. A formal proof is written in a formal language instead of a natural language. A formal proof is defined as sequence of formulas in a formal language, in which each formula <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>logical</b> consequence of preceding formulas. Having a definition of formal proof makes the concept of proof amenable to study. Indeed, the field of proof theory studies formal proofs and their properties, for example, the property that a statement has a formal proof. An application of proof theory is to show that certain undecidable statements are not provable.|$|E

The logical axioms consist of several axiom schemas of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only modus ponens and universal generalization as rules of inference.|$|E
