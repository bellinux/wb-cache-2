50|$|Another {{recent study}} has claimed water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake, {{depositing}} gold. When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a <b>fault.</b> <b>Water</b> often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs. About 6 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface, under incredible temperatures and pressures, the water carries {{high concentrations of}} carbon dioxide, silica, and gold. During an earthquake, the fault jog suddenly opens wider. The water inside the void instantly vaporizes, flashing to steam and forcing silica, which forms the mineral quartz, and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces.|$|E

Four types of water hazards caused by faults were given, i. e. transverse inrushing water hazard, vertical conducting water hazard, overflowing water hazard from floor and bursting water hazard from roof. Aiming at hydro-geological characteristics of faults and different types of water hazards, water control technologies and methods were proposed, including in advance pre-dewatering and drainage, directional guided inclination detection and transformation of key interval by grouting as well as remaining scientifically water-proof coal/rock pillars, which has important significance for reducing coal pillar left for fault and increasing recovery of coal resources...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of different fault dip angle on fault activation under different mining conditions, the supporting pressure distribution model of corresponding working face is established and the formula of stress on the fault plane is also derived. Combined with the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion, the essay summarizes the critical factor of fault rock yield activation (N f). The contributions of fault dip angle and base disturbance to critical factors are further analyzed. At the same time, by using FLAC software, the rules of different inclined fault in mining whose floor of the plastic zone around the propagation and the variation of the stress field characteristics are analyzed. The simulation results showed that connected condition of floor plastic zone and the regularity influence floor water inrush. The research shows: small obliquity faults and shallow area faults {{are more likely to}} be activated, and small obliquity faults are more susceptible to affect disturbance leading to the bottom of plastic failure. The results would have an important value to preventing against <b>fault</b> <b>water</b> inrush accident and projecting the waterproof pillar...|$|E

25|$|Water is {{important}} in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most rocks, and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of <b>faulting.</b> <b>Water</b> in the mantle {{is responsible for the}} melt that produces volcanoes at subduction zones. On the surface of the Earth, water {{is important}} in both chemical and physical weathering processes.

40|$|Determining the source, {{transport}} and fate or crustal fluids {{is an important}} problem in modern geoscience. Crustal fluids affect rheology and rock deformation through water-rock interaction at elevated temperatures and pressures. Geothermal resources are a globally significant source of low-carbon energy, and their associated hydrothermal systems {{are responsible for the}} formation of most of the world's precious metal deposits. Knowing where fluids originate in the crust, what flow paths they follow, and the conditions under which they discharge to the surface is essential to understanding how rocks, water and volatiles interact. This thesis explores the low-enthalpy warm springs present on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand, an anomalous and understudied example of upper-crustal fluid flow in one of the world's most active orogens. Geochemical tracing of the water in conjunction with soil-gas flux surveying has been applied to three selected localities, Motukarara, Rapaki Bay, and Hillsborough Valley to ascertain the warm spring’s origin and source of heat. This thesis shows the Banks Peninsula warm springs to be an eastward extension of the metamorphic-hydrothermal system associated with the Alpine <b>Fault.</b> <b>Water</b> δ 18 O, δD, δ 13 C and soil-gas δ 13 C values are consistent with a metamorphic hydrothermal system dominated by meteoric water, similar to the Alpine fault hot-springs system. Analyses of the warm springs’ gas and water isotopic and geochemical compositions reveal similar type waters to the Alpine Fault hydrothermal system that has mixed with local Canterbury Aquifer System (CAS) waters. Low temporal variance, combined with the elevated temperatures and localised nature of the Banks Peninsula warm springs suggests a strong structural control on the upper crust fluid flow of this system...|$|E

Most of the gas in the cavity is composed of steam; its volume decreases dramatically as the temperature falls and the steam condenses. There are however other gases, mostly carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which do not condense and remain gaseous. The carbon dioxide is produced by thermal decomposition of carbonates, hydrogen is created by reaction of iron and other metals from the nuclear device and surrounding equipment. The amount of carbonates and water in the soil and the available iron {{have to be considered}} in evaluating the test site containment; water-saturated clay soils may cause structural collapse and venting. Hard basement rock may reflect shock waves of the explosion, also possibly causing structural weakening and venting. The noncondensible gases may stay absorbed in the pores in the soil.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{construction}} of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements (JPCPs) in Chile, {{it was observed that}} joints remained uncracked. The objectives of this paper are to evaluate the effects of uncracked joints (UnCrJ) in JPCPs and to propose possible solutions or improvements to avoid or minimize this phenomenon. Considering low thermal amplitude as cause of UnCrJ, a rational-based, detailed and empirically validated model is used to predict UnCrJ and crack width. The modelled results are not only due to material changes but also to the location of the series of cracks in time in the JPCP system. The paper contributes with this rational approach, instead of an empirical-simplified one, to achieve the objectives. For the modelled conditions, the "as-built" slab length range is 8 m to 56 m instead of the 4 m designed one. Then, more curling, joint <b>faulting,</b> <b>water</b> infiltration in sealed joints and load transfer efficiency &# 8804; 70 % are expected. The alternative solutions proposed are associated to innovations as short joints spacing, unsealed joints and saw-cuts up to 50 % thickness made with thin blade (&# 8804; 3 mm), which was verified with new field evidence provided in the article...|$|R

40|$|The Euganean Hills of North East Italy {{have long}} been {{recognised}} as an area characterized by a higher than average natural radiation background. This is due to two main reasons: a) primary lithogenic radiation due to rhyolitic and trachytic outcrops, which are "acidic alkaline" magmatic rocks potentially enriched in uranium and thorium; b) secondary sources related to a geothermal field - widely exploited for spa tourism in the area since the Roman age - producing surface release of radon-enriched fluids. Though radioactivity levels in the Euganean district have been often investigated in the past - including recent works aimed at assessing the radiation doses from radon and/or total gamma radiation - no effort has been put so far into producing a thorough assessment linking radiation protection data to geological-structural features (lithology, <b>faults,</b> <b>water,</b> organic matter content, etc.). This work represents {{the first part of}} the interdisciplinary project "Geological and geochemical control on Radon occurrence and natural radioactivity in the Euganean Hills district (North-Eastern Italy) ", aimed at producing detailed results of the actual radiation levels in connection mainly with lithological parameters. A detailed sampling strategy, based on lithostratigraphy, petrology and mineralogy, has been adopted. The 151 rock samples collected were analyzed by high resolution γ-ray spectrometry with ex situ HPGe detectors. Statistical and geostatistical analyses were performed, and outlier values of U and Th - possibly associated with anomalies in the geological formation - were identified. U, Th and K concentration maps were developed using both the entire database and then again after expunging the outliers; the two were then compared. In all maps the highest values can be associated to trachyte and rhyolite lithologies, and the lowest ones to sedimentary formations. The external dose due to natural radionuclides in the soil - the so called terrestrial gamma dose rate - has been calculated using the U, Th and K distribution measured in the bedrock samples...|$|R
