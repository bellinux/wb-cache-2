40|$|A {{review is}} given {{of the results}} of first {{principles}} calculations used to investigate the structures and electronic properties of screw and edge dislocations in GaN. The atoms {{at the core of the}} full <b>core</b> <b>screw</b> dislocation possess heavily strained bonds leading to deep gap states. Removing the first shell of Ga and N atoms gives a screw dislocation with a small open core consisting of { 101 - 0 } type surfaces. Therefore open-core screw dislocations induce only shallow gap states. In the same way we found the core of the threading edge dislocation to be reconstructed without any deep states. The interaction of oxygen with the <b>cores</b> of open-core <b>screw</b> and edge dislocations is considered and it is found that the impurity has a strong tendency to be bound by Ga vacancies leading to three types of defect trapped in the strain field.

In this paper, we discuss high resolution imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy studies which show that open <b>core</b> <b>screw</b> dislocations in GaN films grown by hydride vapour phase epitaxy have surfaces that are substituted by oxygen. It is argued that open core formation is not primarily driven by the need to reduce strain field energy, but is influenced by kinetic factors, with oxygen stabilising the open core surfaces and acting as a growth inhibitor. It is pointed out that impurity segregation can explain a range of observed dislocation core structures in GaN.

This paper reviews the limited present understanding of the operational impact of various crystal defects on SiC electrical devices. Aside from micropipes and triangular inclusions whose densities have been shrinking towards manageably small values in recent years, many of these defects appear to have little adverse operational and/or yield impact on SiC-based sensors, high-frequency RF, and signal conditioning electronics. However high-power switching devices used in power management and distribution circuits have historically (in silicon experience) demanded the highest material quality for prolonged safe operation, and are thus more susceptible to operational reliability problems that arise from electrical property nonuniformities likely to occur at extended crystal defects.

The voids are pyramids with symmetric hexagonal { 0001 } base facets and { 101 ¯ 1 } side facets.

STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy spectrum imaging showed a large C concentration inside the void and on the void surfaces. There is also a larger C concentration in the GaN (or InGaN) below the void than above the void. We propose that inadvertent carbon deposition during metal organic chemical vapor deposition growth acts as a mask, stopping the GaN deposition locally, which in combination with lateral overgrowth, creates a void.

Atomistic simulations of the <b>core</b> structure of <b>screw</b> dislocations in elastically anisotropic Mo are carried out using Bond Order Potentials. These simulations take account automatically {{of the effects of the}} surface relaxation displacements (anisotropic Eshelby twist). They show that the differential displacements of the atoms at the surface are different with components perpendicular to the Burgers vector about five times larger than those in the middle of the foil, the latter being characteristic of the bulk. Nye tensor plots show that the surface relaxation stresses strongly affect the incompatible distortions. HREM simulations of the computed structure reflect the displacements at the exit surface, modified by interband scattering and the microscope transfer function. Nye tensor plots obtained from the HREM images show that interband scattering also affects the incompatible distortions. It is concluded that it would be very difficult to obtain information on the <b>core</b> structure of <b>screw</b> dislocations in the bulk Mo from HREM images, even under ideal experimental conditions, and that quantitative comparisons between experimental and simulated images from assumed model structures would be essential...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the microstructure of GaN and InGaN/GaN and to examine electric fields around the defects, and across the quantum wells by electron holography. For this reason different types of GaN and InGaN/GaN samples have been prepared and studied. Conventional transmission electron microscopy has been used for structural study of two MBE grown GaN/GaAs samples, grown at room temperature and at 340 deg C. The structure of the samples were found to be hexagonal polycrystalline in an amorphous GaN matrix, and textured hexagonal polycrystalline material respectively. The experimental results indicate that the higher growth temperature results in a more crystalline material with a higher density of bigger grain sizes. Different types of undoped and Si doped GaN/Sapphire samples were studied, with respect to the defect structure in GaN films. GaN was found to be a highly defective material with a dislocation density of 10 " 9 /cm" 2. The majority of the dislocations are edge dislocations. It has been found that nanopipes are open <b>core</b> <b>screw</b> dislocations, and the population and size of the nanopipes is proportional to the Si doping concentration. Dislocation structures were found to depend on the Si doping level in the material, with higher Si doping giving a lower density of dislocations with a more random distribution. In addition some EELS, EDX and HRTEM have been performed on the nanopipes and dislocations in order to investigate Si segregation in the defects. In MBE grown GaN/In_ 0 _. _ 1 Ga_ 0 _. _ 9 N/GaN SQWs and MQWs, V shaped defects were found to be present in the InGaN regions, which locally reduced the width of the InGaN layers.

40|$|We {{present results}} of highly {{localized}} electron energy loss spectroscopy carried out using scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} in the energy loss regime at band gap and at the nitrogen near-edge structure of cross-sectional GaN, InGaN, and Al(Ga) N structures. We specifically attempt to determine changes in the intensity distribution and the onset energy of the inelastic scattering (the band-gap-related energy), of heterointerfaces, of quantum wells and of dislocations. We have used ab initio calculations within the local-density approximation to density-functional theory of the GaN and AlN band structure to simulate low electron energy loss spectra. Tests in which these were compared to experimental low loss spectra of pure GaN and AlN show good agreement in the position and shape of the spectral features. We then compare the positions of the onset energies on traversing interfaces of single AlN and AlGaN quantum wells as well as of GaInN and GaAlN multiple quantum well structures to the pure GaN and AlN spectra. We have been able to map relative changes in band-gap related energies of isolated interfaces and quantum wells, while the energy loss near edge structure allowed us to monitor relative changes in multiple layered structures of less than 5 -nm separation. Reasons for the different sensitivities towards the above features, when measured in different energy regimes, are discussed. Following on from this we study the scattering intensity around onset and the position of the onset energy in locations along projection lines of isolated dislocations. Low loss spectrum calculations of dislocated regions reveal band-gap states associated with all dislocation types in GaN. The related pre-band-gap scattering intensity at 3. 3 eV of the simulated spectra, in particular for the full <b>core</b> <b>screw</b> dislocation is in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings.

The [001] screw dislocation is shown to exhibit a low-energy non-planar core. It is suggested that for this dislocation to move its core may need to change structure and form a high-energy planar structure similar to that derived from the Peierls-Nabarro model.

40|$|Based on the atomistic studies {{presented}} in Part I we develop analytical yield criteria for single crystals that capture {{the effect of}} shear stresses other than the Schmid stress (non-glide stresses) on the shear stress needed for dislocation glide (Peierls stress).

Employing these criteria we identify the operative slip systems for tensile/compressive loading along various axes within the standard stereographic triangle and determine the ensuing tension-compression asymmetry. This result is in an excellent qualitative agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, using the constructed yield criteria within the Taylor homogenization procedure, we demonstrate that effects associated with non-planar <b>cores</b> of <b>screw</b> dislocations persist in random polycrystals.

One potential fabrication method involves deep drawing cup-like shapes form slices of an ingot containing only a few grains.

40|$|The Schmid law, {{which has}} been ubiquitously {{utilized}} in large-scale continuum computations, asserts that only the shear stress acting in the slip plane in the slip direction controls the plastic deformation. This rule is accurate for fcc metals {{but it does not}} apply in bcc metals owing to the spacial spreading of the <b>core</b> of <b>screw</b> dislocations that control their plastic deformation. In this paper we present resulsts of atomic-level simulations of the effect of externally applied stresses on 1 / 2 [1 1 1] screw dislocations in molybdenum.

These are shear stresses parallel to the Burgers vector in other { 1 1 0 } planes of the [1 1 1] zone as well as shear stresses perpendicular to the Burgers vector acting in { 1 1 0 } planes. We thus identify three distinct non-glide shear stresses that affect the glide of 1 / 2 screw dislocations and formulate single crystal yield criteria that include the effects of these stress components. This forms a basis for multislip yield criteria and flow relations for continuum analyses.

40|$|In principle, the {{macroscopic}} plasticity {{properties of}} crystalline materials are derivable {{from the physical}} processes involving dislocations and interactions between dislocations with other defects. However, a quantitative theory of plasticity based on the dislocation mechanism requires crossing multiple length and time scales. To accommodate these requirements, we developed a multiscale approach for modeling crystalline solids. In this thesis, to establish the connections between simulations in different length and time scales, I mainly focus on identifying and determining the importance and influence of various unit processes involving the dislocations through atomic level simulations. These unit processes in turn {{play a major role}} in modeling the single crystal plasticity. Key Results from Atomistic Simulations Dislocation core structure and core energy: Using the first-principles qEAM force field (FF), we determine the core energy for 1 / 2 a screw dislocation and 1 / 2 a edge dislocation in bcc Ta. We find that the core energy of edge dislocation is 1. 77 times higher than that of screw dislocation. This ratio (1. 77) is a fundamental material property used as input to the macroscopic model. Furthermore, we find that the central 12 atoms closest to the 1 / 2 a screw dislocation line have distinguishably higher atomistic strain energy than the other atoms. Thus, we arrive at a physical definition of dislocation <b>core.</b> <b>Screw</b> dislocation mobility: In this thesis, we proposed a new method to investigate dislocation mobility by analyzing the process of migration of a screw dislocation dipole. The new method is based on the energy distribution at the atomistic scale and is used to calculate the Peierls potential barrier and Peierls stress for dislocation continuous motion. The calculated Peierls stress is in good agreement with results obtained using other method. Simulating dislocation motion at finite temperatures (from 20 K to 300 K), we find that the activation energy for dislocation motion is about 6 times lower than computed at 0. 001 K. Our results suggest that the decrease in the correlation between neighboring segments in the dislocation line accounts for the decrease of activation energy. We observe that the formation of kink pair along the dislocation line enhances the dislocation mobility. This verifies the traditional belief that the screw dislocation in bcc metals moves by first kink pair nucleation and subsequently lateral movements of kinks along the dislocation. Kinks in screw dislocations: To bridge the atomistic process of dislocation motion with continuum model, we accurately calculate the material properties, such as kink pair formation energy and effective kink pair length, using atomic level simulations. In detailed structural analysis, we discover the substructures of different kinks when the <b>screw</b> dislocation <b>core</b> is asymmetric. There are only two kinds of elementary kinks in the dislocation and the others are the composite kinks consisting of an elementary kink and one or two flips. Based on these findings, we further explain the observed trend of the formation energy and mobility of different classes of kinks. (Note: Similar trend and conclusion could have been found in earlier studies but not mentioned by the authors of those papers.) In summary, we have used quantum mechanics based interaction potentials to investigate the unit processes that play important role in single crystal plasticity and verified the findings using the quantitative results obtained from the atomic level simulation in a macroscopic model for single crystal plasticity. ...|$|R

Insertion and removal of pedicle screws is sometimes necessary during surgical procedure to assess {{the integrity of the}} pilot-hole wall. However, this maneuver may compromise the implant-holding capacity. Methods. Sixty thoracolombar vertebrae (T 13 -L 5), harvested from 10 healthy calves, were used to insert 2 different designs of pedicle screws: cylindrical (5. 0 -mm outer diameter) and dual-core screws (5. 2 -mm outer diameter). Three experimental groups were created {{on the basis of the}} number of insertions of the screws and 2 subgroups were established according to the <b>core</b> pedicle <b>screw</b> design (dual-core and cylindrical). The insertion torque was measured during initial insertion, second insertion, and third insertion. Pullout screw tests were performed using a universal testing machine to evaluate the pullout strength after initial insertion, second insertion, and third insertion. Results. Significant reductions of 38 % in mean insertion torque and 30 % in mean pullout strength of dual-core screw were observed between the initial insertion and the third insertion. The cylindrical screw observed significant reductions of 52. 5 % in mean insertion torque and 42. 3 % in mean pullout strength between the initial insertion and the third insertion.

However, the risk of miniimplant failure {{is one of the}} most important issues, especially the rupture of its structure referred to as fracture, mainly due to metal deficiencies. This study analyzed the internal microstructure of orthodontic mini-implants, ascertaining the composition of the metal to detect possible discontinuities from the surface to the <b>core</b> of the <b>screws.</b> Eighteen samples of mini-implants, of 3 different brands, were obtained. The samples were cold-embedded in methyl methacrylate polymer, and were sectioned both longitudinally (3 samples of each brand) and transversely (the other 3 screws of each brand). After preparation, the samples were observed using a light microscope at up to 2, 000 x magnification. The results showed that the mini-implants thus analyzed were composed of an Alpha-Beta globular phase of titanium alloy, patterns A 1 and A 9 (in accordance with the "Technical Committee of European Titanium Producers"). The miniimplants did not present any defects such as bubbles, imperfections or fissures, in either longitudinal or transverse sections, in their internal microstructure. All samples met the requirements of international norms. Orthodontists must be aware of the metal composition and internal microstructure of mini-implants, to decrease the risk of fractures...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} screw dislocations in Hydride-Vapor-Phase-Epitaxy (HVPE) {{template}} and Molecular-Beam-Epitaxy (MBE) over-layers was performed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) in plan-view and in cross-section. It was observed that screw dislocations in the HVPE layers were decorated by small voids arranged along the screw axis. However, no voids were observed along screw dislocations in MBE overlayers. This was true both for MBE samples grown under Ga-lean and Ga-rich conditions. Dislocation core structures {{have been studied}} in these samples in the plan-view configuration. These experiments were supported by image simulation using the most recent models. A direct reconstruction of the phase and amplitude of the scattered electron wave from a focal series of high-resolution images was applied. It was shown that the <b>core</b> structures of <b>screw</b> dislocations in the studied materials were filled. The filed dislocation cores in an MBE samples were stoichiometric. However, in HVPE materials, single atomic columns show substantial differences in intensities and might indicate the possibility of higher Ga concentration in the core than in the matrix. A much lower intensity of the atomic column {{at the tip of}} the void was observed. This might suggest presence of lighter elements, such as oxygen, responsible for their formation...|$|R
40|$|The glide of a {{dislocation}} is {{the fundamental}} process of plastic deformation in crystalline solids. For body-centered-cubic (bcc) metals, the three-fold <b>core</b> dissociation of <b>screw</b> dislocations has attracted much attention and investigation. In this paper, we present a molecular dynamics study of glide of edge dislocations in bcc tungsten and molybdenum. On the { 110 } glide planes, the Peierls-Nabarro stress (PNS) of the edge dislocation {{is found to be}} (3. 75 - 5. 0) x 10 - 4 *m and (1. 25 - 2. 50) x 10 - 4 *m for tungsten and molybdenum, respectively, where *m is the shear modulus. On the glide planes { 1 1 2 }, these two numbers are (8. 13 - 8. 75) x 10 - 4 *m and (3. 75 - 5. 0) x 10 - 4 *m along one direction, and (1. 13 - 1. 38) x 10 - 3 *m and (6. 25 - 8. 75) x 10 - 4 *m along the opposite direction. The asymmetry of the PNS on the { 112 } planes is attributed to the asymmetrical dislocation core structure. During the glide process on { 110 } planes, the three constituent planes of an edge dislocation displace in sequence. The glide on { 112 } planes involve two such subsequent displacements, since the core consists of two non-equivalent planes...|$|R
40|$|The main {{theme of}} this thesis is {{development}} of potentials that are a necessary precursor for computer simulations of lattice defects in TiAl at atomic level. Extended defects, such as dislocations and stacking-fault type defects, {{play an important role}} in controlling the overall mechanical behavior of crystalline materials. Understanding their key structural properties at the atomistic level is a necessary prerequisite for gaining a deeper insight into the macroscopic scale deformation processes. The main focus of the computer simulation presented in this work is on studying the core structure of dislocations in L 10 TiAl. Results of atomistic simulation of dislocation cores provide then a framework for analyzing the experimentally observed deformation modes in this material. An appropriate description of atomic interactions is needed for physically meaningful computer simulation studies. For this purpose a substantial part of this thesis was devoted to the development of the Bond order potentials (BOP) for TiAl. BOP represents a semi-empirical real-space tight-binding based scheme that is computationally efficient and at the same time capable to capture directionality of bonding arising from the unfilled d band in this material. The new BOP for TiAl was extensively tested and its ability to describe different bonding environments in both TiAl and Ti 3 Al demonstrated. Using this potential the core structures and possible dissociations of both the ordinary 1 / 2 〈 101] dislocation and the 〈 101] superdislocation were investigated together with the energies of stacking fault type defects participating in dislocation splitting. Our results for the ordinary 1 / 2 〈 110] dislocations indicate the existence of a non-planar <b>core</b> for <b>screw</b> and 60 degrees mixed dislocations. This core structure renders these dislocations sessile. In the case of the 101 it is observed to dissociate into partial dislocations and the two following configurations were found in our simulations 101 = 1 / 6 112 +SISF+ 1 / 210 1 +CSF+ 1 / 621 1 101 = 1 / 6112 +SISF 111 + 1 / 3201 +S ISF 111 1 / 6112 A planar configuration and a configuration spreading into two intersecting { 111 } type planes, which is, presumably, sessile. ...|$|R
40|$|For the {{calculation}} of bottom protection in harbours near quay-walls, analytical formulas are used. The current experiences suggest an overestimation of load on the harbour bottom. Extensive measurements in prototype situations are very expensive. For this reason, {{the use of a}} computer model will be far more economical. However, at this moment there is no expertise in the use of numerical models for this type of situation. For this reason, a physical model was made to validate the use of the numerical model. The results of the measurements of Nielsen were not conclusive, because the two models did not match. A sensitivity analysis of the numerical model showed that the model is sensitive to changes in the geometry. Especially the changes to the geometry of the bowthruster caused large differences in {{the calculation}} results of the model. For the thruster outflow to be modelled accurately, measurements needed {{to be done in the}} physical model. Measurements are executed in a scale model, velocities and turbulence are measured with a Vectrino around the bow truster. The measurements revealed an unexpected aspect of the flow situation. The low velocity <b>core</b> behind the <b>screw</b> axis was expected to collapse within a certain distance. The measurement results show the core to exist beyond this distance and its contribution to the distribution of the velocities from the bowthruster. Even though this raises new questions, the adaptations to the bowthruster in the numerical model, reproduced the outflow of the physical model. The calculation results of this model were very comparable to the flow situation measured in the physical model. This gives some confidence for the use of the ke-model for modelling bowthruster-induced flows. It also shows the importance of modelling the bowthruster. When the outflow of the bowthruster does not match reality, large deviations are expected...|$|R
