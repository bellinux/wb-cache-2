This was considered acceptable when {{voltage and current}} distortion levels were low and the old, well known induction meters were used.

Electromagnetic interference has been observed between active infeed converters as used in photo-voltaic systems and static meters.

Three-phase meters showed large deviations, even when supplied with an ideal sinusoidal voltage from a four-quadrant power amplifier.

40|$|Electric <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> are {{designed}} to account energy under sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal conditions, because both, old and new standards for <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> require testing their accuracy under different conditions.

This paper discusses calibration problems of <b>electronic</b> revenue <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> for direct connection and for connection through current transformers, and it proposes a new calibration procedure which reproduces normal operating conditions better: three-phase configurations of measurement systems, load range during meter testing or shapes of test signals. Recently, modern Electrical Power Standards, also known as Power Calibrators, enable automatic testing of various types of electrical devices, including electricity meters in their normal operating conditions. This article presents examples of single and multi position fully automatic test systems, which employ Power/Energy Calibrator from Poland as the precision source with programmed waveforms of three phase voltages up to 560 V and currents up to 120 A conforming to EN 50470, or with random waveforms generated by PC software random wave generator.

5000|$|Ideally, {{the primary}} and {{secondary}} currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, phase shifts of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have phase shifts up to six degrees. [...] For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as ammeters only display {{the magnitude of the}} current. However, in wattmeters, <b>energy</b> <b>meters,</b> and power factor meters, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. At zero power factor, any indicated power is entirely due to the current transformer's phase error.

40|$|Government of Sri Lanka spends {{large amounts}} of money to {{implement}} Rural Electrification (RE) schemes with the support of concessionary loans from various funding agencies such as Asian Development Bank, Japanese Bank of International Corporation and Kuwait Fund. The expectation of the government is to develop rural areas by providing electricity to those areas and enhance the living standards of rural people. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the implemented RE schemes and to examine whether the desired targets have been achieved as planned in the initial stage and the reasons for failures if expected results have not been achieved, and to propose corrective actions to overcome those problems. Nine RE schemes were selected from Kalutara, Monaragala and Badulla districts which are implemented in the period of year 1998 to year 2000 by CEB under Project - RE 3 funded by Asian Development Bank for investigation. 1. Social and Economical development achieved by these schemes 2. Technical problems related to these schemes and reliability of electricity supply. The present situations of these schemes were investigated through a structured survey and compared the results with expectation of the planning stage. At the occasions of present results are deviated from the expected targets, corrective actions are proposed for implementation in existing RE schemes and also in future RE schemes. The development in social and economic benefits in the villages due to rural electrification schemes can be summarized as, Achievement on economic benefits, poverty alleviation, household benefits, education level, community benefits and incentive to build houses are found to be satisfactory. Improvements on employment opportunities, small industries, commercial and agricultural activities and health services are found to be not satisfactory. Migration of villagers to urban areas was reduced and no harmful environmental effects are observed. It is further revealed that reliability of electricity supply provided for rural villages are not satisfactory, Energy losses are considerably high, Load factor, Power factor and All-day efficiency of RE substations are at acceptable levels, Safety levels provided by the RE schemes are fairly low, The effectiveness of RE schemes were considerably reduced due to above technical reasons.
