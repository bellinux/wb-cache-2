5|$|Further {{south in}} Mali, the Great Mosque of Djenné, a {{dramatic}} example of Sahel mudbrick architecture. {{was built in}} 1907, based {{on the design of}} an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280.

5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They <b>had</b> <b>let</b> her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E

5|$|The end of Austrian {{dominance}} of the German states shifted Austria's attention to the Balkans. In 1867, the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph accepted a settlement (the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867) in which he gave his Hungarian holdings equal status with his Austrian domains, creating the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The Peace of Prague (1866) offered lenient terms to Austria, in which Austria's relationship with the new nation-state of Italy underwent major restructuring; although the Austrians were far more successful in the military field against Italian troops, the monarchy lost the important province of Venetia. The Habsburgs ceded Venetia to France, which then formally transferred control to Italy. The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded Revanche pour Sadová ("Revenge for Sadova"), illustrating anti-Prussian sentiment in France—a problem that would accelerate {{in the months leading}} up to the Franco-Prussian War. The Austro-Prussian War also damaged relations with the French government. At a meeting in Biarritz in September 1865 with Napoleon III, Bismarck <b>had</b> <b>let</b> it be understood (or Napoleon had thought he understood) that France might annex parts of Belgium and Luxembourg in exchange for its neutrality in the war. These annexations did not happen, resulting in animosity from Napoleon towards Bismarck.|$|E

25|$|In the Harry Potter franchise, the Trolls {{are strong}} creatures and {{are listed as}} XXXX by the Ministry of Magic's {{classification}} on them. There were different types of trolls ranging from Forest Trolls, Mountain Trolls, and River Trolls.

In the other books, there are Security Trolls that are skillfully trained to guard several wizarding locations.|$|E

He scored 17 as Australia reached 8/226 before the match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's was washed out with not even one innings completed.

25|$|On {{the verge}} of his {{greatest}} triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that Moore wanted to leave West Ham. Moore <b>had</b> <b>let</b> his contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of Sir Alf Ramsey and realisation he was technically ineligible to play, did he re-sign with West Ham {{to allow him to}} captain the England team of 1966. Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager Ron Greenwood to England's hotel and told the two of them to resolve their differences and get a contract signed up.|$|E
25|$|Assuming that Bismarck {{would not}} object, the French {{government}} {{was shocked to}} learn that instead Bismarck, Prussia and the North German Confederation were threatening war should the sale be completed. Napoleon III <b>had</b> <b>let</b> precious months peel away in trying to complete the transaction, allowing Bismarck time to rally support to Prussia's objection. To mediate the dispute, the United Kingdom hosted the London Conference (1867) attended by all European great powers. It confirmed Luxembourg's independence from the Netherlands and guaranteed its independence from all other powers. War {{appeared to have been}} averted, at the cost of thwarting French desires.|$|E
25|$|In 1704, Chastelein bought another land {{which later}} he named Weltevreden.

It can not be a coincidence that Chastelein <b>had</b> <b>let</b> this family work in Depok, slave families like Laurens and Loen from Ambon. During the period he wrote a dissertation in which he established an ethical manifestation against Dutch East India Company's merchant politics, especially toward Governor General Willem van Outhoorn, who was in favor of aggressive trade policy.|$|E

25|$|A first innings lead of 248 placed great {{pressure}} on the English batsmen, but their combined experience counted when it was required, and their captain David Gower led the fight-back with a well made 106. Robin Smith was unluckily dismissed for 96. However it was again Terry Alderman's turn with 6 for 128, 4 of them LBWs achieved through either dead straight balls or - his speciality - the late swing from leg stump making them virtually straight balls that the batsmen played across. England had made a solid 359, but their first innings <b>had</b> <b>let</b> them down, and it left Australia with a comfortable target of 117 runs for victory on the last day.|$|E
25|$|While {{his home}} in Earlysville {{was placed in the}} 5th District, {{represented}} by Lewis F.

But state Republican leaders <b>had</b> <b>let</b> it be known that he could not expect any support for his planned run for governor in 1993 if he made such a challenge. Allen decided not to run in either district. After Democratic U.S. Rep. James Olin of the 6th district decided to retire, there was speculation Allen could run there. But he decided not to move his family and run in the 6th district either.|$|E
25|$|The fall of Jerusalem, and {{the death}} of Sibylla at the Siege of Acre in 1190, led to a dispute over the throne of the kingdom. Balian's {{stepdaughter}} Isabella was now rightful queen, but Guy refused to concede his title, and Isabella's husband Humphrey—who <b>had</b> <b>let</b> her cause down in 1186—remained loyal to him. If Isabella were to succeed, she needed a politically acceptable and militarily competent husband, the obvious candidate being Conrad of Montferrat, who also had some claim as Baldwin V's paternal uncle. Balian and Maria seized Isabella and talked her into agreeing to a divorce. There were precedents: the annulment of Amalric I's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, and the unsuccessful attempts to force Sibylla to divorce Guy.|$|E
