2500|$|Much of this {{legislation}} was consolidated into the Equality Act 2010, the bulk of which entered into force in October 2010, which also introduces an [...] "equality duty" [...] requiring public bodies to have due regard {{to the need to}} eliminate discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to foster good relations between people. It also imposes a duty on public bodies to publish information about compliance with the equality duty and to set equality objectives. In addition, the Act clarifies existing legislation and simplifies the definition of direct discrimination, extends the definitions of <b>indirect</b> <b>discrimination</b> and harassment, regulates pay secrecy clauses in employment contracts and the use of health questionnaires by employers. It also gives employment tribunals new powers to make recommendations to employers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the basic framework for <b>indirect</b> <b>discrimination</b> is found for the issue of equal pay between men and women. Because the Equal Pay Act 1970 preceded other legislation, {{and so did the}} TFEU article 157, {{there has always been a}} separate body of rules. It is not entirely clear why this should continue, particularly because in several respects it is harder to bring equal pay claims on grounds of gender than for other protected characteristics, meaning that the task of closing the gender pay gap is frustrated compared to race, sexual orientation or other grounds. First, a claim must relate to [...] "pay", concept which is generally construed widely to encompass any kind of remuneration for work, as well as sick pay or for maternity leave. Second, under the EA 2010 section 79, a comparator must be real, and employed by the same employer, or an associated employer, and at the same establishment, or a different establishment if common terms apply. It is usually harder to find a real comparator than imagine a hypothetical one. Third, under EA 2010 section 65, the claimant must be doing [...] "broadly similar" [...] work to the comparator, or work [...] "rated as equivalent", or work which is of [...] "equal value". These criteria, which at their broadest focus on the [...] "value" [...] of labour, make explicit what a court must take into account, but also potentially constrain the court in a way that the open ended test for <b>indirect</b> <b>discrimination</b> does not. Fourth, under section 128 there is a time limit of six months to bring a claim, but unlike the three-month time limit for other discrimination claims it cannot be extended at the court's discretion. However, equal pay claims do import an [...] "equality clause" [...] into the claimant's contract of employment. This allows a claim to be pursued in the High Court as well as a Tribunal. It is unclear what principle justifies the segregation of unequal pay claims based on sex, compared to all other protected characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum {{levels of}} equal {{treatment}} {{for people with}} part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the [...] "same type of contract" [...] doing [...] "broadly similar work", and {{are in the same}} establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension pro rata was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{discrimination}} {{can arise}} in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an employer not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee {{based on their}} gender. [...] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women. This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for systemic bias. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia. In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender. [...] As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, {{there are two types}} of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and <b>indirect</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt'. Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.|$|E

2500|$|For {{characteristics}} {{other than}} disability, [...] "hard" [...] positive discrimination, through privileged contract terms, hiring and firing based on gender, race, sexuality, belief or age, or setting quotas for underrepresented groups in most jobs, is generally unlawful in the EU. This policy, however, leaves open {{the issue of}} historical disadvantage, and sub-conscious exclusion, {{which may not be}} addressed through ordinary direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>discrimination</b> claims. The EU has permitted [...] "soft" [...] positive action, in contrast to the United States or South Africa, where [...] "affirmative action" [...] operates in many workplaces. Lawful positive action in the EU means, in the case of hiring candidates for work, employers may select someone from an under-represented group, but only if that person has qualifications equal to competitors, with full consideration of the candidate's individual qualities. In Marschall v Land Nordrhein Westfalen a male teacher failed to get a promotion, and a woman did. He complained that the school's policy, to promote women [...] "unless reasons specific to an individual candidate tilt the balance in his favour", was unlawful. The ECJ held the school would not be acting unlawfully if it did in fact follow its policy. By contrast in Abrahamsson and Anderson v Fogelqvist Göteborg University's policy was to hire a woman candidate unless [...] "the difference between the candidates’ qualification is so great that such application would give rise to a breach of the requirement of objectivity". A male candidate, who was not hired over two less qualified women, was successful in claiming discrimination. In addition, according to Re Badeck’s application legitimate positive action measures include quotas in temporary positions, in training, guaranteeing interviews to people with sufficient qualifications, and quotas for people working on representative, administrative or supervisory bodies such as a company's board of directors. This approach, developed initially in ECJ case law, is now reflected in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 157(4) and was put into UK law in the Equality Act 2010 sections 157-158.|$|E
2500|$|Harassment and {{victimisation}} {{cannot be}} justified, but in principle {{there are exceptions}} or justifications for all forms of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Apart from direct age discrimination which can also be objectively justified, the general rule for direct discrimination, elaborated in EA 2010 Schedule 9, is that an employer may only be exempt if it can show that having a worker fit a particular description is a [...] "genuine occupational requirement". This means the (otherwise) discriminatory practice must pursue a legitimate aim {{in terms of the}} nature of the occupation itself (not the employer's business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. The test is stringent. In Etam plc v Rowan a man was turned down for a job at a woman's clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women's change rooms. But this did not count as a genuine occupational requirement because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a genuine occupational requirement, to ensure fitness. Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state's margin of discretion to say being male is a genuine occupational requirement for work in the military. This was even so, in Sirdar v The Army Board & Secretary of State for Defence, for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on [...] "interoperability" [...] meant every member had to be capable of combat. Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job's functions require adherence to an organisation's ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation, Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed from a job as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious [...] "ethos", because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>discrimination,</b> after {{a neutral}} {{practice}} puts {{a member of}} a group at a particular disadvantage, is not made out if there is an [...] "objective justification". In most cases, this will be a justification based on business necessity. The ECJ, mostly in cases concerning sex discrimination under TFEU art 157, has held that an employer must show a [...] "real need" [...] for the practice that has a disparate impact, and it must be [...] "unrelated" [...] to the protected characteristic. The justification should not involve [...] "generalisations" [...] rather than reasons specific to the workers in question, and budgetary considerations alone are not to be considered an [...] "aim". Many foundational judgments concerned employers who gave fewer benefits to part-time staff than full-time staff. Given the particular disadvantage this caused women it was hard to justify. In domestic equal pay claims based on gender, instead of [...] "objective justification", the old terminology still used is that there must be a [...] "genuine material factor", found in EA 2010 section 69. Despite different headings, the same underlying concepts are present as for objective justification, with the need to show a [...] "legitimate aim" [...] and that action is [...] "proportionate" [...] to such an aim. In Clay Cross (Quarry Services) Ltd v Fletcher Lord Denning MR held that an employer could not justify paying a young man a higher wage than an older lady (who in fact trained him) on the basis that this was what the employer had to pay given the state of the job market. However, in Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board the House of Lords held that women NHS prosthetists who were paid 40% less than men prosthetists, who had become contracted through private practices, had no claim because it was agreed that such higher prices were necessary to attract their services. Thus, the [...] "objective justification" [...] was said to be an organisational necessity. In Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority the ECJ held that although a speech therapist being paid less than a male counterpart could not be justified only on the ground that this resulted from different collective agreements, if a disparity came from market forces, this was an objective justification. It has, however, been emphasised that the legislation's purpose is to achieve equal pay, and not fair wages. So in Strathclyde RC v Wallace the House of Lords held that women teachers who had to fill in for an absent male head master were not entitled to be paid the same during that time. This was a different job. It has also been asserted that collective agreements designed to incrementally make a transition to equal pay between jobs rated as equivalent cannot be justified, and can even result in liability for the union that concluded them. Unlike other protected characteristics, under EA 2010 section 13(2), direct age discrimination is open to justification on the same principles, on the basis that everyone will go through the ageing process. This has meant, primarily, that older workers can reach a compulsory retirement age set either by the workplace or the government, on the basis that it is a legitimate way of sharing work between generations.|$|E

40|$|Australian {{nurses are}} {{increasingly}} working part-time. A paucity of research based knowledge about this {{segment of the}} nursing workforce was the impetus for a grounded theory study that recruited a sample of part-time nurses (n= 86) and nurse managers and nurse educators (n= 18) to discover the ‘realities’ of part-time nursing for the regional Queensland context. Embracement of gendered identity constructs led many nurses to choose part-time employment {{as a means to}} balance family work and professional careers. It may be assumed that as nursing is a female dominated profession a feminine organisational culture would be hegemonic and female gendered discrimination would not occur. However part-time nurses, who choose their employment hours because their constructs of feminine identity value a work-family balance, are experiencing notable professional development inequities. This paper argues that though gendered <b>discrimination</b> is prohibited, <b>indirect</b> gendered <b>discrimination</b> may be occurring in plain sight while remaining ‘hidden’ because nursing is a predominantly female profession. The paper uses extant literature to examine study findings related to the <b>indirect</b> gendered <b>discrimination</b> of regional Queensland part-time nurses. The paper suggests that this situation is worthy of exploration because nursing represents a unique profession where females dominate at all hierarchical levels; including higher level positions. Therefore females at higher level positions are discriminating against other females who choose part-time employment because of their feminine identity constructs...|$|R

40|$|The {{prospect}} of a justification defence in cases of direct sex discrimination is universally criticised by academic commentators {{on the ground that}} it would subvert the goal of equality that underlies sex discrimination and equal treatment legislation. At the outset the thesis examines the differences between the sexes, how these differences can be used to explain the distinction between direct and <b>indirect</b> sex <b>discrimination</b> and considers various concepts of equality. Building on various elements of the existing justification defences for <b>indirect</b> sex <b>discrimination</b> and disability discrimination, this thesis constructs a model justification defence. The impact on equality of such a defence is assessed by reference to the main existing legislative exceptions for direct sex discrimination and various judicial exceptions that have been created, in the main, by the European Court of Justice. Further, the thesis considers whether the blanket prohibition against the use of sex stereotypes is warranted {{and the extent to which}} they might be permitted under the model defence. The conclusions reached are that criticism of the potential defence is overstated. Rather than undermining the goal of sex equality, such a defence could in fact enhance the degree of legal protection as long as the criteria of the defence are stringently drawn. Indeed, in relation to some areas of direct sex discrimination, for example pregnancy and maternity, the introduction of such a defence could enhance the degree of equality. Moreover, the introduction of such a defence could introduce a greater degree of openness and clarity into this complex area of law...|$|R
