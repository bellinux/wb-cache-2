40|$|Alpine skiing {{accidents}} {{admitted to}} the Trondheim Regional and University Hospital during one year were recorded. Of the 339 injured, 67 per cent were male and 33 per cent were female. Eighty-seven per cent were outpatients, and 13 per cent were hospitalized. Falling accidents (67 per cent), followed by collision accidents (17 per cent), were {{the most common cause}} of injury. The injuries in the lower extremities were caused by falling and the head injuries were mostly caused by collisions. <b>Knee</b> <b>ligament</b> <b>strains</b> were the most common injuries, and 17 per cent of these were hospitalized and required operative treatment. Of the minor knee strains, all 44 per cent were not fully recovered after two and a half years. Seventeen patients sustained tibial fractures, eleven of them spiral fractures and six transverse fractures. The patients with spiral fractures were younger than the patients with transverse fractures. Head injuries were the most severe injuries, with eleven concussions and two epidural haematomas...|$|R
50|$|During the mid-season Hajduk went on {{a two-week}} tour of Turkey, where they would play four {{friendly}} matches. They drew 0-0 with Austria Wien on 29 January, but three days later they beat Obolon Kyiv 3-2 with goals from brothers Sharbini and Vukušić. During the match with Obolon, Mario Brkljača suffered a <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> <b>strain,</b> meaning he {{would be out of}} action for at least a month. They were held to a 1-1 draw against Dinamo Bucharest as Dinko Trebotić scored the Hajduk goal. Their final game of the tour against Lech Poznań also ended as a 1-1 draw, with Marin Ljubičić scoring the goal. After their return from mid-season preparations in Antalya, Hajduk drew 0-0 with Dugopolje at Stadion Hrvatski vitezovi. On 13 February, Slavia Prague travelled to Split to commemorate the one hundredth year anniversary of Hajduk. Slavia won 2-0 at sold-out Poljud with goals from Karol Kisel and Zoran Milutinović. Five days later, Hajduk defeated Dubrovnik 9-0 in the last game of the mid-season campaign. In their first league game after the winter break, Hajduk drew 0-0 against Inter Zaprešić at Poljud.|$|R
40|$|The lolotte or drop-knee {{technique}} {{is a fundamental}} of rock climbing that particularly involves lower limbs, and especially knee joints. To the authors' best knowledge, no biomechanical analysis of the lolotte seems to have ever been conducted, despite its widespread use. As a first contribution to this research topic, the present work deals with an athlete-specific kinematic analysis of the lolotte aimed at quantifying the hip and knee joint angle trajectories and <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> <b>strains.</b> A marker-based motion capture system was employed to track {{the execution of the}} lolotte on a purposely designed climbing structure. The marker trajectories were then used as input for a numerical simulation in the OpenSim program, where an athlete-specific musculoskeletal model was set up to perform an inverse kinematics analysis and obtain the joint angle trajectories as well as their ranges of motion. Further processing of the model allowed to estimate the strain of the <b>knee</b> medial collateral <b>ligament.</b> Such kinematic analysis revealed characteristic hip and knee joint angle patterns and highlighted a critical phase in which the knee is considerably abducted (increased valgus). As a consequence, the medial collateral ligament is remarkably recruited, thereby substantiating the claim diffused among climbers that drop-kneeing may cause ligament injury...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of finite element models have been {{developed}} to study the behaviour of the knee joint under different loading conditions. They have been used to study <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> function, <b>knee</b> prosthesis design and ligament reconstruction procedures. The terms pretension or prestrain of a <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> refer to the <b>strain</b> in the <b>ligament</b> when the joint is at full extension and little is known about its influence on the kinematics of the joint. In <b>knee</b> models, the <b>ligament</b> reference <b>strains</b> are usually merely estimated [1] and sometimes adapted by means of trial and error in order to get better agreement with experimental data [2]. As a consequence, very different values {{can be found in the}} literature. The purpose of this study was to analyze how ligament prestrains can affect the kinematics of the knee predicted with a FE model...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> injury is increasing and represents a significant cost to healthcare providers. Current interventions include tissue grafts, suture repair and non-surgical management. These techniques have demonstrated good patient outcomes {{but have been}} associated with graft rejection, infection, long term immobilization and reduced joint function. The limitations of traditional management strategies have prompted research into tissue engineering of <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments.</b> This paper considers whether tissue engineering of <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments</b> offers a viable alternative in the clinical management of <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> injuries. A search of existing literature was performed using OVID Medline, Embase, AMED, PubMed and Google Scholar, and a manual review of citations identified within these papers. Silk, polymer and extracellular matrix based scaffolds can all improve graft healing and collagen production. Fibroblasts and stem cells demonstrate compatibility with scaffolds, and have been shown to increase organized collagen production. These effects can be augmented using growth factors and extracellular matrix derivatives. Animal studies have shown tissue engineered ligaments can provide the biomechanical characteristics required for effective treatment of <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> injuries. There is a growing clinical demand for a tissue engineered alternative to traditional management strategies. Currently, there is limited consensus regarding material selection for use in tissue engineered ligaments. Further research is required to optimize tissue engineered ligament production before clinical application. Controlled clinical trials comparing the use of tissue engineered ligaments and traditional management in patients with <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> injury could determine whether they can provide a cost-effective alternative...|$|R

40|$|Recognition of ligamentous {{injuries}} of {{the knee}} in the acute phase is essential for optimum treatment and prognosis. A multitraumatized patient with a fractured femur and occult <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> damage presents a difficult diagnostic challenge.

The high incidence (48 %) of ipsilateral <b>knee</b> <b>ligament</b> damage, particularly of a severe nature (30 %) evident at followup (mean 24. 5 months) is alarming.
