40|$|Japan, {{like many}} countries, has long offered savings {{deposits}} through the postal system. That system has undergone some reform {{over the past}} dozen years, and beginning in 2007 the system was to undergo privatization, with Japan Post Bank eventually becoming an independent entity. A new law passed in 2012 has stalled the privatization process. Regardless of how the issue of privatization plays out, {{the existence of a}} savings bank embedded within the postal system raises a number of troubling issues. This essay addresses five of those problems: a level playing field, market power, cross subsidization, social policy, and risk or inefficiency. These issues concern the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> within the banking industry, future financial stability of the Japan Post Bank, and broader economic inefficiency within the Japanese economy. This essay argues that government ownership of Japan Post Bank is unjustified on economic or social grounds. Complete privatization should resolve some of the problems, especially that of a level playing field. But issues of economic inefficiency and future financial stability could remain even after privatization...|$|E
40|$|Southern Italy has {{a rate of}} {{unemployment}} of more than 20 per cent and net imports {{of goods and services}} greater than 13 per cent of GDP. Northern Italy on the contrary, has full employment and net exports of goods and services for more than 8 per cent of GDP. This means that the price of labour is higher than the equilibrium level in the South and lower in the North; a competitive equilibrium requires a monetary price of labour in the South about two thirds that in the North. This could be obtained either through lower monetary wages in the South, or through taxation on labour employed in tradable sectors higher in the North than in the South. The choice is a political one. This paper argues that the objections of the European Commission to fiscal benefits for southern tradable production on <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> grounds do not seem to have a firm theoretical basis.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{observed}} an optimistic bias in cost and ridership forecasts for rail transit projects around the globe, {{which has led}} to billions of dollars of public investment in projects that have not performed as promised. This bias has been a major cause of concern for project stakeholders, including the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), which has spent an average of over $ 3 billion each year {{over the past two decades}} on new rail transit projects in the United States through its Capital Investment Grants program, commonly known as New Starts. Partly in response to credibility concerns raised by forecast bias, the FTA has made changes to the New Starts program over the years. However, there has been no research to date that has examined how these changes in the New Starts program have influenced forecast accuracy for rail transit projects that receive funding. This study addresses that gap in the literature through a mixed-methods approach involving semi-structured interviews with thirteen transit planning and forecasting professionals and a quantitative analysis of 67 completed transit projects to determine whether and to what extent forecast accuracy has changed over time and what changes in federal policy and transit planning practice might explain these changes. I find that there have been steady improvements over time in the accuracy of ridership forecasts and cost estimates for New Starts projects. The improvement in ridership forecast accuracy can be explained in part by shorter project construction durations and a shift over time in the perceived purpose of forecasting from (1) project promotion to (2) <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> to (3) use in local decision-making. Some of the improvement in cost estimate accuracy can be explained in by changes in project characteristics, particularly a tendency towards more modest projects representing incremental changes to the transit network. This analysis of forecast bias in transit planning gives us reasons for optimism regarding the future of optimism bias in cost and ridership forecast accuracy, since forecasts appear to be on a long-term trajectory toward more accuracy and less bias...|$|E

40|$|Whenever {{competing}} {{options are}} considered in sequence, their evaluations {{may be affected}} by order of appearance. Such serial position effects would threaten the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitions</b> using jury evaluations. Randomization cannot reduce potential order effects, but it does give candidates an equal chance of being assigned to preferred serial positions. Whether, or what, serial position effects emerge may depend on the cognitive demands of the judgment task. In end-of-sequence procedures, final scores are not given until all candidates have performed, possibly burdening judges’ memory. If judges’ evaluations are based on how well they remember performances, serial position effects may resemble those found with free recall. Candidates may also be evaluated step-by-step, immediately after each performance. This procedure should not burden memory, though it may produce different serial position effects. Yet, this paper reports similar serial position effects with end-of-sequence and step-by-step procedures used for the Eurovision Song Contest: Ratings increased with serial position. The linear order effect was replicated in the step-by-step judgments of World and European Figure Skating Contests. It is proposed that, independent of the evaluation procedure, judges’ initial impressions of sequentially appearing candidates may be formed step-by-step, yielding serial position effects...|$|R

40|$|Having taken a {{backseat}} in {{the concerns of}} those in charge of European sport since the famous Bosman ruling the issue known as the «nationality clauses» in team sports recently resurged acutely within the debates.

This initiative known as « 6 + 5 » was given a very cold reception by the European Commission and the European Parliament for which «all had been said» in terms of the sporting jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of Luxembourg. But for FIFA, such a clause would be beneficial because it is able to maintain the sporting identity of the clubs, to protect national teams, to guarantee the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitions</b> and to encourage the training of young people, all at the same time.

We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all {{have a right to}} enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} the paper "A Theory <b>of</b> <b>Fairness,</b> <b>Competition</b> and Cooperation" by Ernst Fehr and Klaus Schmidt (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1999), has been tremendous, and the theory of {{inequity}} aversion has been widely used in varying fields of economics. Here, the merits of inequity aversion as a theory <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> and as an explanation of human behavior are critically examined. I argue that the theory has weak points in both areas. First, it provides no deeper understanding of why and when people exhibit other-regarding preferences. Second, the outcome-based nature of the theory ignores the fundamental role of procedures, both in the theoretical literature on fairness, and in experiments regarding actual human behavior. Finally, I suggest an alternative way of understanding the puzzling behavior of humans in economic experiments, based on the potentially conflicting norms of individual property rights and social sharing. Many modern theories <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> essentially amount to promoting an efficient mix of these two norms.

Such requirements can vary between countries; this paper therefore introduces basic legislation governing this process both in the Czech Republic and Poland. The verification of compliance of these requirements should be made individually for each public procurement procedure which {{is associated with the}} need to submit corresponding documents. The aim of the article is to analyse and compare current practice in using qualification criteria for public works contracts in both countries. Information about qualification criteria have been studied on the sample of 345 tenders for public works contracts, in particular for road structures, schools and water and sewage facilities and equipment. Analytical part focuses on the extent of qualification criteria use and discusses their application in the context <b>of</b> ensuring <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>competition</b> with regard to non-discriminatory nature of the qualification. Research findings reveal significant disparity between the Czech Republic and Poland in the area of 1) professional and 2) economic and financial qualifications. It has been concluded that the reintroduction of economic and financial qualification criteria in the Czech Republic is justified if used appropriately and according to methodological guidelines. In Poland, the risk of inappropriate use of criteria lies especially in excessive requirements in relation to the volume and nature of contract.
