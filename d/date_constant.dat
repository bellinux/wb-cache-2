40|$|Evaluating the {{performance}} of high-speed networks is a critical task that requires reliable tools to generate traffic workloads at high rates. The current software tools provide poor performance in terms of packets per second and timing/rate accuracy, because of the intrinsic limitations of the PC architecture. This paper proposes a different approach, based on a cooperative PC/NP architecture: an advanced software tool runs on a host PC and instructs the processing engines of an Intel IXP 2400 network processor, which {{take care of the}} actual traffic generation. This way we keep the high flexibility of PC tools while achieving the high packet rates of hardware solutions. The system is able to generate several traffic models (to <b>date,</b> <b>constant</b> bit rate, Poisson and Poissonian arrival of burst are implemented); however the tool is easily extensible in that any other traffic models can be added through the available APIs.

40|$|In most {{classical}} scheduling models, it {{is assumed}} that a job is dispatched to a customer immediately after its processing completes. In many practical situations, however, a set of delivery dates may be fixed before any jobs are processed. This is particularly relevant where delivery is an expensive or complicated operation, for example, as with heavy machinery. A similar situation arises where customers find deliveries disruptive and thus require them to be made within a limited time interval that repeats periodically. A third possibility is that a periodic business function, for example, the supplier's billing cycle, effectively defines a delivery date, and includes all jobs that have been completed since the previous billing cycle. These situations are not adequately represented by classical scheduling models. We consider a variety of deterministic scheduling problems in which a job is dispatched to a customer at the earliest fixed delivery date that is no earlier than the completion time of its processing. Problems where the number of delivery <b>dates</b> is <b>constant,</b> and others where it is specified as part of data input, are studied. For almost all problems considered, we either provide an efficient algorithm or establish that such an algorithm is unlikely to exist. By doing so, we permit comparisons between the solvability of these fixed delivery date problems and of the corresponding classical scheduling problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstraet [...] The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the errors induced by different hypotheses used to elaborate reduced kinetic mechanisms of tropospheric chemistry. To do that, a reference chemical kinetic scheme was developed: it includes a limited number of representative primary species (6 alkanes, 4 alkenes, 2 aromatics) for which up to <b>date</b> kinetic <b>constants</b> and mechanisms were used. This chemical scheme constitutes a reference against which the various reduction methods were tested. The tests were performed for three different scenarios characterised by various VOC/NO x ratios (5, 10, 20). These scenarios are assumed to correspond to the chemical state of the atmosphere in urban areas and in rural situations. In a first step, the high NO x approximation (i. e. a chemical scheme without treatment of peroxy + HO = and peroxy + peroxy reactions) was tested. The results show that this scheme does not produce significant error on the simulated concentrations for NO concentrations above 2 ppb. In a second step, three successive reduction methods were applied to the reference mechanism: (1) use of the chemical operator concept to treat the organic peroxy chemistry, (2) loss of information on the organic peroxy class, (3) lumping of secondary organic species into surrogate species. The use of chemical operators provides a satisfactory representation of the organic peroxy chemistry for NO concentration down to 100 ppt. The scheme obtained after the loss of information on the organic peroxy class increases only slightly the error...|$|R
30|$|Scheduling is the {{assignment}} of resources over time to perform tasks. In conventional scheduling system, only one resource is considered, which processes the parts. An FMS scheduling differs from conventional job shop scheduling. The complexity of FMS scheduling {{is due to the}} flexibility of an FMS in terms of machine, product, operation and routing (Browne et al. 1984). Scheduling of an FMS is effected by several factors including orders arrivals, due dates and batch size (Liu and MacCarthy 1996). The production management has to set policies whether to handle periodic or continuous orders of the customers. Meeting customers’ due dates play key role in make to order system and the FMSs are mostly suited for MTO system. Due dates are effected by various factors including arrival rate, variability and batch size. Among these factors, batch size is significant factor for effective scheduling of an FMS as it directly affects due <b>dates.</b> In addition, <b>constant</b> batch size makes MTO less responsive to customers’ demands (Beemsterboer et al. 2017).|$|R

An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed for alternating power and bit allocation by employing Yates’ framework. To further reduce the computational complexity, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed in closed form by decoupling the problem into subproblems under asymptotical analysis. Simulation {{results show that the}} suboptimal algorithm performs closely to the iterative optimization algorithm under high-quantization resolution. Moreover, the proposed two algorithms provide substantial EE gain over existing schemes with equal power and bit allocation, and the EE depends on the target data rate and outage probability of each user as well as the circuit power consumption at the base stations.|$|R

40|$|Generally, tax {{systems are}} {{perceived}} to be complex. This study takes a qualitative empirical approach to examine individual taxpayers’ perceptions of tax complexity. This was achieved by obtaining individual taxpayers perceptions on the complexity of the tax system. The study also investigates whether taxpayers perceive that their tax burden is influenced by the complexity of the tax system and also analyses suggestions by respondents on how the South African tax system can be simplified. The findings are that not all taxpayers perceive that the tax system is complex. These respondents mainly acknowledge the various means available, such as e-filing, to counter the effects of tax complexity. They also point out that taxpayers should be responsible for educating themselves on how the tax system works. However, there are more people who believe that the tax system is complex. The complexity is mainly attributed to the challenges taxpayers face in attempting to comply with tax legislation. These challenges include difficulties in keeping up to <b>date</b> with <b>constant</b> changes to legislation, the fear of filing an inaccurate tax return and the general lack of adequate knowledge to confidently handle one’s tax affairs. An interesting theme emerged on how respondents make the presumption that the tax system might be complex for other taxpayers {{due to a lack of}} education or knowledge of the tax system.

30|$|As far as {{the authors}} know, no {{previous}} work has considered the joint power and feedback bit allocation to improve the system’s EE for limited-feedback CoMP-CB under <b>constant</b> <b>date</b> rate services. The EE performance of CoMP-CB is severely limited by two types of residual interferences, i.e., MUI and ICI, which results from the inaccurate coordinated beamforming led by imperfect CDI. The residual interferences can be reduced by allocating more feedback bits for quanting the corresponding CDI or less transmit power to the corresponding interferer. Therefore, allocating the feedback bits and transmit powers in an efficient way eventually improves the system’s EE. Motivated by this, we jointly optimize the allocation of transmit powers among multiple users and the feedback bits of each user between quantizing the desired and interfering channels under the constraints on individual feedback overhead and outage probability. To find the optimal solution for the problem, we derive an iterative algorithm using Yates’ framework [22]. Since high computational complexity will cause high circuit power consumption, a suboptimal algorithm is developed for the system with high-quantization resolution, where both the power and bit allocation are with closed form expressions of low complexity.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Long-term ice records (1823 - 1994) {{from six}} sites in {{different}} parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes region were used to show the type and general timing of climatic changes throughout the region. The general timing of both freeze-up and ice loss varies and is driven by local air temperatures, adjacent water bodies and mixing, and site morphometry. Grand Traverse Bay and Buffalo Harbor represent deeper-water environments affected by mixing of off-shore waters; Chequamegon Bay, Menominee, Lake Mendota, and Toronto Harbor represent relatively shallow-water, protected environments. Freeze-up dates gradually became later and ice-loss dates gradually earlier from the start of records to the 1890 s in both environments, marking the end of the "Little Ice Age". After this, freeze-up <b>dates</b> remained relatively <b>constant,</b> suggesting little change in early-winter air temperatures during the 20 th century.
