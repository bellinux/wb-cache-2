Although many approaches for evaluating the tribological performances of such coatings can be found in the existing literature, they often suffer from limitations in reproducing the interface conditions typical of the industrial processes. The objective of the present research work is to investigate the tribological behaviour of DLC coatings applied to sheet-forming tools under process conditions compared to the ones experienced by the traditional coatings used in industry.

The mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of some of the candidate chemicals, namely 1, 2 -dichloroethylene, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 3 -dichloropropane, 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane and 1, 1, 3 -trichloropropene were evaluated in an in vitro micronucleus assay. The cytokinesis-block methodology was applied on human lymphocytes in the presence or absence of an external metabolic activation system (S 9 -mix). In the micronucleus assay, all test substances, except 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane with and without S 9 -mix and 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane without S 9 -mix in the repeated experiment, exhibited a low but statistically significant mutagenic activity, compared to the concurrent control. However, none of the five chemicals was able to induce a clear and reproducible linear dose-dependent increase in micronucleus frequencies in this assay. Generally, mutagenic activity of the chemicals was found in the absence of severe cytotoxicity and/or cell cycle delay. The DNA breakage capacity and the cytotoxicity of these chemicals were also assessed in the alkaline single cell gel (SCG) electrophoresis test (comet assay) with and without S 9 -mix in isolated human lymphocytes. All chemical compounds induced DNA breakage, in the presence or absence of the metabolic activation system, at the doses tested. The data showed that the DNA reactivity of the chemicals increased with increasing degree of halogenation. The results of the present work suggested that the comet assay might be a more suitable and sensitive screening method than the micronucleus test for this particular class of compound.

40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} are {{amongst the}} most common soil and groundwater contaminants due to their widespread use as dry-cleaning solvents and as <b>degreasing</b> <b>agents.</b> Due to their physicochemical properties, they produce large scale plumes of pollution in the groundwater. In the densely populated regions, these pollution plumes are located under residential and urban development areas and therefore difficultly accessible. Vapours can migrate through building slabs into indoor air. Soil vapor migration into house, with subsequent inhalation, is often the main exposure pathway to humans at sites contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Two approaches are commonly used for quantification of indoor concentrations: indoor gas measurement or transfer modeling from the source. Model development is relatively well advanced, but measurements for model calibration and 'validation' hardly exist in the literature. Furthermore, predictions of indoor gas concentrations from different models may vary by several orders of magnitude, depending on the application. The work presented here consists in comparing modelled results and experimental measurements on a pilot site. The pilot site is a factory, where contaminations with chlorinated solvents in groundwater and the vadose zone were observed. Before beginning the campaigns of measurements, some preliminary characterizations were carried out as screening by Cone Penetration Test and BAT sampling. Then an adequate monitoring network was performed (groundwater monitoring and soil-air monitoring wells). Measurements concerned contaminant concentrations in several media (groundwater, soil, soil air, indoor air) and fluxes at soil surface, but also key model parameters (source depth, soil and concrete characteristics and other characteristics of the building like atmospheric / soil pressure difference, ventilation rates [...] .). The analytical modeling was performed with two transport models, one based on the equations of Johnson & Ettinger, the second based on the equations of VOLASOIL adapted for a multilayer soil. The numerical modeling was performed with COMSOL Multiphysics. COMSOL is a finite element analysis for various physics and engineering applications, especially coupled phenomena or multiphysics.

A number of leaks of radioactive liquors to ground {{are known to have}} occurred from several plant buildings, vaults and disposal trenches within and around the Separation area at the Sellafield nuclear site over the past 50 years 1. The most significant of these leaks have occurred from the Magnox Silo, the Caesium Extraction Plant, the Magnox Reprocessing Pump House, the Sludge Storage Tanks, the Burial Pits and the Medium Active Evaporation and Thermal Denitration Plant. The radioactive contamination will be accompanied by other components of spent fuel reprocessing, including inorganic salts from neutralised acids, solvents and other organic compounds along with the typical contaminants commonly associated with large industrial activity such as heavy metals, fuel, oils, <b>degreasing</b> <b>agents</b> etc. The research in this thesis describes the effects of common industrial contaminants on the behaviour of Cs and Sr sorption to bentonite and montmorillonite clay minerals. Batch sorption experiments of Cs and Sr uptake onto bentonite and montmorillonite in a number of complex systems were investigated as follows: 1. 	Initial batch sorption experiments investigating the normal behaviour of the clay minerals. 2. 	Introduction of anthropogenic organic ligands EDTA, NTA and picolinic acid into the system and their influence on Sr and Cs uptake. 3. 	Time dependent studies investigating the effect that residence time of the anthropogenic organic ligands has on the sorption properties of montmorillonite and bentonite. 4. 	Quaternary systems where simulant Magnox sludge equilibrated water, at a number of concentrations, was introduced to ternary systems containing anthropogenic organic ligands. 5. 	Time dependent studies investigating the effect of hydrocarbons TCE, toluene and naphthalene on the uptake of Cs and Sr to bentonite and montmorillonite. The batch sorption experiments show that the presence of anthropogenic organic ligands reduces the uptake of Cs and Sr by both montmorillonite and bentonite. It is also shown that the presence of simulant Magnox sludge in quaternary systems can also reduce the uptake of Cs and Sr, with significant reductions in sorption observed for Sr sorption in EDTA quaternary systems. Further, the uptake of Cs and Sr to bentonite and montmorillonite appears to decrease with increasing anthropogenic organic ligand residence time. This suggests that the ligands are altering the surface of the clay minerals reducing the number of available binding sites. The influence of hydrocarbons shows a significant decrease in sorption after 3 months for Cs and Sr sorption to montmorillonite.

The discovery involved an interval of relatively finer-grained sediment within the unconfined aquifer, an interval that is not sampled by routine groundwater monitoring. Although VOC contamination in the unconfined aquifer has been identified and monitored, the concentrations of newly discovered contamination are much higher than encountered previously, with some new results {{significantly higher than the}} drinking water standards. The primary contaminant is trichloroethene, with lesser amounts of tetrachloroethene. Both chemicals were used extensively as <b>degreasing</b> <b>agents</b> during the fuels fabrication process. A biological degradation product of these chemicals, 1, 2 -dichloroethene, was also detected. To further define {{the nature and extent of}} this contamination, additional characterization drilling was undertaken during 2007. Four locations were drilled to supplement the information obtained at four locations drilled during the earlier investigation in 2006. The results of the combined drilling indicate that the newly discovered contamination is limited to a relatively finer-grained interval of Ringold Formation sediment within the unconfined aquifer. The extent of this contamination appears to be the area immediately east and south of the former South Process Pond. Samples collected from the finer-grained sediment at locations along the shoreline confirm the presence of the contamination near the groundwater/river interface. Contamination was not detected in river water that flows over the area where the river channel potentially incises the finer-grained interval of aquifer sediment. The source for this contamination is not readily apparent. A search of historical documents and the Hanford Waste Information Data System did not provide definitive clues as to waste disposal operations and/or spills that might have resulted in groundwater contamination in this sediment, although several relatively small accidental releases of VOCs have occurred in the past in the northern portion of the 300 Area. It is likely that large quantities of degreasing solutions were disposed to the North and South Process Ponds during the 1950 s and 1960 s, and that evidence for them in the upper portion of the unconfined aquifer has been removed because of groundwater movement through the much more transmissive sediment. Also, investigations to date have revealed no evidence to suggest that a dense, non-aqueous phase liquid remains undetected in the subsurface. Potential pathways for contamination to migrate from this finer-grained sediment include groundwater movement through the interval to offshore locations in the Columbia River channel, dispersion out of the finer-grained interval into the overlying transmissive sediment (again, with transport to the riverbed), and potential future withdrawal via water supply wells...|$|R
