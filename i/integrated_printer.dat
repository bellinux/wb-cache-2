5000|$|Busicom had {{designed}} their own special-purpose LSI chipset {{for use in}} their Busicom 141-PF calculator with <b>integrated</b> <b>printer,</b> following the architectural model of the Olivetti Programma 101, the world’s first tabletop programmable calculator, introduced in 1965, and commissioned Intel to develop it for production. Like the Olivetti Programma 101, the Busicom design used serial read-write memory. The Busicom memory was based on MOS shift registers rather than the costly Olivetti memory based on magnetostriction wire. However, Intel determined it was too complex, since serial memories required more components, and would use 40 pins, a packaging standard different from Intel’s own 16-pin standard {{and so it was}} proposed that a new design produced with standard 16-pin DIP packaging and reduced instruction set be developed., using Intel’s newly developed dynamic RAM memory. This resulted in the 4004 architecture, which is part of a family of chips, including ROM, DRAM, and serial-to-parallel shift register chips. The 4004 was subsequently designed by Federico Faggin [...] using silicon gate technology and built of approximately 2,300 transistors and was followed the next year by the first ever 8-bit microprocessor, the 3,500 transistor 8008 (and the 4040, a revised and improved 4004). It was not until the development of the 40-pin 8080 in 1974, a project conceived and directed by Faggin [...] that the address and data buses would be separated, giving faster and simpler access to memory.|$|E

Key aspects of the physics of this approach, which has some features in common with related but comparatively low-resolution techniques for graphic arts, are revealed through direct high-speed imaging of the droplet formation processes.

40|$|A {{challenge}} for tissue engineering is producing three-dimensional (3 D), vascularized cellular constructs of clinically relevant size, shape and structural integrity. We present an <b>integrated</b> tissue-organ <b>printer</b> (ITOP) that can fabricate stable, human-scale tissue constructs of any shape. Mechanical stability {{is achieved by}} printing cell-laden hydrogels together with biodegradable polymers in integrated patterns and anchored on sacrificial hydrogels. The correct shape of the tissue construct is achieved by representing clinical imaging data as a computer model of the anatomical defect and translating the model into a program that controls the motions of the printer nozzles, which dispense cells to discrete locations. The incorporation of microchannels into the tissue constructs facilitates diffusion of nutrients to printed cells, thereby overcoming the diffusion limit of 100 - 200 μm for cell survival in engineered tissues. We demonstrate capabilities of the ITOP by fabricating mandible and calvarial bone, cartilage and skeletal muscle.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the pamphlets which defended Parliament’s resistance against the King {{in the first}} English civil war (1642 – 1646), {{and the development of}} Parliament’s legal case in response to the pressures of mobilisation, ideas and events. The civil war was explained, narrated and defended in cheap print, which was consumed by the reading public who were hungry for news, ideas and justifications. Increasingly, pamphlets used the device of an implied reader to construct obedience and solve the political problems thrown up by the debate, but this unprecedented opening-up of legal issues to public debate further complicated the parliamentary cause. The thesis also <b>integrates</b> the <b>printers</b> and publishers who facilitated this public debate into its account of legal, political and religious ideas. By using typographic and bibliographic techniques, the thesis suggests that printers and publishers held coherent political and religious identities, and could exert influence over not only the pamphlets they produced, but increasingly the way that the parliamentary cause was understood. As the concept of allegiance becomes more problematic, and as histories of the civil war focus more on the concept of mobilisation and the construction of the parliamentary cause, this thesis argues that closer contextualisation and a chronological examination of the debate elucidates in greater detail the complexities and complications of the parliamentarian position. By tracing the way that Parliament’s case developed throughout the conflict {{and the ways in which}} their justification had to flex to accommodate new ideas and events, this thesis {{examines the}} legitimising frameworks that pamphlet authors used to explain the civil war, which through the course of the conflict became increasingly contested and destabilised under the weight of the polemical pamphlets themselves. The collapse of these legitimising frameworks, combined with a partisan press willing to intervene in the debate and a jury of readers willing to bring their own legal understandings to the issues of the day, left the parliamentary cause fractured and ultimately created a political environment where settlement could not be achieved...|$|R

The Marine Corps must search for a solution {{to increase the efficiency}} and responsiveness of its logistics. One solution is using additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3 D printing. This thesis answers the question of how additive manufacturing can improve the effectiveness of Marine Corps logistics. In order to answer the question, beneficial process(es), application(s), and level of integration are determined through a comparative analysis of current and future 3 D-printing processes, examination of several civilian and military examples, and examination of the impact across current doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership, personnel, and facilities. Several issues should be addressed prior to the Marine Corps fully <b>integrating</b> 3 D <b>printers,</b> such as the lack of certification and qualification standards, unreliable end product results, and determining ownership of intellectual property.

40|$|International audienceLaser {{cutting of}} paper {{is widely used}} in the paper {{conversion}} industry. CO 2 lasers are well suited {{for this type of}} applications. Desktop printing is a large market both for digital photography, document management and graphics applications, but it still lacks advanced cutting and scoring ability, and CO 2 lasers seem costly to be <b>integrated</b> in mass-market <b>printers.</b> For that reason, mass-scalable and low-cost semiconductor laser diodes would be very advantageous to add paper cutting and scoring features in desktop printers. However, common paper can not be cut properly using visible or Near Infrared (NIR) laser diode since it has a very poor absorption at these wavelengths. We report here an innovative solution to achieve paper cutting or scoring using a 1 W single emitter NIR laser diode, within an inkjet printer. A special ink that absorbs the NIR light, and that penetrates all through the paper, is first disposed on the lines to be cut. Then, the laser diode goes along the lines to be cut. We show that a cutting speed of 2 m/min can be achieved on 80 g/m 2 conventional paper. The influence of the optical properties of the ink on the cutting speed are discussed, as well as focussing issues. In particular, we show that invisible inks are suitable, and very clear-cut edges can be obtained. The perspective of this technique are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} NASA's In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) {{project is to}} identify, design, and {{implement}} on-demand, sustainable manufacturing solutions for fabrication, maintenance and repair during exploration missions. ISM has undertaken a phased strategy of incrementally increasing manufacturing capabilities to achieve this goal. The ISM project began {{with the development of}} the first 3 D printer for the International Space Station. To date, the printer has completed two phases of flight operations. Results from phase I specimens indicated some differences in material properties between ground-processed and ISS-processed specimens, but results of follow-on analyses of these parts and a ground-based study with an equivalent printer strongly indicate that this variability is likely attributable to differences in manufacturing process settings between the ground and flight prints rather than microgravity effects on the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. Analysis of phase II specimens from the 3 D Printing in Zero G tech demo, which shed further light on the sources of material variability, will be presented. The ISM project has also developed a materials characterization plan for the Additive Manufacturing Facility, the follow-on commercial multimaterial 3 D printing facility developed for ISS by Made in Space.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to the high speed automatic stitchmarking of shoe upper components by <b>integrating</b> an electrographic <b>printer</b> with a shape recognition system. A critical review of recognition system parameters selects the currently known shape parameters which are most suitable {{for use in a}} high speed recognition system with the large number of different shoe components found in a typical shoe factory. These are compared with the parameters actually used in the previously developed recognition system to be used for stitchmarking. A discussion of printing technologies suitable for marking shoe materials with computer generated patterns follows. It is concluded that an electrographic printer has the best combination of characteristics. There follows a description of experiments demonstrating xerography on shoe upper materials, and the design of a system integrating a low-cost laser printer to the recognition system which proved the concept of continuous automatic stitchmarking. With this performing satisfactorily, the system was converted to use a high speed printer requiring the use of an advanced graphics processor for handling the data transformations and interfacing with the printer. Modifications to the printer for operation with shoe materials are described, together with the need for a special toner. A full description of the resulting stitchmarking system is given, followed by details of analyses of its performance. Individual chapters are devoted to the accuracy, recognition efficiency, and the timing of the system. A potential bottleneck in determining the orientation of certain difficult shapes is identified, and faster methods for dealing with these are specially investigated. This concludes that the best approach is to optimise the present method and accelerate the calculations by using a more advanced microprocessor. A discussion of the general running of the machine includes details of problems which occurred with the modified printer mechanism and how these were overcome. Finally, suggestions are made for incorporation in an improved system capable of handling larger shapes with a tenfold speed increase...|$|R
40|$|Digital halftoning is a {{printing}} technology {{that creates the}} illusion of continuous tone images for printing devices such as electrophotographic printers that can only produce {{a limited number of}} tone levels. Digital halftoning works because the human visual system has limited spatial resolution which blurs the printed dots of the halftone image, creating the gray sensation of a continuous tone image. Because the printing process is imperfect it introduces distortions to the halftone image. The quality of the printed image depends, among other factors, on the complex interactions between the halftone image, the printer characteristics, the colorant, and the printing substrate. Printer models are used to assist in the development of new types of halftone algorithms that are designed to withstand the effects of printer distortions. For example, model-based halftone algorithms optimize the halftone image through an iterative process that <b>integrates</b> a <b>printer</b> model within the algorithm. The two main goals of a printer model are to provide accurate estimates of the tone and of the spatial characteristics of the printed halftone pattern. Various classes of printer models, from simple tone calibrations, to complex mechanistic models, {{have been reported in the}} literature. Existing models have one or more of the following limiting factors: they only predict tone reproduction, they depend on the halftone pattern, they require complex calibrations or complex calculations, they are printer specific, they reproduce unrealistic dot structures, and they are unable to adapt responses to new data. The two research objectives of this dissertation are (1) to introduce a new framework for printer modeling and (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of such a framework in building an electrophotographic printer model. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modeling a printer as a texture transformation machine. The basic premise is that modeling the texture differences between the output printed images and the input images encompasses all printing distortions. The feasibility of the framework was tested with a case study modeling a monotone electrophotographic printer. The printer model was implemented as a bank of feed-forward neural networks, each one specialized in modeling a group of textural features of the printed halftone pattern. The textural features were obtained using a parametric representation of texture developed from a multiresolution decomposition proposed by other researchers. The textural properties of halftone patterns were analyzed and the key texture parameters to be modeled by the bank were identified. Guidelines for the multiresolution texture decomposition and the model operational parameters and operational limits were established. A method for the selection of training sets based on the morphological properties of the halftone patterns was also developed. The model is fast and has the capability to continue to learn with additional training. The model can be easily implemented because it only requires a calibrated scanner. The model was tested with halftone patterns representing a range of spatial characteristics found in halftoning. Results show that the model provides accurate predictions for the tone and the spatial characteristics when modeling halftone patterns individually and it provides close approximations when modeling multiple halftone patterns simultaneously. The success of the model justifies continued research of this new printer model framework...|$|R
