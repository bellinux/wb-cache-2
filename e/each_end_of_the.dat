5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle {{on the center of}} the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn {{at the same time as}} the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, leading towards East Finchley {{to the north and}} Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E

30|$|A typical 400  ×  103  V {{three phase}} {{transmission}} line system having generators at two ends {{has been used}} for simulating, developing and implementing the developed method based upon ANNs. <b>The</b> system consists <b>of</b> two generators of 400  ×  103  V, <b>each</b> located <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmission line to simulate and study the various faults at different various locations on the transmission line.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, roundabouts were {{constructed}} at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Causeway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic on the bridges {{and the distribution of}} traffic back into the road network. The roundabout at the eastern end, connecting with Great Eastern Highway, opened in 1952. In 1973 construction began on upgrading that intersection to a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange. The interchange opened on 8 March 1974, having cost AUS$1.3 million.|$|E
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
5|$|Structure 7, at the {{southwest}} side of Plaza C, is a ballcourt of similar dimensions to Structure 8. It was the ballcourt of the Xahil clan {{and may have}} been the older of the two ballcourts. <b>Each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ballcourt had a projecting stairway and there was an additional stairway to the southeast. A tennoned head sculpture recovered from Plaza C may originally have been a ballcourt marker from this ballcourt.|$|E
25|$|The Jelapang and Ipoh South toll plazas were {{demolished}} in 2009 {{to make a}} non-stop route across Ipoh. This {{is achieved}} through <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> two local-express lanes for each side, which are only accessible via Exit 138 Ipoh South Exit (for northbound traffic) and Exit 141 Ipoh North Exit (for southbound traffic). The toll plazas in Ipoh are therefore relocated at <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local-express lanes.|$|R
25|$|Law 18: Scoring runs. Runs are scored {{when the}} two batsmen run to <b>each</b> other's <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch. Several runs can be scored from one ball.|$|R
50|$|Such springs can {{frequently}} {{be found}} {{as a component}} of garden secateurs. Short posts anchored in each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handles, and inserted into <b>each</b> narrow <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring, keep the spring in position.|$|R
5|$|The Alban Goldsmith House was {{constructed}} sometime prior to 1820. The story-and-a-half brick edifice is laid in common bond with a Flemish bond facade on the front. Three gabled windows {{were added to}} the facade many years after its construction. Interior chimneys with corbels on top adorn <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. It faces west onto Second Street, away from Constitution Square, and opposite the Ephraim McDowell House across the street.|$|E
5|$|The main armor belt was Krupp {{cemented}} and nineinches (230mm) thick, but {{narrowed to}} six and three inches (150 and 76mm) closer to <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships. The barbettes were protected by nine-inch armor, while the turret had a twelve-inch (300mm) front, eight-inch (200mm) sides, and a two- to three-inch (51to76mm) top, and the conning tower had twelve-inch armor. The deck armor had multiple decks of one-and-a-half to twoinches (38to51mm), oneinch (25mm), and oneinch.|$|E
5|$|There {{are flat}} {{junctions}} at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern services cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes. The station {{also has a}} turnback siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.|$|E
50|$|The Italian {{sculptor}} Arnaldo Pomodoro {{has created}} various sculptures for the park, including four large abstract columns and two sun-like water features which from <b>each</b> their <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park sprinkle {{it with their}} jets of water.|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in optical technologies {{provided by the}} optical fiber industry are opening new avenues for improvement in microwave applications, among which the microwave signal filtering is found. In this thesis work we aim at reviewing new microwave filtering methods wich rely on optical technologies from both a theoretical as well as experimental viewpoint. A simple technique for microwave photonic filtering is presented, which allows independent tunability <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RF passband by tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lasers which are phase modulated with the RF signal and optically filtered. The results proved its potential and the conducted research has revealed the key {{role played by the}} optical filter spectral transfer characteristics...|$|R
25|$|For {{the past}} program, {{the third and}} fourth cars, {{coloured}} in green were even more radical in the reconfiguration, with all but eight parts of seats, four at <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car removed completely. In its place was standing room with upholstered cushion, in an attempt to provide a degree of comfort to passengers standing in that space. This design proved to be unpopular with the commuters, and it was eventually dropped. The original seats between the 1st and 2nd door, and the 3rd and 4th door on these cars have been replaced. The remaining upholstered seats were reverted to original seats in May 2006. All C151 trains had their seats on <b>the</b> middle part <b>of</b> carriage removed.|$|R
5|$|Unusually for a Thames bridge, {{only three}} of Chiswick Bridge's five spans cross the river; the shorter spans at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge cross the former towpaths. To allow {{sufficient}} clearance for shipping without steep inclines, the approach roads to the bridge are elevated from some distance back from the river.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the spaces between the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E

5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it {{is equipped with a}} pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).|$|E

50|$|Until the 2012-13 season Liga II had 2 {{groups of}} 16 teams <b>each.</b> At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons {{the last five}} teams were relegated.|$|R
5|$|Except for its two stations—one at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The {{line was}} built {{in less than three}} months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it {{was not included in the}} 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1950, the Queen Mother {{travelled}} {{the line}} {{as far as}} Cranbrook when she visited the National Sanatorium at Benenden. The five-coach Royal Train was pulled by a Maunsell E1 class 4-4-0 No. 31067, Her Majesty using a Pullman car named Malaga, which was flanked by two corridor composites; there was a corridor third brake at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train. Malaga was one of six twelve-wheel first-class kitchen cars which had been built in 1920–1; and following an extensive refit in late 1949, was occasionally used in the Royal Train. It was withdrawn in 1961, and is preserved close to Shepperton railway station.|$|E
60|$|It was, of course, {{impossible}} {{to endeavour to}} grasp that great cylinder with its rounded ends; their forceps would slip from any portion of its smooth surface on which they should endeavour to lay hold, and no such attempt was made. Keeping near the cylinder, one at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>the</b> two moved slowly after the Llangaron, apparently discouraged.|$|R
5000|$|Crocodile (German Krokodil) {{electric}} locomotives are so called {{because they have}} long [...] "noses" [...] at <b>each</b> <b>end,</b> reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout <b>of</b> a crocodile (see also Steeplecab). These contain the motors and drive axles, and are connected by an articulated center section. The center section usually contains the crew compartments, pantographs and transformer.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{began with}} the duo {{shooting}} straight {{up in the air}} from apparatuses at <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, which had a sci-fi design. Hubbard and Kelley kicked off the show with [...] "Every Night" [...] and [...] "Smile", two non-singles from their current album, and ended the night with their smash hit [...] "Cruise". During the show they went into an acoustic setup for [...] "Dirt". Tyler Hubbard has said he thinks about his father in heaven when they sing that song, so towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> it, during <b>the</b> New York City show he called out, [...] "From MSG to Heaven." [...] Opening acts Thomas Rhett and Frankie joined Florida Georgia Line for [...] "Party People". They sang medley of covers which included songs such as Meghan Trainor's [...] "All About That Bass" [...] and Garth Brooks's [...] "Friends in Low Places".|$|R
