40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{improving}} {{the design of}} torque sensor used in the EPS system. Such design not only integrates the torque and the corner signal, but also saves space. By using Matlab interior point method, the gear system parameters are optimized andthe weight {{and the size of}} the sensor are reduced. Bench test results demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of this self-designed sensor is able to meet the demands of EPS. 1. Design of the torque and angle <b>sensor</b> <b>gear</b> set The structural design of <b>sensor</b> <b>gear</b> is shown in fig 1 [1]. We define gear 1 and gear 2 to have the same number of gear teeth; the duplex gears 3, 4, and 5 to have the same number of gear teeth; gear 6, 7 with the same amount of gear teeth. Gear 1, 6, 8 and double gear 3 hence become the main concerns in parameter design. The transmission ratio is respectively: Z 1 =Z 2 = 84 ；Z' 3 =Z’ 4 =Z’ 5 = 15 ；Z 3 =Z 4 =Z 5 = 45 ；Z 6 =Z 7 = 35 ；Z 8 = 36 (1) In Eqs. 1, Z’ 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-small-sized duplex gear. Z 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-large-sized duplex <b>gear.</b> Fig 1 <b>Sensor</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement To set the steering wheel atthe initial position for angle 0 °, then the angle difference between pinion 6 and pinion 8 is 0 ° too. If the steering wheel’s rotation angle is, then the angle difference between gear 6 and gear 8 is, thus the steering wheel’s rotation angle corresponds with the angle difference of the pinions. Therefore, the measurement of the steering wheel’s rotation angle can be converted into the measurement of the angle difference between the two pinions. According to the transmission ratio, when the rotation angle is, the turning angle of gear 6 is and the turning angle of gear 8 is 3 7...|$|R

Differential oil capacity is about 1 liter. An acceptable differential oil is Redline synthetic MT-90 75W90 gear oil or any synthetic 75W90 GL4 gear oil.

40|$|Addressing the {{uncertainties}} in fishing activities, the CEDER project examines {{the use of}} observer reports, landings, e-logbooks, VMS and GPS tracks, and fishery-specific information. Such information was assessed {{in order to provide}} more accurate and timelier data on effort, catches, discards, and/or landings. This document contains CEDER¿s Project Implementation Plan for policy makers, as well as expected benefits for government, industry, and science. The CEDER consortium advocates the use of GPS data at 15 minute intervals for scientific purposes. Among these are improved spatial planning and a new fishing effort measure, the actual effort while fishing, which can be inferred from vessel behaviour. The correlation between catch and effort can be used as an indicator for inspectors, but one cannot reliably guess catches from effort. VMS and logbook data can be matched using rule-bases systems, leading to higher data quality and better use of quota. Furthermore, if fishing mortality were known in near real time, then the integration of current year fishing mortality into management plans would yield benefits for stock recovery. The full realisation of such benefits requires a re-appraisal of the 15 % TAC revision rule. The CEDER consortium insists that any roll-out of the ERS e-logbook must be properly enforced, and that the e-logbook cannot by itself replace observer reports. Finally, estimating discards may be feasible in selected fisheries, but additional means such as <b>gear</b> <b>sensors</b> may be required in order to get more reliable data in the general case.

Instead of knowing what gear the bicycle is in, they rely on sensing when the cyclist changes <b>gears</b> using <b>sensors</b> in the shifters.

Hardware design, controllers and simulation are based on experience gained during {{the development of the}} robot JOHNNIE. The objective of the current research project is to realize a fast, human-like and autonomous walking motion. To enable an optimal design of the robot with respect to lightweight construction, motor and drive sizing, an appropriate simulation model is required. Dynamics simulation is a key tool to develop the hardware and control design properly. For hardware design and detailed dynamic analysis a comprehensive model including motor and gear dynamics is required, while for controller design and stability analysis a simplified model for global system dynamics is sufficient. Both robots are characterized by a lightweight construction. In comparison to JOHNNIE, the new robot LOLA has a modular, multi-sensory joint design with brushless motors.

A number of assistive devices, that make use of this technology, have been developed {{in the last two}} decades: some employ contact impedance, membrane switches, or miniature joysticks, while others use magnetic or piezoelectric sensors. This thesis proposes a new tongue-computer interface, which was designed to enable users to manipulate a computer pointer by moving the tip of their tongue over an intraoral electrode array. The system maps the contact between the tongue and the electrodes, detects the movements of the tongue, and translates it into pointer movements. Compared to similar devices, the MouthPad does not require any head <b>gear</b> or <b>sensors,</b> and does not employ heavy signal processing. The hardware is simplified by using a small number of electrodes and only one output channel, multiplexed over the electrode array. A low power footprint allows the potential miniaturization of the system, so that it could fit on palatal retainer, and allow for permanent unobtrusive usage. The performance of the device was evaluated by measuring the throughput and the accuracy as defined in ISO 9241 - 9 standard. Two extra measures proposed in the literature, target re-entry and movement offset, were used for the evaluation of the accuracy.

Several effective techniques are proposed to address these challenges, arriving at an efficient communication protocol for FINDERS.
