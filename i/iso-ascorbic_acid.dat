40|$|As the chrysanthemin {{of white}} peaches is changed to purple in cans and this {{phenomenon}} spoils {{the quality of}} peach cans, the study of decolotation of peach cans is very important. To solve this problem, the decoloration method has been studied, and following results were obtained: 1) A good method was nt found in using of many bleaching chemicals. 2) Antnhocyanase was also no effective for this purpose. 3) Ascorbic acid and <b>iso-ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> were very effective and the flavor of canned peaches were very increased, and the turbidity of syrup in cans was decreased by addition of these chemicals. 4) The decoloration ability of ascorbic acid was equal to the abiliry of <b>iso-ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> and the avility was romoted dy addition of cysteine. 5) The decoloration ability of ascorbic acid for chrsanthemin was very improved by addition of Î²-glucose oxidase which is able to consume oxygen {{on the presence of}} glucose. 6) The discovery of complete decoloration method on the most reddish peaches was failed...|$|E
40|$|We {{summarize}} {{our recent}} results that model {{the formation of}} uniform spherical silver colloids prepared by mixing <b>iso-ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> and silver-amine complex solutions {{in the absence of}} dispersants. We found that the experimental results can be modeled effectively by the two-stage formation mechanism used previously to model the preparation of colloidal gold spheres. The equilibrium concentration of silver atoms and the surface tension of silver precursor nanocrystals are both treated as free parameters, and the experimental reaction time scale is fit by a narrow region of this two-parameter space. The kinetic parameter required to match the final particle size is found to be very close to that used previously in modeling the formation of uniform gold particles, suggesting that similar kinetics governs the aggregation process. The model also reproduces semi quantitatively the effects of temperature and solvent viscosity on particle synthesis. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Preparation and {{understanding}} the formation of unsupported and supported colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have considerable importance in nanocatalysis due to their beneficial properties. In the present study, colloidal AuNPs were prepared in aqueous solution by one-step chemical reduction of tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl 4) using six different reducing agents, namely: citric acid, sodium citrate, <b>iso-ascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> sodium borohydride, tannic acid and sodium thiocyanate [...] The combination of two reductants (sodium citrate + tannic acid) was shown to have a remarkable change in the size and stability of colloidal AuNPs. Hence, Colloidal AuNPs were impregnated onto a suitable oxidic supports such as CaO, TiO 2, and Al 2 O 3. Unsupported and supported colloidal AuNPs were characterized by UV-vis, XRF, ICP, BET, XRD, and TEM. In addition, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with oxygen using colloidal AuNPs supported on CaO, TiO 2, Al 2 O 3 was investigated. Among all, colloidal AuNPs supported on TiO 2 showed the best catalytic activity due to the smaller size of AuNPs formed in this catalyst...|$|E
