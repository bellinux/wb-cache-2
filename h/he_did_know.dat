5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though {{it is unclear how}} much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know.</b> After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Voldemort simply {{sought the}} wand for its {{supposedly}} unbeatable power, after his previous wand unaccountably failed to kill Harry Potter. He had not realised that the wand {{was one of}} three Hallows, nor sought the other two Hallows. He also possessed the Resurrection Stone but only made use of it as a horcrux. Dumbledore says that he doubts Voldemort would have any interest in the Cloak or the Stone even if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> about them.|$|E
25|$|In The Concept of Anxiety, Haufniensis {{focuses on}} the first anxiety {{experienced}} by man: Adam's choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts {{of good and evil}} did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed original sin, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety {{comes from the fact that}} God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.|$|E

500|$|California {{used the}} M'Naghten {{standard}} for sanity which held {{that for a}} defendant to [...] "establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of}} the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong." [...] Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts were wrong, and had also shown signs of malice aforethought. On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the co-eds because he wanted them [...] "for myself, like possessions," [...] and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind.|$|E
500|$|Involuntary and {{pathological}} intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, {{but are not}} defenses to regulatory law {{and traffic}} law offenses that are considered strict liability violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone {{did not know that}} they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To be used as a defense, the person being charged must show that [...] "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> it, {{that he did not know}} what he was doing was wrong." [...] Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if [...] "the defendant was so intoxicated" [...] that he or she [...] "could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Where the {{defendant}} {{is alleged to have}} been insane at the time of committing the offence, this issue can be raised in one of three ways; {{the defendant}} can claim he was insane, the defendant can raise a defence of Automatism where the judge decides it was instead insanity, or the defendant can raise a plea of diminished responsibility, where the judge or prosecution again show that insanity is more appropriate. Whatever the way in which a plea of insanity is reached, the same test is used each time, as laid out in the M'Naghten Rules; [...] "to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong".|$|E

500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant know what he was doing, and if so, that what he was doing was wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E

[...] She apparently merited no entry in the Dictionary of National Biography and only one mention: in the article on her adversary Thomas Edwards.|$|E

2500|$|The defense's chief {{expert witness}} was Fredric Wertham, a {{psychiatrist}} {{with an emphasis}} on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly [...] "sacrificing" [...] a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but {{he turned out to be}} larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish's cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered [...] "He is insane". Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an [...] "insane knowledge". The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.|$|E
