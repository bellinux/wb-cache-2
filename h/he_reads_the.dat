5|$|Australian openside David Pocock, who {{was also}} shortlisted for the IRB award, admires the way <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> game {{as well as his}} ability to read the referee. One of McCaw's {{strengths}} is his ability to re-invent himself. For example, he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws (e.g., the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations (ELVS) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations) and, over time, other areas of his game.|$|E
5|$|Bryan Cogman, {{initially}} {{a script}} {{coordinator for the}} series, was promoted to producer for the fifth season. Cogman, who wrote at least one episode {{for the first five}} seasons, is the only other writer in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss. Before his promotion, Vanessa Taylor (a writer during the second and third seasons) worked closely with Benioff and Weiss. Dave Hill joined the writing staff for the fifth season after working as an assistant to Benioff and Weiss. Although Martin is not in the writers' room, <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> script outlines and makes comments.|$|E

Krušina and the crowd marvel at Jeník's apparent self-denial, but the mood changes when they learn {{that he has been}} paid off. The Act ends with Jenik being denounced by Krušina {{and the rest of the}} assembly as a rascal.|$|E

60|$|On <b>the</b> train <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> {{letter to}} Hendricks which Peter Sadler {{had given to}} him unsealed. It was a long letter, and <b>he</b> <b>read</b> it twice.

Then he folded it up and put it into his pocket.|$|R
5|$|While <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> diary {{over the}} course of several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake in his diary.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E

25|$|Rt Hon Hugh Abbot MP (Chris Langham) – Series 1-2 – He is the Secretary of State for Social Affairs (later Social Affairs and Citizenship). He is an inept cabinet {{minister}} who is generally {{out of touch}} with the electorate. While he believes he has some influence, he often finds himself at the mercy of events and bearing the brunt of Tucker's vitriol. <b>He</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> New Statesman and has two children, Alicia and Charlie, whom he barely sees. He is replaced by junior minister Nicola Murray in a reshuffle at the beginning of series 3 without appearing on screen.|$|E
25|$|Jerry is in {{a grocery}} store with Vanessa, after they visited the cinema. He manages to persuade Vanessa to go away with him to a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont. Meanwhile, <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} in hope that his stock has gone up, but it has in fact fallen in value. The next day, Kramer (Michael Richards) tells Jerry that his stock has fallen again. Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson, the man who gave the stock tip in the first place, but no one can find him. George rings him back and tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital. While visiting the dry cleaner, Jerry tells George that he wants to sell his stock, but George insists that the tip is good and they should keep the stock. Eventually, George says he will go and visit Wilkinson {{to find out what they}} should do, despite the fact that George does not know him personally.|$|E

500|$|Davis is a Christian. Growing up, {{his parents}} {{took him to}} First Baptist Church in Longview, but Davis {{said it was not}} until after his {{difficult}} 2010 season that he [...] "finally grasped true faith", according to Joshua Cooley. Davis says, [...] "It's not about how hard you’re working to go against the grain. It's just about surrendering every day. Give God the glory no matter what happens. After every at bat after every play, it just keeps me grounded and keeps my faith strong and keeps my head and heart in the right place." [...] <b>He</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> Bible daily.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Sheen {{appeared}} in a supporting role as the boyfriend of Tina Fey in the comedy Admission, with Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice describing the character as [...] "a whiskery, elfin academic who chuckles to himself as <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> Canterbury Tales prologue aloud in bed, in Middle English, no less. (Sheen is scarily good at this.)" [...] In 2014, he starred in the fantasy children's film Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box. R. Kurt Osenlund of Slant Magazine said [...] "the ever-versatile Sheen brings an artful hamminess to his role" [...] but Matt Pais of RedEye found him [...] "insufficiently zany" [...] in [...] "a part that Robert Downey Jr. would nail but never accept." [...] His second film role of 2014 was a minor role in the political thriller Kill the Messenger. Also in 2014, he starred in IFC's six-episode The Spoils of Babylon, a television parody of classic, sweeping miniseries, in which he played the husband of Kristen Wiig's character.|$|E
500|$|The North American {{version was}} {{released}} {{a month later}} on October 20. Changes and additions were made to this version, such as a choice of three difficulty settings when starting a new game (with a fourth setting that is unlocked after completing the game once), an alternate tuxedo outfit for Snake (which the character wears on every third playthrough on the same save file), and a [...] "demo theater" [...] mode where the player views every cutscene and radio conversations relevant to the main story. Jeremy Blaustein, who previously worked on the English localization of Snatcher for the Sega CD, wrote the English version of the script. One change in the English script was the addition of Western sources and authors to Mei-Ling's pool of motivational quotes; originally the character only cited Chinese proverbs natively, providing an explanation afterward in Japanese, but this prove difficult to adapt during the translation. The games detected by Psycho Mantis when <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> player's memory card were also changed, due to certain titles (such as the Tokimeki Memorial series) not being released outside Japan. This resulted in Kojima's cameo (in which he thanks the player for supporting his work via a voiceover) being cut from the Western versions, as save data from two PlayStation titles not available outside Japan, Snatcher and Policenauts, needed to be present on the player's memory card for this Easter egg to appear.|$|E

500|$|Another deleted scene {{involved}} Bruce {{waking up}} after being {{shot in the}} head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the Batmobile was, and Alfred says, [...] "Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave." [...] The platform then rotates downward to another level where the sonar-modification equipment is kept, from the special Batsuit to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father's red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. <b>He</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written 'even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week'. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by Rick Baker, {{who was in charge of}} the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. She takes her tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as <b>he</b> <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clatter of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E
