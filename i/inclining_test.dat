40|$|Ensembles of {{in-plane}} and inclined orbits in {{the vicinity}} of the Lagrange points of the terrestrial planets are integrated for up to 100 million years. The integrations incorporate the gravitational effects of Sun and the eight planets (Pluto is neglected). Mercury is the least likely planet, as it is unable to retain tadpole orbits over 100 million year timescales. Both Venus and the Earth are much more promising, as they possess rich families of stable tadpole and horseshoe orbits. Our survey of Trojans in the orbital plane of Venus is undertaken for 25 million years. Some 40 % of the survivors are on tadpole orbits. For the Earth, the integrations are pursued for 50 million years. The stable zones in the orbital plane are larger for the Earth than for Venus, but fewer of the survivors are tadpoles. Both Venus and the Earth also have regions in which <b>inclined</b> <b>test</b> particles can endure near the Lagrange points. For Venus, only test particles close to the orbital plane are stable. For the Earth, there are two bands of stability, one at low inclinations (i < 16 degrees) and one at moderate inclinations (between 24 degrees and 34 degrees). The <b>inclined</b> <b>test</b> particles that evade close encounters are primarily moving on tadpole orbits. Our survey of in-plane test particles near the Martian Lagrange points shows no survivors after 60 million years. Low inclination test particles do not persist, as their inclinations are quickly increased until the effects of a secular resonance with Jupiter cause de-stabilisation.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{laboratory}} experimental techniques aimed at determining the viscous properties of materials that are produced during fast landslides type mud and debris flows. An experimental study of the rheological behavior of a natural pyroclastic soil remixed with water {{has been carried out}} {{with the help of an}} <b>inclined</b> plane <b>tests</b> and a rotational rheometer. It has been decided to use both <b>inclined</b> <b>test</b> and rotational rheometer because, unlike standard fluid rheometer, with the <b>inclined</b> plane <b>test</b> it has been possible to use much higher volume of mixtures of appropriate size and then, next to the real. The mixtures have been reconstituted at at different volumetric solid concentrations and different grain size distributions and maximum diameter of soil particles. In the studied range of solid volumetric concentration (in which the material behaves like an homogeneous fluid) the typical rheological behavior of these suspensions is that of a yield stress fluid exhibiting a static yield stress larger than its dynamic yield stress. The static and dynamic yield stresses of these materials widely increase from very low to very large values (several orders of magnitude). <b>Inclined</b> plane <b>tests</b> provide reasonable though still approximate values for the static and dynamic yield stresses. It has been also observed that the rheological behavior of this kind of material is strongly influenced by the particles size in the mixtures too. These results suggest that in the field during the debris flow motion, a small variation of the solid fraction or particle dimensions can lead to changing the behavior from “solid-like” to “fluid-like” and vice versa. The material starts to flow beyond a critical shear stress at a relatively large velocity. The critical shear stress, related to solid fractions and particle size, might explain the in situ observed post-failure behavior of pyroclastic debris flows, which are able to flow over very long distances even over smooth slope...|$|R

It was somewhat of a departure for the Admiralty to seek scientific advice, but eminent engineers William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and William John Macquorn Rankine were appointed to the enquiry. It concluded that the ship was insufficiently stable: at 14 degrees heel (when the edge of the deck touched the sea) the righting moment (torque) due to the buoyancy pushing the ship upright again was just 410-foot-tons (1.2 MN·m). HMS Monarch, the masted turret ship proposed by the 1865 committee and designed by Reed, and which was in the area at the time of the sinking, had a righting moment of 6,500-foot-tons (20 MN·m) at the same angle. Maximum righting moment occurred at a heel of 21 degrees, and thereafter declined to zero at 54.5 degrees. Monarch's righting moment increased to a maximum at 40 degrees. Survivors testified that the Captain floated upside down for between three and ten minutes, which proved that the ship had capsized.

The paper that follows discusses the suitability of the yacht for its proposed use, describes the design development process undertaken, identifies the main regulatory issues and proposes essential modifications required for the yacht to be operated safely offshore. To assess the yacht’s general suitability for sail training purposes a preconversion evaluation was undertaken to establish initial stability characteristics, accommodation requirements, likely cost considerations, appropriate tankage capacities, estimated speed, range, confirmation of the installed power requirement and suitability of the existing sail plan. For calculation of the data presented in the paper various analytical methods were employed based {{on a combination of}} first principles engineering methodologies and those defined by the regulatory authorities. Having established the suitability of the vessel for the intended purpose detailed analysis was undertaken to assess compliance with the main regulatory requirements for intact stability, damage stability and structural safety of the yacht which also included analysis of the rig engineering.

40|$|The present master thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of producing a full scale test case {{of the performance of}} sailing yachts. With such a test case, it is believed that instantaneous and absolute performance of sailing yacht evolving in real conditions can be investigated. An out-put of this study is the ability to validate a velocity prediction program with full scale data. Through the use of a sailing yacht, a procedure for performance measurement at sea was developed. This procedure involves the use of on-board electronic instrumentation, displacement measurement and <b>inclining</b> <b>test.</b> A code is developed in Excel c, using VBA c to sort all the data gathered during the measurement campaign. The sorting of data involves the compilation of a database used for plotting the performance of the yacht in two different ways: the first to analyse the instantaneous behaviour of the yacht; the second to analyse the maximum potential performance the yacht can reach. The measurements can then be compared with simulations produced in the “same” sailing condition using a VPP. In this paper, two VPPs are investigated: SailSim c from SSPA AB and WinDesign c from the Wolfson unit at the University of Southampton. The first software has dynamical capabilities but was not used in the end for this research. The second one has only static capabilities and was used for the simulations in the present work. From the comparison between the measurements and the simulations, the quality of full scale data is established and the possibility to validate a VPP using standard sailing electronics is demonstrated. Further development is also suggested and further analysis involving full scale data is proposed. In the present master thesis a universal method to record sailing yacht’s performance data at sea was developed. Then a code to process these data and sort them into a general database useful for further studies was built. It was proven that the quality of nowadays electronics make scientific studies possible.

40|$|The small {{fishing boats}} “wasen”, Japanese style vessels were mainly {{propelled}} with scull or sails {{before the last}} War. Nowadays, however, the wasens are mostly equipped with an outboard engine and their wooden hulls are replaced with fiberglass-reinforced plastics (FRP). Accordingly, the wasens made of wood and their boat-building techniques are gradually disappearing from fishing villages. In this research, though wasen was left from the mainstream of the present age, I promoted to the wasens for its rationality of the hull-type and provided to them and their boat-builders to the historical and the technical rank throughout the wasen's model resistance test of fundamental kinematic performance and theory for security of stability. Therefore, I visited about 200 boat-builders in Kyushu, mainly within Nagasaki Prefecture and collected over 1, 000 memorandums of their boat dimensions and board drawings of hull structures from 1975 to 1985. Hull lines of wasen were redrawn from the collected data. Therefore, standing on the current state mentioned above, {{this study was conducted}} to record accurately the wasen’s structure. Also, collection of hull line records, model tests and analysis of the wasens were made to clarify its characteristics. Stasistical analysis were conducted on the principal dimentions measured from the hull lines and various characteristics were probed according to type, sea area and period of use. The procedure of clarifying the wasens of their hull-type and characteristics mentioned above were intended in the first department, “Survey of hull-type and statistical analysis for wasens”, and showed them in the second to 4 th Chapter. Next, the investigation of the wasens for their rationality, kinematic performance of resistance and stability in the first department were intended in the second department, “Hull-type and its kinematic performance”, and showed them in the 5 th to 7 th Chapter. The general result was as follows: 1) I classified and showed their characteristics about 600 various wasens which could be read necessary dimensions according to application such as fishing boat, angling, seiner, whaling, carrier and other boat from field survey. So I showed each genus of the stem post, “Miyoshi” geometry that represented wasens and made its usage clear. 2) I measured around 25 major parts of hull dimensions and showed the hull-type changes by the period and characters of the sea area usage for angling and seiner wasens. In angling wasens became small all principal dimensions and tended constant length of stern keel, “tomogawara” to approach modern times by degrees. In seiner wasens the depth became large against for the length or width of principal dimensions to approach the modern times. The characteristic usages of sea area, in angling wasens were constructed wider for the length and high stability boat around the Goto inlands and western coast of Nagasaki prefecture, and in seiner wasens were constructed so as to be applied for the fishing ground by kind and size of net fishing. 3) Next stage, I selected and produced restoring scale-models of 22 high-speed wasens used mainly as whale chaser boat from the lines of board drawings for the tank test. For the examination, there were 6 stages with full or half load condition and 3 kinds of trims, by the head and stern about 1 % extended mainly in even keel for the resistance test of the towing tank. From the tank test, I showed the dimensionless total resistance coefficient sγt for actual boat and same for 5 tonnage 5 γt, mean full-load displacement the sample boat used for comparison of hull-type, that were converted from model total resistance. As a result of 5 γt coefficient was 0. 04 to 0. 07 in low speed in Fn and near by the last hump of high-speed in Fn around 0. 17 for full-load and 0. 15 for half-load. 4) Therefore I tried analysis about propulsion performance of wasen through the above-mentioned resistance performance and the method of sweeping propulsion force of a “Ro” for the skill seaman. As the result of wasen’s effective horsepower was of 0. 04 to 0. 05 ps in average and was calculated 0. 06 ps for the maximum in a “Ro” of the skill seaman. So I inspected and suggested the possibility of the boat speed about eight knot from historical fact for the 8 sweeping pieces whale chaser “ 8 -cho-ro, Iki-seko-bune”. 5) I examined the stability of the 22 wasens above-mentioned, to compare with “standard of stability of a small fishing boat”. I decided the KG as the gravity center of height from the keel was 65 % for depth (KG= 0. 65 D) from the field survey, and calculated the stability from inlet angle and static stability of cross-curve calculation. As a result, I understood maximum righting lever was 12 to 28 cm and restoring angle was 17 to 41. 5 degrees for half-load, and same as 7 to 25 cm, 11 to 31. 5 degrees for full-load condition to the actual boat of wasen. The estimation of dynamical stability was calculated the examination of rolling period and result of the radius gyration from the <b>inclining</b> <b>test</b> for the representative models. From the result, the consequence that satisfied a safety level was provided and the wasens were recognized as the construction that maintained security. 6) On the other hand, I examined damping coefficient about roll decay (N coefficient) from angling and seiner representative model boat. The angling boat has comparatively greatly upper stack and apron stage of chine part. When the list seemed to be buried in water damped by one swing and N coefficient was about 0. 035 of 10 degrees of <b>inclining</b> <b>test.</b> But seiner boat did not show the same characteristic, N coefficient about 0. 018 same as 10 degrees of <b>inclining</b> <b>test.</b> As the result, I utilized it in application of ships stability law of next section. 7) The Japanese-style fishing boat wasen by the human power propulsion with a “Ro” was the mainstream investigated from the Meiji era to the last War in Showa had been moved in FRP boat of with outboard engine equipment in present. Therefore I examined the present situation and the stability of the small fishing boat that originated from wasen for the small size fishing boat safety level and stability law. I estimated the metacentric height of GM and displacement of the each small fishing boat from the experiment of its inclining and rolling test used by the result of radius gyration before mentioned for the trawling and long-line fishing boat at Mogi-town in Nagasaki city. The consequence that examined rationality of wasen’s hull type was as follows: 1) The principal dimensions of angling and seiner fishing wasens were clarified by period and usage of sea area. 2) The total resistance performances of selective 22 fishing wasens were clarified. 3) The propulsion performance of wasen was clarified from resistance test by towing tank and the sweeping test of a “Ro” of skill seaman. For the “ 8 -cho-ro” whaling chaser was described the possibility of the velocity of historical fact in Edo-era. 4) The selective 22 fishing wasens were confirmed security with a small fishing boat safety level. 5) The roll damping coefficient of wasens were clarified from the still water rolling experiment using the models of angling and seiner fishing boat. 6) The security of stability and current state of the small fishing boats originated from wasens were identified...|$|E

The HydroPulse{trademark} tool is designed to operate on weighted drilling mud at conventional flow rates and pressures. Pressure drilling tests confirm that the HydroPulse{trademark} tool provides 33 % to 200 % increased rate of penetration. Field tests demonstrated conventional rotary and mud motor drilling operations. The tool has been operated continuous for 50 hours on weighted mud in a wear test stand. This level of reliability is the threshold for commercial application. A seismic-while-drilling version of the tool was also developed and tested. This tool was used to demonstrate reverse vertical seismic profiling while drilling an <b>inclined</b> <b>test</b> well with a PDC bit. The primary applications for the HydroPulse{trademark} tool are deep onshore and offshore drilling where rate of penetration drives costs. The application of the seismic tool is vertical seismic profiling-while-drilling and look-ahead seismic imaging while drilling...|$|R

The modification of the experiment consisted in a change of the sample’s inclination angle and in feeding a moistening solution to the upper surface of the sample. The main aim of the modification was to create laboratory test conditions {{as close to the}} ones observed in reality as possible...|$|R
40|$|International audienceComposite lining systems {{comprising}} different geosynthetics {{and soil}} are typical capping devices in modern landfills. Analyses {{of the behavior}} of capping devices have shown that they are very sensitive components {{thanks in part to the}} shear strength of geosynthetic interfaces, many of which were reported to have controlled slippage between capping lining components during landfill slope failures. There are some laboratory testing alternatives for measuring the shear strength of the interface between geosynthetics or between geosynthetics and soil. The <b>inclined</b> plane <b>test</b> is especially appropriate for shear strength tests under low normal pressure which is a specific condition of these geosynthetic systems on cap cover. However, the selected shear strengths, inferred from the laboratory experimentation, show considerable variability, which depends on the test procedure. This work proposes a new procedure and a new interpretation of the <b>inclined</b> plane <b>test</b> taking as an example the interface between geospacers and geomembranes often considered as a critical interface. The measurement of displacement acceleration during the test gives the possibility of more accurately defining the large sliding displacement shear strength, which may approach the true residual condition...|$|R
40|$|Among recent {{developments}} in automotive crash absorbers, box-section thin-walled beams with embedded sinusoidal patterns on wall surfaces have been proposed in literature and have shown promising results under axial impacts. To cater for real-life accident situations, an efficient automotive frontal crash absorber {{must be able to}} absorb high amounts of impact energy not only in the axial direction, but also during misaligned and oblique impacts. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study and analyse the performance of beams with embedded sinusoidal patterns subjected to oblique impact loads which exert both an axial force and a bending moment. Two types of triggering mechanisms for these beams which have been recently proposed in literature, i. e. conventional notch triggers and progressive frequency triggers have been numerically studied under oblique impacts in this paper. The results obtained are compared with a plain reference specimen using the critical angle criterion. It is observed that patterned beams with notch triggers are only marginally better in oblique impacts as compared to plain beams with the same triggers. Progressive frequency triggers on the other hand, greatly improve the beam's performance under <b>inclined</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dilatancy is {{described}} as the shear-induced volume change in granular materials. An <b>inclined</b> shear <b>test</b> {{was used in this}} study to measure dilatancy on double layer asphalt specimens, where, due to the configuration of the device, dilatancy can-not be inhibited. Under monotonic loading conditions, three angles of 30 °- 45 °- 60 ° between the specimen axle and the horizontal were considered, so as to set differ-ent ratios between normal and shear force. A guillotine shear test was used to compare allowed and inhibited dilatancy at different levels of applied normal stress. The dilatancy angle ψ and the dilatancy speed were introduced as useful parameters to characterize the phenomenon. The results proved that, by inhibiting dilatancy, the interface shear strength increases of a constant amount regardless of the applied normal pressure. Moreover, the comparison of the test outcomes between the two devices highlighted the non-contemporaneity between the dila-tancy speed peak and the shear stress peak in the <b>inclined</b> shear <b>test.</b> It can be at-tributed {{to the fact that the}} volumetric expansion of the specimen is countered by the normal stress, which increases proportionally to the shear stress during the test...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) in black ginger (Kaempferia parviflora) extract (KPE) increased energy production by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in C 2 C 12 myoblasts. We herein evaluated {{the effects of}} KPE on physical fitness performance and muscular endurance in mice. Male mice were orally administered KPE for 4 weeks, and then forced swimming <b>test,</b> open-field <b>test,</b> <b>inclined</b> plane <b>test,</b> and wire hanging test were performed. KPE significantly increased the swimming time, motility after swimming, and grip strength. IL- 6 and TNF-α mRNA expression levels were decreased in the soleus muscle, whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC) - 1 α and glycogen synthase mRNA expression levels, mitochondrial number, and glycogen content were increased. These results were in agreement with those obtained for KPE and PMFs in C 2 C 12. Therefore, the activation of AMPK by PMFs {{may be one of}} the mechanisms by which KPE improves physical fitness performance and muscular endurance...|$|R
