The related high rate production processes {{will take advantage of}} a significantly in-creased level of automation to increase production speed and reproducibility.

Furthermore high rate production processes have to be absolutely mature to minimize quality con-trol efforts and scrap rates. Today the production processes for high performance CFRP compo-nents are restricted, because all crucial parameters like e. g. pressure, cure temperature, dwell time, heat-up and cool-down rates are specified and fixed. In order to meet the demands men-tioned above, a dynamic control of all crucial process parameter based on an online condition monitoring of all important laminate properties should be a viable option. A highly promising re-search approach in this respect is to analyse the laminate throughout the complete process via “Ultrasonic Sensors”.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1989 While the {{commercial}} application of polymeric composite materials is increasing, methods of processing composites {{are becoming more}} complex and cost prohibitive. Several in situ monitoring techniques have been proposed to permit the development of "smart" processes, which would reduce processing time and cost per part. One proposed technique, dielectric spectroscopy, monitors changes in the electrical properties of polymers during processing. While dielectric instrumentation has become quite sophisticated and commercially available, {{the relationships between the}} dielectric properties and the changing chemical and physical states of polymers during processing have not been quantified. This study seeks to elucidate these relationships by considering dielectric spectroscopy as a thermal analysis technique for polymer characterization. The behaviors of both ionic and dipolar species in polymers were considered. Classical thermoanalytical expressions were developed for determining the activation energies of dielectric transition and polymerization from the dielectric properties. Models which combine the contributions of ionic conductivity and dipolar relaxation were developed for relating the extent of reaction to the dielectric properties of thermosetting polymers during both isothermal and nonisothermal reaction. Ionic conduction was described using the Keinle-Race expression; the isofrequency dielectric response was described in terms of the dipolar relaxation time, using the Lane-Seferis-Bachmann equation. Using the principles of kinetic viscoelasticity, the relaxation time was considered {{as a function of the}} extent of reaction and an entanglement parameter. An expression relating the entanglement parameter to the parameters in the WLF equation was derived. Methods for removing polarization effects from <b>dielectric</b> <b>cure</b> data were also derived. The developed dielectric data analysis methods were tested using a model epoxy/amine resin for high performance polymeric composites, TGDDM cured with 25 phr DDS hardener.

The success of this approach demonstrates the usefulness of dielectric thermal analysis techniques and provides further basis for the development of quantitative dielectric techniques for polymeric composite process monitoring...|$|R

The complexity of the cure reactions was illustrated by results from DSC and FTIR experiments and was attributed to the variety of chemical reactions between the epoxy and the amine groups. Several phenomenological and mechanistic cure kinetics models were constructed, based on the cure reaction mechanisms, in order to simulate the degree of conversion during the cure. A one-to-one relationship was established between the degree of cure and the glass transition temperature of the curing resin, which was finther used in the construction of chemoviscosity models and in a simulation of the viscosity advancement during the cure. A number of mathematical techniques were utilised to evaluate the parameters involved in all the models, varying from simple linear regression methods to complex non-linear least squared estimation procedures. An in-situ dielectric monitoring technique was used in combination with the above mentioned chemorheological models, to investigate the feasibility of a quantitative correlation between the changes in the <b>dielectric</b> signal, the <b>cure</b> advancement and the major physical transformations, namely gelation and vitrification.

40|$|Permanent {{dielectric}} {{materials are}} {{integral to the}} fabrication of microelectronic devices and packaging. Dielectrics are used throughout devices to electrically and mechanically isolate conductive components. As such, {{they are required to}} have low electrical permittivity and robust mechanical properties. For packaging applications, dielectrics can be directly photo-definable. Dielectrics need to have excellent lithographic properties. These properties are pivotal for enabling high yield and low cost fabrication of reliable, energy efficient devices. The aim of this work was to develop new positive tone dielectrics which have improved or application-specific lithographic, mechanical, and electrical properties. To this end, several new dielectric polymers and chemistries were evaluated and characterized. Initially, it was desired to develop a positive tone, polynorbornene (PNB) dielectric that utilizes diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) photochemistry. Cross-linking was achieved with epoxy cross-linkers during a thermal cure. Several DNQ-containing compounds were evaluated, but only one had good miscibility with PNB. The dissolution characteristics of PNB were measured with respect to polymer composition, DNQ loading, and cross-linker loading. PNB films exhibited unique dissolution properties, and these measurements allowed for an optimum formulation to be developed. A formulation with 20 pphr DNQ and 10 pphr epoxy cross-linker had sufficient inhibition in unexposed regions and fast dissolution in exposed regions. The resulting dielectric was the first positive tone, DNQ-based PNB dielectric. After achieving photo-definability, the cross-linking of the <b>cured</b> <b>dielectric</b> was evaluated by characterizing the mechanical properties. It was discovered that DNQ acted as a cross-linker in these films, and this insight was key to achieving good <b>curing</b> of the <b>dielectric.</b> Several experiments were performed to support this conclusions, and the reaction kinetics of this cross-linking reaction were evaluated. This effort produced a functional, positive tone dielectric with a sensitivity of 408 mJ cm- 2 and contrast of 2. 3. The modulus was 2. 0 to 2. 6 GPa and the dielectric constant of 3. 7 to 3. 9, depending on the curing conditions. The DNQ cross-linking results led to the investigation of other cross-linking chemistries for positive tone dielectrics. A chemically amplified (CA) photochemistry was utilized along with a Fischer esterification cross-linking reaction. Patterning and cross-linking were demonstrated with a methacrylate polymer. Successful positive tone lithography was demonstrated at a high sensitivity of 32. 4 mJ cm- 2 and contrast of 5. 2. Cross-linking was achieved at 120 °C as shown by residual stress and solubility measurements. The CA photochemistry and Fischer esterification cross-linking were also demonstrated using a PNB dielectric, which was shown to have improved lithographic properties: a sensitivity of 8. 09 mJ cm- 2 and contrast of ≥ 14. 2. Work was performed to evaluate the effect of the polymer composition on the mechanical and electrical properties. A polymer with 60 mol% hexafluoroisopropanol norbornene and 40 mol% tert-butyl ester norbornene exhibited a dielectric constant of 2. 78, which is lower than existing positive tone dielectrics. It also outperformed existing dielectrics in several other categories, including dark erosion, volume change, cure temperature, and in-plane coefficient of thermal expansion. However, a limitation of this dielectric was cracking in thick films. The final study was to improve the mechanical properties of this CA PNB dielectric specifically to enable 5 µm thick films. First, a terpolymer was tested that included a non-functional third monomer. The dielectric constant increased to 3. 48 with 24 mol% of the third monomer. Second, low molecular weight additives were used to lower the modulus. Only one of the five tested additives enabled high quality, thick films. This additive did not significantly affect the dielectric constant at low loadings. An optimized formulation was made, and processing parameters were studied. The additive decreased the lithographic properties, lowering the sensitivity to 175 mJ cm- 2 and lowering the contrast to 4. 36.

Each dielectric can serve a variety of purposes in microelectronics packaging. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|A novel phosphorus-containing tri-functional novolac (dopotriol) was {{synthesized}} {{from the}} addition reaction of 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenan threne 10 -oxide (dopo) and rosolic acid. The structure of dopotriol {{was confirmed by}} NMR spectrum and elemental analyses. The dopotriol was blended with phenol novolac (PN) in the ratio of 10 / 0, 8 / 2, 6 / 4, 4 / 6, 2 / 8 and 0 / 10 to serve as curing agents for diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (dgeba). Thermal properties such as Tg, thermal decomposition temperature, flame retardancy, moisture absorption and <b>dielectric</b> properties of <b>cured</b> epoxy resins were evaluated. The activity and activation energy of curing were studied using the methods of the Kissinger and Ozawa by dynamic DSC scans. The glass transition temperatures of cured epoxy resins {{are in the range}} of 138 - 159 oC, increasing with the phosphorus content. This is rarely seen in the literature after introducing a flame retardant element. The flame retardancy increases with phosphorus content and a UL- 94 V- 0 grade can be achieved with phosphorus content of 1. 87 %. Similar dielectric properties and moisture absorption were observed for these phosphorus-containing epoxy resins, implying that the introduction of phosphorus into epoxy does not affect the dielectric properties and moisture absorption. We also synthesized another novel phosphorus-containing triamine (dopo-ta) from the nucleophilic addition of 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene 10 -oxide (dopo) and pararoaniline chloride using triethylamine as a catalyst. We confirmed the structure of dopo-ta by IR, Mass, NMR spectrum and elemental analysis. The dopo-ta was served as a curing agent for diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (dgeba) and dicyclopentadiene epoxy (hp 7200). Properties such as glass transition temperature, thermal decomposition temperature, flame retardancy, moisture absorption and <b>dielectric</b> properties of <b>cured</b> epoxy resins were evaluated. The glass transition temperatures of cured dgeba/dopo-ta and hp 7200 /dopo-ta are 171 oC and 190 oC, respectively. The flame retardancy increases with the phosphorus content and a UL- 94 V- 0 grade can be achieved with a phosphorus content of 1. 80 wt % for dgeba/dopo-ta/ddm and 1. 46 wt % for hp 7200 /dopo-ta/ddm systems. The dielectric constant for dgeba/dopo-ta and hp 7200 /dopo-ta is 3. 00 and 2. 89, respectively, implying dopo-ta curing system exhibits low dielectric properties. A trifunctional benzoxazine, dopot-m and CH 3 t-m, was prepared from dopotriol and 1, 1, 1 -Tris(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethane, and their structure were confirmed by NMR and IR spectra, etc. The synthesized benzoxazines were blended with another benzoxazine based on 4, 4 '-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (F-a) in the different ratios. Glass transition and thermal degradation behaviors of these thermosets were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The materials exhibited high glass transition temperatures and thermal decomposition temperature. V- 0 materials were obtained when dopot-m/F-a were tested for ignition resistance with the UL- 94 test. 我們經由dopo與rosolic加成反應合成新穎的三官能含磷硬化劑dopotriol，其結構經由NMR、EA等分析確認無誤。dopotriol與PN以比例 10 / 0, 8 / 2, 6 / 4, 4 / 6, 2 / 8 and 0 / 10 做為dgeba硬化劑。我們測得硬化環氧樹脂的熱性質Tg、Td、燃燒性、吸水性和電氣性，而硬化活化能使用DSC經由Kissinger與Ozawa估計，硬化的環氧樹脂Tg在 138 oC~ 159 oC之間，隨磷含量增加，這在文獻中導入難燃元素是少見的。另外難燃性隨磷含量增加在 1. 87 %達UL- 94 V- 0 等級。結果顯示介電質與吸水率顯示不受導入磷的影響。 另外，我們也將dopo與pararoaniline chloride使用triethyl amine做觸媒，合成了含磷六官能的dopo-ta。我們藉由IR、NMR、Mass與EA分析。我們將dopo-ta做為dgeba和hp 7200 的硬化劑，並測得其硬化後的Tg、Td、難燃性、吸水性與電氣性。硬化後的dgeba/dopo-ta和hp 7200 /dopo-ta，Tg分別為 171 oC與 190 oC。難燃性隨磷含量增加，對dgeba/dopo-ta/ddm與hp 7200 /dopo-ta/ddm磷含量分別在 1. 80 wt%與 1. 46 wt%可達UL- 94 V- 0 等級。介電常數分別為 3. 00 與 2. 89 顯示dopo-ta硬化系統有低介電性質。 由三官能的dopotriol與 1, 1, 1 -Tris(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethane製造出的benzoxazine經由NMR和IR等鑑定其結構。合成出的benzoxazine再與另一 4, 4 ’-dihydroxydiphenylmethane型的benzoxazine (F-a) 以不同莫耳比例混合，並藉由DSC與TGA測其硬化後的熱性質，此混掺的材料顯示有不錯的玻璃轉化溫度與熱裂解溫度。而藉由UL- 94 測試，我們確定dopot-m有難燃效果。總目錄 壹、	中文摘要 Ⅰ 貳、	英文摘要 Ⅱ 參、	總目錄 Ⅴ 肆、	表目錄 Ⅷ 伍、	圖目錄 Ⅸ 陸、	主文 第一章	緒論 1. 1 前言 1 1. 2 印刷電路板簡介 1 第二章	文獻回顧與原理 2. 1 含磷化合物之難燃原理 4 2. 2 - 1 環氧樹脂簡介 5 2. 2 - 2 含磷環氧樹脂硬化劑文獻回顧 6 2. 3 - 1 氧代氮代苯并環己烷簡介 8 2. 3 - 2 氧代氮代苯并環己烷文獻回顧 9 第三章	實 驗 3. 1 藥品與儀器 3. 1 - 1 實驗藥品說明 17 3. 1 - 2 儀器設備說明 18 3. 2 實驗步驟 3. 2 - 1 dopotriol之合成 20 3. 2 - 2 dopo-ta之合成 20 3. 2 - 3 benzoxazine(dopot-m) 之合成 21 3. 2 - 4 benzoxazine(CH 3 t-m) 之合成 22 3. 3 試片硬化條件 3. 3 - 1 dopotriol與環氧樹酯dgeba試片硬化 23 3. 3 - 2 dopo-ta與環氧樹酯Dgeba、HP- 7200 試片硬化 23 3. 3 - 3 dopot-m與F-a試片硬化 24 3. 3 - 4 CH 3 t-m與F-a試片硬化 24 第四章	結果與討論(Ⅰ) 4. 1 單體之鑑定 4. 1 - 1 dopotriol的NMR鑑定 26 4. 1 - 2 dopotriol的IR鑑定 30 4. 1 - 3 dopotriol DSC融點測定 31 4. 1 - 4 dopotriol的Mass分析 31 4. 1 - 5 dopotriol的EA分析 32 4. 1 - 6 dopotriol的XRD分析 33 4. 2 合成DOPOTRIOL的反應機構 34 4. 3 硬化性質與活化能 35 4. 4 熱性質分析 4. 4 - 1 DSC分析 38 4. 4 - 2 TGA分析 40 4. 5 UL- 94 燃燒性測試 41 4. 6 介電分析與吸水性測試 43 4. 7 結論 43 第五章	結果與討論(Ⅱ) 5. 1 單體之鑑定 5. 1 - 1 dopo-ta的IR鑑定 46 5. 1 - 2 dopo-ta的NMR鑑定 47 5. 1 - 3 dopo-ta DSC融點測定 51 5. 1 - 4 dopo-ta的EA分析 51 5. 1 - 5 dopo-ta的MASS分析 52 5. 2 合成dopo-ta的反應機構 53 5. 3 硬化性質與活化能 55 5. 4 反應度 59 5. 5 熱性質分析 61 5. 5 - 1 DSC分析 61 5. 5 - 2 TGA分析 63 5. 6 UL- 94 燃燒性測試 64 5. 7 介電分析 64 5. 8 吸水性測試 65 5. 9 結論 66 第六章	結果與討論(III) 67 6. 1 單體之鑑定 67 6. 1 - 1 benzoxazine(CH 3 t-m) 的IR鑑定 67 6. 1 - 2 benzoxazine(CH 3 t-m) 的 1 H-NMR鑑定 68 6. 1 - 3 benzoxazine(CH 3 t-m) 的Mass鑑定 69 6. 1 - 4 dopotriol型benzoxazine(dopot-m) 的IR鑑定 70 6. 1 - 5 dopotriol型benzoxazine (dopot-m) 的NMR鑑定 71 6. 1 - 6 dopot-m的 31 P-NMR鑑定 72 6. 1 - 7 dopotriol型benzoxazine(dopot-m) 的Mass鑑定 73 第一部份 6. 2 熱性質分析 6. 2 - 1 DSC分析 74 6. 2 - 2 TGA分析 75 6. 3 UL- 94 燃燒性測試 77 6. 4 介電分析 77 第二部份 6. 5 觸媒對共聚dgeba/benzoxazine玻璃轉化溫度影響 79 6. 6 dgeba/benzoxazine硬化後熱性質 81 6. 7 結論 84 第七章 參考文獻 85 表目錄 表 3. 1 dopotriol/dgeba試片製備 23 表 3. 2 dopot-m與F-a試片製備 24 表 3. 3 CH 3 t-m與F-a試片製備 24 表 4. 2. 硬化的DT 0 ~DT 100 的熱性質、吸水率與電氣性質 42 表 4. 3. 硬化的 DT 0 - DT 100.
