40|$|Hydroxyl radical <b>generating</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been}} {{explored}} {{in search for}} a PET formulation screening method that can predict the qualities of formulations regarding radiochemical stability. The idea of using the hydroxyl radical originates from work with polysorbate 80 screening methods, literature {{on the subject of}} stabilizing excipients in radiopharmaceuticals, and the process of radiolysis of water. The Fenton reaction and UV irradiation of hydrogen peroxide have been used to generate the hydroxyl radical. A GE proprietary model substance (the API) where the PET radionuclide 18 F has been replaced by the stable nuclide 19 F, has been used to model the effects of the radical <b>generating</b> <b>methods.</b> A hydroxyl radical loading procedure as well as a procedure where the hydroxyl radical was generated {{in the presence of the}} 19 F API, have been applied for both the hydroxyl radical <b>generating</b> <b>methods.</b> A qualitative test (the methylene blue dye test) was used to verify the presence of the hydroxyl radical. The concentration of 19 F API has been analyzed by HPLC with UV detection, and the effects of the hydroxyl radical generated from the mentioned methods estimated. The impurity profiles of these same samples have been compared to those of equivalent radioactive 18 F PET drug product, to get indications of how representative the hydroxyl radical based screening method could be of the radiolytic processes. As a part of the method development, alternative formulations to that already used with the model substance have been developed and manufactured. In samples treated with the hydroxyl radical <b>generating</b> <b>methods,</b> the 19 F API concentration was found to be reduced, and the presence of the hydroxyl radical verified in the applied procedures. The impurity profiles vary for different 19 F API sample matrixes, as well as for the hydroxyl radical <b>generating</b> <b>methods</b> and procedures, but many degradation peaks with the same relative retention time as those from radioactive 18 F drug product analyses were found. The methods were also able to detect some trends with regards to the effect of chosen formulation factors. To conclude on the value of both the use of the hydroxyl radical in such a screening method and the radical <b>generating</b> <b>methods</b> employed, further analyses and methods to determine the mechanism behind the observed effects, the identity of degradation peaks, as well as quantifications of the hydroxyl radical must be implemented. In addition the method will need optimization to both reduce and estimate uncertainty, and to establish reproducibility...|$|R

40|$|Background: In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the {{statistical}} {{significance of a}} peptide-spectrum or protein-spectrum match is an important indicator of the correctness of the peptide or protein identification. In bottom-up mass spectrometry, probabilistic models, such as the <b>generating</b> function <b>method,</b> have been successfully applied to compute {{the statistical}} significance of peptide-spectrum matches for short peptides containing no post-translational modifications. As top-down mass spectrometry, which often identifies intact proteins with post-translational modifications, becomes available in many laboratories, the estimation of statistical significance of top-down protein identification results has come into great demand. Results: In this paper, we study an extended <b>generating</b> function <b>method</b> for accurately computing the statistical significance of protein-spectrum matches with post-translational modifications. Experiments show that the extended <b>generating</b> function <b>method</b> achieves high accuracy in computing spectral probabilities and false discovery rates.

Generally, it’s desirable {{that there is}} no foot-ground slipping during biped walking.

By selecting the hip’s horizontal locomotion as the parameter, the trajectories in task space for walking are planned. A task space controller without calculating the inversion of inertial matrix is presented. Simulation experiments are implemented on a virtual 5 -link point foot biped robot.

The paper proposes a series of weights <b>generating</b> <b>methods</b> in equidifferent forms.

These properties {{similar to that of the}} geometric (maximum entropy) OWA operator, which can also be seen as the discrete case of equidifferent RIM (regular increasing monotone) quantifiers.
