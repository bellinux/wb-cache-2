5|$|Born in Croydon, Victoria, Stanley James Goble {{was one of}} {{four sons}} to an Australian father, George, and an English mother, Ann. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> {{received}} little schooling, and began his working life as a clerk with the Victorian Railways at the age of sixteen. By twenty-three he was, like his father, a stationmaster.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{married three}} times: Roxana, {{daughter}} of the Sogdian nobleman Oxyartes of Bactria, out of love; and the Persian princesses Stateira II and Parysatis II, the former a daughter of Darius III and latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III, for political reasons. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is," [...] {{asserted}} Mrs. Hastings with a laugh. [...] "You see, he's highly eligible {{from our}} point of view, {{but at the same time}} <b>he's</b> <b>apparently</b> invulnerable. I believe," [...] she added dryly, [...] "that's the right word, too." ...|$|R

5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> also {{toyed with the idea of}} abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E
5|$|In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying {{to explore}} the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to Parthia and reached the Persian Gulf. Gan left a {{detailed}} account of western countries; <b>he</b> <b>apparently</b> reached as far as Mesopotamia, then {{under the control of the}} Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip was dangerous and could take two years. Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories, as far as the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
5|$|Much of Khalid's {{strategic}} and tactical genius lies in {{his use of}} extreme methods. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> put more emphasis on annihilating enemy troops, rather than achieving victory by simply defeating them. For instance his employment of the double envelopment maneuver against the numerically superior Persian army at the Battle of Walaja, and his maneuver at the Battle of Yarmouk where he virtually trapped the Byzantine army between three steep ravines by stealthily capturing their only escape route, a bridge, at their rear.|$|E

5|$|Nicholson {{was born}} in the village of Downholme, Yorkshire, England, on 12 November 1655. Little is known of his ancestry or early life, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>apparently</b> received some education. He served as a page in the household of Charles Paulet (later the Marquess of Winchester and the Duke of Bolton), under whose patronage his career would be advanced. He waited on Paulet's daughter Jane, who married John Egerton, Earl of Bridgewater, another patron who promoted his career.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before. A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is {{believed}} to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.|$|E
5|$|Pound was in Rome {{early in}} September when Italy surrendered. He {{borrowed}} {{a pair of}} hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked {{the rest of the}} way; <b>he</b> <b>apparently</b> traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.|$|E

5|$|The {{convention}} deadlocked {{among the}} three main candidates, with Virginia's votes going to Clay. Many Northern Whigs opposed Clay, and some, including Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, showed the Virginians a letter written by Scott in which <b>he</b> <b>apparently</b> displayed abolitionist sentiments. The influential Virginia delegation then announced that Harrison was its second choice, causing most Scott supporters to abandon him in favor of Harrison, who gained the presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|When the deanship of the {{law school}} came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> had strong support from several members of the university's board of governors. At the same time however, he was {{increasingly}} drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to Sidney Smith, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for one more year. In 1930, he resigned so he would be free to enter politics.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that <b>he</b> <b>apparently</b> never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not known}} when Marshall began {{studying}} law, nor who his tutor was, he was practicing as early as 1785. In that year, he discovered a flaw in the original 1774 survey of the town of Frankfort. Due to the flaw, several choice acres of land {{in the northern part of}} Frankfort remained unclaimed, and Marshall quickly entered claims for them at the land office. Marshall also gained membership in the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, a Danville-based society dedicated to disseminating information to farmers, mechanics, and other common citizens. <b>He</b> <b>apparently</b> was not accepted for membership in the Danville Political Club, although some sources report that he was accepted as a member after initially being rejected.|$|E
5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an illegitimate child. Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 <b>he</b> <b>apparently</b> tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Chotiner {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Knowland. Knowland cross-filed and won both major party primaries, virtually assuring his re-election. The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the California 22nd Congressional district Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file‚Äîthe state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, {{which was supposed to}} be for Congressional use only, though <b>he</b> <b>apparently</b> made no public use of the file in the campaign. Holt defeated Tenney in the primary, and {{went on to win the}} general election.|$|E
