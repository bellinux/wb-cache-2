50|$|The high <b>dividends</b> <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> {{the final}} years of the SVR's {{independent}} existence had been achieved by not doing enough maintenance of the line or locomotives. There were a number of track-related derailments in the early period of Midland ownership, and Miles et al attribute them to lack of maintenance. The Midland was no doubt aware of the poor state of the infrastructure of the network it had acquired, and it quickly set about modernising it; track replacement was an early priority, followed by the renewal of some bridges.|$|R

40|$|We recover {{prices of}} {{dividend}} strips on the aggregate stock market {{using data from}} derivatives markets. The price of a k-year dividend strip is {{the present value of}} the <b>dividend</b> <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> k years. The value of the stock market is the sum of all dividend strip prices across maturities. We study the properties of strips and find that expected returns, Sharpe ratios, and volatilities on short-term strips are higher than on the aggregate stock market, while their CAPM betas are well below one. Short-term strip prices are more volatile than their realizations, leading to excess volatility and return predictability. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the disappearing dividend phenomenon within the Nigerian context by observing dividend patterns between year 2003 to 2012. We investigate {{possible explanation for}} the pattern observed by examining factors that determine a firm's decision to pay or not to pay dividends. Findings indicate a {{decline in the number of}} firms paying dividends and a downward trend <b>in</b> nominal <b>dividends</b> <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> latter years. Fixed effect logistic estimates indicate that firms with higher level of foreign ownership are less likely to pay dividends. Our findings therefore provide support for the tax-induced clientele theory of dividends. The study also provide support for profitability as a characteristic of a dividend payer and support for dividend smoothing hypothesis. However, we did not find evidence in support of the catering theory and the life cycle theory of dividend...|$|R

40|$|Agency theory {{suggests}} that dividends {{can be used to}} mitigate agency problems between shareholders and managers. If director stock options are granted to align the interests of directors with shareholders, we anticipate that there will be less need for external governance mechanisms such as dividends. Examining the association between outside director stock options and dividend policy, we show that outside director option compensation indeed varies inversely with dividend distribution. This result suggests that incentivizing outside directors reduces the need for external market monitoring through dividends. Controlling for the sensitivity of options to changes in dividends, we illustrate that the lack of dividend protection for stock options is not a sufficient explanation for the reduction of dividends. We also show that while investment policy might dominate the decision to offer a dividend, director stock options {{play an important role in}} determining the level of <b>dividend</b> <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> firms that pay dividends.

40|$|We examine recent confrontational {{shareholder}} activism campaigns by {{hedge funds}} and by other private investors. The three main {{parallels between the}} groups are a significantly positive market reaction for the target firm around the initial Schedule 13 D filing date, a further significant increase in share price for the subsequent year, and the activist's high success rate in gaining its original objective. The two main differences are the types of companies each group targets and the activists' post-investment strategies. Hedge funds target more profitable and healthy firms than other activists. Afterwards, hedge funds reduce the target's cash holdings by increasing its leverage and <b>dividends</b> <b>paid.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, other activists lower the target's capital expenditures and research and development costs. In total, we conclude that the activism benefits existing shareholders of the targeted firms, but that hedge funds and other entrepreneurial activists achieve these benefits through different outlets. ...|$|R
50|$|Each year a {{taxpayer}} must calculate and then pay the greater {{of an alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) or regular tax. Effectively for high income earners who mitigate their tax position from the day-to-day income tax, an end of year consolidation of all taxable income is requested and submitted. This is then <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> (from the normal payroll income tax) less any allowable deductions. For many taxpayers, the effective marginal tax rates are 0% (exemption), 26% (low bracket), 28% (high bracket), 32.5% (low bracket with exemption phase out), and 35% (high bracket with exemption phase out), with increasing taxable income as modified for AMT. As with regular federal income tax, rates and exemptions vary by filing status. The lower rate and the exemption are phased out above certain income levels at 25% of AMT income. A lower rate applies on capital gains (and qualifying dividends).|$|R

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of historical dividend policy to firms, I investigate whether dividend payers manipulate earnings through real activities to smooth dividend levels and dividend payout ratios. Using Compustat’s Execucomp database, I find evidence that dividend policy impacts both upward and downward real earnings management. I find that payers manipulate earnings upward through real activities to mitigate the shortfall of pre-managed earnings relative to prior year dividends when pre-managed earnings are lower than <b>dividends</b> <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> the prior year, suggesting that dividend levels are an important earnings benchmark. I document a stronger relationship between changes in pre-managed earnings and real earnings management for payers than for non-payers, suggesting that dividend policies impact real earnings management. Consistent with {{the importance}} of dividend policy in real earnings management, I show that dividend payers that follow conservative dividend policies manipulate earnings {{to a greater extent}} than dividend payers that do not follow conservative dividend policies...|$|R
40|$|Frank and Jagannathan (1998) compare {{ex-dividend}} drop in {{share price}} to the <b>dividend</b> <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> a tax-free environment {{and argue that}} market microstructure effects may explain a ratio of less than one. This study examines whether the results are supported in the UK gilt market where tax effects {{are also likely to}} be negligible. As there is a time delay from a stock's closing price on the cum-dividend day to the ex-dividend day of, usually, up to 3 days, a proxy is used to account for changes in the stock price unrelated to the dividend payment. An equilibrium model such as the capital asset pricing model is usually used for this purpose. The availability of gilt yield curve data from the Bank of England provides a potentially better proxy for the effects of changes on the gilt prices which are unrelated to the coupon paid. The results provide evidence that the gilt drop-off ratio is, in the main, not significantly different from one. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1995, several {{opposition}} movements (FPP, MDD PSD, FC and ADP) {{joined together}} and formed the Conseil Démocratique des Partis de l'Opposition CODEPO.

One of the mutinies involved approximately 200 soldiers who demanded salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. The aftermath led the French troops stationed in the country to suppress the rebellion and restore order. In December, at the 19th Summit Meeting of Heads of State and Government of France and Africa, Patassé asked the Presidents of Gabon, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali to mediate a truce between government and rebel forces.|$|R
