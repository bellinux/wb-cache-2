Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that I give a lot of credit to the developer on. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> right. They were smart about the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean." ...|$|E

2500|$|All of {{the explosions}} {{in the movie}} were filmed in one shot, {{as opposed to a}} typical film where each would have been covered by {{multiple}} cameras. Russell explained, [...] "to me that's more real. The car's blowing up on this guy, and we just park the camera. Of course the producer says, 'we gotta run three cameras!' But if I cut three ways, then <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> like an action picture." [...] Russell also had the Foley department tone down the sounds of gunfire, saying he didn't want to [...] "Bruce Willis-ize" [...] the film." [...] One frequently noted shot in the film is an image of a bullet piercing a number of internal organs, releasing bile into the abdominal cavity, used when Gates is describing sepsis as the effect of a gunshot wound. This internal camera is again used when SFC Barlow is shot in the torso and his chest begins to fill with air, crushing his lung. Both of these scenes were inspired by Russell asking an emergency room doctor friend [...] "What's the weirdest wound you've ever seen?" [...] It also erupted a minor controversy, when Russell began to joke around that the gunshots were fired into a real corpse; a statement everyone vehemently denied later.|$|E
