50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>weever,</b> Trachinus draco Linnaeus, 1758.|$|E
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> (Trachinus draco, Linnaeus 1758) is a benthic and {{demersal}} venomous marine fish of {{the family}} Trachinidae. The <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> is widely distributed along the eastern Atlantic coastline from Norway to Morocco, extending to the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas.Trachinus draco {{has been shown to}} occur in depths ranging from shallow water up to -150 meters where it inhabits mostly muddy or sandy grounds.Trachinus draco is mostly and notoriously known for its venomous spines that can inflict serious injuries on humans through accidental stinging. Because of these spines and its potent venom it is classified {{as one of the most}} venomous fishes in the Mediterranean.⁠The name “weever” is thought to originate from the Anglo-Saxon word “wivre” which translates as “viper”.|$|E
5000|$|Although the <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> is sold commercially in France, {{where it}} is seen as a delicacy, it is often caught as by-catch.⁠ [...] ⁠If caught {{together}} with other by-catch fish it is often sold on markets in the category of mixed fish also called “morralla” or at least this is considered a practice {{in some parts of the}} Mediterranean.⁠ ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{incident}} regarding humans is strongly connected with T. draco’ s typical behaviour: being burrowed {{in the sand}} of shallow waters. Especially in the summer it is quite possibility for a careless bather to step, jump or fall on the venomous spines of the <b>greater</b> <b>weever.</b> The other occasion where humans are at risk to get stung by T. draco is when fishermen are handling the fish if caught in a net.⁠⁠⁠The venom of the <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> is best-known for the excruciating pain it provokes {{a short period of}} time after the initial sting which can last from a few hours to days. There are in fact cases reported, in which victims of a weever sting were still affected by it after a period of 4 months, even if this seems to be a rare scenario. The pain can in some cases reach up to a 10/10 on the visual analogue scale In a reported case from 1782, a fishermen who had been stung, amputated his own finger to relieve the pain.⁠ ⁠Even if there are reported cases of fatal accidents with T. draco, it is widely believed that those are due to secondary infections and sepsis rather than to the toxin itself.⁠ ...|$|E
50|$|Most human stings are {{inflicted by}} the lesser weever, which habitually remains buried in sandy areas of shallow water {{and is thus}} more likely to {{come into contact with}} bathers than other species (such as the <b>greater</b> <b>weever,</b> which prefers deeper water); stings from other species are {{generally}} limited to anglers and commercial fishermen. Even very shallow water (sometimes little more than damp sand) may harbour lesser weevers. The vast majority of injuries occur to the foot and are the result of stepping on buried fish; other common sites of injury are the hands and buttocks.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are as many}} {{recommended}} {{treatments for}} a sting of the <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> as there are fishermen who were stung by them. These recommendations reach from the application of hot water or vinegar to more arcane methods like fish liver, tobacco juice or the suggestion of “burning the devilish weever, swear and pray”.⁠The modern medicine does in fact recommend the application {{of any kind of}} heat preferably to souse the affected limb into hot water (40-42 °C). Beside this first aid attempt to ease the pain it is recommended to clean the wound and to see a physician because antibiotics, further analgesics or even a tetanus prophylaxis might be appropriate.⁠ ...|$|E
50|$|The {{reproduction}} {{period of}} T. draco seems to lasts from June to October.⁠ This very broad range {{is limited by}} the observations of Ole Bagge (2004) who states, that his findings strongly indicate that the spawning time of T. draco is indeed restricted to the period between June and August with a peek in July. Bagge states further, that there have been no findings of <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> in spawning condition from September to May in the following year.⁠T. draco is an oviparous spawning fish that lays its eggs into the pelagic zone. ⁠The larvae have a size of about 4.8 mm to 6.8 mm ⁠ and hatch after approximately three months. The larvae and the eggs can both be found in the pelagic zone and the surface plankton. The larvae of T. draco may have a need for relatively warm water with a relatively low salinity to hatch in greater numbers.⁠⁠T. draco is probably not territorial, not even in mating season. It does not carry out any form of parental care, or at least this kind of behaviour could never be observed.|$|E

40|$|Trachinus Draco, {{known as}} <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> fish, {{probably}} seen {{more frequently than}} has been reported. However, only a few clinical cases {{have been reported in}} the literature that describes Trachinus species envenomation. Here, we presented a case poisoned by a weever fish and tried to describe the signs/symptoms and treatment modalities of the weever fish envenomation and also tried to emphasize poisonings that could be far from the sea with dead sea creatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{species and}} size {{selectivity}} of long-lines using small hooks were studied off the south coast of Portugal using ''Mustad'' brand round bent, flatted sea hooks (Quality 2316 DT) numbers 15, 13, and 11 baited with razor shell clam (Ei-isis siliqua). Hook numbers 13 and 11 are 49 and 109 % larger respectively than number 15 hooks {{in terms of}} overall size (maximum width x maximum length). A total of 39 900 hooks were fished in 45 sets and 35 species of fish and cephalopods were caught. As a group, 13 species of sea breams (Sparidae) dominated the catch by numbers (58 %) and weight (73 %). Six species of sea breams, along with the <b>greater</b> <b>weever</b> fish (Trachinus draco) accounted for 81 % of the total catch by weight, with the common or white sea bream (Diplodus sargus) bring the most important (29 %). Catch size distributions by hook size were, in general, highly overlapped for all species and hook size had little apparent effect on minimum size at capture. All hooks caught {{a wide range of}} sizes per species, but the catch rate (number of fish per 100 hooks) was significantly lower for the largest hook. Except for the black sea bream (Spondyliosoma cantharus), capture of illegally sized or immature fish was minimal. Small increases in average size with hook size were evident for four species: Diplodus sargus, D. vulgaris, Lithognathus mormyrus and Serranus cabrilla. No differences in size selectivity were detected for Boops boops, D. annularis, Spondyliosoma cantharus and Trachinus draco. A skew-normal model adequately described differences in size selectivity in five of six species. (C) 1996 International Council for the Exploration of the Se...|$|E
