This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, nearly 75% of Irish {{people lived}} in rural areas. About 38% of these {{comprised}} the agricultural workforce, of which nearly 70% were agricultural labourers, 25% of these forming a class of 'landless' labourers, an estimated 60,000 in number, together with their families amounting to {{nearly a quarter of}} a million of the rural population, struggling to survive in the squalor of 40,000 one room 'cabins' (together with their animals if they could afford them). Their simple twin demand was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> home and a small piece of land. The Land League was thus forced to also address labourer's issues.|$|E
25|$|Huysmans {{followed}} {{it with the}} novel, Marthe, Histoire d'une fille (1876). The {{story of a young}} prostitute, it was closer to Naturalism and brought him to the attention of Émile Zola. His next works were similar: sombre, realistic and filled with detailed evocations of Paris, a city Huysmans knew intimately. Les Soeurs Vatard (1879), dedicated to Zola, deals with the lives of women in a bookbindery. En ménage (1881) is an account of a writer's failed marriage. The climax of his early work is the novella À vau-l'eau (1882) (Downstream or With the Flow), the story of a downtrodden clerk, Monsieur Folantin, and his quest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> meal.|$|E
25|$|Despite going {{days without}} eating, {{and having to}} sleep on the wrestling mats at the gym, he refused to turn professional, {{partially}} to preserve his amateur status and he also did not want his mother to discover he was earning a living as a boxer. When friends who knew him from his gym work, and seeing him struggle to pay <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> meal, asked why he didn't take up the nightly paid 'private' fights, Welsh initially refused. Despite his misgivings, the next day Welsh took up the offer and knocked out Kid Allen in a third round bout. This was followed with wins over Johnny Mezier, Young Peterson and Jack Cameron. With his financial issues resolved and being able to pay for steady meals, at the age of nineteen, Welsh decided to turn professional.|$|E

25|$|The Legend-class cutters are {{the second}} longest of all U.S. Coast Guard cutters, behind the {{research}} icebreaker , and {{will replace the}} twelve s in service. These cutters are envisioned by the Coast Guard as being able to undertake {{the entire range of}} the high endurance cutter roles with additional upgrades to make it more of an asset to the Department of Defense during declared national emergency contingencies. These vessels can be used for intercepting suspect vessels, or for rescuing swimmers, fishery protection, maritime homeland security missions, counterterrorism, coastal patrol missions, defense operations and other military/naval operations, and can assist in mine warfare. To facilitate intercept missions, the Legend class can carry and launch both the Short Range Prosecutor and the Long Range Interceptor rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs). The cutters are configured to be able to survive in Low Threat Environments, which can include the enemy having a poorly equipped military, some coastal patrol craft, and few to none anti-ship cruise missiles, operations in this environment could be general defense operations including theater security, port protection, ship escort, anti-piracy, and maritime interception operations, and the cutters can also survive in Medium Threat Environments, which can include fairly well equipped military, with ships and aircraft with weapons and radar coverage well offshore, higher numbers of anti-ship cruise missiles and a possible submarine threat, operations in this threat environment could include defense operations, naval surface fire support, and the evacuation of non-combatants. The cutters are not expected to survive in a high threat environment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> amount of time with their current configuration.|$|E

However, the IAU announcement on September 17, 2008, that Haumea had been accepted as a dwarf planet, did not mention a discoverer. The location of discovery was listed as the Sierra Nevada Observatory of the Spanish team, but the chosen name, Haumea, was the Caltech proposal; Ortiz's team had proposed [...] "Ataecina", named for the ancient Iberian goddess of Spring.|$|E
500|$|In 1903 Shaw {{joined in}} a {{controversy}} about vaccination against smallpox. He called vaccination [...] "a peculiarly [...] filthy piece of witchcraft"; in his view immunisation campaigns were a cheap and inadequate substitute <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> programme of housing for the poor, which would, he declared, be the means of eradicating smallpox and other infectious diseases. Less contentiously, Shaw was keenly interested in transport; Laurence observed in 1992 {{a need for a}} published study of Shaw's interest in [...] "bicycling, motorbikes, automobiles, and planes, climaxing in his joining the Interplanetary Society in his nineties". Shaw published articles on travel, took photographs of his journeys, and submitted notes to the Royal Automobile Club.|$|E

As Saldívar has noted, [...] "Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well." [...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the up-tempo dance song [...] "Lose My Breath", a track {{detailing}} a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums and keyboard stabs and the backing track contains various sound effects. [...] "Soldier", the second track with T.I. and Lil Wayne, the only featured artists on the album, contains elements from Southern hip hop and Crunk. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover {{from the opening}} song, the protagonists ask <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> soldier, further singing about finding a gangster. After finding the soldier, the third song, the R number [...] "Cater 2 U", lyrically is about submissively serving the man considered as such. Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} social structure, the Industrial Revolution {{witnessed}} the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> life; however, most workers in textiles, which {{was by far the}} leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children. [...] Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel – child labour, dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, under President Evo Morales, a new Law for Universal Access to Electricity (Ley de Acceso Universal) was proposed. Under the {{framework}} of this Law, the program called ‘Electricity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Decent</b> Living” {{has been designed to}} improve both rural and urban electrification. The short-term goal (2006–2010) of the program is to increase rural electrification to 53% (connection of 210,000 new households) and urban electrification to 97% (connection of 460,000 new households). The medium-term goal (2010–2015) is to achieve universal access in urban areas and a 70% access in rural ones. In the final stages, rural access would have increased to 87% by 2020 and universal coverage would be reached by 2025. The Law also mandates de creation of a Common Fund for Universal Access to Public Electricity Service (FOCO) and creates a co-financing mechanism of the National Government with Prefectures, municipalities and the private sector. [...] However, the Law has not been approved yet, although it is expected that the Law and the mechanisms it creates will be approved soon.|$|E
2500|$|Contracts between {{employees}} and employers (mostly corporations) usually begin an employment relationship, but {{are often not}} enough <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> livelihood. Because individuals lack bargaining power, especially against wealthy corporations, labor law creates rights that override unjust market outcomes. Historically, the law rigidly enforced property rights and [...] "freedom of contract" [...] on any terms, even if this was inefficient, exploitative and unjust. In the early 20th century, as more people favored the introduction of democratically determined economic and social rights over rights of property and contract in unequal markets, {{state and federal governments}} introduced law reform. First, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 created a minimum wage (now $7.25 at federal level, higher in 28 states) and overtime pay of one and a half times. Second, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 creates very limited rights to take unpaid leave. In practice, good employment contracts improve on these minimums. Third, while there is no right to an occupational pension or other benefits, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ensures employers guarantee those benefits if they are promised. Fourth, the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970 demands a safe system of work, backed by professional inspectors. Individual states are often empowered to go beyond the federal minimum, and function as laboratories of democracy in social and economic rights, where they have not been constrained by the US Supreme Court.|$|E
