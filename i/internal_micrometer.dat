40|$|Abstract: The use of {{measurement}} system Repeatability and Reproducibility (R&R) studies is widespread in industry. Such analyses have become mandatory for many companies who supply {{the automotive industry}} and is now {{an integral part of}} the QS 9000 automotive industry standard. R&R study allow one to estimate the contribution of variation attributable to the measurement system itself and is used to ensure that a company measurement system is acceptable. If the measurement system R&R study indicate that the recorded measurements may be unreliable, this may impact all subsequent analyses, e. g. control charts, capability analyses etc. It is the aim of this paper to address such issues and to show a measurement system R&R case study that was made in a major automotive company. A measurement system used to measure a bore diameter of a part, having a specification of 18. 1 to 18. 3 mm was to be evaluated. Ten parts have been selected for measurements by three operators. Each part was measured twice with a dial bore gauge. Because R&R value was between 10 % and 30 %, it had required further analysis to find the sources {{of measurement}} error. The supposition was that the dial bore gauge was not adequate to measure this bore diameter, so it was replaced by an <b>internal</b> <b>micrometer</b> and another measurement system R&R study was made. The conclusion was that the new measuring system is excellent...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{known as}} 'Bowers Precision Engineers', {{established}} as a toolmaker in Bradford in 1915. In 1994 it developed a 3-point <b>internal</b> bore <b>micrometer.</b> In 1979 'Bowers Internal Gauge Company Limited' was found by Roger Bowers. The company moved to Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1989. In 2000, Bowers Metrology Group was founded.

40|$|Probes (sampling, temperature, pressure) for {{high-temperature}} environments, such as {{gas turbine}} combustors, can survive {{only if they}} are cooled. To keep probe size small, the cooling passages must be microchannels, [O] 100 <b>micrometer</b> <b>internal</b> diameter. For logistical reasons, the length-to-diameter ratio is considerable. Heat fluxes are high, so that boiling occurs even with high velocities. The limiting factor for probe survivability, then, is the critical heat flux (CHF). This paper summarizes an experimental study of CHF in cooling channels that might be used for probes. A CHF correlation for water coolant is developed for design. An orifice at the channel inlet, originally conceived for enhancement, was found to dramatically improve the flow stability and increase the CHF. Pumping power requirements for plain tubes and orificed tubes are also documented...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and advantages of in situ synthesis of organic polymer monolith supports for metal pre-catalysts in narrow bore fused silica capillary microreactors are described. Catalyst immobilisation involves the covalent attachment of ligand binding sites to the porous polymer monolith, followed by coordination to metal centres. Flow-through microreactors using poly(chloromethylstyrene-co-divinylbenzene) monolith in capillaries of <b>internal</b> diameter 250 <b>micrometers</b> were used successfully for Suzuki– Miyaura and Sonogashira reactions, utilising both 1, 10 -phenanthroline and imidazole/carbene binding to palladium and with very low palladium leaching, illustrating {{the potential of}} flow-through technology at the microscale level using organic monolith support for transition metal catalysed reactions. Polymer monoliths, present as a continuous phase filling capillaries and bonded to the internal surface, are promising new materials for solid supported catalysis in microreactors. The performance of the flow-through microreactors included quantitative yields for the conversion of iodobenzene in the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, and quantitative yields for Sonagashira coupling of p-iodoacetophenone with phenylacetylene...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION It {{has been}} {{recognised}} in industry that {{the measurement of}} large components to high orders of accuracy presents a particularly difficult problem. This fact has been emphasised by a survey {{carried out by the}} N. P. L. (Ref. 1) in which a number of engineering firms in Great Britain were asked to declare the size of several prepared test pieces ranging in diameter from 15 inches to 80 inches. In general terms the result of this investigation showed that, under industrial conditions using conventional equipment, it was not possible V declare the size of large components to an accuracy of better than - 30 parts in a million under workshop conditions and - 15 parts in a million under inspection conditions. The survey also showed that above 20 inches the accuracy of determination of internal diameters was somewhat higher than for external diameters. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to indicate the main problems associated with measuring large sizes and to describe the experimental work undertaken at the College of Aeronautics in the design and testing of a new type of stick <b>micrometer</b> for <b>internal</b> diameters and <b>micrometer</b> frame for external diameters...|$|R
