500|$|In 1991, the {{environment}} ministers for France, Italy and Switzerland {{came together to}} agree the formation of Espace Mont Blanc – a partnership of national authorities and local communities {{to plan for the}} future development and protection of the Mont Blanc region. In 1998, the group was charged with creating a sustainable development scheme for the region (finally launched in 2005), whilst in 2003 it adopted a plan for safeguarding sensitive environments and landscapes. In 2007, it produced its position statement regarding the classification of Mont Blanc as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in 2009 a Transboundary <b>Integrated</b> <b>Plan</b> (PIT) was announced, with the implementation of six regional projects running until 2013. In 2014, the group launched [...] "Strategy for the Future", which is intended to be a strategic tool for ensuring that public policies are consistent across the different territories around the Mont Blanc massif.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} Australian and international interest in <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> that promotes health and wellbeing. Melbourne is experiencing unprecedented rapid population growth, {{especially in the}} outer suburban Growth Areas {{to the north and}} west. This is creating public health challenges associated with low-density, single land-use, car-dependent suburban developments. Because of the state government&# 039;s leadership role in the <b>planning</b> system, <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> across state policy sectors is critical for creating healthy communities. This paper examines the extent to which key Victorian legislation supports <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> that promotes health. It involves a content analysis of three statutory documents: the Planning and Environment Act 1987, the Transport Integration Act 2010, and the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008. These documents are assessed against criteria that reflect best-practice principles for <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> for health. While the Acts contain some supportive features, they also present significant barriers to <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> that promotes health. Recommended changes to the legislation are outlined, to assist policymakers to create healthy communities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>planning</b> across {{multiple}} sectors {{is essential for}} creating healthy communities, where jobs, shops and services are accessible from homes via walking, cycling or public transport. This paper explores barriers and enablers of health-promoting <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> in Melbourne, focussing on horizontal integration across Victorian state government departments and agencies. Content analysis was undertaken of Victorian state government policy documents that shape the health of urban environments. The planning strategy for Portland, Oregon, USA was also analysed, to identify lessons that might {{be drawn from the}} City of Portland, which is widely regarded as a leading example of <b>integrated</b> <b>planning.</b> In addition, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior policymakers from the Victorian state government and the City of Portland. Walt and Gilson&# 039;s (1994) policy analysis framework was used to assess and categorise barriers and enablers of <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> into actor, process, content and context factors. Despite clear aspirations and efforts at health-promoting <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> in Victoria, this research suggests that key challenges remain, such as the disconnection between land use planning and infrastructure and service delivery. Recommendations for improving governance arrangements, policy processes and policy content are outlined, to assist in the creation of healthier communities through <b>integrated</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

Analyzing these experiences with the BC Core Functions Improvement Process and reviewing the literature of other recent initiatives leads to a summary of potential key areas to address public health improvement. This project will explore in detail the key area of <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> using information from interviews with public health staff, a public health leadership team meeting, implementation of an <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> framework, and the relevant literature. A proposed framework for <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> will assist health authorities in successfully implementing public health improvement initiatives, assist the Ministry of Health in their goal of renewing public health services, and move towards an <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> and delivery system in public health in British Columbia...|$|R

Through the examination of series of planning evaluation framework with shared <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> idea, it proposes a more practical and <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> evaluation framework method as an <b>integrated</b> <b>planning</b> platform that can guide the planning and design process for a true sustainable solution. The Light Sustainable Systems Integration Model Framework (Light SSIM) calculates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using programmatic and spatial patterns (urban form) of the plan alternatives. These KPIs are then presented in a decision matrix that allows stakeholders to prioritize performance factors and select a preferred plan based on a rational, quantifiable, and transparent decision process. This becomes master plan tools for urban design sustainability assessment which is being applied in Indonesia by AECOM Jakarta...|$|R
