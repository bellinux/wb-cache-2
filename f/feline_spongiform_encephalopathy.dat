50|$|<b>Feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is {{a disease}} that affects the brains of felines. It is caused by {{proteins}} called prions.|$|E
50|$|The protein {{can exist}} in {{multiple}} isoforms, the normal PrPC, and as Protease resistance PrPRes like the disease-causing PrPSc(scrapie) and an isoform located in mitochondria.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Public {{health and}} {{agricultural}} policy attempts to keep bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> out of North America using infectious disease containment policies. Inconsistencies of the infectious disease model {{as it applies}} to the <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> may result in failure of these policies. METHODS: Review of historical, political and scientific literature to determine the appropriate disease model of <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> has always occurred sporadically in man and other animals. Hippocrates may have described it in goats and cattle. Transmission of <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> between individuals is too uncommon for it to be usefully considered an infection. <b>Spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is a somatic disorder whose dissemination within a host or transmission between individuals is more like cancer than infectious disease. <b>Spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> transmission within a species is facilitated in comparison to transmission between species so that cannibalism may amplify the prevalence of the disease. CONCLUSION: Agricultural policy should be directed toward an absolute prohibition on occult cannibalism and away from surveillance, quarantine and slaughter, the principal measures of infectious disease containment used to control bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy...</b>|$|R

BSE was first reported in the 1980 s, when it caused an explosive epidemic among cattle in the U. K. This disease eventually spread to many other countries. FSE was first reported in 1990, and was apparently transmitted to individual cats in BSE-contaminated food. As the BSE epidemic has declined, and controls have been placed on feeding high-risk bovine tissues to animals, FSE has become increasingly rare.

40|$|Prion {{diseases}} {{are known as}} Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE). These are degenerative brain disorders characterized by tiny microscopic holes that give the brain 'spongy' appearance. The causative agent is proteinaceous infective particle called prion. Prion diseases affect a variety of mammals including humans. The disease is transmitted by contaminated food or feed containing prion protein. In animals the diseases caused by prions are Scrapie, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy (TME), Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), <b>Feline</b> <b>Spongiform</b> <b>Encephalopathy</b> (FSE) and exotic Engulate Encephalopathy (EUE). Currently the only reliable test is histo-pathological examination of tissues. Control measures are surveillance, culling sick animals and banning specified risk materials.

40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are transmissible neurodegenerative conditions affecting human {{and a wide}} range of animal species. The pathogenesis of prion diseases is associated with the accumulation of aggregates of misfolded conformers of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC). Animal prion diseases include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease, transmissible mink encephalopathy, <b>feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> exotic ungulate spongiform encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of cervids and spongiform encephalopathy of primates. Although some cases of sporadic atypical scrapie and BSE have also been reported, animal prion diseases have basically occurred via the acquisition of infection from contaminated feed or via the exposure to contaminated environment. Scrapie and chronic wasting disease are naturally sustaining epidemics. The transmission of BSE to human has caused more than 200 cases of variant Cruetzfeldt-Jacob disease and has raised serious public health concerns.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper written by Hilbe et al (BMC vet res, 2009), {{the nature and}} {{specificity}} of the prion protein deposition in the kidney of feline species affected with <b>feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (FSE) were clearly considered doubtful. This article was brought to our attention because we published several years ago an immunodetection of abnormal prion protein in the kidney of a cheetah affected with FSE. At this time we were convinced of its specificity but without having all the possibilities to demonstrate it. As previously published by another group, the presence of abnormal prion protein in some renal glomeruli in domestic cats affected with FSE is indeed generally considered as doubtful mainly because of low intensity detected in this organ and because control kidneys from safe animals present also a weak prion immunolabelling.

40|$|In {{addition}} to {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) of cattle and scrapie of sheep and goats, a few other animal prion diseases have been reported. These include <b>feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> of zoological and domestic cats (FSE) and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of zoological ruminants and non-human primates, as well as chronic wasting disease of deer and elk (CWD) and transmissible mink encephalopathy of farmed mink (TME). The origins of TSE in cats, zoo bovids, and non-human primates are clearly linked to the BSE epidemic; however, the origins of CWD and TME are less clear, but are not epidemiologically linked to the BSE epidemic. Here we review the epidemiology, transmission, clinical features and pathology of these other animal prion diseases. Spongiform encephalopathy in zoo ruminants, cats, and non-human primates BSE transmits to non-domestic bovids, felids, and non-human primates Parallel to the BSE epidemic in cattle beginning in the 1980 s, 15 additional species have contracted a spongiform encephalopathy...|$|E

40|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, {{caused by a}} prion, that mainly affects cattle. Other ruminant species, cats and humans are occasionally affected; this disease is called <b>feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (FSE) in cats, and variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. BSE {{is a relatively new}} disease that was first reported in the United Kingdom in the 1980 s. It is spread by ingestion; animals or humans become infected when they eat prion-containing tissues from an infected animal. Cooking and standard disinfection procedures do not destroy this agent. Infected animals or people do not become ill for years; however, the disease is always progressive and fatal once the symptoms develop. The origins of BSE are unknown; however, the recycling of ruminant proteins in ruminant feed amplified this prion and caused an explosive epidemic in the U. K in the 1980 s and 1990 s. This epidemic peaked in 1992, with almost 1, 000 new cases diagnosed each week, but has subsided as the result of control measures. BSE also spread to many European countries, North America, parts of Asia and possibly other areas of the world. The prevalence of disease varies widely between nations. As o...|$|E
40|$|<b>Feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (FSE) is {{considered}} to be related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and has been reported in domestic cats as well as in captive wild cats including cheetahs, first in the United Kingdom (UK) and then in other European countries. In France, several cases were described in cheetahs either imported from UK or born in France. Here we report details of two other FSE cases in captive cheetah including a 2 (nd) case of FSE in a cheetah born in France, most likely due to maternal transmission. Complete prion protein immunohistochemical study on both brains and peripheral organs showed the close likeness between the two cases. In addition, transmission studies to the TgOvPrP 4 mouse line were also performed, for comparison with the transmission of cattle BSE. The TgOvPrP 4 mouse brains infected with cattle BSE and cheetah FSE revealed similar vacuolar lesion profiles, PrP(d) brain mapping with occurrence of typical florid plaques. Collectively, these data indicate that they harbor the same strain of agent as the cattle BSE agent. This new observation may have some impact on our knowledge of vertical transmission of BSE agent-linked TSEs such as in housecat FSE, or vCJD...|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{prion protein}} (PrPC) is {{expressed}} ubiquitously on the normal cell surfaces of nerve cells, lymphocytes, and follicular dendritic cells. Transmissible spongiform enceph-alopathy (TSE), or prion disease, {{is a neurodegenerative}} disorder characterized {{by the presence of}} an abnormal, pro-tease-resistant isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) (Prusiner 1991). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot-ting, and immunohistochemical analysis have been per-formed for the diagnosis of prion diseases such as scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer, <b>feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (FSE) in cheetah, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. At present, formalin-fixed specimens are conventionally used for histo-pathological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of TSEs (Bodemer 1999). A highly sensitive Western blotting technique using phosphotungstic acid precipitation has been used to detect PrPSc accumulation in the peripheral nerves and the adrenal glands of experimentally BSE-infected cattle with clinical signs of the disease (Masujin et al. 2007). Moreover, trans-genic mice overexpressing bovine PrPC (Tgbov XV) have been used to detect infectivity in the brains; spinal cords; retinas; optic, facial, and sciatic nerves; and ilea of naturally infected cows in the terminal stage of BSE (Buschmann et al. 2006).

40|$|<b>Feline</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (FSE) is a {{transmissible}} {{spongiform encephalopathy}} associated with the consumption of feedstuffs contaminated with tissue from bovine spongiform encephalopathy-affected cattle and characterized by the accumulation in {{the central nervous system}} of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP sc). Clinically, it presents as a progressive fatal neurologic syndrome that is not easily distinguished from other feline neurologic conditions. Most cases of FSE have been reported in England, where it was first detected in 1990, but a few cases have been reported from other European countries. To identify possible cases of FSE in Italy, the Italian Ministry of Health funded a 2 -year surveillance project during which the brains from 110 domestic cats with neurologic signs were evaluated histologically for spongiform encephalopathy and immunohistochemically to detect PrP sc. Although no cases of FSE were found, the study proved useful in monitoring the Italian cat population for other neurologic diseases: neoplasia (21. 8 %), toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (18. 2 %), granulomatous encephalitis (15. 5 %), suppurative encephalitis (4. 6 %), trauma (3. 6 %), circulatory disorders (3. 6 %), degeneration (2. 7 %), nonsuppurative encephalitis (2. 7 %), and neuromuscular diseases (1. 8 %).
