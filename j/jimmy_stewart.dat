5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Stewart</b> of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
