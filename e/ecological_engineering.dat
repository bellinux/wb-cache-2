40|$|The current paper {{presents}} a new measure of trait resilience derived from three common mechanisms identified in <b>ecological</b> theory: <b>Engineering,</b> <b>Ecological</b> and Adaptive (EEA) resilience. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of five existing resilience scales {{suggest that the}} three trait resilience facets emerge, and {{can be reduced to}} a 12 -item scale. The conceptualization and value of EEA resilience within the wider trait and well-being psychology is illustrated in terms of differing relationships with adaptive expressions of the traits of the five-factor personality model and the contribution to well-being after controlling for personality and coping, or over time. The current findings suggest that EEA resilience is a useful and parsimonious model and measure of trait resilience that can readily be placed within wider trait psychology and that is found to contribute to individual well-bein...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>Engineering</b> is an {{emerging}} {{field of study}} between ecology and engineering concerned with the designing, monitoring and constructing of ecosystems. The term <b>ecological</b> <b>engineering</b> was first coined by Howard T.

30|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{quantitative}} study of different disciplines such as system sciences, physics, <b>ecological</b> sciences, <b>engineering,</b> economics and biological sciences, {{have been driven}} by new modeling known as stochastic dynamical systems. This paper aims at studying these important dynamical systems {{in the framework of}} G-Brownian motion and G-expectation. It is demonstrated that, under the contractive condition, the weakened linear growth condition and the non-Lipschitz condition, a neutral stochastic functional differential equation in the G-frame has at most one solution. Hölder’s inequality, Gronwall’s inequality, the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy (in short BDG) inequalities, Bihari’s inequality and the Picard approximation scheme are used to establish the uniqueness-and-existence theorem. In addition, the stability in mean square is developed for the above mentioned stochastic dynamical systems in the G-frame.|$|R

Previous research and literature on sustainable construction are plentiful, and diversifying to a very broad - and sometimes conflicting - range of aspects: from social, economic, and <b>ecological,</b> to <b>engineering.</b> Sustainable construction, however, is by no means standard practice. This paper attempts to investigate several issues related to the practical implementation of sustainable practices in construction, including the nature of &# 039;sustainable construction&# 039; itself, the limitations to application, and the need for a promoted set of sustainable construction practices at an operational level.

40|$|Interest in {{the study}} of {{microbial}} biofilms has increased greatly in recent years {{due in large part to}} the profound impact biofilms have in clinical, industrial, and natural settings. Traditionally, the study of biofilms has been approached from an <b>ecological</b> or <b>engineering</b> perspective, using a combination of classical microbiology and advanced microscopy. We and others have begun to use genetic approaches to understand the development of these complex communities. To begin we must answer the question: What is a biofilm? This definition, by necessity, may be quite broad because it is clear that many organisms can attach to a variety of surfaces under diverse environmental conditions. Therefore, in the context of this article we will operationally define a biofilm as bacteria that are attached to a surface in sufficient numbers to be detected macroscopically...|$|R

40|$|Moisture {{content is}} a {{fundamental}} physical index that quantifies soil property and is {{closely associated with the}} hydrological, <b>ecological</b> and <b>engineering</b> behaviors of soil. To measure in-situ soil moisture contents, a distributed measurement system for in-situ soil moisture content (SM-DTS) is introduced. The system is based on carbon-fiber heated cable (CFHC) technology that has been developed to enhance the measuring accuracy of in-situ soil moisture content. Using CFHC technique, a temperature characteristic value (Tt) can be defined from temperature–time curves. A relationship among Tt, soil thermal impedance coefficient and soil moisture content is then established in laboratory. The feasibility of the SM-DTS technology to provide distributed measurements of in-situ soil moisture content is verified through field tests. The research reported herein indicates that the proposed SM-DTS is capable of measuring in-situ soil moisture content over long distances and large areas...|$|R
