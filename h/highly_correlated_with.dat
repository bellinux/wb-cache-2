5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> {{the presence of}} sheep.

Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E

30|$|By their {{construction}} in psychology, the Big-Five personality traits {{are supposed to}} be uncorrelated [3]. However, as Vinciarelli notes in [4], this is not often the case as raters’ cognitive and cultural biases tend to create correlations among traits while annotating. In addition, personality traits that can be observed in group settings such as emergent leadership and dominance <b>highly</b> <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> the Big-Five personality traits, in particular with extraversion. To handle such correlation when building predictive models, we explore the usage of a multi-task learning (MTL) framework to search for a combination of tasks and features that <b>highly</b> <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> the leadership and extraversion traits of humans.|$|R

25|$|Lomborg's main {{argument}} is {{that the vast majority}} of environmental problems—such as pollution, water shortages, deforestation, and species loss, as well as population growth, hunger, and AIDS—are area-specific and <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> poverty. Therefore, challenges to human prosperity are essentially logistical matters, and can be solved largely through economic and social development. Concerning problems that are more pressing at the global level, such as the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming, Lomborg argues that these issues are often overstated and that recommended policies are often inappropriate if assessed against alternatives.|$|E

Hans Eysenck responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain. Eysenck also argued IQ tests were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.|$|E
25|$|Food {{shipments}} {{in case of}} dire local shortage {{are generally}} uncontroversial; but as Amartya Sen has shown, most famines involve a local lack of income rather than of food.

Historically, food aid is more <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> excess supply in Western countries than with the needs of developing countries. Foreign aid has been an integral part of African economic development since the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{uses the}} U. S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics {{household}} level data {{to examine the}} factors that may affect stock market participation and portfolio composition. Three types of background risks sourced from labor income, business income and home equity, {{as well as some}} households' demographic characteristics are examined. It finds that all these background risks are statistically significant in determining households' stock market participation and portfolio composition. In addition, the effects of the correlation between these background risks and stock return, risk free rate, and the correlation between any two of the three background risks are also examined. It finds that, when the background risk is <b>highly</b> positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the stock return, or <b>highly</b> negatively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the risk free rate, it discourages households' stock market participation and stock holdings; whereas when it is <b>highly</b> negatively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> stock return, or <b>highly</b> positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the risk free rate, it encourages stock market participation and stock holdings. However, the effects of these correlations vary in terms of statistical significance. In addition, households' stock market participation and stock holding is also affected by various households' demographic characteristics, such as age, education, wealth, labor income, business income, house ratio and mortgage ratio...|$|R

25|$|SAD shows a {{high degree}} of co-occurrence with other {{psychiatric}} disorders. In fact, a population-based study found that 66% of those with SAD had one or more additional mental health disorders. SAD often occurs alongside low self-esteem and most commonly clinical depression, perhaps {{due to a lack of}} personal relationships and long periods of isolation related to social avoidance. Clinical depression is 1.49 to 3.5 times more likely to occur in those with SAD. Anxiety disorders are also very common in patients with SAD, in particular generalized anxiety disorder. Avoidant personality disorder is also <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> SAD, with comorbidity rates ranging from 25% to 89%.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{explanation}} of the high correlation between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of extraversion {{is a tendency to}} behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and excitement, that person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{provided}} a statistic showing that nearly a billion monarchs have {{vanished from the}} overwintering sites since 1990. At that time, {{one of the main}} reasons cited was the herbicides used by farmers and homeowners on milkweed, a plant used as a food source, a home and a nursery by the monarchs. A 2016 study also attributed the last decade's ten-fold decline in overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch population to the loss of breeding habitat, namely the many species of milkweed (Asclepias species) that developing larvae require for food, however scientists believe there are other factors as well. A number of researchers believe milkweed loss during the breeding season is the cause because declines in milkweed abundance are <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the adoption of herbicide-tolerant genetically modified corn and soybeans, which now constitute 89% and 94% of these crops, respectively, in the U.S. However, correlative evidence does not prove causation, and other possible causes of the overwintering declines have been proposed.|$|E

25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases.

25|$|A new {{scientific}} understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general {{ability to perform}} {{a wide range of}} tasks. Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence. Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein as g serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, collective intelligence research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups c factor' (also called 'collective intelligence factor' (CI)) displaying between-group differences on task performance. The collective intelligence score then is used to predict how this same group will perform on any other similar task in the future. Yet tasks, hereby, refer to mental or intellectual tasks performed by small groups even though the concept is hoped to be transferrable to other performances and any groups or crowds reaching from families to companies and even whole cities. Since individuals' g factor scores are <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> full-scale IQ scores, which are in turn regarded as good estimates of g, this measurement of collective intelligence can also be seen as an intelligence indicator or quotient respectively for a group (Group-IQ) parallel to an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se.|$|E
