40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> capacity in sand is {{hampered by the}} extreme changes in stress which occur {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pile during installation (Randolph 2003). High quality instrumented tests on steel model piles, such as those reported by Lehane (1992) and Chow (1997), have helped identify other factors that have a bearing on preformed <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> behaviour in sand. These factors include the extent of soil displacement during installation and loading, the reduction in shaft friction due to increasing load cycles during installation (referred to as friction fatigue), increases in radial stresses due to dilation at the pile-soil interface, differences in shaft resistance with loading direction (i. e. compressive and tensile loading) and increases in shaft capacity with time, i. e. pile ageing. The majority of these phenomena have now been incorporated in four new cone penetration test (CPT) -based design methods which give superior estimates of preformed <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> capacity in sand in comparison to traditional methods. The knowledge gained from the high-quality studies of <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> behaviour is now being applied to other pile types such as partial displacement piles (e. g. open-ended piles) and replacement piles (e. g. bored and screw piles). One category of pile which has received sparse attention is the driven cast-in-situ (DCIS) pile which is typically classified as a large <b>displacement</b> <b>pile,</b> despite sharing certain aspects of its construction with replacement pile types. Furthermore, there are relatively few case histories of load tests on DCIS piles in the literature to verify the assumption that they behave as full displacement piles. The behaviour of DCIS piles during installation, curing and maintained load testing was therefore investigated by constructing a total of seven instrumented DCIS piles in layered soils and sand at sites in the United Kingdom. The resistance of the steel installation tube during driving was derived using instrumentation fitted to the DCIS piling rigs. The variation in temperature and strain after casting was monitored continuously in three of the test piles to examine the development of residual loads during curing. After developing sufficient concrete strength, the test piles were subjected to maintained compression load tests to failure (i. e. a displacement in excess of 10 % of the pile diameter), with the shaft and base resistance during loading derived from strain measured within the test piles using vibrating wire strain gauges. The installation resistance derived by the rig instrumentation shows good agreement with the base resistance profile derived by the University of Western Australia UWA- 05 method using the Dutch averaging technique. Residual loads developed during curing of the DCIS piles installed in layered soils due to consolidation settlement of soft soil layers as pore pressures induced by the driving process dissipated. On the other hand, residual loads for DCIS piles in uniform sand were negligible. The instrumented DCIS piles in sand exhibited a clear reduction in normalised local shear stresses and radial effective stresses at failure with distance from the pile base, i. e. friction fatigue, which is a well-known characteristic of preformed displacement piles and its existence for DCIS piles implies that radial stresses during driven installation of the steel tube are not erased upon concreting and tube withdrawal. The normalised base resistance at failure showed excellent agreement with the UWA- 05 design method for driven closed-ended displacement piles, with the onset of degradation in base stiffness occurring at large base displacements. Design correlations have subsequently been developed {{based on the results of}} the instrumented DCIS pile tests. The main implication of the experimental data for DCIS pile design in sand is that the shaft, base and total capacities of a DCIS pile are similar to a preformed closed-ended <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> of equivalent dimensions. In keeping with this finding, an examination of the predictive performance of seven CPT-based <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> design methods using a database of 26 DCIS pile load tests with adjacent CPT qc profiles demonstrated that the recent methods provide improved estimates of DCIS shaft, base and total capacity in comparison to traditional simplified methods. However, a statistical study of DCIS pile load-displacement behaviour in sand using a database of 105 pile load tests showed that the total resistance of a DCIS pile tends to mobilise at a slower rate in comparison to preformed driven displacement piles, implying that DCIS piles may exhibit greater levels of displacement for a given applied load...|$|E

40|$|Piles can be {{classified}} into three categories depending {{on the amount of}} soil displaced during installation: (i) Large volume displacement piles: (ii) Small volume <b>displacement</b> <b>piles</b> and: (iii) Replacement piles. Installation of piles can disturb the soil surrounding the pile and {{have an effect on the}} surrounding area by two different ways: (i) Due to variation of the material properties of the soil surrounding the pile and: (ii) Due to changes in the pore water pressure in the soil surrounding the pile. Magnitude of these variations is highest in large volume <b>displacement</b> <b>piles</b> compared with small volume <b>displacement</b> <b>piles</b> and replacement piles due to the high disturbance in the surrounding area caused by large volume of soil displaced. Moreover. the pore pressure generated during installation process might be dissipated with time depending on the permeability of the surrounding soils and the structure of the soil disturbed due to driving may also be recovered with time. The recovering of the soil structure with time and the equalization of pore pressure with time is termed, "Tixotropic Recover". Time taken for the recovery to complete depends on the amount of disturbance caused by the pile installation process and the properties of the surrounding soil. Due to the strength regaining of the soil surrounding the pile as a result or rixotropic recovery, the ultimate carrying capacity of the pile will vary with time. If the ultimate carrying capacity of the pile is increased due to tixotropic recovery it is termed 'setup' whereas if it's decreased it is termed 'relaxation'...|$|R

40|$|An {{approximate}} analytic {{relationship is}} developed between the maximum radial {{stress on the}} shaft of a <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> in sand and the base resistance of the pile. Using the cavity expansion analogy, together with a confined failure mechanism, the ratio between the two quantities, defined as a factor S t, is established {{as a function of}} the friction angle, shear stiffness, compressibility and mean effective stress of the sand near the pile tip. It is shown that, given otherwise identical input parameters, the value of S t will decrease with increasing friction angle, and with decreasing mean stress level. It also tends to decrease with an increase in relative density. It is predicted that S t has typical values between 0. 03 and 0. 05, in broad agreement with the range of empirically derived values in the literature. The relationship also predicts that S t may take much higher values (~ 0. 1) for piles installed in dense sand or in highly compressible sand. Because of the analytical nature, the established relationship provides useful insights into the mechanisms involved and important implications for design practice. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

In this paper, a critical review is made of the ability of these methods to predict the total capacity of driven cast-in-situ (DCIS) piles. To this end, a DCIS database of 16 piles (with adjacent CPT profiles) is developed which incorporates new DCIS load-test data from UK sites. Initially, instrumented piles from the database are used to illustrate that DCIS and preformed piles have comparable shaft and base resistance characteristics. The database is then used to study {{of the performance of}} three simplified and four advanced CPT-based <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> design methods in estimating the total capacity of DCIS piles. Statistical analyses show that in general, the advanced CPT methods provide the best estimates of DCIS total capacity, although capacities tend to be under predicted by most methods. This tendency may be attributed to enhanced interface friction between the cast-in-situ concrete and the soil compared to that developed with preformed piles.

High pile rebound (HPR) soils may stop the pile driving and results in a limited pile capacity. In some cases, rebound leads to pile damage, delaying the construction project, and the requiring foundations redesign. HPR was evaluated at seven Florida sites, during driving of square precast, prestressed concrete piles driven into saturated, fine silty to clayey sands and sandy clays. Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) deflection versus time data recorded during installation, was used to develop correlations between cone penetrometer (CPT) pore-water pressures, pile displacements and rebound. At five sites where piles experienced excessive HPR with minimal set, the pore pressure yielded very high positive values of greater than 20 tsf. However, at {{the site where the}} pile rebounded, followed by an acceptable permanent-set, the measured pore pressure ranged between 5 and 20 tsf.

40|$|A {{time-dependent}} capacity increase {{has often}} been observed for driven <b>displacement</b> <b>piles</b> in sand. Long-term bearing capacity increase after dissipation of excess pore water pressure {{is referred to as}} set-up. Significant increases in axial capacity have been reported where the rate of set-up varied between 15 and 75 % per log cycle of time. More economic foundation designs are feasible when set-up is incorporated in pile design methods. The objective of this thesis is to expand knowledge on time-dependent capacity of driven <b>displacement</b> <b>piles</b> and make way for a pile design method that incorporates time dependency of pile bearing capacity. The time dependency of virgin pile capacity has been assessed in a database study and a scaled test program. 4 scaled closed-ended steel piles were driven in a man-made sand deposit. The virgin capacity of a pile was assessed 2, 16, 31 and 70 days after installation. The 3 m long, 0. 15 m diameter piles were statically tested in compression. Strain was measured at multiple locations along the shaft during the load tests. The applied load and <b>pile</b> <b>displacement</b> were measured at the pile head. The contribution of the pile shaft and pile tip was determined from the strain distribution over the pile length at failure. A trend for capacity increase with time has been found in the database study and the test program. A capacity increase of 13 % per log cycle of time was found for the closed-ended piles tested. Both an increase in shaft and tip resistance was found with respect to the reference capacity determined 2 days after installation. The shaft capacity increased on average 18. 5 % per log cycle of time and an average increase of 9 % per log cycle of time has been found for the pile tip capacity. The measured capacity was compared with the calculated capacity determined by the Dutch design code. Considering the measured capacity normalized by the calculated capacity the influence of time is even stronger on the tip resistance than on the shaft resistance for the piles tested. As discussed in the report, there are some uncertainties with the interpretation of the strain distributions over the pile shafts. The accuracy of the CPT-based design method available in the Dutch design code, method Koppejan, has been assessed from the pile test results in the database. The results were compared with other design methods available. The accuracy of all methods was low. The calculated capacity exceeded the measured capacity up to a factor 3. Time-dependent capacity increase is a potential mechanism to incorporate in designs of axially loaded driven <b>displacement</b> <b>piles.</b> A trend for time-dependent increase of virgin capacity was found for all the test results considered in literature {{as well as for the}} test program conducted.

However, there are relatively few case histories of load tests on DCIS piles in the literature to verify the assumption that they behave as large displacement piles. In particular, the shaft resistance of DCIS piles in sand is uncertain due to the complex interaction between the freshly cast concrete and surrounding displaced soil after extraction of the steel installation tube. This paper describes the installation, curing, and maintained compression load testing of three temporary-cased DCIS test piles at a uniform sand site near Coventry, United Kingdom. The piles were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges to enable accurate measurement of the local shear stress generated on the pile shaft during maintained compression loading. The tests showed that the peak average and local shear stresses tended to mobilize at greater shaft displacements than traditional preformed displacement piles during loading. A clear reduction in normalized local shear stresses (and hence radial effective stress) at failure with distance from the pile base, i. e., friction fatigue, was evident for all piles, implying that radial stresses generated during driven installation of the steel tube are not erased upon concreting and tube withdrawal. Furthermore, the inferred normalized radial effective stresses at failure were remarkably similar to those reported for traditional preformed displacement piles in the literature.

To achieve this objective, two phases of research were conducted. The first phase was a field study that investigated the in-service pile behavior of four integral abutment bridges. The second phase was an experimental study that was used to evaluate the capability of piles typically used in integral abutment bridges. Nine low-cycle, large amplitude lateral <b>displacement</b> <b>pile</b> tests were conducted. Throughout both phases, analytical investigations were also conducted. To develop simplified modeling techniques that sufficiently account for soil-pile interaction, the piles supporting abutments were analytically modeled and calibrated based on the field and experimental results. A parametric study was also performed with variables including pile type, pile orientation, axial load, pile length, and soil type. The results of these phases were evaluated and design recommendations were developed based on these results. Overall, the design recommendations provide for an extension in the length limits often used for integral bridges. The extension of these limits can result in a reduction in bridge construction and maintenance costs for a large number of structures that cannot currently be built using this structural system. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} {{study is}} performed {{to evaluate the}} displacement behavior of monopile of offshore wind turbine founded in sandy soil. The system consists of pile, turbine tower and soil modeled as 3 D finite element model in ANSYS. An explicit dynamic analysis is performed in a time domain considering soil as an explicit material and wind and wave loads act on the turbine tower as static loads. Behavior of monopile in soil {{is analyzed by considering}} soil pile interaction. The study shows that <b>pile</b> <b>displacement</b> and <b>pile</b> tilt angle depends on soil properties and pile embedded length and pile diameter...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of extensive centrifuge tests modeling rigid circular piled rafts laying on a bed of loose very fine silica sand. The tests were aimed at investigating the behavior of rafts on settlement reducing piles. The testing program included: an unpiled raft, rafts on 1, 3, 7 and 13 piles. In each test, some model piles were instrumented with load cells to determine the distribution of load along the shaft. Beneath the rafts, two types of model piles, close-ended and free headed were installed: quasi displacement (QD) and quasi-non <b>displacement</b> (QND) <b>piles.</b> The obtained results permitted figuring out the role of piles in terms of their effectiveness as settlement reducers and to quantify the load sharing mechanism between piles and the raft-soil contact. The tests were aimed at investigating the load transfer mechanisms adopted in the design approach, and in particular at validating a numerical code which can be used in engineering practice. The paper describes the details of experiments undertaken, the adopted procedures and some of the results; where not specified, all the experimental data given in this paper referred to model scale. The adopted numerical code is briefly described and its validation, via test results on quasi-non <b>displacement</b> <b>piles,</b> is also reported...|$|R
40|$|The capacity, {{hence the}} load-settlement {{behaviour}} of a pile {{is governed by}} the collective behaviour of the base and shaft. It is highly desirable, sustainable and economical to accommodate the increasing demand for deeper and wider foundations {{through the use of}} higher capacity piles. This research investigated the performance of preformed <b>displacement</b> ribbed <b>piles</b> in a unit gravity model test. Four tests were carried out to replicate the constant rate of penetration (CRP) test in the field. Two lengths corresponding to short and long piles for each of plain and ribbed piles were employed. Compacted Kaolin S 300 type was employed as the model soil. The failure load of the piles was determined using six different methods. An increased capacity of 32 % and 20 % was obtained in the short and long ribbed piles, respectively. Also, it was observed that the closer the distance between the ribs, the higher the capacity produced for equal number of ribs. The ribbed piles gave higher capacities through the increase in their shaft capacity which is associated with the presence of ribs along their lengths. An increase in the axial capacity of <b>displacement</b> <b>piles</b> can be attained by modifying the profile of the pile shaft through the use of ribs...|$|R
