40|$|Abridged] We detect three (plus {{one less}} certain) z-dropout sources in two {{separate}} fields of our UDF 05 HST NICMOS images. These z~ 7 Lyman-Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates allow us to constrain the Luminosity Function (LF) of the star forming galaxy population at those epochs. By assuming a change in only M* and adopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values at z~ 6, the best fit <b>evolution</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is found to be}} 0. 43 +- 0. 19 mag per unit redshift (0. 36 +- 0. 18, if including all four candidates), which provides a value of M*(z= 7. 2) =- 19. 7 +- 0. 3. This implies a steady evolution for the LBG LF out to z~ 7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~ 3 to 6 period. This puts a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~ 6 galaxies, whose ensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~ 170 Myr before the epoch at which they are observed. In particular, a large fraction of stars in the z~ 6 LBG population must form at redshifts well above z~ 7. Extrapolating this steady evolution of the LF out to higher redshifts, we estimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~ 6, provided that the faint-end slope of the z> 7 LF steepens to alpha~- 1. 9, and that faint galaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute a substantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. This scenario gives however an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~ 2 sigma below the WMAP- 5 measurement. Therefore, altogether, our results indicate that, should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either the currently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z> 7, or the LF evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and a corresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>evolution</b> of dry lubricant coatings {{subjected to}} unidirectional sliding. Dry lubricant coatings {{have been investigated}} for maintaining low friction under sliding conditions, and {{have been used for}} this purpose in mechanical components. Experimental characterisation of coating durability can be achieved by measuring the friction coefficient {{as a function of the}} number of turns, or, alternatively, the sliding distance. In this paper, literature on abrasive wear tests of various low friction coatings was reviewed, and friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>evolutions</b> of these coatings were analysed with appropriate mathematical forms. The friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>evolutions</b> can be classified into three distinct types: exponential, linear, and logarithmic. In an exponential <b>evolution</b> type, friction <b>coefficient</b> growth rate with respect to sliding distance is expressed as a power-law function of the friction coefficient itself. It was identified that two parameters determine the friction coefficient evolution: the damage rate constant and the damage exponent. The damage exponent was found to be close to unity, suggesting an exponential relation between damage and sliding distance. In a linear <b>evolution</b> type, friction <b>coefficient</b> growth rate is constant, expressed with the damage rate constant. In a logarithmic <b>evolution</b> type, friction <b>coefficient</b> growth rate is expressed as a power-law function of sliding distance. Two parameters, the damage rate constant and the damage exponent, were also identified. The damage exponent was found to be close to minus unity. This characterisation of friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>evolutions</b> with the damage rate constant and the damage exponent helps to understand friction behaviours of coated systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discussed}} the friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>evolution</b> of a TiN coated contact during sliding wear. A hard TiN coating was prepared on a bearing steel (GCr 15) substrate {{by applying the}} composite method of cathode arc and magnetron sputtering. The microstructure, microhardness, microscratch and tribological behaviour of this coating were studied to obtain the relationship between friction coefficient and other coating properties, meanwhile the full friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>evolution</b> curve with different stages during the wear process of TiN coating was shown. It was found that, coating friction and wear, as two interactive responses from a tribo-system, mutually affected each other and should be studied as a single physical phenomenon. Therefore, a novel friction-wear interactive friction model was developed to represent the <b>evolution</b> of friction <b>coefficient</b> and to predict coating breakdown.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{interactive}} friction-lubricant thickness {{model was}} developed to predict the <b>evolution</b> of <b>coefficient</b> of friction and the useful life of lubricant film. The developed model was calibrated by experimental results determined from pin-on-disc tests. For these experiments, a grease lubricant was applied on a Tungsten Carbide ball which slides against a disc made from AA 6082 Aluminium alloy. In the pin-on-disc tests, the lubricant film thickness decreased with time during single path sliding leading to a rapid increase in the coefficient of friction. The breakdown of lubricant was divided into three stages, namely, the Stage I low and stable coefficient of friction region, Stage II region in which the coefficient of friction sees a rapid rise, and Stage III in which the coefficient of friction reaches a plateau with a value {{similar to that of}} dry sliding. In order to characterise the <b>evolution</b> of <b>coefficient</b> of friction throughout these stages, a novel interactive friction model was developed combining the effects of sliding distance, sliding speed, contact pressure and initial lubricant amount on the <b>evolution</b> of the <b>coefficient</b> of friction. This interactive friction model can be applied to situations involving lubricant breakdown in a dynamic environment such as the metal forming industry, where the use of traditional constant coefficient of friction values present limits in predictive accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} extra {{dimensions}} on gauge coupling unification is studied. We {{start with a}} comparison between power law running of the gauge couplings in models with extra dimensions and logarithmic running that happens in many realistic cases. We then discuss the effect of extra dimensions on various classes of unification models. We identify products of <b>evolution</b> <b>coefficients</b> that dictate the profile of unification in different models. We use them to study under what conditions unification of couplings can occur in both one and two step unification models. We find that Kaluza-Klein modes can help generate interesting intermediate scale models with gauge coupling unification such as the minimal left-right models with the seesaw mechanism with a M_W_R∼ 10 ^ 13 GeV intermediate scale, useful in understanding neutrino oscillations. We also obtain several examples where the presence of noncanonical normalization of couplings enables us to obtain unification scales around 10 ^ 11 GeV. This fits very well into a class of models proposed recently where the string scale is advocated to be at this value from physical arguments.

This paper proposes a novel method, which dynamically computes the confidence levels of new streams based on the past history of their agreement/disagreement with the al-ready trusted streams.
