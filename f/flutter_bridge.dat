40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{analysis}} framework that offers direct and explicit expressions for estimating the bimodal coupled flutter is presented. Its accuracy and effectiveness are demonstrated through a flutter {{analysis of a}} cable-stayed bridge. This framework is utilized to emphasize significance of {{the role played by}} both structural dynamics and aerodynamics on <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter,</b> which helps in better tailoring of the bridge structural systems and deck sections for superior <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> performance. Based on this framework, guidance on the selection of modes and the role of different aerodynamic force components in multimode coupled flutter are offered. The potential importance of the consideration of inter-modal coupling in predicting <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> dominated by the action of torsional mode is highlighted. Finally, a clear insight to the contribution of drag force to <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> is provided...|$|R

Aerodynamic {{stability}} {{is an issue}} in the wind-resistant design of long-span <b>bridges,</b> <b>flutter</b> is an aerodynamic instability phenomenon that occurs due to interactions between wind and structural motion. The Xihoumen Bridge is the second long suspension bridge in the world, the aeroelastic performance of the Xihoumen Bridge is investigated by wind tunnel testing and an analytical approach. In the case, wind-tunnel testing was performed using an aeroelastic full model of the bridge, and two section models of the <b>bridge.</b> <b>Flutter</b> derivatives of <b>bridge</b> decks are routinely extracted from wind tunnel section model experiments for the assessment of performance against wind loading, the analytical method used here were a two-dimensional flutter analysis and a multi-mode analysis in the frequency domain.

40|$|<b>Bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> {{phenomenon}} {{presents an}} important criterion of instability, {{which should be}} considered in the bridge design phase. This paper presents different <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> methods which can be used to solve the flutter problem. Most commonly used frequency-domain approach is based on the formulation of aero elastic forces with frequency dependent coefficients called flutter derivatives. The critical wind speed, as the main critical condition for the onset of flutter is obtained based on these aero elastic forces. Aero elastic forces can be also expressed in the time-domain, using so-called indicial functions. These functions are usually determined from the corresponding flutter derivatives. In situations when fluid-memory effects tend to become small the quasi-steady theory can be used as an approximation of aero elastic forces. A numerical example related to the typical bridge cross-section follows presented approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|Bridges are an {{important}} component of transportation. Flutter is a self-excited, large amplitude vibration, which may lead to collapse of bridges. It must be understood and avoided. This paper takes the Jianghai Channel Bridge, which is {{a significant part of the}} Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, as an example to investigate the <b>flutter</b> of the <b>bridge</b> deck. Firstly, aerodynamic force models for <b>flutter</b> of <b>bridges</b> were introduced. Then, wind tunnel tests of the bridge deck during the construction and the operation stages, under different wind attack angles and wind velocities, were carried out using a high frequency base balance (HFBB) system and laser displacement sensors. From the tests, the static aerodynamic forces and flutter derivatives of the bridge deck were observed. Correspondingly, the critical flutter wind speeds of the bridge deck were determined based on the derivatives, and they are compared with the directly measured flutter speeds. Results show that the observed derivatives are reasonable and applicable. Furthermore, the critical wind speeds in the operation stage is smaller than those in the construction stage. Besides, the flutter instabilities of the bridge in the construction and the operation stages are good. This study helps guarantee the design and the construction of the Jianghai Channel Bridge, and advances the understanding of flutter of long afterbody bridge decks...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the numerical simulation of wind flow around bridges using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and {{the principles of}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD). Since, the suspension bridges are prone to the aerodynamic instabilities caused by wind this becomes a prime criterion to be checked during the design. If the wind velocity exceeds the critical velocity for <b>flutter</b> that the <b>bridge</b> can withstand, then the bridge fails due to the phenomenon of <b>flutter.</b> Tacoma’s narrows <b>bridge</b> failure in Washington, USA is a classical example of this failure. Larsen and Walther (1997) used the Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) similar to the wind tunnel procedures. In this work, the computations are carried out for both the fixed and the moving bridge conditions. A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model is used and the rigid body grid movement technique is adopted. The critical velocity for flutter is calculated directly using the free oscillation procedure similar to the approaches reported by Selvam et. al (1998 and 2000). The influence of grid on critical velocity is also studied. The computed critical velocity for flutter is in good agreemen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{analytical}} model is developed for modeling aerodynamic flutter derivatives for long-span Open-Truss Girder Suspension Bridges and their interaction. The approach suggested {{here is to}} synthesize the wind derivatives based on proposed functions interpolated from experimental results of previous studies. The model solves the equation of motion and the synthesized aerodynamic forces are solved to find the critical wind velocity of the suspension bridge. The solution procedure and assumptions of the approach are verified using the Golden Gate <b>Bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> analyses, where the experimental aerodynamic coefficients of the bridge are modeled {{as a function of}} the wind velocities in the proposed procedure and compared with the analysis based on the interpolated coefficients. The results agree with the results in the literature. The result of the proposed {{analytical model}} is close to the values extracted from previous researches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{examines}} the well-known issue of evaluating the flutter probability for a long-span bridge, necessary for assessing structural integrity and reliability. The motivation {{stems from the}} need for critically reviewing and investigating a number of existing numerical approaches (e. g., random perturbation analysis, collocation methods, Galerkin approach) for the modeling and the solution of stochastic dynamic problems, by adapting them to the specific problem. The study proposes a generalized formulation for stochastic <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> in terms of random eigenvalue analysis. A 1200 m suspension bridge model {{is used in the}} numerical simulations to compare the various methods and to provide indications on advantages and limitations of each method. Moreover, the link between the proposed formulation and existing studies on the propagation of uncertainty in aeroelastic systems, for example associated with measurement errors in wind tunnel, is examined.

40|$|Problem statement: Flutter {{derivatives}} are {{the essential}} parameters in the estimations of the flutter critical wind velocity and {{the responses of}} long-span cable supported bridges. These derivatives can be experimentally estimated from wind tunnel test results. Generally, wind tunnel test methods {{can be divided into}} free decay test and buffeting test. Compared with the free decay method, the buffeting test is simpler but its outputs appear random-like. This makes the flutter derivatives extraction from its outputs more difficult and then a more advanced system identification is required. Most of previous studies have used deterministic system identification techniques, in which buffeting forces and responses are considered as noises. These previous techniques were applicable only to the free decay method. They also confronted some difficulties in extracting flutter derivatives at high wind speeds and under turbulence flow cases where the buffeting responses dominate. Approach: In this study, the covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification technique (SSI-COV) was presented to extract the <b>flutter</b> derivatives of <b>bridge</b> decks from the buffeting test results. An advantage of this method is that it considers the buffeting forces and responses as inputs rather than as noises. Numerical simulations and wind tunnel tests of a streamlined thin plate model conducted under smooth flow by the free decay and the buffeting tests were used to validate the applicability of the SSI-COV method. Then, wind tunnel tests of a two-edge girder blunt type of Industrial-Ring-Road Bridge deck (IRR) were conducted under smooth and turbulence flow. Results: The identified flutter derivatives of the thin plate model by the SSI-COV technique agree well with those obtained theoretically. The results from the thin plate and the IRR Bridge deck validated the reliability and applicability of the SSI-COV technique to various experimental methods and conditions of wind flow. Conclusion/Recommendations: The SSI-COV was successfully employed to identify <b>flutter</b> derivatives of <b>bridge</b> decks with reliable results. It is a proven technique that can be readily applied to identify flutter derivatives of other bridge decks either by the free decay or the buffeting tests...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{recent developments}} on {{the evaluation of}} multimode coupled bridge response and modeling of equivalent static wind loading on bridges when subjected to strong winds. First, the coupled <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> is studied with an emphasis placed on the participation of structural modes in flutter, not only based on their amplitudes in flutter motion, but more importantly, by delving into their contributions to flutter modal damping. The bimodal coupled flutter is then revisited based on a framework with closed-form formulations that sheds more insights to the underlying physics of coupled flutter. This discussion {{was followed by a}} unified analysis framework of integrating both flutter and buffeting analysis that better points out the roles of both self-excited and buffeting forces on bridge response to wind fluctuations. Finally, the methodology for modeling equivalent static wind loading associated with multimode coupled buffeting is discussed with applications to bridge design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In bridge design practice, {{especially}} {{in case of}} large span bridges, wind loading can be extremely dangerous. Since {{the collapse of the}} Tacoma-Narrows Bridge in 1941, <b>bridge</b> <b>flutter</b> assessment has become a major concern in bridge design. In the early ages, wind tunnel tests were made in order to assess the aerodynamic performance of bridges. These tests required scaled models of the bridges representing the structure by insuring certain similarity laws. The wind tunnel models can be either full-aeroelastic models or section models. The full models are more detailed and precise while the section models can show a two-dimensional slice of the bridge deck only. Such wind tunnel tests are really expensive and time consuming tools in bridge design therefore there is a strong demand to replace them. In this paper a novel approach for <b>bridge</b> deck <b>flutter</b> assessment based on numerical simulation will be presented.

40|$|Abstract. The hybrid {{methods used}} in the {{aeroelastic}} analysis of <b>flutter</b> for long-span <b>bridges</b> are computational, but they use coefficients and functions obtained experimentally in a wind tunnel. The experimental tests are carried out with a deck sectional model {{and there are two}} types: an aerodynamic testing for obtaining the aerodynamic coefficients such as drag, lift and moment, and an aeroelastic testing for obtaining the flutter derivatives by studding the model oscillations under wind action. In this article, some improvements were achieved in the experimental phase {{as well as in the}} computational phase of the method. The influence of variation of the aerodynamic coefficients were studied with Reynold’s number; different sets of springs were used to include a wide range of reduced velocities that the flutter derivatives depend on; the influence of deformation that the static wind load produces at angle of attack along the bridge was studied; finally the variation of the angle of attack was taken into ac-count to determine the critical flutter speed. These improvements were applied to the sec-tional and computational models of the future Messina Strait Bridge. José Á. Jurado, Alberto León, Félix Nieto and Santiago Hernández...|$|R
40|$|Identification of {{dominant}} modes {{is an important}} step in studying linearly vibrating systems, including flow-induced vibrations. In the presence of uncertainty, when some of the system parameters and the external excitation are modeled as random quantities, this step becomes more difficult. This work is aimed at giving a systematic treatment to this end. The ability to capture the time averaged kinetic energy is chosen as the primary criterion for selection of modes. Accordingly, a methodology is proposed based on the overlap of probability density functions (pdf) of the natural and excitation frequencies, proximity of the natural frequencies of the mean or baseline system, modal participation factor, and stochastic variation of mode shapes in terms of the modes of the baseline system - termed here as statistical modal overlapping. The probabilistic descriptors of the natural frequencies and mode shapes are found by solving a random eigenvalue problem. Three distinct vibration scenarios are considered: (i) undamped arid damped free vibrations of a bladed disk assembly, (ii) forced vibration of a building, and (iii) <b>flutter</b> of a <b>bridge</b> model. Through numerical studies, it is observed that the proposed methodology gives an accurate selection of modes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} {{in the process}} to numerically compute the <b>flutter</b> derivatives of <b>bridge</b> deck sections is desirable to advance the application of CFD based aerodynamic design in industrial projects. In this article, a 2 D unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach adopting Menter׳s SST k-ω turbulence model is employed for computing the flutter derivatives and the static aerodynamic characteristics of two well known examples: a rectangular cylinder showing a completely reattached flow and the generic G 1 section representative of streamlined deck sections. The analytical relationships between flutter derivatives {{reported in the literature}} are applied with the purpose of halving the number of required numerical simulations for computing the flutter derivatives. The solver of choice has been the open source code OpenFOAM. It has been found that the proposed methodology offers results which agree well with the experimental data and the accuracy of the estimated flutter derivatives is similar to the results reported in the literature where the complete set of numerical simulations has been performed for both heave and pitch degrees of freedom.
