500|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, Blaine's musical {{performances}} leading the Warblers became so prevalent that he was called out for it on-screen. Criss offered the insight: [...] "Blaine definitely had his moment in the sun. I think it's time to focus back on the characters that fans of the show really know and love. Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine get all these songs? This is ridiculous. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> other people doing stuff.' I think we're focusing a little more back on New Directions and taking {{a little bit of a}} break from the Warblers." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep {{is the one}} who {{suggested}} the editorial meeting scene, which does not advance the plot but shows Miranda at work without Andrea present. It was also her idea that Miranda not wear makeup in the scene where she opens up to Andrea and worries about the effect on her daughters of her divorce becoming public knowledge. Blunt, for her part, contributed the line where she tells Andy [...] "I'm hearing this", while opening and closing her hand, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> this" [...] keeping it closed. In 2015 she told Howard Stern that she had overheard a mother saying that to a child in a supermarket during production.|$|E
500|$|In {{an online}} chat with website Reddit, Madonna {{addressed}} the concerns regarding the mastering {{issues with the}} DVD and Blu-ray in Europe, saying that she was horrified about the glitches and her record label was solving it. She concluded by saying that [...] " [...] spent 6 months editing and doing the sound mix for the DVD the last thing <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> is that the fans aren't getting the fruits of my labor." [...] On September 23, 2013, Interscope Records announced that they were recalling all the Blu-ray discs issued in US, after hearing continuous reports of glitches in the sound from consumers, adding that an [...] "error in manufacturing" [...] compromised the 5.1 audio of the discs. The announcement also added the following: ...|$|E

500|$|While {{performing}} in Vancouver, Canada, {{it was reported}} that Pusha T announced that he would be releasing, for promotional purposes, a mixtape, titled Wrath of Caine by the end of 2012. However, {{it would have to be}} pushed back to 2013. Pusha T described the tape as street-oriented music intended for his longtime fans. [...] "Wrath of Caine is basically just me catering to my core. It's all about just street Hip Hop, street music" [...] he said. [...] "It's just something that I like to do. It's something that I feel like has no boundaries, no parameters. I can do what I really, really want to do… not about more of a creative , I just think it's about more of what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> for myself and what my fans want to hear. They want to hear lyrics, they want to hear street …it's just the whole street life perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|Spector made various {{changes to}} the songs. His most {{dramatic}} embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to [...] "The Long and Winding Road", [...] "Across the Universe" [...] and [...] "I Me Mine" [...] at Abbey Road Studios. The {{only member of the}} Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector's characteristic [...] "Wall of Sound". Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: [...] "He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying 'I want to hear this, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that. I must have this, I must have that.'" [...] The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector's behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him into coming back after Starr had told Spector to calm down.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E
6000|$|... "How so?" [...] I asked; {{though in}} fact I felt it {{quite as much}} as he did, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Frank's own {{unadulterated}} idea about the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Brown; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the news. You didn't suppose I {{could go}} to bed without it," [...] she replied calmly, though she was {{trembling}} with eagerness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{have asked}} you that," [...] she said. [...] "One reason I came was because--because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the worst. You were too {{considerate}} to tell me--all." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 24 August 1972, Clough and Taylor signed David Nish from Leicester City, for a then-record {{transfer}} fee of £225,000, without consulting the Derby board. Afterwards, Jack Kirkland, a director, warned Clough and Taylor {{there would be}} no more expensive buys like Nish. Then, on 3 September 1972, after the team had defeated Liverpool 2–1 at the Baseball Ground, Clough criticised the Derby County fans, stating that [...] "They started chanting only near the end when we were a goal in front. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them when we are losing. They are a disgraceful lot". In the same interview, Clough also verbally attacked the club's board of directors for their policies. The following day, Board chairman Sam Longson apologised to the fans and dissociated himself from Clough's remarks.|$|E
2500|$|As {{shown in}} the first legs of the tour, the first four songs are always the same. The concert begins with footage of Brooks' {{silhouette}} while singing the opening lines to [...] "Man Against Machine". He then appears via elevator through {{the floor of the}} stage, pauses, and [...] The bridge and final chorus are omitted and it transitions to [...] "Rodeo", followed by [...] "Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House", and [...] "The Beaches of Cheyenne". Next, depending on the venue, other songs such as [...] "The River", [...] "Two Pina Coladas", [...] "Papa Loved Mama", and [...] "Ain't Goin' Down ('Til the Sun Comes Up)". [...] "Unanswered Prayers" [...] follows, with the audience singing the entire song with little accompaniment from Brooks. Additional songs, including [...] "That Summer", [...] "The Thunder Rolls", and [...] "We Shall Be Free" [...] may follow. Excluding the opening, Brooks only performs one song from Man Against Machine, his new album (either [...] "People Loving People" [...] or [...] "All American Kid"; occasionally [...] "Mom"). When questioned on his lack of new songs in the setlist, he remarked, [...] "I'm just like you... I see the guys I like and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the old stuff." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1999, Tate {{established}} Burnt Sugar, an improvisational ensemble that {{varies in}} size between 13 and 35 musicians. Tate described the band in 2004 as [...] "a band <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{but could not}} find".|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; they're {{in such a}} muddle--it {{may take}} months. Now what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> you know, is whether you'd like to come along?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Elaine quietly, {{but with}} {{electrical}} effect; [...] "I came to announce it <b>to</b> you but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all about Suzette first. It will be formally {{announced in the}} papers {{in a day or}} two." ...|$|R
