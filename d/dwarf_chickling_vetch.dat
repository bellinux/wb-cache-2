40|$|The {{influence}} of red light radiation and nitragine treatment of five <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> seed cultivars, on basic nutritional component and mineral element contents in their yield, was eva- luated in this paper. Both biostimulation methods interacted {{in a different}} way towards <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> seeds, causing the stimu- lation of different seed yield components. Radiation mainly affected the increase in total protein, crude fibre and mineral element (Na and K) levels. Nitragine treatment influenced the increase of calcium and microelement levels such as Zn and Cu. Single radiation of <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> seeds caused an increase in the total protein level of all varieties of seed yields. Both biostimu- lation methods caused an increase of Fe in seed yield, but Mg con- tent was, in practice, at the same level in the majority of varieties under study...|$|R

40|$|Green manure {{crops are}} {{critical}} to maintaining soil fertility in organic cropping systems. However, {{little research has been}} conducted to address their contribution to weed control. Indianhead black lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus), AC Green Fix <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> (Lathyrus sativus L.), and Trapper field pea (Pisum sativum L.) are legumes developed for use as annual green manure crops in the Northern Great Plains. Currently, no plant population density recommendations exist for these three species when grown as green manure crops under weedy conditions. The objective of this research was to determine the yield-density response of these three species under weedy and weedy-free conditions and to develop plant population density recommendations for use as annual green manure crops. Each species was grown at five plant population densities (10, 24, 64, 160, and 400 plants m- 2) with weedy and weed-free treatments. Wild oat (Avena fatua L.) and wild mustard (Brassica kaber (D. C.) L. C. Wheeler) were planted in weedy treatments to supplement the natural weed community. Biomass samples and soil moisture measurements were taken at early bud and full bloom to simulate when these crops would be terminated. Biomass samples from the early bud stage were analysed for total nitrogen content. Green manure biomass production for all species was lower under weedy conditions. Weed biomass in weedy treatments decreased with increasing green manure plant population density for all species. Trapper field pea was the most competitive crop while Indianhead black lentil was the least competitive. Although total plot biomass differed among species and green manure crop density, changes in soil moisture levels were not greatly affected. No significant difference in total nitrogen concentration was found among green manure species. Differences in total nitrogen accumulation occurred because of differences in biomass production. Marginal cost analysis based on green manure seed costs and their nitrogen contribution to the value of subsequent wheat crop yield were used to determine optimum plant population densities. Under weedy conditions field pea and black lentil should be planted at densities of 49 - 78 and 223 - 300 plants m- 2, respectively. Under weed-free conditions plant population densities for field pea and black lentil could be reduced to 45 - 60 and 184 - 223 plants m- 2, respectively. No profitable plant population density was determined for <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> when assuming a lower nitrogen contribution under both weedy and weed-free conditions. However, when assuming a higher nitrogen contribution, a profitable plant population density for <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> of 24 plants m- 2 was determined under weedy conditions and 32 plants m- 2 under weed-free conditions...|$|R

40|$|A newly {{isolated}} fungus, Aspergillus terreus NCFT 4269. 10, {{was employed}} in both solid state (SSF) and liquid static surface culture (LSSC) {{for the production}} of protease using different agro-residues. Among different substrates appraised, <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> peels (CVP) supported the enhanced production of protease both at LSSC and SSF (499. 99  ±  11  U/ml; 5266. 8  ±  202. 5  U/gds, respectively). In the presence of peptone (1 %, w/v), leucine (5  mM/ 100  ml), Fe 2 + (1  mM) and riboflavin (10  mg/ 100  ml) with a medium pH of 5. 0 incubated at 30  °C for 96  h, 3 -fold higher protease production was achieved in LSSC compared with control. Fermentation kinetics studies revealed that the highest specific growth rate of A. terreus was observed in fermentation medium supplemented with riboflavin (10  mg/ 100  ml), i. e., 256. 45  mg l− 1  h− 1. The growth-associated coefficient of enzyme production (α) by A. terreus was maximal when protease was produced using Fe 2 +.

40|$|Abstract Aspergillus terreus NCFT 4269. 10 was imple-mented in {{solid-state}} (SSF) {{and liquid}} static surface fer-mentation (LSSF) for biosynthesis of pectinase. Amongst various substrates, like, mustard oil cake, neem oil cake, groundnut oil cake, black gram peels, green gram peels, <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> peels/grass pea peels wheat bran, pearl millet residues, finger millet waste, broken rice, banana peels (BP), apple pomace (AP) and orange peels, banana peel (Musa paradisiaca L.; Family: Musaceae) was {{most suitable for}} pectinase biosynthesis (LSSF: 400 ± 21. 45 Uml- 1; SSF: 6500 ± 1116. 21 Ug- 1). Opti-mization of process parameters using one-variable-at-a-time method revealed that an initial medium pH of 5. 0 at 30 C and 96 h of incubation along with mannitol, urea, ammo-nium persulfate and isoleucine have positive influence on pectinase production. Further, K? (1 mM), Riboflavin (10 mg 100 ml- 1) and gibberellic acid (0. 025 %, w/v) supported in enhanced pectinase production. Banana peels and AP {{at a ratio of}} 9 : 1, moisture content of 90 % with 2 % inoculum size were suitable combinations for production of pectinase. Similarly, 96 h of soaking time with 0. 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) is essential for pectinase recovery. Purification to electrophoretic homogeneity revealed 1. 42 fold purification with 8. 08 % yield and a molecular weight of 24. 6 kDa.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a 3 -year field experiment designed to evaluate the content of organic carbon in brown soil (Haplic Cambisol Dystric) developed from a light loamy sand under legumes cultivation. Experimental factors were: species of legume crop (colorful-blooming pea (Pisum sativum), <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> (Lathyrus sativus), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), methods of legumes tillage (legumes in pure culture and in mixture with naked oats) and mineral N fertilization (0, 30, 60, 90 kg N·ha− 1). Cultivation of legumes on sandy soil did not result in an increase of organic carbon content in the soil after harvest as compared to the initial situation, i. e. 7. 39 vs. 7. 76 g·kg− 1 dry matter (DM), on average, respectively. However, there was the beneficial effect of this group of plants on soil abundance in organic matter, the manifestation of which was higher content of organic carbon in soils after legume harvest as compared to soils with oats grown (7. 21 g·kg− 1 DM, on average). Among experimental crops, cultivation of pea exerted the most positive action to organic carbon content (7. 58 g·kg− 1, after harvest, on average), whereas narrow-leaved lupin had the least effect on organic carbon content (7. 23 g·kg− 1, on average).

40|$|Póster presentado en la VI International Conference on Legume Genetics and Genomics (2012), celebrada en Hyderabad (India) del 2 al 7 de octubre de 2012. Nowadays underused in Europe, Lathyrus {{species were}} in the past {{widespread}} in Mediterranean regions. The superior atmospheric nitrogen fixation rate and potential in crop rotation, allied to the ability to tolerate salinity, drought and flooding, make some of these Lathyrus species highly potential for sustainable agriculture. Being member of the legume family Fabaceae, Lathyrus spp. could share genes, physiological processes and defense mechanisms with economically important related crops such as pea and lupines. Likewise, the molecular tools developed on these model species and cross-amplifiable on Lathyrus spp. could be used on them for different genetic studies, such as diversity analysis. Accordingly, the genetic diversity of an Iberian collection of 45 Lathyrus sativus (grass pea) and 45 L. cicera (<b>chickling</b> <b>vetch)</b> accessions was evaluated using 17 cross -species amplifiable molecular markers (ITAP, EST -SSR and gSSR), developed for Pisum sativum, Lupinus albus and Medicago truncatula. Homology of amplified fragments was confirmed by sequencing. In L. sativus, 2 loci did not amplify, 7 were monomorphic and 8 polymorphic, with an allele average of 3. 75 (range 2 - 8) and a PIC average of 0. 356 (range 0. 024 - 0. 792). For L. cicera, 7 loci were polymo rphic and 10 monomorphic, with an allele average of 2. 14 (range 2 - 3) and a PIC average of 0. 287 (range 0. 099 - 0. 435). Four loci were polymorphic in both Lathyrus species. These results confirm the feasibility of interchange molecular markers for genetic studies, revealing a higher heterozygosity and a potential higher outcrossing rate of L. sativus in relation to L. cicera.

40|$|Annual forage {{cropping}} systems are a vital aspect of livestock forage production. One area where this production {{system can be}} enhanced is the integration of novel annual forages into conventional {{cropping systems}}. Two separate projects were conducted to investigate alternative forage options in annual forage production. In the first discussed research trial, two sets of crops were sown following soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain harvest, at two nitrogen application rates 56 and 112 kg ha- 1. The first set of crops were C 4 summer annuals seeded within two weeks of wheat grain harvest and included, brown mid-rib (BMR) sorghum sudangrass, pearl millet, foxtail millet, and tef. The second set of crops included C 3 cool-season annuals sown in early August; these were oats, oilseed radish, and forage turnip. Crops were harvested and analyzed for yield, nitrogen, ash, and fiber content. Results from over a three-year span showed that crops did not consistently differ in any studied variable between the two nitrogen rates. Yield and forage quality characteristics allowed crops to be broken into groups based on livestock dietary requirements and production goals. The second research trial focused on characterizing the forage quality and nutrient removal capabilities of amaranth as compared to other annual forage crops in {{the presence or absence}} of manure application. Conventional crop options included BMR sorghum-sudangrass, maize. Additionally, another potential crop option of oats and <b>chickling</b> <b>vetch</b> were also sown. Results from the forage quality study show that amaranth has superior forage characteristics to conventional crop options with the highest nitrogen content of all crops, and one of the lowest fiber contents, but does not have a high enough yield to allow it to be a replacement for any conventional crop option. Maize had the greatest biomass yield of all crop treatments. In the nutrient removal study amaranth plant tissue nutrient concentrations were highest in Ca, Mg, and K than all other crop treatments. However, when nutrient removal by harvest was analyzed, individual amaranth harvests did not always remove more of certain nutrients in comparison to maize and other crop options. Results demonstrate that novel annual forage crop options can contribute to conventional systems. The crop utilized by the producer depends on production goals and animal dietary requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|Cover crops perform {{multiple}} {{functions in}} agro-ecosystems, such as nitrogen (N) fixation, nutrient retention and weed suppression. However, {{there is often a}} trade-off between N fixation and weed suppression - legumes fix N but are not very weed suppressive, while non-legumes suppress weeds but do not fix N. Legume-based mixtures, consisting of species with spatially and/or temporally complementary traits, can be a strategy to effectively manage N fixation and weed suppression. The aim of this study was to: (1) evaluate the N fixation and weed suppression characteristics of eight legume and four non-legume, annual summer species {{that can be used in}} the Northeastern U. S. A, (2) evaluate the performance of legume-based mixtures, in terms of biomass production, N fixation and weed suppression, (3) evaluate the competitive ability of the different legume and non-legume species in mixtures by using a replacement series design and (4) evaluate different management strategies to effectively manage mixtures for N fixation and weed suppression. Experiments were conducted over two years, and mixtures were designed using a replacement series. In monoculture, Crimson Clover fixed the most N (111 kgN. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 71 kgN. Ha 1 in 2009) and it was the most weed suppressive legume (12 g. m- 2 in 2008 and 20 g. m- 2 in 2009). Cowpea fixed the lowest amount of N in both years (12 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 13 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2009), but accessed more soil N (50 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 58 kg N. Ha- 1) than any of the legumes and it was the least weed suppressive legume in 2009 (250 g. m- 2 in 2009). Regarding the non-legumes, Sorghum Sudan (938 g. m- 2 and 632 g. m- 2) had the greatest biomass production in monoculture at high and low seeding densities (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 0001), while Buckwheat was the most weed suppressive (15 and 30 g. m- 2) species in monoculture (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 0001). Buckwheat took up similar amounts of soil N than Sorghum Sudan, even though it had lower above ground biomass. In all the mixtures, except Buckwheat, the LER was generally greater than one. The legumes in all the mixtures, except in the Buckwheat mixture, relied slightly more on N fixation than in monoculture. For non-viny legumes, the total N fixed was significantly greater in monocultures than in all the mixtures (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). For the viny legumes, total N fixed in mixtures with C- 4 grass species was not significantly different from the monocultures, but in Buckwheat mixtures significantly less N than monoculture was fixed (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). The weed suppressive capacity of the mixtures depended on the species involved, and there was no consistent improvement in mixture weed suppression compared to the monocultures (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). The competitive ability of the non-legumes can be ranked as follows: Buckwheat to Sorghum Sudan to Japanese Millet to Flax. Within non-viny legumes, the Berseem Clover was more competitive than Crimson Clover, and within the viny species Cowpea was more competitive than Soybean Tyrone and <b>Chickling</b> <b>Vetch.</b> There was a functional trade-off between N fixation and weed suppression: mixtures that are effective at suppressing weeds (Buckwheat mixtures) also suppress legumes and legumes that are competitive (Cowpea) in mixture do not fix a lot of nitrogen. In mixtures containing species with complementary growth times (Clovers and Sorghum Sudan / Buckwheat), mowing the competitive non-legumes increased legume biomass five-fold in Buckwheat mixtures and two-fold in Sorghum Sudan mixtures, while weed suppression was maintained. Nitrogen fixation increased eight- to ten-fold in mowed Buckwheat mixtures and two-to four-fold in mowed Sorghum Sudan mixtures. Mowing competitive species in temporally complementary mixtures can avoid the trade-offs in N fixation and weed suppression...|$|R
