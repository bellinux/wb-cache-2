5|$|Other {{examples}} of systemic conditions associated with aphthous-like ulceration include reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), and recurrent <b>erythema</b> multiforme.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, some {{patients}} may develop PPE, characterized by skin eruptions on {{the palms of}} the hand or soles of the feet, swelling, pain, and <b>erythema.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, <b>erythema</b> multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or <b>erythema</b> nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local <b>erythema,</b> edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (<b>erythema),</b> warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous <b>erythema</b> {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E
5|$|There are {{side effects}} and risks {{associated}} with the smallpox vaccine. In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated {{for the first time}} experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions, including toxic or allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} vaccination (<b>erythema</b> multiforme), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or blackening of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or <b>erythema.</b> Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel {{in the use of}} the equipment, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky <b>erythema,</b> petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
25|$|This {{condition}} is sometimes termed (oral) <b>erythema</b> migrans, {{but this has}} {{no relation to the}} more common use of the term <b>erythema</b> migrans (<b>erythema</b> chronicum migrans), to describe the appearance of skin lesions in Lyme disease.|$|E
25|$|Other, rather rare, skin {{associated}} {{symptoms include}} pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome, drug reactions, <b>erythema</b> nodosum, lobe panniculitis, atrophy of finger skin, palmar <b>erythema,</b> and skin fragility (often worsened by corticosteroid use).|$|E
25|$|Potassium iodide {{has been}} used for {{symptomatic}} treatment of <b>erythema</b> nodosum patients for persistent lesions whose cause remains unknown. It {{has been used}} in cases of <b>erythema</b> nodosum associated with Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|Palmar <b>erythema</b> is a {{reddening}} of palms at the thenar and hypothenar eminences also as {{a result}} of increased estrogen.|$|E
25|$|Anaphylaxis: Sometimes {{cases of}} {{anaphylaxis}} consisting of diffuse <b>erythema,</b> pruritus, conjunctival injection, fever, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension and bronchospastic reactions are observed.|$|E
25|$|Bullous Pemphigoid, Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Drug Eruptions. Epidermolysis Bullosa, Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita, <b>Erythema</b> Multiforme, Lichen Planus, {{pemphigus}} vulgaris, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Less common {{side-effects}} include {{red skin}} (<b>erythema),</b> dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth (xerostomia), water retention, and sexual impotence. Some medications can trigger allergic or pseudoallergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis, <b>erythema</b> multiforme, red man syndrome, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{of early}} scabies {{infestation}} mirror other skin diseases, including dermatitis, syphilis, <b>erythema</b> multiforme, various urticaria-related syndromes, allergic reactions, ringworm-related diseases, and other ectoparasites such as lice and fleas.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{is used as}} a {{first line}} {{treatment}} in multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone, to treat acute episodes of <b>erythema</b> nodosum leprosum and for maintenance therapy.|$|E
25|$|Larvae and nymphs, as well {{as adults}} are capable of causing very {{dramatic}} allergic reactions. Dramatic local redness (<b>erythema)</b> and fluid swelling (oedema) may develop within 2–3 hours of attachment of even one larva.|$|E
25|$|The {{swelling}} is {{firm and}} fibrous, with a smooth, pink surface. The surface may also show ulceration or <b>erythema.</b> The {{size of the}} lesion varies from less than 1cm to involving {{the entire length of}} the sulcus.|$|E
25|$|A {{validated}} comprehensive grading {{scale has}} categorized the clinical findings of skin aging as laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), {{and the various}} facets of photoaging, including <b>erythema</b> (redness), and telangiectasia, dyspigmentation (brown discoloration), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths) and poor texture.|$|E
25|$|Since {{alveolar}} osteitis is {{not primarily}} an infection, {{there is not}} usually any pyrexia (fever) and cervical lymphadenitis (swollen glands in the neck), and only minimal edema (swelling) and <b>erythema</b> (redness) {{is present in the}} soft tissues surrounding the socket.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{of a few}} larvae to a non-sensitised host provokes {{little or}} no response, even though the contact is {{prolonged}} over several days. However, {{towards the end of}} feeding some pruritus, <b>erythema</b> and localised oedema may develop at the site of attachment.|$|E
25|$|Manifestation {{appears to}} be {{slightly}} different according to race and sex. <b>Erythema</b> nodosum is far more common in men than in women and in Caucasians than in other races. In Japanese patients, ophthalmologic and cardiac involvement are more common than in other races.|$|E
25|$|Interferon alpha-2a {{may also}} be an {{effective}} alternative treatment, particularly for the genital and oral ulcers as well as ocular lesions. Azathioprine, when used in combination with interferon alpha-2b also shows promise, and colchicine can be useful for treating some genital ulcers, <b>erythema</b> nodosum, and arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease may}} produce facial palsy. Sometimes the facial palsy {{occurs at the}} same time as the classic <b>erythema</b> migrans rash. Other times, it occurs later. In areas where Lyme disease is common, it may be the cause of facial palsy in half of cases.|$|E
25|$|At a 1909 {{research}} conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius {{presented a}} study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in {{an older woman}} following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion <b>erythema</b> migrans. The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911.|$|E
25|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} (with {{an increased}} risk of hepatocellular carcinoma) Liver disease is always preceded by evidence of liver dysfunction including elevated serum enzymes specific to the liver, clubbing of the fingers, leuconychia, asterixis, hepatomegaly, palmar <b>erythema</b> and spider naevi. Cirrhosis can also present with jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and ascites.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythema</b> marginatum: A {{long-lasting}} reddish rash {{that begins}} {{on the trunk}} or arms as macules, which spread outward and clear in the middle to form rings, which continue to spread and coalesce with other rings, ultimately taking on a snake-like appearance. This rash typically spares the face and is made worse with heat.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{feature of}} the syndrome is its prolonged clinical evolution, with relapsing episodes and autoimmune dysfunction. If diagnosed in its early stages, the symptoms respond well to antibiotics. If the disease evolves to a chronic phase, it can potentially cause oligoarthritis, cognitive impairment, meningoencephalitis and <b>erythema</b> nodosum, with the patient risking to develop both articular and neurological sequelae.|$|E
25|$|Aciclovir topical {{cream is}} {{commonly}} associated (≥1% of patients) with: dry or flaking skin or transient stinging/burning sensations. Infrequent adverse effects include <b>erythema</b> or itch. When {{applied to the}} eye, aciclovir is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with transient mild stinging. Infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), ophthalmic aciclovir is associated with superficial punctate keratitis or allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} due to sarcoidosis {{of other}} organs may be uveitis (inflammation of the uveal layer in the eye), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), arthralgia (joint pains), lupus pernio (a red skin rash, usually of the face), <b>erythema</b> nodosum (red skin lumps, usually on the shins), {{and symptoms of}} liver involvement (jaundice) or heart involvement (heart failure).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are {{mucocutaneous}}: dry lips, skin and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips (cheilitis), redness {{of the skin}} (<b>erythema),</b> rashes, peeling, eczema (dermatitis), itching (prunitis) and nose bleeds (epistaxis). Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all patients.|$|E
25|$|Attachment of the nymphal {{and adult}} stages produce {{variable}} responses, {{many of which}} are clearly allergic in nature. Often, attachment may provoke little or no response and the patient may be quite unaware of the presence of a tick for some days until eventually minor itchiness leads to its discovery. Conversely, there is sometimes a locally heightened sensitivity or hyperaesthesia. Such attachment sites are surrounded by <b>erythema.</b>|$|E
