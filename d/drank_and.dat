5|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} Longstreet family in January 1862. A scarlet fever {{epidemic}} in Richmond, Virginia claimed {{the lives of}} his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne, his four-year-old son James, and eleven-year-old Augustus ("Gus"), all within a week. His 13-year-old son Garland almost succumbed. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely <b>drank,</b> <b>and</b> he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E

He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer <b>drank,</b> <b>and</b> he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E

25|$|Although Poets Follies earned Kees much notoriety, {{his other}} {{projects}} {{did not find}} {{the same kind of}} support. A film company ended in a lawsuit. His collaborations with Helm, Ketty Lester, and other musicians, although professionally satisfying, did not produce any hit records. A permanent home for the Poets Follies, the Showplace, a large building on Fulton Street in the Mission District, was closed in late May 1955, just days before the premiere of a serious one-act play, The Waiting Room, which Kees had written for three actress friends. During much of July, Kees spent time with a woman he had met while working at Langley Porter, a Jungian psychiatrist named Virginia Patterson. Like other relationships Kees had following his divorce, this ended abruptly. Kees, too, had been taking barbiturates for the past two years, which also had intensified his episodes of manic depression. After visiting his parents in Santa Barbara, California, one last time in early July, as well as his friend, the literary critic Hugh Kenner, Kees returned to San Francisco and had dinner with various friends, including Pauline Kael, who appeared as a guest on Kees’s film review program on KPFA-FM, Behind the Movie Camera. She noticed the disturbing changes in Kees’s demeanor. For several days in mid-July, Kees <b>drank</b> <b>and</b> commiserated with his friend and business partner, the San Francisco newspaperman and novelist Michael Grieg. He even confessed to have tried jumping over the rail of the Golden Gate Bridge, but he could not physically manage it. He talked of going to Mexico as an alternative, a country that fascinated him up until then in books such as Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano. Then Kees returned to his home in the Marina District on the evening of July 17, 1955. What he did the following day is a mystery. He took a call from Michael Grieg, who told Kees of a possible job offer. Kees also telephoned a friend, the memoirist Janet Richards, seeking her company.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{discuss the}} {{composition}} and rationale {{for the use of}} sports drinks along with recent studies investigating the relationship between sports <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> dental erosion. Methods: A review of the literature of sports <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> dental erosion was done. Results: For most athletes and individuals engaged in physical activity, the use of sports drinks does not provide a benefit over water. Furthermore, although there is much in vitro evidence that acidic drinks such as wine, fruit juices <b>and</b> carbonated soft <b>drinks</b> have erosive potential and there are relationships between consumption of these <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> erosion, only one study has reported an association between sports <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> dental erosion. Other factors such as drinking habit and salivary production may be more important determinants of dental erosion...|$|R

Method: Twenty milk <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> ten fruit juices {{were evaluated by}} random experiment, with 3 repetitions for each sample.

Results: The TSS content of drinks ranged from 13. 26 to 26. 30 for milk <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> 10. 23 to 13. 53 to ready to drink juice. The maximum and lower values to pH were, respectively, 3. 58 and 7. 01 for milk <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> 3. 07 and 3. 72 to drink juice. Conclusion: The high the concentration of TSSC verified in the milk <b>and</b> juice <b>drinks,</b> associated to a low pH {{can contribute to the}} development of decay lesions in case they be consumed in excess by the children...|$|R

500|$|Brothers and Sisters is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band. Produced by Johnny Sandlin and the band themselves, the album was {{released}} in August 1973 in the United States by Capricorn Records.

500|$|Shortly {{following}} their leader Duane Allman's death in 1971, the Allman Brothers Band released Eat a Peach, a hybrid studio/live album that became their biggest release yet; it peaked at number four on the Billboard charts.

The band also purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette, Georgia for $160,000 and nicknamed it [...] "the Farm"; it soon became a [...] "group hangout" [...] and fulfilled bassist Berry Oakley's communal dreams. Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of Duane: he excessively <b>drank</b> <b>and</b> consumed drugs, and was losing weight quickly.

500|$|Flanagan {{returned}} {{to working with}} Fitzgerald in 1968. In addition to being her pianist, mostly {{as part of a}} trio, he was her musical director. Her popularity meant that a lot of touring was required: 40–45 weeks a year, including at least one tour of Europe a year (29 cities there in 1970, for example). During these concerts, Flanagan often played [...] a set as part of his trio, without the singer. Beginning in 1974, he again began to perform and record as a leader: his 1975 trio release, The Tommy Flanagan Tokyo Recital, was his first as leader since 1960. Prior to these performances, he had felt that his technique was inadequate for a soloist, but he enjoyed the extra exposure of being a leader, so decided to continue. Flanagan ended his role with Fitzgerald in 1978, after he had a heart attack and had become tired of extensive touring.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Clapton and Harrison became close friends, and began writing and {{recording}} music together. This is when Clapton {{fell in love}} with Boyd. His 1970 album with Derek and the Dominos, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, was written to proclaim his love for her, particularly the hit song [...] "Layla". When Boyd rebuffed his advances later that year, Clapton descended into heroin addiction and self-imposed exile for three years. Boyd moved in with Clapton and married him in 1979. Her struggles within the marriage were masked by her public image with Clapton. Boyd <b>drank,</b> <b>and</b> admits to past drug use, but she never became a drug addict like Clapton did. Boyd left Clapton in April 1987, and divorced him in 1989. Her stated reasons were Clapton's years of alcoholism, as well as his numerous affairs, including one with Italian model, Lory Del Santo. In 1989, her divorce was granted on the grounds of [...] "infidelity and unreasonable behaviour". Boyd was also the inspiration for the songs: [...] "Bell Bottom Blues" [...] and [...] "Wonderful Tonight".|$|E
500|$|The 44-date {{tour of the}} United States left Blur in [...] "complete disarray", {{according}} to writer David Cavanagh. Dismayed by American audiences' infatuation with grunge and the lacklustre response to their music, the group frequently <b>drank,</b> <b>and</b> members often broke into fist-fights with one another. Homesick, the tour [...] "instilled in the band a contempt for everything American", Cavanagh later wrote; frontman Damon Albarn, who [...] "started to miss really simple things [...] ", listened to {{a tape of the}} English pop group the Kinks throughout the tour. Upon their return to England, the group discovered that the attention of the music press had shifted to Suede. The newcomers' success displeased Blur who, in Cavanagh's words, [...] "were inclined to feel that every record Suede sold was an affront to human decency". After many poor live shows, which Blur members often performed while drunk—in particular one at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received performance by Suede on the same bill—Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food.|$|E
