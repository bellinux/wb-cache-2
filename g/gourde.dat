25|$|The Lightning had an {{off-season}} in 2016-17, as {{they missed}} the playoffs with only 94 points {{with a host}} of key players being injured. During the season, they traded Ben Bishop, Brian Boyle and Valtteri Filppula. There were positive signs however, as Nikita Kucherov became a superstar after Steven Stamkos's injury. Rookies Brayden Point, Yanni <b>Gourde,</b> and Jake Dotchin all broke into the league and made major impacts. Vasilevskiy also played well in the starter's job after Bishop was sent to Dallas.|$|E
25|$|Still, Kock {{managed to}} sign a {{contract}} on August 8 which granted him a 10 year lease of Île-à-Vache, {{with the right to}} an extension of a further 10 years. The rent was 3.5 <b>Gourde</b> (about $0.35) per hectare. He had to start operations within six months and a number of employee supervisors had to be black. They would be immediately naturalized as Haitians upon arrival. Kock was to provide a percentage of all the wood that he chopped on the island, as a kind of tax. The contract also guaranteed that he would protect the Haitian state, and that he would not have to pay import duties on the supplies that he imported.|$|E
50|$|A legal {{minimum wage}} of 36 <b>gourdes</b> a day (about U.S. $1.80) was set in 1995, and applies to most workers in the formal sector. It was later raised to 70 <b>gourdes</b> per day. Actually this minimum is 200 <b>gourdes</b> a day(about U.S. $4.80). 39.175 gourds= a U.S dollar.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, {{banknotes}} {{were issued}} by the [...] "Banque Nationale d'Haïti" [...] in denominations of 25 centimes, 1 and 5 piastres (equal to <b>gourdes).</b> Following this, banknotes were issued in denominations ranging from 10 centimes to 5 <b>gourdes</b> by the various Haitian governments until 1916, when the [...] "Banque Nationale de la République d'Haïti" [...] began issuing notes. In 1920, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 <b>gourdes</b> notes were issued, with 50 and 100 <b>gourdes</b> added in 1925. In the 1970s, 25, 250, and 500 <b>gourdes</b> notes were introduced. In 1979, the Banque de la République d'Haïti replaced the National Bank as the paper money issuing body. A 1000 <b>gourdes</b> note was introduced in 1999, to commemorate the 250th anniversary {{of the founding of}} Port-au-Prince. A 20 <b>gourdes</b> note was released into circulation in 2001, both as a commemorative (to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution of Toussaint L'Ouverture) and as a regular issue. In 2004, the Banque de la République d'Haïti issued a series of notes to commemorate the bicentennial of Haiti.|$|R

25|$|On September 27, 2015, the Lightning {{announced}} {{a series of}} roster cuts that reduced their training camp roster to 29 players. The Lightning prospects cut from that list are Blujus, DeAngelo, Dotchin, Erne, <b>Gourde,</b> Hart, Ikonen, Peca, Richard, Vermin, Walcott and Wilcox. The following veteran players have to clear waivers to be assigned to the Syracuse Crunch: Mike Blunden, Philippe Paradis, Tye McGinn, Jeff Tambellini, and Matt Taormina. In addition to the roster cuts, the Lightning announced that Ray Emery had been cut from his PTO with the team, and that the team had claimed goaltender Kevin Poulin off waivers from the New York Islanders. Poulin is expected to compete with Kristers Gudlevskis for the temporary backup role behind starter Ben Bishop while Andrei Vasilevskiy recovers from his injury. Poulin, 25, has played in 50 NHL games, going 18-25 with a 3.07 goals against average.|$|E

A cabinet was purchased for the library for 75 <b>gourdes</b> (one Haitian gourde=approx. $20). Later that year about 936 <b>gourdes</b> were spent {{for the purchase of}} 444 volumes ordered by Dr. François Fournier de Pescay. This library may have been destroyed during the 1860s, when political clashes saw the destruction of many items of cultural significance in Haiti.|$|R

Four of those newly elected federal Members of Parliament [...] Maxime Bernier, Steven Blaney, Jacques <b>Gourde</b> and Josée Verner [...] came from districts {{represented}} by ADQ members at the provincial level. All except Bernier were at one point ADQ activists. Blaney was ADQ candidate in Beauce-Nord in 1998.

6000|$|There is {{a charming}} description, {{in his little}} tale of [...] "La Grenadiere," [...] of {{the view of the}} {{opposite}} side of the Loire as you have it from the square at the end of the Rue Royale, - a square that has some preten- sions to grandeur, overlooked as it is by the Hotel de Ville and the Musee, a pair of edifices which directly contemplate the river, and ornamented with marble images of Francois Rabelais and Rene Descartes. The former, erected a few years since, is a very honor- able production; the pedastal of the latter could, as a matter of course, only be inscribed with the Cogito ergo Sum. The two statues mark the two opposite poles to which the brilliant French mind has travelled; and if there were an effigy of Balzac at Tours, it ought to stand midway between them. Not that he, by any means always struck the happy mean between the sensible and the metaphysical; but one may say of him that half of his genius looks in one direction and half in the other. The side that turns toward Francois Rabelais would be, on the whole, the side that takes the sun. But there is no statue of Balzac at Tours; there is only, in one of the chambers of the melancholy museum, a rather clever, coarse bust. The description in [...] "La Grenadiere," [...] of which I just spoke, is too long to quote; neither have I space for any one of the brilliant attempts at landscape paint- ing which are woven into the shimmering texture of [...] "Le Lys dans la Vallee." [...] The little manor of Cloche- <b>gourde,</b> the residence of Madame de Mortsauf, the heroine of that extraordinary work, was within a moderate walk of Tours, and the picture in the novel is presumably a copy from an original which it would be possible to-day to discover. I did not, however, even make the attempt. There are so many chateaux in Touraine commemorated in history, that it would take one too far to look up those which have been com- memorated in fiction. The most I did was to endeavor to identify the former residence of Mademoiselle Gamard, the sinister old maid of [...] "Le Cure de Tours." [...] This terrible woman occupied a small house in the rear of the cathedral, where I spent a whole morning in wondering rather stupidly which house it could be. To reach the cathedral from the little place where we stopped just now to look across at the Grenadiere, without, it must be confessed, very vividly seeing it, you follow the quay to the right, and pass out of sight of the charming coteau which, from beyond the river, faces the town, - a soft agglomeration of gardens, vine- yards, scattered villas, gables and turrets of slate- roofed chateaux, terraces with gray balustrades, moss- grown walls draped in scarlet Virginia-creeper. You turn into the town again beside a great military barrack which is ornamented with a rugged mediaeval tower, a relic of the ancient fortifications, known to the Tourangeaux of to-day as the Tour de Guise. The young Prince of Joinville, son of that Duke of Guise who was murdered by the order of Henry II. at Blois, was, after the death of his father, confined here for more than two years, but made his escape one summer evening in 1591, under the nose of his keepers, with a gallant audacity which has attached the memory of the exploit to his sullen-looking prison. Tours has a garrison of five regiments, and the little red-legged soldiers light up the town. You see them stroll upon the clean, uncommercial quay, where there are no signs of navigation, not even by oar, no barrels nor bales, no loading nor unloading, no masts against the sky nor booming of steam in the air. The most active business that goes on there is that patient and fruitless angling in, which the French, as the votaries of art for art, excel all other people. The little soldiers, weighed down by the contents of their enormous pockets, pass with respect from one of these masters of the rod to the other,as he sits soaking an indefinite bait in the large, indifferent stream. After you turn your back to the quay you have only to go a little way before you reach the cathedral.|$|E
50|$|In 1872, the <b>gourde</b> {{was again}} revalued, {{this time at}} a rate of three hundred to one. In the early years of this third <b>gourde,</b> only {{banknotes}} were being issued and the name piastre was sometimes used instead of <b>gourde,</b> especially on a banknote issue dated 1875. In 1881, the <b>gourde</b> was linked to the French franc at 5 francs = 1 <b>gourde</b> and coin production recommenced.|$|E

Of the approximately 2,190 secondary schools in Haiti, 90.5% of secondary schools are private and 78% of them are located in urban areas. Roughly half of all schools {{are located in the}} West Department. There is a large discrepancy between the West and other regions in Haiti. Tuition costs have increased significantly over the last decade. Average tuition went from 5,000 <b>gourdes</b> ($125) in 2004 to 7,800 <b>gourdes</b> ($195) in 2007, representing an increase of 56% in 3 years.|$|R

50|$|In 1870 the <b>gourde</b> was revalued {{at a rate}} of ten to one. Only {{banknotes}} {{were issued}} for this second <b>gourde,</b> with the government issuing notes of 10 and 25 gourdes.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after Sustr's {{extension}} {{was announced}} by the Lightning, the team announced that it had re-signed forward Yanni <b>Gourde</b> to a two-year, $1 million contract extension. <b>Gourde</b> skated in 20 games, and scored six goals.|$|E

50|$|With flash floods ensuing {{across much}} of {{southern}} Haiti on July 7, the Civil Protection Department released 2 million <b>gourdes</b> (US$48,800) in emergency funds. This was later increased in 5 million <b>gourdes</b> (US$120,500). Médecins Sans Frontières, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the World Food Programme, and other international agencies mobilized for relief efforts on this day. The IFRC provided immediate funds of 250,000 Swiss francs (US$192,000). By July 15, the nation's government requested international assistance to handle the aftermath of Hurricane Dennis. Japan was the first nation to comply, providing emergency supplies—such as blankets, generators, and radios—worth ¥11 million (US$97,900). This coincided with a disaster declaration by U.S. chargé d'affaires Douglas Griffiths, which also prompted release of US$50,000 in funds from the United States Agency for International Development. World Concern provided aid to 18,000 people, distributing emergency kits with food and basic supplies.|$|R
50|$|After the {{deposition}} {{and death of}} her Dessalines in 1806, she denied the offer from Henry Christophe {{to move in with}} his family.

5000|$|Although not compulsory, {{preschool}} is formally {{recognized for}} {{children between the}} ages of 3 and 5. Around 705,000 children below 6 years of age, representing 23% of the age group, have access to preschool education. The majority of preschools are located in elementary schools, and most of these are private and concentrated in the West department. Tuition costs have increased significantly over the last decade for preschools, going from 1628 <b>gourdes</b> (roughly $41) in 2004, to 4675 <b>gourdes</b> (roughly $117) in 2007, a 187% increase in just 3 years. Elementary education is compulsory for children between 6 and 11. It consists of 3 cycles of 3 years each, which altogether is called [...] "fundamental education". The 3rd cycle is completed either in elementary or in secondary school. Enrollment has seen a steady improvement in the last decade. According to IHSI, the Haitian Institute of Statistics and Information Technology, school enrollment has gone from 40.1% in 1990 to 86.7% in 2002, representing 2.1 million children. Although tuition in public schools is legally free for the first two cycles of fundamental education, equivalent to elementary education, 81.5% of these children go to private schools and pay fees, often due to the limited availability of public schools. One hundred forty five districts have no public school and 92% of the 15,268 elementary schools in Haiti are private. Tuition costs have increased significantly over the last decade. Average tuition for 2nd cycle classes in elementary school has almost tripled since 2000, sometimes going up to 92,500 <b>gourdes</b> ($2313).|$|R
