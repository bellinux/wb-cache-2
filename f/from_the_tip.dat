5|$|The Scottish {{architect}} George Wittet {{combined the}} elements of the Roman triumphal arch and the 16th-century architecture of Gujarat. The monument's design is a combination of Hindu and Muslim architectural styles. The arch is of Muslim style while the decorations are of Hindu style. The Gateway of India is built from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. The stone was locally obtained, and the perforated screens were brought from Gwalior. The gateway faces out to Mumbai Harbour <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of Apollo Bunder.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{studies of}} the palustris–couesi contact zone in Texas {{published}} in 1979, using more specimens and characters, indicated that the two species are in fact easily distinguishable there; therefore, O.couesi has since been regarded as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat. Afterward, {{some of the other}} forms synonymized under O.couesi or O.palustris were resurrected as separate species—Oryzomys nelsoni from the Marías Islands, western Mexico, and Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed western Mexican Oryzomys, reaffirmed the distinctness of O.nelsoni, and reinstated O.peninsulae <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the Baja California Peninsula and O.albiventer from interior Mexico as species. Still, O.couesi included 22 synonyms, and Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that further research on O.couesi and related species would certainly result in the recognition of additional species.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there was no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{the theory}} that temnospondyls were the {{ancestors}} of all lissamphibians has gained wide support. The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls {{has been compared to}} those of modern frogs and salamanders, but the presence of bicuspid, pedicellate teeth in small, paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians. Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls, pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods, teeth begin to calcify at their tips. Calcification normally proceeds downward {{to the base of the}} tooth, but calcification <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth. Calcification resumes at the base, leaving an area in the center of the tooth uncalcified. This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils.|$|E

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|While {{historically}} {{thought of}} as simple leathery structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the wing membranes of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called actinofibrils. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as is the exact material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), {{they may have been}} stiffening or strengthening agents in the outer part of the wing. The wing membranes also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> and then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from {{the opposite side of}} the mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|Most mammals have agouti hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E

5|$|The newly hatched American white ibis {{is covered}} with violet down feathers, {{deepening}} to dark brown or black {{on the head and}} wings. The chest is often bare and there can be a white tuft on the head. The irises are brown. The exposed skin is pinkish initially, apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the bill which is dark gray, but turns gray within a few days of hatching. The bill is short and straight at birth and has an egg tooth which falls off between days five and nine, and develops three black rings from around day six, before turning gray by around six weeks of age. The gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six, and face and bill become pink a few weeks later, while the legs remain gray. The irises have turned slate-gray by this stage. Once fledged, the juvenile American white ibis has largely brown plumage and only the rump, underwing and underparts are white. The legs become light orange. As it matures, white feathers begin appearing on the back and it undergoes a gradual molt to obtain the white adult plumage. This is mostly complete {{by the end of the}} second year, although some brown feathers persist on the head and neck until the end of the third year. Juvenile birds take around two years to reach adult size and weight.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E
5|$|The best-preserved mf1 is MLP 88-III-28-1. The crown is unworn and {{complete}} {{and there are}} no roots, suggesting that the tooth had not yet erupted when its owner died. Krause, who first described the tooth in 1993, identified it as a right molar, but the subsequent discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica made it clear that Ferugliotherium molariforms had been reversed, and MLP 88-III-28-1 is actually from {{the left side of the}} jaw. The tooth is 2.2mm long and 1.5mm wide. The crown is roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. The lingual row consists of four cusps, which are smaller and lower than the three labial ones. The cusps in this row become smaller and lower from the front to the back. Two ridges descend <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of each cusp to the lingual and labial sides. The labial ridges on the first and fourth cusp only reach the base of the cusp, but those on the second and third cusps join ridges descending from the first and second labial cusp. In the first three cusps, the lingual ridge extends to near the lingual margin of the tooth and then turns backward; the end of the ridge is lingual to the next cusp. In the fourth cusp, the ridge hardly extends posteriorly, but rather labially, forming the posterior margin of the tooth and joining a ridge descending from the last labial cusp. The labial cusp row includes three, larger cusps, each of which bears two ridges that descend lingually into the valley between the two cusp rows. The front ridge of each pair ends in the central valley, and the back ridge joins a ridge from a lingual cusp. The ridge pattern results in the presence of three transverse furrows between the main cusps.|$|E

40|$|Fractography on {{fractured}} K-IC {{specimens of}} spheroidized steel has revealed a statistical distribution of dimple sizes (in the ductile failure region) {{dependent on the}} temperature and distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pre-crack <b>tip.</b> <b>The</b> statistical distributions of carbide sizes and dimple sizes conform closely to a Weibull distribution.
