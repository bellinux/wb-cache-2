2500|$|By December, {{the company}} had begun work on a {{reconversion}} of the U.S. Navy transport [...] into a civilian ocean liner, a contract described as [...] "the largest ship repair job ever handled" [...] in the United States. Mechanical improvements to the ship were to include the installation of a fuel-oil burning system [...] "with 24 furnace fronts", and the installation of a Sperry <b>gyrostabilizer</b> together with a foundation capable of absorbing a maximum thrust of 470,000lbs. Passenger accommodations were to be improved {{with the construction of}} a gymnasium, library and reading room, the latter two finished in hardwood and pine panelling, and the refitting of a smoking room and the passenger cabins, plus other improvements including the addition of two sick bays and installation of a new fire-indicating and extinguishing system.|$|E

25|$|The Norden sight was {{designed}} by Carl Norden, a Dutch engineer educated in Switzerland who emigrated to the U.S. in 1904. In 1911, Norden joined Sperry Gyroscope to work on ship <b>gyrostabilizers,</b> and then moved to work directly for the US Navy as a consultant. At the Navy, Norden worked on a catapult system for a proposed flying bomb that was never fully developed, but this work introduced various Navy personnel to Norden's expertise with gyro stabilization.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} post-war years, the Navy {{sponsored}} similar projects. For the first program, Witteman-Lewis aircraft and Norden-designed <b>gyrostabilizers</b> were used, {{but the results}} were no better than those achieved by the Sperrys. In 1921, the program was reoriented {{to focus on the}} radio control aspect. The control equipment was developed at the radio laboratory at NAS Anacostia (later the Naval Research Laboratory). In 1923, tests began, and were relatively successful, but interest waned and the project lapsed in 1925. Over a decade was to pass before the Navy seriously undertook the development of target drones and pilotless aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Fehse studied {{mechanics}} and aircraft guidance, navigation and {{control at the}} Technical University of Berlin (Germany), where he received his master's degree in 1965. In 1972, the doctor’s degree (summa cum laude) has been conferred on him by the Aerospace Institute of the Technical University of Berlin for his research and thesis on hydrostatic bearings as frictionless suspension in navigation instruments.In addition, in 1965 through 1973, {{he was responsible for}} the development of inertial navigation sensors and <b>gyrostabilizers</b> for satellites at Teldix (now Rockwell Collins, Inc.) in Heidelberg (Germany).In the following years he worked at ESTEC, the main technology development and test centre for spacecraft and space technology of the European Space Agency (ESA) at Noordwijk, The Netherlands, on attitude control and precision pointing problems and became later Head of the Navigation and Guidance Section. There, he and his teams at ESA and in industry developed basic techniques and technologies for automated rendezvous and docking of spacecraft, which are being applied in international space projects, such as the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), the first West-European spacecraft that docked automatically to the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2008.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1910, as the Sperry Gyroscope Company by Elmer Ambrose Sperry to {{manufacture}} navigation equipment, chiefly his own inventions—the marine <b>gyrostabilizer</b> and the gyrocompass at 40 Flatbush Avenue Extension in Downtown Brooklyn. During World War I the company diversified into aircraft components including bomb sights and fire control systems. In their early decades, Sperry Gyroscope and related companies were concentrated on Long Island, New York, especially in Nassau County. Over the years, it diversified to other locations.|$|E
40|$|The {{undesirable}} effects of roll motion of ships (rocking about the longitudinal axis) became noticeable {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century when significant changes were introduced to the design of ships as a result of sails being replaced by steam engines and the arrangement being changed from broad to narrow hulls. The combination of these changes led to lower transverse stability (lower restoring moment for a given angle of roll) with the consequence of larger roll motion. The increase in roll motion and its effect on cargo and human performance lead to the development several control devices that aimed at reducing and controlling roll motion. The control devices most commonly used today are fin stabilizers, rudder, anti-roll tanks, and <b>gyrostabilizers.</b> The use of different types of actuators for control of ship roll motion has been amply demonstrated for over 100 years. Performance, however, can still fall short of expectations because of difficulties associated with control system design, which have proven to be far from trivial due to fundamental performance limitations and large variations of the spectral characteristics of wave-induced roll motion. This short article provides an overview of the fundamentals of control design for ship roll motion reduction. The overview is limited to the most common control devices...|$|R

50|$|The M4 Sherman {{evolved from}} the M3 Medium Tank, which had its main {{armament}} in a side sponson mount. The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design, but put the main 75 mm gun in a fully traversing turret. One feature, a one-axis <b>gyrostabilizer,</b> was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the reticle on target, {{so that when the}} tank did stop to fire, the gun would be aimed in roughly the right direction. The designers stressed mechanical reliability, ease of production and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight. These factors, combined with the Sherman's then-superior armor and armament, outclassed German light and medium tanks fielded in 1939-42. The M4 went on to be produced in large numbers. It spearheaded many offensives by the Western Allies after 1942.|$|E
50|$|It {{can be very}} {{interesting}} to use the bombsight to drop newly added ordnance onto a target like the Little Boy, Fat Man, German radiological dirty bombs or the Tallboy bomb. However some of these aircraft are hypothetical especially the German designs some of which never saw aerial combat during World War II. So is the German ordnance hypothetical as well. Another feature in this add on is that you can fly bombers in a formation, with FLAK effects when under enemy anti aircraft fire. Twenty-five missions of the Memphis Belle B-17 Flying Fortress are included in this add on. One thing that's lacking though is a sophisticated simulation of the Norden Bombsight which B-17 Flying Fortress the Mighty 8th has a decent representation of albeit not fully emulating the Norden computer, it's <b>gyrostabilizer</b> and ancillary equipment. Instead the Bombsight in Firepower is fixed but it is functional. Even so, this is workable in the simulation add on with a fixed sight but {{it takes a lot of}} practice. Firepower is one of the most popular add ons to Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the current state}} of <b>gyrostabilizer</b> vehicular technology. With no previous description of the wide range and variety of <b>gyrostabilizer</b> technology, this paper provides a review of {{the current state of}} the art. This includes a detailed examination of <b>gyrostabilizer</b> vehicular systems, dynamics and control. The present review first describes the historical development of gyroscopic systems before going on to describe the various system characteristics, including an overview of <b>gyrostabilizer</b> vehicular applications and system designs for land, sea and spacecraft. The equations of motion for generic gyroscopic systems are derived following momentum (Newton-Euler) and energy (Lagrange) based approaches and examples provided. The derivations are made generically for individual components, enabling direct application for a wide variety of systems. In the final section, a review of <b>gyrostabilizer</b> control strategies is presented and the remaining challenges are discussed. <b>Gyrostabilizer</b> systems are anticipated to become more widely adopted as they provide an effective means of motion control with several significant advantages for land, sea and spacecraft.

40|$|A vessel {{stabilizer}} {{control system}} includes a sensor fault detection means which senses {{the availability of}} sensing signals from a <b>gyrostabilizer</b> precession motion sensor and a vessel roll motion sensor. The control system controls the action of a gyro-actuator which is mechanically coupled to a <b>gyrostabilizer.</b> The benefit of employing fault sensing of the sensors providing the process control variables is that the sensed number of available process control variables (or sensors) {{can be used to}} activate a tiered system of control modes. Each tiered control mode is designed to utilize the available process control variables to ensure safe and effective operation of the <b>gyrostabilizer</b> that is tolerant of sensor faults and loss of power supply.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} an algorithm for {{the synthesis of}} neural networks to control <b>gyrostabilizer.</b> The neural network performs {{the role of a}} state vector observer. The role of such an observer is to provide feedback on <b>gyrostabilizer,</b> which is illustrated in the article. The paper details the issue of specific stage-related peculiarities of classic algorithms: choosing the network architecture, learning the neural network and verifying the results of feedback control. The article presents an optimal configuration of the neural network like memory depth, number of layers and neurons in these layers, and activation layer functions. It also provides data on dynamic systems to improve learning neural network learning. There is also provided an optimal training pattern...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{problems}} of the engineering implementation of 3 -axis <b>gyrostabilizer</b> of the camera for orthophotography performed from light and ultralight aircrafts. The functional diagram of <b>gyrostabilizer</b> {{is characterized by a}} lighter ball-bearing having a large inner diameter used for the platform suspension on its internal (vertical) axis. The problem is to transfer the supply voltage to the platform and the electric signals to and from the platform. Design solutions concerning the power supply and information transfer are supported by the experimental techniques suggested in this paper, namely: the use of the rolling contact; three-phase gyro motor power supply replaced by that from the single-phase network; signal transmission from the precession angle sensor using the air transformer; current and voltage frequency division; DC mode selection for the torquer. The results obtained prove the efficiency of the suggested design solutions...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} modern {{structural}} systems, spurred by advances in construction methodology and high strength materials, has driven {{the height of}} modern skyscrapers beyond what was once deemed possible. Although science and technology {{has been able to}} increase the strength of building materials such as steel and concrete, their material stiffness has remained virtually unchanged. The end result is a wave of taller, slender and more flexible skyscrapers that are very susceptible to wind-induced excitations. Ever mindful of the fact that human comfort levels are affected by perceived structural responses, engineers must employ various strategies to satisfy serviceability constraints. This thesis presents an overview, in addition to successful applications, of the various aerodynamic and damping modifications that are used to control wind-induced motion in tall buildings. Finally, a modified <b>gyrostabilizer,</b> akin to those used in luxury yachts, is proposed as a possible active control mechanism. The feasibility of this device was studied using simple statics and rigid body dynamics. by Nnabuihe Nnamani. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Beside the {{enormous}} grow of Chinas mega-cities, also small cities and big villages show up an urban sprawl {{that makes a}} monitoring essential. Especially {{in the eastern part}} of the country, forced by the economic growth, the sprawl of urban fabric is extreme. This causes a need for a frequently and rapid monitoring in order to take pace in mapping and documentation. The typical turn rate of countrywide aerial surveys is not convenient to solve this task. Small scale, long intervals, and bad quality of the data hamper doing the job with sound scientific methods. The Hebei Bureau of Surveying and Mapping finally found a smart solution in the year 2006 and meanwhile ran several campaigns of even big areas. A combination of a medium format camera, a <b>gyrostabilizer</b> and a professional FMS were installed on a Trike for aerial survey missions. Quality and operability will be shown in the following paper. 1.

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{distributed}} systems stabilization based on gyroscopes with three-degree-freedom {{and based on}} gyroscopes with ball suspension. The accuracy and resource of operation of such systems requires an increase. The problem of improving the accuracy and increasing the service life of information – measuring systems of stabilization can be solved by using as a sensitive element of a dynamically tuned gyroscope. Today the issue of achieving {{the potential of the}} metrological characteristics of information-measuring systems stabilization on dynamically tuned gyroscope is not fully resolved. It requires the development of mathematical models, different from the known, detailed description of the perturbations acting on a device. In addition, it is necessary to develop structures amplifying-transforming paths of the contours stabilization of information-measuring systems of stabilization on dynamically tuned gyroscopes, assuring higher accuracy and noise immunity of the system, {{what is the purpose of}} the work. In using the Euler equations obtained a complete mathematical model of functioning system with three motion bases, in detail taking into account the disturbances acting on the device. Considered are the peculiarities of mathematical description of dynamically tuned gyroscope. Dominant frequencies of components noise is identified in the output signal of the gyroscope. The original scheme of the contours stabilization is presented, that help increase the accuracy of stabilization at low frequencies and of providing the absence of systematic drift of the <b>gyrostabilizer</b> from the action of the permanent disturbing moment along the axis of stabilization. The dynamic calculations show the possibility of providing error of stabilization on payload not more than 0, 0042 degree.  </p...|$|E
