40|$|Isolated submandibular {{suppurative}} sialadenitis {{is extremely}} rare in newborn infants and {{is associated with}} prematurity and prolonged gavage feeding. This report describes a premature infant who developed a life-threatening airway obstruction due to suppurative submandibular sialadenitis. The diagnosis was made on clinical grounds and confirmed by ultrasonography. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from the pus expressed from the Wharton's duct orifice. Upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure were managed with intubation and mechanical ventilation, and the sialadenitis resolved quickly and completely with flucloxacillin treatment. Possible causes of sialadenitis include dehydration, decreased saliva flow and stasis during gavage <b>feeding,</b> <b>duct</b> obstruction by stones and direct bacterial inoculation. Ultrasonography is the diagnostic imaging of choice to exclude congenital tumours, lymphadenitis, congenital malformations of the Wharton's duct or the gland itself, and subcutaneous fat necrosis. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of suppurative submandibular sialadenitis may prevent complications such as abscess formation, septicaemia and respiratory failur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nitrous oxide has {{recently}} entered violently {{the arena of}} space propulsion and gained interest, due to its high energy and gasification potential and despite its low oxygen content as an oxidizing chemical and its instability over some 600 C. However, its physical and chemical instability soon {{proved to be a}} potential hazard and led to a renewed interest in the study of its behavior as a fluid. In the present contribution computer simulation of the liquid phase flow of the nitrous oxide under high pressure is used to predict and avoid the cavitation into the feeding line tract of rocket engines, specifically of the compound rocket engines feeding line. The method involves a substantially simplified 1 -D description of the fluid motion with sufficiently accurate determination of cavitation risk where the <b>feeding</b> <b>duct</b> suffers blunt variations of the cross area or steep turns and corners involving sensible static pressure variations of the fluid. A means of avoiding dangerous behaviors of the nitrous oxide is thus developed that could increase safety margins during the handling of this quite unpredictable oxidizer for the compound, combined or hybrid rocket engines...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{requirements}} related to successful utilization of plasma technology as an oil-free backup system for coal ignition and combustion stabilization in power plant boilers is provision of properly regulated pulverized coal distribution to the <b>feed</b> <b>ducts</b> leading the fuel mixture to a burner. Proper regulation of coal distribution is deemed essential for achieving an adequate pulverized coal concentration in the zone where thermal plasma is being introduced. The said can be efficiently achieved by installation of stationary louver in the coal-air mixing duct ahead of the <b>feed</b> <b>ducts</b> of a burner. The paper addresses numerical simulation of a two-phase flow of air-pulverized coal mixture in the mixing ducts, analyzing the effects of particle size distribution on pulverized coal distribution to the burner <b>feed</b> <b>ducts.</b> Numerical simulation was performed using the FLUENT 6. 3 commercial code and related poly-dispersed flow module, based on the PSI-CELL approach. Numerical experiments have been performed assuming a mono-dispersed solid phase with particle diameter ranging from 45 mm to 1200 mm. Distance between the louver blades and the resulting effect on the flow profile was analyzed as well. Results obtained indicate {{that the size of}} coal particles considerably influence the overall solid phase distribution. While fine particles, with diameters {{at the lower end of}} the above specified range, almost fully follow the streamlines of the continuous phase, coarser particles, which hit the louver blades, deflect towards the thermal plasma zone. In this manner, a desired phase concentration in the considered zone can be reached. For the said reason, installation of stationary louver have been deemed a very efficient way to induce phase separation, primarily due to more pronounced impact of the installed louver on discrete phase flow then the impact on the flow of the continuous phase...|$|R

40|$|A {{program to}} develop {{analytical}} tools {{for evaluating the}} dynamic performance of Air Cushion Landing Systems (ACLS) is described. The heave (vertical) motion of the ACLS was analyzed, and the analysis was extended to cover coupled heave-pitch motions.

The air source characteristics, flow losses in the <b>feeding</b> <b>ducts,</b> trunk and cushion, the effects of fluid compressibility, and dynamic trunk deflections, including ground contact are considered. A computer program, based on the heave-pitch analysis, was developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of an ACLS during landing impact and taxi over an irregular runway. The program outputs include ACLS motions, loadings, pressures, and flows as a function of time. To illustrate program use, three basic types of simulations were carried out.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the impact of filleted edges variations on heat transfer. In real gas turbines, sharp edges are an approximation, because of manufacturing tolerances and/or geometrical modifications occurring during operation. The value of fillet radius is not exactly known a priori. It can be assumed that a specific radius occurs with a probability following a probabilistic distribution. For this reason, the effect of variation of the filleted edge on internal channel of a film cooling configuration has been studied numerically using an in house solver. The hole exit is fan-shaped and the <b>feeding</b> <b>duct</b> axis and the main stream are perpendicular to each other. A response surface has been generated varying the internal Mach number of coolant and the pressure ratio range between coolant and main gas. Four fillets radii for the internal duct have been analysed, r/D= 0. 0 - 5 %. A Gaussian distribution for the fillet radius has been assumed. Using the over mentioned distributions it is possible to obtain the probabilistic functions of the corresponding discharge coefficient, C d, and adiabatic effectiveness, h. The overall variation of C d and h can be more than 10 % the value without fillet. Furthermore the differences on Cd due to the uncertainties on fillet radius are bigger than those obtained modifying the exit duct shape (i. e. from cylindrical to fanshaped). This paper shows that the effect of variation of fillet radii must be included in numerical simulations. This has direct consequences on LES and DNS simulations, which normally include sharp corners or mean radii. A probabilistic approach must be included in the analysis of the results and the equivalent fillet radius assumed instead...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} of liquid rocket engine test processes involves assessing critical fluid mechanic and heat and mass transfer mechanisms within a cryogenic environment, and accurately modeling fluid properties such as vapor pressure and liquid and gas densities {{as a function}} of pressure and temperature. The Engineering and Science Directorate at the NASA John C.

The wind tunnel was designed to eliminate noise from the entrance of air or from flow interactions with the tunnel walls so that noise caused by the flow-test structure interactions can be studied. The channel contains 1 x 1 x 0. 2 m glass and metal foil baffles spaced 0. 2 m apart. The flow is forced by a 350 kW fan in the primary circuit, and a 110 kW blower in the secondary circuit. The primary circuit features a factor of four throat reductions, followed by a 1. 6 reduction before the test section. Upstream and downstream sensors permit monitoring of the anechoic effectiveness of the channel. Other sensors allow modeling of the flow structures in the tunnel.

40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and {{industry}} contractors have undertaken activities {{to develop a}} simplified liquid oxygen (LO 2) propellant conditioning concept for future expendable launch vehicles. The objective of these activities is to reduce operations costs and timelines and to improve safety of these vehicles.

The porose areas symmetrically located on the dorsal surface of the basis capituli are openings of their accessory glands.

Rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complexes, secretory granules undergoing exocytosis suggest that secretory cells have a protein-synthesis ability.

50|$|The {{stator core}} is built with lamination's of cold rolled {{grain-oriented}} sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, insulated {{from each other}} with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial <b>ducts</b> <b>feed</b> the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a concern}} that environmental-contamination caused {{corrosion}} may negatively affect Information Technology (IT) equipment reliability. Nineteen data centers in the United States and two in India were evaluated using Corrosion Classification Coupons (CCC) to assess environmental air quality as it may relate IT equipment reliability. The data centers were of two basic types: closed and outside-air cooled. A closed data center provides cool air to the IT equipment using air conditioning in which only a small percent age of the recirculation air is make-up air continuously supplied from outside to meet human health requirements. An outside-air cooled data center uses outside air directly as the primary source for IT equipment cooling. Corrosion measuring coupons containing copper and silver metal strips were placed in both closed and outside-air cooled data centers. The coupons were placed at each data center (closed and outside-air cooled types) with the location categorized into three groups: (1) Outside - coupons sheltered, located near or at the supply air inlet, but located before any filtering, (2) Supply - starting just after initial air filtering continuing inside the plenums and <b>ducts</b> <b>feeding</b> the data center rooms, and (3) Inside located inside the data center rooms near the IT equipment.
