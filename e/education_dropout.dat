50|$|Reproductive {{health is}} usually gauged {{in terms of}} the {{maternal}} mortality rate, which is the number of mothers per 100,000 who die from pregnancy-related causes. In 2015, Honduras had a rate of 129 deaths/100,000 live births. Many of these deaths come as a result of unregulated and illegally performed abortions which leave the women at great risk for infection. Another indicator is the adolescent fertility rate, which is the number of live births per 1,000 adolescent mothers (ages 13-18). For every 1,000 births in Honduras, 93.3, or almost 10 percent, were to adolescent mothers. This high rate is a negative indicator not only for the women who are having children at such a young age, but also for the community as a whole. Women who have children as adolescents put their children in a situation where they {{are much more likely to}} be raised in poverty, due to the fact that the secondary <b>education</b> <b>dropout</b> rate is significantly higher among adolescents who have children.|$|E

40|$|Background : In Germany, almost 15 {{per cent}} of all first-year {{students}} leave higher education without obtaining a degree.

30|$|Reducing {{the high}} levels of early school leaving {{is one of the main}} {{challenges}} facing most of European education systems (European Commission 2011; Salva-Mut et al. 2014). Consequently, there is ample research and scientific literature related to this topic, as confirmed in reviews by De Wittea et al. (2013) and by Hovdhaugen et al. (2015). Despite this abundance of literature on dropouts, almost all of it is related to secondary education leaving.

30|$|In {{line with}} common labour market theories, {{we assumed that}} the {{matching}} process of job applicants to open positions {{takes place in a}} context of uncertainty and that employers evaluate ‘signals’ of job-applicants (Spence 1973). We discussed if higher <b>education</b> <b>dropout</b> signals a lack of ability and non-cognitive skills, as proposed by Heckman and Rubinstein (2001), or if enrolment in higher education as such is assessed as positive signal (Arrow 1973). As Germany is known for a highly credentialist labour market, we expected dropouts without pre-tertiary vocational qualifications to have large disadvantages in the labour market transitions, compared to job-seekers with pre-tertiary vocational qualifications.|$|E

30|$|The above {{summary of}} {{existing}} {{research suggests that}} ‘some college’ without graduating generates benefits in some countries, but not in others and in Germany the additional benefit of a non-completed higher education episode seems to be low. Existing literature however, {{does not take into}} account that higher <b>education</b> <b>dropouts</b> may enter the labour market with formal vocational qualifications that were gained outside higher education. The German educational system, for example, provides vocational training opportunities which are perceived as an attractive alternative pathway by a large proportion of general upper secondary education graduates. In the following sections, we therefore give a brief overview of the German post-secondary educational system and develop implications for the labour market transitions of higher <b>education</b> <b>dropouts</b> in the specific context conditions of the German case.|$|R

30|$|Later {{approaches}} rather {{assume that}} the recruitment process {{takes place in a}} context of uncertainty. Since employers cannot determine job candidates’ actual productivity levels, they screen potential employees on the basis of observable characteristics such as educational attainment, grades, gender, age, work experience, unemployment duration or other personal characteristics. These observable characteristics are termed ‘signals’ (Spence 1973). It is, however, rarely discussed if higher <b>education</b> <b>dropout</b> serves as a signal in the recruiting process and if it is perceived as a positive or negative signal by employers. Higher <b>education</b> <b>dropout</b> could in fact be interpreted as failure and as a signal for a lack of ability, perseverance and goal commitment (Heckman and Rubinstein 2001). Future employers therefore might perceive hiring dropouts as a risky investment as they might be likely to show these characteristics in the job as well. Arrow (1973) to the contrary argues that time spent in higher education sends a positive signal to prospective employers. His model describes the signalling role of higher education as a ‘double filter’: admission to higher education acts as a first filter, while graduation serves as a second filter. Thus the mere enrolment in higher education {{can be seen as a}} positive signal for employers, and consequently enhances applicants’ labour market chances even if they did not obtain a higher education degree. Our above summary of previous research reveals that it seems to depend on the context whether dropouts are more successful in the labour market than job-seekers who never entered higher education (see especially Schnepf 2015 for a comparison of European countries). Germany appears to be one of the countries where ‘some college’ is not associated with higher labour market returns (Schnepf 2017; Stegmann and Kraft 1988). The reasons for this, however, are largely unexplored. We suggest that vocational training might play a non-negligible role here.|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the subject of the early school leaving, there are few researches about success and dropout pathways in Vocational Education and Training, while there are many studies centered in other educational levels. This article aims to respond to the following questions: What role do practical recommendations play in research on vocational <b>education</b> <b>dropout?</b> To which specific areas of the educational intervention do these recommendations refer? What specifically are the main practical recommendations for reducing vocational education dropouts? A review of the existing scientific literature has been conducted.

30|$|A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} students leaves higher education without a degree {{and has to}} enter the labour market without formal vocational qualifications. Previous {{research shows that the}} group of higher <b>education</b> <b>dropouts</b> has a higher risk of being unemployed, working part-time or on fixed term contracts and on average obtains lower wages than higher education graduates (e.g. Becker et al. 2010; Davies and Elias 2003; Griesbach et al. 1977; Johnes and Taylor 1991; Lewin et al. 1995; Reisel 2013). In Germany however, approximately a quarter of all first year students enters higher education after having obtained a formal vocational training degree (Bildungsberichterstattung 2014). This ‘double-qualification’ usually serves to improve labour market opportunities or to bridge waiting periods (e.g. when entrance restrictions prevent an immediate transition into the desired course), but is also a risk-mitigating strategy among students who expect a certain risk of failure in higher education (Büchel and Helberger 1995; Pilz 2009). Research on double qualifiers has shown that an additional vocational degree does not result in additional labour market benefits for higher education graduates (Büchel and Helberger 1995; Hammen 2011; Tuor and Backes-Gellner 2010; Weiss et al. 2014). The question if a vocational qualification indeed serves as a safety net in case of higher education non-completion however, has not been examined yet. This paper aims to fill this gap and to examine labour market transitions of higher <b>education</b> <b>dropouts.</b> We examine if these pre-tertiary vocational qualifications mitigate the risk of protracted labour market transitions and low occupational status when higher education has not been completed with a degree. We distinguish two labour market outcomes: First, the actual transition into a stable first employment indicates if higher <b>education</b> <b>dropouts</b> have more difficulties finding a job. Second, the occupational status of the first job, which indicates if higher <b>education</b> <b>dropouts</b> without pre-tertiary vocational training are more likely to enter low status jobs than dropouts with formal vocational qualifications. We also examine whether a non-completed higher education episode generates advantages compared to individuals who have graduated from non-tertiary vocational training, but never entered higher education. The remainder of this paper will give an overview of previous research and an introduction to the institutional setting in Germany. From general theories of education-to-work transitions we will derive our theoretical framework and hypotheses, followed by data description and an empirical test. We discuss our results in the conclusions section and develop an outlook on future research.|$|R

This research uses data from students, which are the main population in higher education. Thus, the research is based on a survey questionnaire conducted to a higher education student population. These students can be divided in two categories to be compared: the regular private higher education students and the college students who have stopped their studies. The empirical study begins by a characterization of the respondents, followed by a logistical regression in order to identify the determinants of dropout.

The country’s education and training system needs to produce an adaptable workforce with professional skills and workplace behaviors.

Technical and vocational and university graduates are increasingly more prepared for entry-level jobs than those who complete general education, but basic skills and life skills are still lacking. This results in a workforce that is not performing to satisfactory industry standards. The government and private sector will need to focus on: (i) skills development by ensuring lifelong learning through flexible pathways that are gender-inclusive; (ii) bottom-up planning, which improves the quality and relevance of teaching and learning; (iii) attracting young people to the technical and vocational stream; (iv) improving industry engagement; and (v) strengthening coordination among stakeholders at the national and training institution levels in the short, medium, and longer term...|$|E

It then elaborates how prominence of any given mechanism within any given country should be conditional on the institutional set up of employment systems. Our country choice is driven by the similarity of two countries’ education systems and their diverging labour market trajectories, allowing for cautious inferences about institutional effects. Empirically, we estimate the propensity of young people to enter, persist in, and complete tertiary education, net of socio-demographic background, and study characteristics.

30|$|As {{outlined}} above, {{vocational training}} {{and higher education}} {{are not mutually exclusive}} in Germany and vocational training graduates can choose to enter higher education later in life (Büchel and Helberger 1995; Hammen 2011; Jacob 2004; Tieben and Rohrbach-Schmidt 2014). The reasons for this double qualification are manifold. On the one hand, we have to assume that individuals adjust their educational and occupational goals during their life course and decide to enter higher education after periods of labour market participation. Often, this happens in order to improve career prospects or because of dissatisfaction with the initially chosen occupation. Entering higher education can also be a strategy to escape from unemployment (Hammen 2011; Jacob 2004). On the other hand, double qualification may also be part of a deliberate education strategy. Especially in the 1990 s, it became increasingly popular to enter vocational training after having obtained a higher education entrance certificate. Büchel and Helberger (1995) assume an ‘insurance strategy’ of these double qualifiers in the German educational system as they hope to benefit from their vocational skills during higher education and in the labour market later on. Büchel and Helberger (1995) also mention the assumption that a vocational training certificate may serve as fall-back option in case of higher <b>education</b> <b>dropout.</b> In a similar vein, Shavit and Müller (2000) discuss how vocational education is a ‘safety net’: A vocational training certificate reduces the risk of unemployment and unskilled labour, especially in countries with a vocational training system which is specific rather than general, such as the German.|$|E
30|$|At {{this point}} {{we return to the}} above {{discussion}} of the ‘signaling’ value of higher <b>education</b> <b>dropout</b> and derive why ‘some college’ may not result in higher labour market returns in Germany, compared to individuals who have never entered higher education. The signalling value of vocational qualifications in the recruitment process depends on the link between the educational system and the labour market (Allmendinger 1989; Gangl 2003; Shavit and Müller 2000; van de Werfhorst 2011; Wolbers 2003). The German labour market can be regarded as being highly credentialist due to its strong linkage between vocational education and the labour market. 4 Because of the high specificity of the German vocational training system, the signals sent by job seekers’ formal vocational qualifications to prospective employers are particularly informative, whereas an unfinished higher education episode does not convey any information about the actual skills of an applicant. If we assume that higher education dropouts are aiming to enter skilled or even high skilled employment, they thus compete with applicants with formal qualifications for these jobs. From the perspective of an employer, an applicant with a vocational training certificate hence should be the less ‘risky’ choice, e.g. in terms of training costs. We therefore expect that dropouts without vocational qualifications achieve lower returns in the labour market than individuals who graduated from vocational training but never entered higher education. More specifically, we expect them to be less likely to enter a stable employment. (Hypothesis 1 a) and to achieve on average a lower occupational status (Hypothesis 1 b).|$|E

30|$|Although {{there is}} a large body of {{research}} examining returns to education, these generally focus on formal qualifications, such as (general upper/vocational) secondary and tertiary certificates. A number of researchers acknowledge that attendance in higher education without graduation may deliver returns in the labour market, but empirical results are inconclusive (Bailey et al. 2004; Davies and Elias 2003; Flores-Lagunes and Light 2007; Grubb 2002; Johnes and Taylor 1991; Kane and Rouse 1995; Matković and Kogan 2012; Reisel 2013; Schnepf 2017; Stegmann and Kraft 1988). Schnepf (2017) for example shows that university dropouts are more likely to hold professional and managerial positions than upper secondary education graduates who never entered higher education in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovakia, but not in France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK. For Germany, Stegmann and Kraft (1988) find that higher <b>education</b> <b>dropouts</b> do not have a higher risk of being unemployed but achieve a lower occupational status and a lower income than higher education graduates.

40|$|ABSTRACT Almost {{every country}} in the world is {{commited}} to offer primary education for every child in 2015 at the latest yet many children have been left out of school. Mozambique is one of the coutries which is still struggling to get all children through a full course of primary education. The street children are part of this phenomenon. Many of them have once been enrolled to primary school but at some point they have dropped out and are now surviving on the street without basic education. In this study the focus is in the question of how to create the possibility of basic education for a dropout living on the street. The data collection took place in Maputo City, Mozambique during the spring 2008. The material was collected with ethnographic methods from 12 children who have dropped out of primary education and are now living on the street. These children were between 13 and 17 years of age and all of them were boys. When collecting the data observation and semi-structured interviews were used as well as photographs and drawings to supplement the research material. This material was collected in a close interaction with the children while working with them. The research follows the ideas of Paulo Freire and it concentrates on analysing the reality of a street child, their vision of a better future and finding means to achieve that better future. All of the researched children said that the mean to achieve their dream is to get education. This created the vision of a better future which is education for all. The means to achieve this were created together with the children. In order to attend school the street children would require a private place to do their homework, wash their clothes and deposit their personal belongings. The children also need school materials and clothes as well as shoes for going to school. Some of the regulations of schooling need to be modificated, like the possibility to influence on school shifts and the physical place of school. Also huge modifications should be made in the public. The attitudes towards the street children should be changed so that they could sleep in peace, their rights would not be neglected and they would not have to face so much hostility rather they would encounter support, help and kindness.    Asiasanat:street children, primary <b>education,</b> <b>dropout,</b> the reality of street children, education for all, Mozambiqu...|$|E
