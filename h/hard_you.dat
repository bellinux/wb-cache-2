500|$|With some hesitation, {{both men}} {{agree to the}} match, {{creating}} a media buzz that stabs at Rocky's has-been status and Dixon's credibility. Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice; that to succeed in life, [...] "it ain't about how <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> hit; it's about how <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> can get hit, and keep moving forward", and that blaming others won't help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky's side. Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed's old trainer, Duke, who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|Hershiser {{had ended}} Padres catcher Benito Santiago's 34-game hitting streak {{the year before}} and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser's streak. Santiago's streak was an MLB record for a catcher, an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres. No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since. According to Tony Gwynn, [...] "We wanted so badly to put a run on the board...Maybe, we tried a little too <b>hard.</b> <b>You</b> {{have to give the}} man credit. He didn't give me one decent pitch to hit all night. He put {{everything}} right where he wanted it to go." ...|$|E
500|$|The celebratory mood {{continued}} into the next preseason, when Adams sent the team for two weeks of training camp in Hawaii. Rymkus was upset by the distractions caused by the decision. [...] "We {{found it hard to}} think football around the palm trees", he said. [...] "A preseason camp has to be hard, and you have to work <b>hard.</b> <b>You</b> can't do it in a place like Hawaii." [...] The team got off to a 1–3–1 start in 1961, and Adams fired him on October 14. Adams said the decision was [...] "based on the conclusion the material on hand has not been used to its fullest potential". Wally Lemm was given the head coaching job, but the shake-up prompted Speedie to resign. Under Lemm, the Oilers regrouped to win their second consecutive title.|$|E

500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really <b>hard.</b> <b>You</b> have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying {{us what we}} more or less deserve from a Batman story. No matter how <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eddy Merckx {{who had won}} the Tour on five occasions, commented: [...] "my {{heart is}} no longer in it" [...] in {{response}} to his support for the Tour. [...] Another Belgian rider Johan Museeuw (who had previously received a two-year ban for doping), suggested doping and drug use were a possible consequence of the difficulty of riding the Tour in its current format.

5000|$|She {{wrote the}} song because, [...] "I {{wanted to let}} people know not to let in bullies in the first place," [...] "They are looking for that reaction, but if you dont let them know they bother you, they move on."

Instead she was actually responding to Perron's blog {{about the possibility of a}} [...] "cover-up" [...] and wanted to clarify that [...] "I do want people to know that you cannot absolutely become a professional ballet dancer in a year and a half no matter how <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> work. I've been doing this for 22 years."

2500|$|After its release, Hydrophobia {{received}} poor {{reviews from}} some media outlets, prompting contention between the developer and some reviewers. Pete Jones, Joint Design Director for Dark Energy Digital {{spoke of the}} difficulties experienced {{in an interview with}} GamingNexus. [...] "Criticism can be <b>hard.</b> <b>You</b> make games because you love games, perhaps on occasions we may have seemed a little too defensive and disappointed. Pride can be a big virtue as well because you need to be intensely proud of something you're creating in any endeavor." [...] Jones further stated that it was difficult to accept that some consumers and critics disliked the game. He conceded that [...] "if the community doesnt like it we try and change it no matter whose toes we tread on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhou Yu {{personally}} welcomed Jiang Gan {{and told}} him, [...] "Ziyi, you tried <b>hard.</b> <b>You</b> travelled {{all the way}} here just to be {{a spokesman for the}} Caos?" [...] Jiang Gan replied, [...] "I'm an old friend of yours but we've not been in contact for years. When I heard you have become famous now, I travelled here to visit you and reminisce our past days, as well as to tour the region. Are you suspecting my intentions when you called me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now. I'll treat you to another meal again after I'm done with that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mike Langberg of Knight Ridder {{was less}} positive, writing {{in his review}} that [...] "At first glance, the CD-ROM {{provides}} a lot of raw material. There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> try." ...|$|E
