5|$|When O'Brien <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> write a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, {{she wanted the}} book to be more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving too much into her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis given on the singer's discography was unnecessary, instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E

The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> work with the USAF to develop the new drone.

Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of , which his script pre-dated by six years. In November 1979, producer Jon Peters and Casablanca FilmWorks, headed by Peter Guber, joined the project. The four producers felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of Superman (1978). Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched Batman to Universal Pictures, but the studio turned it down. The project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the Comic Art Convention in New York. Casablanca FilmWorks was absorbed into PolyGram Pictures in 1980. Guber and Peters left PolyGram Pictures in 1982 and took the Batman film rights with them, although PolyGram would retain at least 7.5% of the profits of said rights due to a contractual agreement. Guber and Peters immediately set up shop at Warner Bros., which <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> accept Batman.|$|E

The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached {{all the way to}} Leoben, about 100km from Vienna, and <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> sue for peace. The Treaty of Leoben, followed by the more comprehensive Treaty of Campo Formio, gave France control of most of northern Italy and the Low Countries, and a secret clause promised the Republic of Venice to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of independence. He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the Horses of Saint Mark.|$|E
5|$|Villa {{were one}} of the {{founding}} members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season.

Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost 1–0 to Chelsea in the last game to be played at the old Wembley Stadium. Again Villa's league position continued to fluctuate under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when David O'Leary left in acrimony.
