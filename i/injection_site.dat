5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the <b>injection</b> <b>site,</b> due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the <b>injection</b> <b>site.</b> Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E
5|$|Herd numbers {{grew from}} 28 to over 165 between 1968 and 1997 and {{overgrazing}} negatively impacted their living environment. To manage population numbers, long-term, non-hormonal contraceptives have been employed, proving 95 percent effective over a seven-year field trial. The contraceptive, which {{began to be}} used at a management level in 1995 although it was used in smaller amounts as early as 1989, has also proven effective at improving the health and increasing the life expectancy of older mares through the removal of pregnancy and lactation-related stress. Since 1990, general herd health has improved, early mortality has decreased and older ponies are now found, with many {{over the age of}} 20 and some even over 25. No horse has ever been injured during the dart-administered treatments, although there is a 0.2 percent rate of abscess at the <b>injection</b> <b>site,</b> which normally heals within two weeks. Each mare between two and four years old is given contraceptives, and treatment is then withdrawn until she produces a foal. Once she has produced enough foals to be well represented genetically within the herd, she is placed on a yearly treatment plan until her death. After the introduction of the contraceptive, herd numbers continued to rise to a high of 175 in 2001 to 2005, but then dropped significantly to around 130 in 2009. In 2009, a study determined that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the herd was quite low, most likely due to their isolation, but that their nuclear genetic diversity remained at a level similar to that of breeds from the mainland.|$|E
30|$|In vivo PET/CT and BLI {{showed a}} clear signal in DC/NF <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> but not in parental DC <b>injection</b> <b>sites.</b> The signal {{intensity}} in DC/NF cells was correlated with time. In vivo 18 F-TFB PET/CT imaging showed higher radiotracer activity in the draining popliteal lymph nodes (DPLNs) in DC/NF <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> than those in DC <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> on day 2. BLI also showed DC/NF cell migration to the DPLNs on day 2 after the injection.|$|R
50|$|The {{provision}} of supervised <b>injection</b> <b>sites,</b> {{also referred to}} as safe <b>injection</b> <b>sites,</b> operates under the premise of harm reduction by providing the injection drug user with a clean space and clean materials such as needles, sterile water, alcohol swabs, and other items used for safe injection.|$|R
50|$|Supervised <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> (SIS) (also {{known as}} {{supervised}} injection facilities, safe <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> fix rooms, safer injection facilities (SIF), drug consumption facilities (DCF) or medically supervised injection centers (MSIC)) are legally-sanctioned, medically-supervised facilities {{designed to reduce}} nuisance from public drug use and provide a hygienic and stress-free environment in which individuals are able to consume illicit recreational drugs intravenously.|$|R

25|$|Deferoxamine is only {{effective}} via daily injections which makes its long-term use more difficult. It has {{the benefit of}} being inexpensive and decent long-term safety. Adverse effects are primary skin reactions around the <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> and hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) {{associated with}} the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at <b>injection</b> <b>site.</b> Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, eosinophilia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on Michel Foucault’s {{bio-power}} lens, {{this paper}} argues that supervised <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> are political and governmental spaces {{that have emerged}} from the harm reduction movement {{as an alternative to}} prohibitionist approaches to drug use. Within this movement, harm reduction as a “health” policy has emerged as the new truth discourse in which to justify supervised <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> as the most appropriate technique to address urban drug problems. However, supervised <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> do not actually function as a form of health care in the traditional sense of optimizing life and wellbeing. Drawing upon secondary and primary textual sources and using the creation of The Toronto Drug Strategy (2005) as my analytical focus I show how supervised <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> operate new governmental and political spaces that naturalize drug use and the various modes of disadvantage that often go hand-in-hand with it. Rather than promoting health, such undertakings normalize the dying body outside the health promotion frame...|$|R
40|$|As known {{insulin therapy}} is {{associated}} with induration of subcutaneous fat at <b>injections</b> <b>sites</b> called lypohypertrophy. It develops at any age and at any site regardless of duration of the treatment. The size of lypohypertrophy varies in a wide range. Numerous {{studies have been conducted}} to elucidate mechanisms of lypohypertrophy (LH) and its risk factors including young age, low or high body mass index, frequency of the change of needles and <b>injection</b> <b>sites,</b> female gender, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. It was shown that insulin crystals induce a local immune reaction and thereby interfere with adipocyte differentiation. At the same time, patients with LH have elevated titters of anti-insulin antibodies. The problem with LH is uncontrollable absorption of insulin from <b>injection</b> <b>sites.</b> We noticed that patients with a target glucose level due to insulin therapy undergo its apparently causeless periodic rises. Comparative ultrasonic examination of subcutaneous fat at different <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> and control body areas revealed specific pathological changes in adipose issue. This finding provided a basis for the hypothesis that LH can be detected by ultrasonography of subcutaneous fat. It was confirmed by the results of examination of 50 patients with DM 1 treated with insulin of whom 41 were found to have pathological changes at <b>injection</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fifteen fibrosarcomas, surgically excised from presumed <b>sites</b> of <b>{{injection}}</b> in dogs, and 10 canine fibrosarcomas excised from sites {{not used}} for injection were histologically and immuno-histochemically compared with 20 feline post-vaccinal fibro-sarcomas. Canine fibrosarcomas from presumed <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> were of grade I (3), of grade II (4) and grade III (8). Two fibrosarcomas from non-injection sites were of grade I, four of grade II {{and four of}} grade III. Feline samples were classified as grade I (2), grade II (4) and grade III (14). All fibrosarcomas from presumed <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> of both species showed lympho-cytic inflammatory infiltration located at the tumour periph-ery, while two canine fibrosarcomas from non-injection sites showed perivascular inflammatory infiltration within the neo-plasm. All samples were immunohistochemically examined for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin and des-min expression. All tumours were positive for vimentin. Ten canine fibrosarcomas from presumed <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> and all feline samples contained cells consistent with a myofibroblastic immunophenotype. Aluminium deposits were detected in eight canine fibrosarcomas from presumed <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> and 11 feline post-vaccinal fibrosarcomas by the aurintricarboxylic acid method. The present study identifies distinct similarities between canine fibrosarcomas from presumed <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> and feline post-vaccinal fibrosarcomas, suggesting the possi-bility {{of the development of}} post-injection sarcomas not only in cats, but also in dogs...|$|R
25|$|Vaccination given during {{childhood}} is generally safe. Adverse effects if any are generally mild. The rate {{of side effects}} depends on the vaccine in question. Some common side effects include fever, pain around the <b>injection</b> <b>site,</b> and muscle aches. Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine. MMR vaccine is rarely associated with febrile seizures.|$|E
25|$|The civic {{government}} {{was dominated by}} the centre-right Non-Partisan Association (NPA) since World War II, albeit with some significant centre-left interludes until 2008. The NPA fractured {{over the issue of}} drug policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) on a harm reduction platform. Subsequently, North America's only legal safe <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> was opened for the significant number of intravenous heroin users in the city.|$|E
25|$|Phenytoin {{was once}} another {{first-line}} therapy, although the prodrug fosphenytoin can be administered {{three times as}} fast and with far fewer <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> reactions. If these or any other hydantoin derivatives are used, then cardiac monitoring is a must if they are administered intravenously. Because the hydantoins take 15–30 minutes to work, a benzodiazepine or barbiturate is often coadministered. Because of diazepam's short duration of action, they were often administered together anyway.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{rotation}} of the <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> {{may not be enough}} to prevent lipodystrophy.|$|R
50|$|Common <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> {{include the}} inner {{surface of the}} forearm and the upper back, under the scapula.|$|R
5000|$|Abscessed infections of <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> {{are caused}} by lack of hygiene {{and a lack of}} aseptic technique.|$|R
25|$|Tetanus can be {{prevented}} through the highly effective tetanus vaccine, which is a tetanus toxin inactivated with formaldehyde to be immunogenic but not pathogenic. The vaccine can be formulated as simple or adsorbed tetanus vaccine, combined tetanus and killed polio vaccine, or the older (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) (DPT) vaccine. Side effects are rare, {{but if they do}} occur, include fever, pain (sometimes long lasting) at the <b>injection</b> <b>site,</b> unexplained crying in infants, and irritability in older children or adults.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} and anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of flucloxacillin include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at <b>injection</b> <b>site,</b> superinfection (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with flucloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people >55 years, females, and those with treatment longer than two weeks.|$|E
40|$|A {{bioavailability}} {{study of}} three commercial chloramphenicol preparations {{was carried out}} in cattle {{in order to determine the}} influence of the number of muscular <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> and the concentration of the product on the level of chloramphenicol serum concentration. Results show that chloramphenicol should be injected at the dose of 22 mg/kg at multiple <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> to reach 5 μg/mL of serum which is considered to be the minimal inhibitory concentration...|$|R

30|$|The {{patients}} {{received a}} total of 500  U of Dysport (BTX-A) injections into the bilateral masseter and temporalis muscles with the injection ratio of 3 to 2, respectively. Before injections, patients were asked to clench their jaws to make the <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> more prominent. Using multiple injection technique, each masseter and temporalis muscle had three <b>injection</b> <b>sites,</b> with diffusion of approximately 1  cm apart from each sites. The treated patients were followed up by a dentist highly experienced in the TMD treatment.|$|R
25|$|These {{modifications}} {{have been}} used to create two types of insulin analogs: those that are more readily absorbed from the <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> and therefore act faster than natural insulin injected subcutaneously, intended to supply the bolus level of insulin needed at mealtime (prandial insulin); and those that are released slowly over a period of between 8 and 24 hours, intended to supply the basal level of insulin during the day and particularly at nighttime (basal insulin). The first insulin analog approved for human therapy (insulin Lispro rDNA) was manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{can also}} be {{administered}} alternatively via subcutaneous injection, with the aqueous formulation Prolutex in Europe being intended specifically for once-daily administration by this route. This formulation is rapidly absorbed and {{has been found to}} result in higher serum peak progesterone levels relative to intramuscular oil formulations. In addition, subcutaneous injection of progesterone is considered to be easier, safer (less risk of <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> reactions), and less painful relative to intramuscular injection. The terminal half-life of this formulation is 13 to 18hours, which is similar to the terminal half-lives of OMP and intramuscular progesterone.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, change in taste, thinned or brittle hair, {{pain in the}} joints of the arms or legs lasting two to three days, changes in {{the color of the}} nails, and {{tingling}} in the hands or toes. More serious side effects such as unusual bruising or bleeding, pain/redness/swelling at the <b>injection</b> <b>site,</b> hand-foot syndrome, change in normal bowel habits for more than two days, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, shortness of breath, severe exhaustion, skin rash, facial flushing, female infertility by ovarian damage, and chest pain can also occur.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one 5 to 18 day old calves were {{administered}} 11 mg chloramphenicol in propylene glycol per kg body weight intramuscularly twice daily for three days.

Serum, kidney, analyzed for the drug using a quantitative gas chromatographic method with a detection limit of five parts per billion. After five days of withdrawal, chloramphenicol was detected in all the <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> and in 6 out of 16 of the other samples. After 21 days of withdrawal, chloramphenicol was detected in all the <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> and in one each of the serum, liver and muscle samples. After 42 days of withdrawal, chloramphenicol was detected in the <b>injection</b> <b>sites</b> only, and after 70 days of withdrawal it was not detected {{in any of the}} samples...|$|R

25|$|Da Vinci's Inquest was {{loosely based}} on the real life {{experiences}} of Larry Campbell, the former chief coroner of Vancouver, British Columbia, who was elected mayor of that city in 2002. The part of Da Vinci, however, was written specifically for actor Nicholas Campbell. Elements of the series storylines were also taken from sociopolitical issues faced by Vancouver itself, such as {{the plight of the}} homeless, the controversy over a designated <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> for drug users, the idea of establishing a red light district, and the disappearance of homeless women and sex workers-similar to the case of Robert Pickton.|$|E
25|$|Routes of {{administration}} that progesterone {{has been used}} by include oral, intranasal, transdermal/topical, vaginal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous injection. Oral progesterone {{has been found to be}} inferior to vaginal and intramuscular progesterone in terms of absorption (low) and clearance rate (rapid). Intravaginal progesterone is available in the forms of progesterone gel, rings, and suppositories or pessaries. Advantages of intravaginal progesterone over oral administration include high bioavailability, rapid absorption, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, sustained plasma concentrations, and a local endometrial effect, while advantages of intravaginal progesterone relative to intramuscular injection include greater convenience and lack of local <b>injection</b> <b>site</b> pain.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture needles {{during this}} period were much thicker than most modern ones and often {{resulted}} in infection. Infection {{is caused by a}} lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time. Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a cauterizing effect at the <b>injection</b> <b>site.</b> Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.|$|E
