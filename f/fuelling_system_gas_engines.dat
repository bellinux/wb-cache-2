It is comparatively difficult to find out their changing rules and interactions, let alone the special supercharging <b>system</b> of natural <b>gas</b> <b>engine.</b> This paper is aimed to calculate and find out the internal connections among all parameters by rationally selecting parameters collected from experiences and establishing mathematical model for the supercharging thermal parameters of natural <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> based on diesel engine’s supercharging estimation method, so as to provide theoretical basis for matching the supercharging system. 1. Overview The independently developed natural <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> (NGE) in China are mostly transformed from diesel engines. Due to the change of such factors as air-fuel ratio, air inflow method and excess air coefficient, the NGE’s flow of combination gas is obviously reduced; the usable exhaust energy is decreased; the supercharging degree and supercharge pressure are naturally lowered; and meanwhile, excessive thermal load problem also comes along comparing with diesel engine under the same working condition. Therefore, the major supercharging thermal parameters of the engin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A steam biomass {{gasification}} {{process has}} been demonstrated in Güssing, AT. The {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant has a fuel capacity of 8 MW and an electrical output of about 2 MWel with an electrical efficiency of about 25 %. Wood chips with a water content of 20 - 30 % are used as fuel. The plant consists of a dual fluidized bed steam gasifier, a two stage <b>gas</b> cleaning <b>system,</b> a <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> with an electricity generator, and a heat utilization system. The start up of the plant was in January 2002 and until September 2002 2500 hours of operation with the gasifier and the <b>gas</b> cleaning <b>system</b> and 750 hours of operation with the <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> could be reached. The overall performance of the CHP plant is very good, however, some minor problems had to be solved. The most important parts operate quite well only the cooler of the producer gas had to be improved. In Austria and also in other European countries there are currently good conditions for an economical operation of an CHP-plant based on biomass due to high prices for green electricity.

Of the major <b>systems</b> the <b>gas</b> turbine <b>engine</b> is a fixed design offered by a manufacturer, and the steam turbine is also a fairly standard design available from a manufacturer, but it may be somewhat customized for the project. In contrast, the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) offers many different design options, and its design is highly customized and integrated with the steam turbine. The objective of this project is to parametrically investigate the design and cost of the HRSG system, and to demonstrate the impact on the overall cost of electricity (COE) of a {{combined cycle}} power plant. There are numerous design parameters that can affect the size and complexity of the HRSG, and it is the plan for the project to identify all the important parameters and to evaluate each. For this study, the design parameter chosen for evaluation is the exhaust gas pressure drop across the HRSG. This parameter affects the performance of both the gas turbine and steam turbine {{and the size of the}} heat recovery unit. Single-pressure, two-pressure and three-pressure HRSGs are all investigated, with the tradeoffs between design point size, performance and cost evaluated for each system. A genetic algorithm is used in the design optimization process to minimize the investment cost of the HSRG. Several system level metrics are employed to evaluate a design. They are gas turbine net power, steam turbine net power, fuel consumption of the power plant, net cycle efficiency of the power plant, HRSG investment cost, total investment cost of the power plant and the operating cost measured by the cost of electricity (COE).
