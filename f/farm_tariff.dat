However, his actions in implementing conscription hurt his party's already-weak support in Quebec, while the Winnipeg General Strike and <b>farm</b> <b>tariffs</b> made him unpopular among labour and farmers alike. The party was defeated by the Liberals, led by William Lyon Mackenzie King. Meighen was personally defeated in Portage la Prairie, with his party nationally falling to third place behind the newly formed Progressive Party.|$|R

On the issues of black urbanisation, the regulation of nonwhite labour, influx control, social security, <b>farm</b> <b>tariffs,</b> and nonwhite taxation the United Party's policy remained contradictory and confused. Its traditional bases of support not only took mutually exclusive positions, but found themselves increasingly at odds with each other. Smuts' reluctance to consider South African foreign policy against the mounting tensions of the Cold War also stirred up discontent, while the nationalists promised to purge the state and public service of communist sympathisers.|$|R

The Doha negotiators deal with processed food roughly three times more often than with farm products per se. Moreover, the high "agricultural" tariffs {{in the developed countries}} are concentrated in processed food.

50|$|The Doha round aims to cut trade {{barriers}} {{across a wide}} range of sectors and is supposed {{to address the needs of}} developing countries, for whom agriculture is a particularly sensitive topic. Developing countries say farm trade needs to be tackled first because it is so important to their economies and because it is heavily protected in many rich countries. The 25-nation European Union, in particular, has been under fire for not making further cuts to its <b>farm</b> <b>tariffs</b> and subsidies. A series of meetings between ministers has failed to break the deadlock. The EU says equal attention needs to be paid to manufactured goods, which far outweigh agriculture's importance in global trade.|$|R
30|$|Existing support {{policies}} for large-scale wind power integration are inadequate. They focus mainly on wind <b>farm</b> <b>tariffs,</b> grid access subsidies and cost sharing, {{rather than on}} obligations and conflicts of interest. Accommodating wind power in the national power system requires not only technical solutions but also reforms in management, policies and regulations. The National Energy Administration initiated a wind power grid integration and accommodation study showing that China could achieve a wind energy economic potential of 160 GW to 200 GW by 2020, by optimising systematic power development plans, encouraging appropriate deployment of pump storage capacity and gas power peak adjustment, as well as rational development of inter-province power transmission. To achieve this potential, administrative co-ordination needs to be strengthened to increase the provincial capacity of wind power accommodation and promote long-distance inter-provincial and inter-regional transmission of wind power.|$|R

40|$|The Doha Round must be {{concluded}} {{not because it}} will produce dramatic liberalization but because it will create greater security of market access. Its conclusion would strengthen, symbolically and substantively, the WTO’s valuable role in restraining protectionism in the current downturn. What {{is on the table}} would constrain the scope for tariff protection in all goods, ban agricultural export subsidies in the industrial countries and sharply reduce the scope for distorting domestic support - by 70 per cent in the EU and 60 per cent in the US. Average <b>farm</b> <b>tariffs</b> that exporters face would fall to 12 per cent (from 14. 5 per cent) and the tariffs on exports of manufactures to less than 2. 5 per cent (from about 3 per cent). There are also environmental benefits to be captured, in particular disciplining the use of subsidies that encourage over-fishing and lowering tariffs on technologies that can help mitigate global warming. An agreement to facilitate trade by cutting red tape will further expand trade opportunities. Greater market access for the least-developed countries will result from the"duty free and quota free"proposal and their ability to take advantage of new opportunities will be enhanced by the Doha-related"aid for trade"initiative. Finally, concluding Doha would create space for multilateral cooperation on critical policy matters that lie outside the Doha Agenda, most urgently the trade policy implications of climate change mitigation.

40|$|The Doha Round discussions {{have started}} again in Geneva. But, the many missed {{deadlines}} {{during the last}} six years are taking their toll. They have created such a pessimistic mood that few people do bother to look at the facts, hence to realize that there is an attractive package within reach. This note describes this package and analyzes it. In a nutshell, the three major types of trade barriers – tariffs on industrial goods and on agricultural products, domestic support in agriculture – would converge to a roughly similar level (12 - 15 percent). A key mandate of the Hong Kong Ministerial – the “equivalent level of ambition ” between liberalization in industrial and agricultural products – would be met. DCs exporters would get what they asked for decades. ACs exporters would get what they asked for during the last decade. If things are fine on average, there are still efforts to be done for the highest tariffs. People believe {{that we live in a}} world of moderate tariffs. But there are still a notable number of scandalously high tariffs – up to 400 percent in Europe, 700 percent in Japan, several thousands of percent in many developing countries. Economic analysis shows that cutting these hight tariffs is by far the largest source of the welfare gains for the consumers. As most of the high tariffs protect agricultural products, consumers tend to back off because they often support small farmers. But the term “agriculture ” is a misnomer. The Doha negotiators deal with processed food roughly three times more often than with farm products per se. Moreover, the high “agricultural ” tariffs in the developed countries are concentrated in processed food.

5000|$|The Kennedy Round officially {{opened on}} May 4, 1964, at the Palais des Nations. It {{was the last}} GATT round to have tariff {{reduction}} as its primary focus. However, {{it was the first}} GATT round to deal with non-tariff issues, such as dumping, a practice whereby a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it charges in its home market. It notably also pioneered a [...] "linear" [...] style of negotiations. In contrast to the item-by-item negotiations of previous GATT rounds, many countries offered across-the-board cuts of a certain percentage on all tariffs of participating countries. Members of the so-called [...] "Bridge Club"—the United States, European Economic Community, Japan, and the UK—led the negotiations and offered linear cuts. Six other European countries joined them in linear cuts. Another 36 countries were nonlinear participators, a difference which led to tension within the negotiations, as linear countries often felt nonlinear countries had no right to participate in the [...] "confrontation and justice" [...] procedure for dealing with proposed exceptions. Thus, although the Kennedy Administration had originally contemplated finishing the round in six months, the round was plagued with delays and slow progress. In addition to the linear and nonlinear divides, disputes arose over agricultural policy and tariff disparities. The United States wanted Europe to agree to cut <b>farm</b> <b>tariffs</b> before moving on to industrial tariffs, but gridlock forced the United States to relent. Only low expectations stopped the concluding agricultural agreements from being considered a disaster. Further, equivalent percentage cuts to high U.S. tariffs (18% on average) and medium EEC tariffs (12% on average [...] ) were seen to favor the United States. Since President Lyndon Johnson had little chance of success in reauthorizing the Trade Expansion Act, its July 1, 1967 deadline served as the effective deadline for the Kennedy round. After a marathon session, negotiators announced a satisfactory agreement at a midnight meeting with the press on May 15, 1967. The final agreement was signed on June 30, 1967. However, within the United States, Congress repealed several provisions of the round of global tariff cuts, hurting the future credibility of the United States in worldwide trade negotiations.|$|R

The schemes in place focus on residential scale infrastructure by having limits that effectively exclude larger scale developments such as wind <b>farms.</b> Feed-in <b>tariffs</b> schemes in Australia started at a premium, but have mechanisms by which the price paid for electricity decreases over time to be equivalent or below the commercial rate.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} two {{scenarios that}} considered {{a reduction of}} the US aggregate measure of supports (AMS) payments by 60 % over a five-year period. In the first scenario, which considered a unilateral action by the US, the targeted AMS payments reduction would require a 12 % cut in the US target price and an 8 % cut in the loan rate. This {{would lead to a}} 3 % decline in US cotton production, a 3 % rise in world cotton price, and a 26 % decline in US cotton net farm income {{at the end of the}} implementation period. The second scenario analyzed the case in which the US AMS payments reduction is concomitant with multilateral tariff and subsidy eliminations from the rest of the world. Under this scenario, fewer cuts in the US loan rate and target price (i. e. 9 and 4 %) were required to achieve the 60 % AMS reduction because of market liberalization from the from the rest of the world. However, US cotton producers' net farm income still declined by 18 %. cotton, net <b>farm</b> income, subsidies, <b>tariffs,</b> United States, WTO,...|$|R
