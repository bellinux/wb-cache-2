50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, founder Earl Stafford felt {{compelled}} to do something special for local underprivileged Americans during the 2009 presidential inauguration festivities. His initial idea was simple: host an inaugural event at a Washington, D.C. hotel suite {{for those who would}} otherwise not be able to attend: the homeless, victims of abuse, wounded veterans, and the poor. At the time, he imagined it would be perhaps a simple gathering of fifty to sixty locally, disadvantaged individuals. Then in October 2008, Stafford read an article about extravagant hotel packages being sold in the area and stumbled upon a larger calling - to rent the ultimate inaugural <b>hotel</b> <b>package</b> and include hundreds of disadvantaged Americans from across the country to participate in a three-day celebration of the incoming president. Days later, Stafford and TSF anonymously purchased the JW Marriott’s premier $1 million inaugural package, which included hundreds of hotel rooms, use of their grand ballroom, and access to the 12th floor terrace overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue and the inaugural parade route.|$|E

This positive development together with the increasing demand and greater concerned of Muslim travellers on matters related to Islamic hospitality services {{have led to the}} interest of hotel companies to turn into Syariah Compliant hotel practices and the concept starts spreading into the Muslim countries globally. The success of Syariah hotel from Muslim guest view could be guided by observing Islamic teachings and practise in hospitality activities. This study is a trial to explore which Islamic dimension attributes of hotels could be used as base for tailoring Syariah compliant <b>hotel</b> <b>package.</b> Four guest hotel attributes are discussed to examine the Muslim guest perceived value of Syariah compliant hotel and its association with satisfaction and word of mouth. Two major dimensions are identified which include tangible: halal and cleanliness; availability of prayer facilities, and intangible: syariah dress code; separate facilities for men and women. It is argued that these factors creates attention to perception and as such, has an implication on word of mouth. Quantitative data collections serve as an approach through questionnaires towards Syariah hotel guest. This paper conceptually discusses the attributes of the tourist in Malaysia which have attract their perception of value and how it implicates satisfaction and word of mouth...|$|E
