5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the points on the {{approaches}} to Paddington did not provide 'flank protection' (where the points beyond a signal at red are set so that a train passing the signal at red is routed so as to minimise the possible consequences). This would have meant routing a train running past SN109 at red onto the Down Relief line. This should have been considered {{at the design stage}} when it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> implement. The reasons for not doing so were not known but it was noted that the introduction of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) had been thought to be imminent. Flank protection would have increased the 'overlap' (the distance for which a train could run past the signal before fouling other lines) at SN109; the desirability of doing so should have been considered by the risk assessment which had not taken place.|$|E

500|$|The Decian {{persecution}} was a grave {{blow to the}} Church. At Carthage, {{there was}} mass apostasy (renunciation of the faith). At Smyrna, the bishop, Euctemon, sacrificed and encouraged others to do the same. Because the Church was largely urban, it should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify, isolate and destroy the Church hierarchy. This did not happen. In June 251, Decius died in battle, leaving his persecution incomplete. His persecutions were not followed up for another six years, allowing some Church functions to resume. Valerian, Decius's friend, took up the imperial mantle in 253. Though he was at first thought of as [...] "exceptionally friendly" [...] towards the Christians, his actions soon showed otherwise. In July 257, he issued a new persecutory edict. As punishment for following the Christian faith, Christians were to face exile or condemnation to the mines. In August 258, he issued a second edict, making the punishment death. This persecution also stalled in June 260, when Valerian was captured in battle. His son, Gallienus (r. 26068), ended the persecution and inaugurated nearly 40 years of freedom from official sanctions, praised by Eusebius as the [...] "little peace of the Church". The peace would be undisturbed, save for occasional, isolated persecutions, until Diocletian became emperor.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Grilled Cheesus", {{when members}} of the glee club are singing songs about {{religion}} and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital. Murphy stated that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> have Kurt, an atheist, sing an anti-religion song, but instead chose to have him sing about love. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of this song choice. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News said he [...] "found it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing 'I wanna be your man' about his father", but Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, which Semigran named her favorite number of the episode. In [...] "Special Education", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] from Evita; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song. Both Colfer's and Michele's versions were released as singles, available for digital download, although neither appears on an album.

The film premiered in Mexico on January 1, 2015, as it was distributed by Universal Pictures with about 1,000 copies. Espinosa and Pérez received positive reviews for their performances from Jessica Oliva of Cine Premiere magazine, who stated that the actors [...] "seem to blend in with their characters. Sofía Espinosa stands out with her voice (singing all the songs), and her physical interpretation and charisma, while Marco Pérez, Sergio Andrade, manages to embody the duality of that genius of the industry, perverse and visionary at the same time". Sofía Ochoa Rodríguez and Verónica Sánchez of En Filme were [...] "surprised by [...] performance" [...] as it was [...] "very close to Gloria Trevi's, albeit with a nasally accent, and cadence which lets through the hoarse, sarcastic and melancholic style that permeates on every one of the songs the actress sings. Her acting work and physical resemblance let her move naturally from comedy to pain, loneliness to longing, to the easy smile, to the dance, to the jumps on stage and the twinkle in her eyes". In contrast, David Noh of Film Journal International was not impressed by Espinosa's acting, saying that she [...] "lacks appeal and is quite ordinary in a role that calls for some of the electricity the very young Jennifer Lopez managed to ratchet up in her musical biopic, Selena". Gloria Trevi praised the work of Espinosa in the film, stating that [...] "it is shocking to see yourself on film, the girl [...] did an extraordinary job". Espinosa won the Diosa de Plata and the Ariel Award for Best Actress for Gloria.|$|E

2500|$|At 17:30 of {{the same}} day, Grandi went to Palazzo Venezia; the {{official}} reason was the presentation to Mussolini {{of a new book}} about the Italian participation in the non-intervention committee in Spain. The meeting was scheduled to last 15 minutes, but at the end it was prolonged until 18:45. Waiting to be received by the Duce were the Chief of Police and the German Feldmarschall Kesselring. In his memoirs written one year later, Mussolini denied that he spoke with Grandi about the OdG, but this is not credible. It is apparent that Grandi, who loved the Duce, explained to him the consequences of his OdG, giving him a last chance to save face and resign before the vote. In that case, the Grand Council’s meeting would have been superfluous. Mussolini listened while Grandi was explaining the necessity to resign to avoid a catastrophe, but at the end rebuked him saying that his conclusions were wrong, since Germany was about to produce a decisive secret weapon. After that, Mussolini met Kesselring and the Chief of Police, Chierici: to the latter he confided that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> bring Grandi, Bottai and Ciano back to the fold, as they were eager to be persuaded by him. On the morning of 23 July Mussolini accepted the resignation of Cini: {{this was supposed to be}} a signal to his opponents. At the same time, at Federzoni's home, Grandi, Federzoni, de Marsico (one of the best jurists in Italy), Bottai and Ciano modified the OdG, removing the interpretative introduction which explained the functions of the Grand Council. Here they demonstrated that the assembly had the constitutional power to remove Mussolini. In fact, according to the constitutionalists, the [...] "Leggi Fascistissime" [...] of December 1925 bent the Constitution, but did not break it. Because of these laws, the Duce ruled the country on behalf of the King, who remained always the source of the executive power. Because of that, if the Grand Council, which was the trait d'union between Fascism and the state, passed a vote of no confidence on the dictator, the King would have been entitled to remove him and nominate his successor. In that occasion Ciano was acquainted with the OdG by Bottai: Grandi was reluctant to accept him, since he was the son-in-law of Mussolini and was known for his superficial and inconstant character, but Ciano insisted, unaware that this decision would have provoked his death six months later in Verona. After that, Grandi had as a guest at his office in the parliament Farinacci, showing him his OdG. Farinacci told Grandi that he accepted the first part of the document, but that he did not agree at all on the rest: the military powers had to be given to the Germans, and Italy should start to fight the war seriously, getting rid of Mussolini and the generals. At the end he, like Scorza, asked him for a copy of his OdG, and like Scorza he used it to produce another OdG of his own. In the time left before the meeting, Grandi contacted other participants asking them to join his action.|$|E
