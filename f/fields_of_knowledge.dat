The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E

25|$|Humans {{are uniquely}} adept at using systems of {{symbolic}} communication (such as language and art) for self-expression and {{the exchange of}} ideas, and for organizing themselves into purposeful groups. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which together {{form the basis of}} human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena (or events) has provided the foundation for developing science, philosophy, mythology, religion, anthropology, and numerous other <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E

500|$|The German British {{mathematician}} Walter Ledermann {{described in}} his memoir how he as an assistant in Mathematics met biology professor Thompson at St Andrews in the mid 1930s and how Thompson [...] "was fond of exercising his skills as an amateur of mathematics", that [...] "he used quite sophisticated mathematical methods to elucidate the shapes {{that occur in the}} living world" [...] and [...] "differential equations, a subject which evidently lay outside d'Arcy Thompson's <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> at that time."

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes between the original and the second version of the Art was in the visuals used. The early version used 16 figures presented as complex, complementary trees, while the system of the Ars Magna featured only four, including one which combined the other three. This figure, a [...] "Lullian Circle," [...] took the form of a paper machine operated by rotating concentrically arranged circles to combine his symbolic alphabet, which was repeated on each level. These combinations were said to show all possible truth about the subject of inquiry. Llull based this notion on the idea that there were a limited number of basic, undeniable truths in all <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and that everything about these <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> could be understood by studying combinations of these elemental truths.|$|E
