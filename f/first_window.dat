25|$|Around {{the same}} time the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> panes are thought to have been produced. The {{earliest}} panes were rough cast into a wooden frame on top of a layer of sand or stone, but from the late 3rd century onwards window glass was made by the muff process, where a blown cylinder was cut laterally and flattened out to produce a sheet.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time the Panorama was offered on all chassis types, {{including}} Ford R226 and Bedford VAL, looking particularly well-suited to the latter, where the chrome trim on the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> bay harmonised with the twin steering axles below. There was even a Panorama for the Bedford SB and Ford Thames 570E, although here the thickened window pillar was absent, and the chrome trim did not extend across the front of the vehicle.|$|E

Each of the three sections contains a window. The <b>first</b> <b>window</b> looks into the bedroom and a double hung two-over-two sash measuring ten inches high by eight inches wide. The second window looks into the bathroom, and is identical to the bedroom window. The third window, looking into the kitchen, is a two-over-two casement measuring ten inches high by fourteen inches wide.|$|E

25|$|The Feature Race {{used the}} grid {{determined}} in sessions {{three and four}} of the previous day's qualifying session, and was held mid-afternoon. The race began from a standing start, and was a race of approximately 180 kilometres, with a maximum time limit of 69 minutes plus one lap. Teams had to make two mandatory pit stops during the Feature Race, one between laps eight and sixteen, and another during a pit window, which was not announced until the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> has closed. Drivers were permitted eight uses of PowerBoost during the Feature Race.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 2016 Dutchman Ronald Koeman was {{appointed}} as manager under {{a three-year contract}} at reported £7 million per year. Everton later announced the signing of Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. From Aston Villa, centre midfielder Idrissa Gueye was the second signing of Koeman's <b>first</b> <b>window.</b> Young centre back John Stones was sold to Manchester City for 47.5 million pounds in August 2016 in a deal inadvertently breached on the UEFA website. Accordingly, the 31-year-old Ashley Williams was signed from Swansea City shortly after. On 15 August, Everton signed winger Yannick Bolasie on a five-year deal from Crystal Palace. Everton also signed young forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin from Sheffield United, initially for the U23 squad. McGeady was loaned out to Preston North End in the championship for the season, while Everton acquired West Ham forward Enner Valencia on a season-long loan.|$|E
25|$|Median power {{frequency}} {{is often used}} {{as a way to}} track fatigue using EMG. Using the median {{power frequency}}, raw EMG data is filtered to reduce noise and then relevant time windows are Fourier Transformed. In the case of fatigue in a 30-second isometric contraction, the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> may be the first second, the second window might be at second 15, and the third window could be the last second of contraction (at second 30). Each window of data is analyzed and the median power frequency is found. Generally, the median power frequency decreases over time, demonstrating fatigue. Some reasons why fatigue is found are due to action potentials of motor units having a similar pattern of repolarization, fast motor units activating and then quickly deactivating while slower motor units remain, and conduction velocities of the nervous system decreasing over time.|$|E

500|$|In 1878, glassmaker Richard Heagany {{organized}} a window glass plant in New York {{and was the}} factory's superintendent. That plant became the largest window glass plant in the state. [...] In 1886, he moved to Kokomo, Indiana and opened the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> glass plant {{in the region to}} use natural gas as a fuel source. Heagany's Kokomo plant lasted three years before it was destroyed by fire. Instead of rebuilding in Kokomo, he moved to Hartford City and organized the Hartford City Glass Company. The company was organized in 1890 with the financial assistance of several capitalists. Production began in early 1891 after the plant was constructed. Heagany was the plant manager until his retirement in 1899.|$|E
500|$|The Rev. Robert Brickel, Rector of St. Michael's Church, Hoole from 1848–1881, {{raised money}} by public {{subscription}} in Lancashire, Oxford and Cambridge {{to fund the}} creation of a new chancel and sanctuary to the church to be named [...] "The Horrocks Chapel". The chancel was completed by 1824, and the sanctuary by 1858. The vestry was extended in 1998–1999, and the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> in the north wall, originally installed in 1872, has stained glass roundels commemorating the transits of Venus of 1874 and 2004. There is also a marble tablet commemorating Horrocks. The church clock, contributed by the parishioners as their commemoration of Horrocks, was installed in 1859; the sundial, installed in 1875, has a quotation from Horrocks ("Sine Sole Sileo") that translates as [...] "Without the sun I am silent".|$|E

2500|$|The website also notes, [...] "The colours address our vital {{consciousness}} directly, {{because they}} tell of optimism, hope and delight in life", says Monsignor Klaus Mayer, who imparts Chagall's work in mediations and books. He corresponded with Chagall during 1973, and succeeded in persuading the [...] "master of colour and the biblical message" [...] {{to create a}} sign for Jewish-Christian attachment and international understanding. Centuries earlier Mainz had been [...] "the capital of European Jewry", and contained the largest Jewish community in Europe, notes historian John Man. In 1978, {{at the age of}} 91, Chagall created the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> and eight more followed. Chagall's collaborator Charles Marq complemented Chagall's work by adding several stained glass windows using the typical colours of Chagall.|$|E
2500|$|An {{adjoining}} office, also locked, has {{the oldest}} stained {{glass in the}} church, a depiction of Jesus preaching the Sermon on the Mount installed in 1872. [...] Its style suggests it {{is the work of}} Clayton and Bell. [...] The three-light south transept window (St Oswald, St George and St Edmund) is by Kempe and Co, 1916. [...] The south aisle's <b>first</b> <b>window</b> by Charles Eamer Kempe, 1898, shows the Annunciation. [...] The second window, designed by Mary Lowndes and produced by James Powell and Sons in 1891, is on the theme [...] "Suffer the little children to come unto me" [...] (Mark 10:14). [...] Finally the west window, which is not accessible to the public, depicts St Michael, St George and St Raphael. [...] It was made in 1896 and is once again the work of Charles Eamer Kempe.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of these factors, the cost of {{production}} was reduced and glass became available for a wider section of society in a growing variety of forms. By the mid-1st century AD this meant that glass vessels had moved from a valuable, high-status commodity, to a material commonly available: “a [...] drinking cup could be bought for a copper coin” (Strabo, Geographica XVI.2). This growth also saw the production of the first glass tesserae for mosaics, and the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> glass, as furnace technology improved allowing molten glass to be produced for the first time. At the same time, the expansion of the empire also brought an influx of people and an expansion of cultural influences that resulted in the adoption of eastern decorative styles. The changes {{that took place in the}} Roman glass industry during this period can therefore be seen as {{a result of}} three primary influences: historical events, technical innovation and contemporary fashions. They are also linked to the fashions and technologies developed in the ceramic trade, from which a number of forms and techniques were drawn.|$|E

2500|$|The Plaxton coach range which {{appeared}} at the 1964 Commercial Motor Show had been extensively revised with assistance from the Ogle design consultancy. Waistrails were virtually straight, and rooflines distinctly shallower. On the new Panorama (later to become Panorama I), a wide chrome trim band wrapped around the front and encompassed the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> bay on either side. The trim then swept upwards to the roof line and neatly terminated on the air scoop at the roof line. The window pillar on the first bay was noticeably thicker than the others and {{gave the impression of}} size that managed to enhance the appearance of the whole vehicle. The front grill was revised and basically split in two horizontally. Twin headlights were on each side of a panel that contained ventilation louvres at the top with the lower part being the actual grill that spanned the width of the vehicle. This grill was to become standard with little change until the Supreme IV of 1978. Again a bit of a Plaxton that was instantly recognisable and a familiar sight throughout Britain. The rear featured two large 9" [...] circular rear lights each side arranged vertically, and the entrance door was now the forward in-swinging type.|$|E
2500|$|St Peter's Church {{is notable}} {{for the quality}} of its stained glass, which {{includes}} work by some of the best-known designers in late 19th-century and early 20th-century England. [...] In the north aisle the second window, depicting Fortitude and Charity, was produced c. 1907 by the firm of James Powell and Sons, and the <b>first</b> <b>window</b> (St Luke and St Paul) was designed by the Sussex artist Charles Eamer Kempe in 1903. [...] The north transept's north window was made in 1928 by Kempe and Co after Kempe's death; its east window (Madonna and Child, and St Nicholas with children) by Frederick Charles Eden, a Brighton man, in 1935. [...] In the Parham chapel, the north window is full of local interest, its five lights depicting Lancelot Andrewes, St Richard of Chichester, St Peter (the dedicatee of the church), St Wilfrid (whom Gibbon called the Apostle of Sussex), and St Augustine of Canterbury. [...] It was produced by Kempe and Co in 1920. [...] The chapel's east window, in four lights, is a 1921 work by Geoffrey Fuller Webb. [...] It shows the Captain of the Host of the Lord appearing to Joshua before Jericho (Joshua 5:13–15), and St John the Divine writing about the Holy City.|$|E

60|$|Just in Bell Alley, on {{the right}} hand of the passage, there was a more terrible cry than that, {{though it was not}} so {{directed}} out at the window; but the whole family was in a terrible fright, and I could hear women and children run screaming about the rooms like distracted, when a garret-window opened and somebody from a window on the other side the alley called and asked, 'What is the matter?' upon which, from the <b>first</b> <b>window,</b> it was answered, 'Oh Lord, my old master has hanged himself!' The other asked again, 'Is he quite dead?' and the first answered, 'Ay, ay, quite dead; quite dead and cold!' This person was a merchant and a deputy alderman, and very rich.
