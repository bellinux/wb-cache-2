5|$|In 2008, {{cervical}} cancer was the third-most common cancer in women worldwide, with rates varying geographically {{from less than}} one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. It is {{a leading cause of}} cancer-related death in poor countries, where <b>delayed</b> <b>diagnosis</b> leading to poor outcomes is common. The introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) {{cervical cancer}}, however this has mainly taken place in developed countries. Most developing countries have limited or no screening, and 85% of the global burden occurring there.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. <b>Delayed</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after <b>delayed</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{effective}} treatment and education efforts, leprosy stigma {{continues to be}} problematic in endemic developing countries.

25|$|Affected {{individuals}} experience {{shame and}} embarrassment, fail to maintain relationships, avoid contact {{with people who}} comment on their condition, and are obsessive about masking the odour with hygiene products and even smoking.

When the condition is suspected or known to occur in a family, genetic testing can be helpful in identifying the specific individuals who have or carry the disorder.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare patient <b>delay,</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>delay</b> and {{treatment}} delay in breast cancer patients of selected public and private health centers in Tehran, Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, female patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in a public medical complex and a private breast clinic within one year were included. Patient delay was considered positive, if the interval between the detection of the first symptom by the patient and the first visit to a health care provider took longer than one month. <b>Delay</b> in <b>diagnosis</b> was defined as the period of more than one week between the first medical visit for the symptoms and the diagnosis of breast cancer. Following the confirmed diagnosis of breast malignancy, if the medical treatment was initiated later than one week, treatment delay had occurred. The potential reasons for patient, <b>diagnosis</b> and treatment <b>delay</b> according to the patients’ reports were also recorded. Results: Overall, 385 patients were included of whom 52. 7 % were recruited from the public hospitals and 47. 3 % from a private clinic. The prevalence of patient <b>delay,</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>delay</b> and treatment delay were 31. 7 %, 17. 9 % and 28. 3 %, respectively. Patient delay was significantly more common among patients with lower socio-economic status and those recruited from the public hospitals. All the patients with <b>diagnosis</b> <b>delay</b> were in the group recruited from the public hospitals. Conclusions: Gaps between women of different socio-economic levels of the society need to be addressed in order to decrease patient, <b>diagnosis</b> and treatment <b>delay.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} critical care for obstetrical hemorrhage, especially in cases of uterine inversion. Study Design. We extracted data for six patients diagnosed with uterine inversion concerning resuscitation. Results. The shock index on admission of the six patients was 1. 6 or more on admission. Four of the six experienced <b>delay</b> in <b>diagnosis</b> and received inadequate fluid replacement. Five of the six experienced delay in transfer. Five of the six underwent simultaneous blood transfusion on admission, and the remaining patient experienced a delay of 30 minutes. All six patients successfully underwent uterine replacement soon after admission.

25|$|Considering {{the many}} signs and symptoms, the {{generally}} <b>delayed</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> {{and the possibility}} of residual complaints after treatment, it is little wonder that a significant number of people with Graves' disease have difficulty keeping their job. One study found that of 303 patients successfully treated for hyperthyroidism (77% had Graves' disease) 53% dealt with lack of energy. About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent mental problems. In their 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted disability pensions on the basis of intellectual dysfunction. Between 2006 and 2008, Ponto et al. surveyed 250 Graves' disease patients. Of these, 36% were written off sick and 5% even had to take early retirement. In the same study, 34% of 400 questioned physicians reported treating patients with fully impaired earning capacity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of {{cervical}} spine injury has grave {{consequences for}} the victim. About one in 20 cervical fractures are missed and about two-thirds of these patients have further spinal-cord damage as a result. About 30% of cases of <b>delayed</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of cervical spine injury develop permanent neurological deficits. In high-level cervical injuries, total paralysis from the neck can result. High-level tetraplegics (C4 and higher) will likely need constant care and assistance in activities of daily living, such as getting dressed, eating and bowel and bladder care. Low-level tetraplegics (C5 to C7) can often live independently.|$|E
