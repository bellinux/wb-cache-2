40|$|Abstract. The <b>deliming</b> {{experiment}} of limed pelt for leather-making {{was carried}} out by means of formic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, citrate acid, Nylon acid, gluconic acid and other nitrogen-free materials. The impacts of the pH of <b>deliming</b> liquid and the content of calcium ion in the <b>deliming</b> liquid on the <b>deliming</b> effect were investigated. In order to further improve the <b>deliming</b> effect of the material, the nitrogen-free organic acids above were subjected to composite research, wherein the results thereof showed that the <b>deliming</b> values of sulfosalicylic acid, formic acid and citrate acid were relatively high, the <b>deliming</b> abilities were relatively strong, but the buffer during the <b>deliming</b> process was not obvious; the <b>deliming</b> values of Nylon acid and gluconic acid were not relatively high, but the <b>deliming</b> process had a certain buffer; and the <b>deliming</b> effect of composite formic acid and gluconic acid was very good.

50|$|However, most tribes, {{regardless}} of their mixed heritage, tend to claim some form of Arab ancestry, as this has been key to achieving social status. Many (the so-called chorfa tribes) will also claim descendancy from the Prophet Muhammad himself. In any case, no tribal identity is cut in stone, and over the centuries {{a great deal of}} intermarriage and tribal re-affiliation has occurred to blur former ethnic/cultural lines; groups have often seamlessly re-identified to higher status identities, after achieving the military or economic strength to defeat former rulers. This was, for example, the case of the largest of the Sahrawi tribes, the Reguibat. A Berber-descended zawiya (scholarly) tribe who in the 18th century took up camel nomadism and warrior traditions, they simultaneously took on more and more of an Arab identity, reflecting their new position alongside the traditional warrior castes of Arab Hassane origin, such as the Oulad <b>Delim</b> and the Arabic-speaking tribes of the Tekna confederation.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was concerned with}} the concentration of residual chromium tanning liquor by evaporative techniques and the re-use of this concentrated chromium liquor for tannage after adjustment with a makeup of basic chromium sulphate powder. Twelve samples of the residual chromium liquors were collected randomly from ALNASR and the White Nile Tanneries. They were analysed mainly for Cr 2 o 3 content, concentration of neutral salts (0 Be) and (PH). The average quantity of chromium oxide "Cr 2 o 3 " for both tanneries which discharged as waste to the drain {{was found to be}} 5. 58 g/L. This quantity is equivalent to 32 % of the chromic oxide added {{at the beginning of the}} tannage. This mean, that more or less one third of the basic chromium sulphate used in tannage is lost as waste. Then two Evaporation experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery laboratory by direct heating to determine the optimum evaporation level for maximum chromium oxide recovery. This level of evaporation was found to be about 27 % of the water, can be evaporated without much loss of chromium oxide. Then Eight tanning Experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery pilot plant in the following manner:- A residual chrome liquor (R 1) was taken from the White Nile tannery and it was evaporated to the required level (C 1). Then the chromium oxide in (C 1) was determined and was adjusted with fresh chromium powder to maintain the tanning percentage to 7 %. Then it was used to tan a <b>delimed,</b> bated, pickled pelt. The residual liquor(R 2) from (C 1) was again evaporated to (C 2). Then the chromium oxide in (C 2) was determined and adjusted to the required level with fresh chromium powder. Then it was used to tan a <b>delimed,</b> bated, pickled pelt. This process was repeated eight times untill (C 8) and (R 9). The average quantity of basic chromium sulphate required to be added as a make-up was found to be 4. 9 %. That means 2. 1 % of basic chromium sulphate is saved all through the year, in addition to the following savings:- 1) 4 % in the sodium chloride 2) 60 - 70 % in the water 3) 0. 1 - 0. 2 % in the sulphuric Acid Then four pelts tanned with (C 8), (C 7), (C 6) plus one side from the White Nile Tannery were retanned as usual and they were paste- Dried. Then they were tested for their physical and chemical properties and the results obtained were found to be within the accepted international limits. The economical evaluation of the project was found to be feasible. The annual profit was found to be 33767 US$ and the pay-back period was found to be about 1. 3 year. As with regard to the environmental evaluation and since the process is a closed loop process, then appendix (5) proves that the salinity will be reduced by 25 %, the toxicity by 24 %, the B. O. D by 1. 2 % and the C. O. D by 1 %, from the total pollution load of the tannery. Hence this process is an eco-friendly process, in addition to the reduction in cost of the end of pipe treatment...|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} 50  years, Sahrawi social {{relations}} and political organization have undergone {{no less than}} a revolution. Major social and political change commenced with colonialism and war and culminated with exile {{and the creation of}} a Sahrawi nation-state, the SADR (see footnote h). Historically, the Sahrawi were organized politically in tribes, where several inhabited the traditional territories (e.g. Reguibat, Izarguien, Oulad <b>Delim,</b> Oulad Tidrarin, etc.; see Briggs [1960]; Pazzanita [2006 a], [b]) in a segmentary system that further subdivided each tribe into branches based on extended families and other kinship ties (Hart [1998]; Caro Baroja [1955]). Tribal relations determined access to pasture where each tribe controlled a customary nomadic area. Decision-making institutions and networks of mutual support functioned along tribal lines and especially within branches (Caratini [1989]). The tribes of Western Sahara continuously interacted through trade, war, raids, agreements of mutual access to each other’s customary areas (e.g. with drought), alliances, tribute payments, etc. Although this political organization was disrupted with colonialism, it was in the mid- 1970 s that it was completely overturned by events: with exile and the establishment of the camps, the Polisario banned tribes and reorganized the Sahrawi under a newly declared nation-state in which each refugee became a citizen of the SADR and pledged allegiance to the Polisario, which controls and grants refugees access to the liberated territories and manages food aid (Wilson [2012]; Caratini [2003]). While kinship continues to have considerable importance among contemporary Sahrawi, tribal affiliation gave way to Polisario allegiance, and the Polisario Front de facto assumed the functions previously assumed by tribes and extended this to incorporate other functions of the modern nation-state, e.g. international political representation. Among Sahrawi refugees, social relations have been established and/or reformulated around camel husbandry on the basis of kinship (e.g. between refugees and nomads) and on Polisario governance (e.g. for access to the liberated territories).|$|R
