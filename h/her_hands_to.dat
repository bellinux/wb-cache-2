25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the campus}} {{buildings}} serve an academic, research, or administrative purpose. Exceptions are the Rita Atkinson Residences, which houses 450 graduate students in a nine-story, two-tower structure, and the Club Med dining facility {{at the base of}} the telemedicine building. The campus features two Stuart Collection works. Terrace, by Jackie Ferrara, consists of three tiled terraces which flow into one another to connect both wings of the Cellular and Molecular Medicine facility. It is the ninth work in the collection. The fourteenth work, Standing by Kiki Smith, is a nude bronze woman raised on a concrete eucalyptus trunk trickling water from <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> its roots. It was the artist's first permanent outdoor sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the mass}} killing of Khojaly {{inhabitants}} was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist Chingiz Mustafayev. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight {{to the scene of}} the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how he looked out of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot in their heads, and the little girl in her last move was stretching out <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his camera, but after recovering from the shock started filming. However, the helicopter came under the fire, and they had to leave.|$|E

25|$|Golaud {{is lying}} in bed with Mélisande at the bedside. He is wounded, having fallen from his horse while hunting. The horse {{suddenly}} bolted for no reason as the clock struck twelve. Mélisande bursts into tears and says she feels ill and unhappy in the castle. She wants to go away with Golaud. He asks her the reason for her unhappiness but she refuses to say. When he asks her if the problem is Pelléas, she replies {{that he is not}} the cause but she does not think he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: Pelléas can behave oddly and he is still very young. Mélisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today {{was the first time she}} saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, Mélisande claims she dropped it in a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold. Golaud orders her to go and search for it at once before the tide comes in, even though night has fallen. When Mélisande replies that she is afraid to go alone, Golaud tells her to take Pelléas along with her.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>to</b> always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

500|$|A.C. Bradley notes that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the scene's few closing lines, the scene is entirely in prose with Lady Macbeth being the only major character in Shakespearean tragedy to make a last appearance [...] "denied the dignity of verse." [...] According to Bradley, Shakespeare generally assigned prose to characters exhibiting abnormal states of mind or abnormal conditions such as somnambulism, with the regular rhythm of verse being inappropriate to characters having lost their balance of mind or subject to images or impressions with no rational connection. Lady Macbeth's recollections – the blood on her hand, the striking of the clock, her husband's reluctance – are brought forth from her disordered mind in chance order with each image deepening her anguish. For Bradley, Lady Macbeth's [...] "brief toneless sentences seem the only voice of truth" [...] with the spare and simple construction of the character's diction expressing a [...] "desolating misery." [...] Lady Macbeth's compulsive washing of <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> rid them of blood is reminiscent of hand washing common among sufferers from Obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{eventually}} the Mackenzies {{gained control of}} Lewis some islanders still resisted, notably Neil MacLeod and Dòmhnall Cam. Around this time tradition has it that Dòmhnall Cam fortified himself on a [...] high promontory of jagged rock on the sea-coast near Mangursta (or Mangersta, Scottish Gaelic: Mangarstadh). Today the stack still bears his name: Stac Dhòmhnaill Chaim. Tradition has it that Dòmhnall Cam's daughter, Anna Mhòr ("Big Anne") carried water to her father on her head, as she needed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> climb the cliffs.|$|E

She then pledged the gold bracelets on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the saint, purchasing olive trees with them. Subsequently others made pledges as well, and at present he [...] has four hundred olive trees. This episode of the woman took place about sixty years ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Polish medium Stanisława Tomczyk {{active in}} the early 20th century claimed {{to be able to}} perform various acts of telekinesis, such as levitating objects, by way of an entity she called [...] "Little Stasia". A {{photograph}} of her taken in 1909, which shows a pair of scissors [...] "floating" [...] in between her hands, is often found in books and other publications as an example of telekinesis. Scientists suspected Tomczyk performed her feats by the use of a fine thread or hair, running between <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> lift and suspend the objects in the air. This was confirmed when psychical researchers who tested Tomczyk occasionally observed the thread.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{with good}} backup {{from the rest}} of the defenders, {{stopping}} attacks can prove very difficult if the goalkeeper remains in the middle of the goal. The most defensible position is along a semicircular line connecting the goalposts and extending out in the centre. Depending on the ball carrier's location, the goalkeeper is positioned along that semicircle roughly a metre out of the goal to reduce the attacker's shooting angle. The goalkeeper stops using his or <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> tread water once the opponent enters at about the 7 metre mark and starts to lift their upper body using the eggbeater technique to prepare to block the shot. Finally the goalkeeper tries to block the ball down, which is often hard for the longer reaches, but prevents an offensive rebound and second shot. As is the case with other defensive players, a goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an attacker in position to score can be charged with a penalty shot for the other team. The goalkeeper can also be ejected for twenty seconds if a major foul is committed. [...] Also inside the five metre mark, the goalie can swing at the ball with a closed fist without being penalised.|$|E
2500|$|The {{execution}} {{was performed}} in the square of Hötorget in Stockholm the 5 August 1676. Malin Matsdotter was to be executed alongside Anna [...] "Annika" [...] Simonsdotter Hack, known as [...] "Tysk-Annika", who had also been accused {{and sentenced to death}} on the testimony of her own children, but was to be executed the normal way by decapitation before burning. The contrast between the behavior of the two have been noted. Anna Simonsdotter was described as full humility and respect and behaved as was expected by her, and though she did not directly say that she was guilty, she behaved as was expected of her, and [...] "by her remorse, by her psalms, and by falling on her knees and lifting her head and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the sky, confirmed the justice in the verdict and the justice in the world". According to contemporary witnesses, Malin Matsdotter behaved with great dignity and courage during her execution. When asked to take the hand of her daughter to make peace with her before death, she refused. She [...] "did not seem to fear death much, courageously mounting the stake", and even the official execution protocol noted that she [...] "was very tough".|$|E
