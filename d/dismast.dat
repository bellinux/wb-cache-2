50|$|<b>Dismasting</b> {{occurs to}} a sailing ship when {{one or more}} of the masts {{responsible}} for hoisting the sails that propel the vessel is broken or overturned, but the hull itself is still upright and seaworthy. <b>Dismasting</b> usually occurs as the result of high winds during a storm acting upon masts, sails, rigging, and spars. <b>Dismasting</b> does not necessarily impair the vessel's ability to stay afloat, but rather its ability to move under sail power.|$|R

6000|$|Thus P- {{passed away}} from amongst the tall spars of ships {{that he had}} tried to their utmost in many a spell of boisterous weather. He had shown me what {{carrying}} on meant, but he was not a man to learn discretion from. He could not help his deafness. One can only remember his cheery temper, his admiration for the jokes in Punch, his little oddities--like his strange passion for borrowing looking-glasses, for instance. Each of our cabins had its own looking-glass screwed to the bulkhead, and what he wanted with more of them we never could fathom. He asked for the loan in confidential tones. Why? Mystery. We made various surmises. No one will ever know now. At any rate, it was a harmless eccentricity, and may the god of gales, who took him away so abruptly between New Zealand and the Horn, let his soul rest in some Paradise of true seamen, where no amount of carrying on will ever <b>dismast</b> a ship! ...|$|E

50|$|Sibylle {{departed}} Saint-Domingue, {{along with}} the 14-gun corvette Railleur, escorting a 16-ship convoy bound for North America. On 2 January 1783, the convoy was chased by the 44-gun ship of the line HMS Endymion and the 32-gun frigates HMS Emerald and Magicienne. Kergariou-Locmaria signaled the convoy to pursue its route with the Railleur, and endeavoured to cover its retreat, first engaging Magicienne. In the ensuing exchange of fire, Kergariou-Locmaria was severely wounded, but his first officer, Morel d'Escures, took command and managed to <b>dismast</b> Magicienne. Sibylle retreated when the Endymion and Emerald intervened. Thomas Graves, who commanded Magicienne, later addressed two engravings of the battle, one representing its beginning, and the other its end.|$|E

5000|$|... 'Wearing ship' is the {{alternative}} maneuver for a square rigged ship that wishes {{to avoid the}} difficulties and hazards of tacking. Light winds, heavy seas, worn-out gear, and poor vessel or crew performance are all reasons a ship may choose to wear instead of tack. Compared to boats with a fore-and-aft rig, a square rigger can jibe without any difficulty or risk of accident. However, since these craft cannot point close to the wind, they may {{find it difficult to}} maintain turning and forward momentum as the bow passes through the large No-go zone. If the ship loses steering way, it can be 'taken aback,' with the wind pressing on the forward surface of the sails and caught in irons. By driving the vessel backwards through the water, this puts excessive strain on the ship's masts, spars and rigging, could break the rudder, and in severe weather could <b>dismast</b> the ship. In some situations it was considered quicker and safer to take a square rigged ship to windward by executing a series of jibes, turning the vessel across the wind through 270 degrees rather than the 90 degrees of a tack. This, however, would result in considerable ground lost to leeward with each jibe. Wearing has been judged to be unseamanlike except in heavy weather.|$|E
