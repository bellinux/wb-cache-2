5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius {{may be able to}} use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
25|$|Hedberg {{suffered}} from stage fright throughout his career; he often performed in sunglasses, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{his hair in}} his face or his eyes closed, and sometimes stood upstage or {{with his back to}} the audience, constantly moving in place. At times, he nervously shook his microphone unconsciously.|$|E
25|$|Butt {{started in}} the Under-17s and quickly progressed through Under-19 level, {{although}} at that time he was much younger than the age limits suggest, making his senior debut for Lahore Whites in 2000 aged only 15. His talent was noticed immediately, which led to him being given {{a place in the}} Pakistan A team against England soon after. However, instead of rushing straight for the limelight of international cricket, he got <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> consolidated by playing consistently for his region and the youth teams, until the Pakistan selectors finally drafted him in 2003.|$|E
6000|$|Bill made a ’orrible {{noise in}} his throat, {{and kept on}} staring at the bottle till they thought ’e’d gone crazy. Then Jasper Potts bent <b>his</b> <b>’ead</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> began to read out loud wot was on the bottle. [...] "P-o-i— POISON FOR BILL JONES," [...] he ses, in a voice as if ’e couldn’t believe it.|$|R
60|$|Poor Harry {{stood before}} {{her for a}} moment, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> hanging <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> a deep blush of shame on his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh, it's a poor {{look-out}} when th' ould folks doesna {{like the}} young uns," [...] said old Martin, bending <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> lower, <b>and</b> seeming {{to trace the}} pattern of the quarries with his eye.|$|R
25|$|The fight {{took place}} in October 2013, Klitschko's third undefeated {{consecutive}} opponent. The bout was marred with over 160 clinches, most initiated by Klitschko, followed by several repeated roughhouse tactics throughout the match against Povetkin. This included leaning on his opponent and pushing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> throwing Povetkin to the canvas, {{which resulted in the}} referee scoring some as knockdowns. Klitschko won by unanimous decision scoring a knockdown in round 2 from a flush jab, and 3 knockdowns in round 7 including one prompted from a big right uppercut. All 3 judges scored it 119–104 on the scorecards. Klitschko landed 139 of 417 punches (33%) and Povetkin connected on 59 of 283 (21%).|$|E
25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
500|$|The Associated Press {{has noted}} that {{contrary}} to expectations, Franken has not sought out the media spotlight: [...] "He rarely talks to the Washington press corps, has shed his comedic persona and focused on policy, working to be taken seriously." [...] In interviews he has expressed his desire to be known for a focus on constituency work, keeping <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> working hard.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Welcome, fair youth,' {{said the}} old man, turning <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'Sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> warm yourself, and tell me how fares the outer world. It is long since I have seen it.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{reading of}} the letter was {{completed}} by Betteredge in silence. After carefully putting {{it back in the}} envelope, he sat thinking, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bowed <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> eyes on the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ginger {{sat up in}} bed {{and stared}} at ’im; then ’e bent <b>’is</b> <b>’ead</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> squinted at <b>’is</b> chest, and next moment ’e was out of bed and all three of ’em was holding ’im down on the floor to prevent ’im {{breaking}} the tattooer’s neck which ’e’d set ’is ’eart upon doing, and explaining to ’im that the tattooer {{was at the top of}} ’is profession, and that it was only by a stroke of luck ’e had got ’im. And Sam reminded ’im of wot ’e ’ad said the night before, and said he’d live to thank ’im for it.|$|R
500|$|Fighting {{tactics are}} governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt {{informal}} tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as [...] "going for it", in which the player puts <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> just throws as many punches as he can, {{as fast as he}} can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.|$|E
500|$|During the season, Geelong coach Chris Scott praised Selwood as [...] "probably {{the toughest}} player I've ever seen...he gets {{hit in the}} head a lot...he just sees the ball and he puts <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> he goes as hard as anyone {{possibly}} could". Despite Selwood's individual efforts, the Cats finished with a 15-7 win-loss record {{at the conclusion of the}} season to finish sixth on the ladder. This represented the first time in Selwood's career that the club had not qualified with a double chance for the finals series, setting them up for an Elimination Final match against Fremantle. Despite Selwood's contribution of a game-high 28 disposals and team-high six inside-50s, the Cats were defeated by 16points and exited the finals series—the first time that the club had failed to progress beyond the first week since Selwood had begun his career.|$|E
500|$|Coburn {{generated}} controversy {{after the}} race, {{when he said}} the current Triple Crown system allowed [...] "the coward's way out" [...] because fresh horses who had not run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who contested all three legs. [...] Sherman downplayed the outburst, saying, [...] " [...] was at {{the heat of the moment}} ... Sometimes the emotions get in front of you." [...] Two days later, Coburn apologized, saying he wanted to congratulate the owners of Tonalist and adding, [...] "I wanted so much for [...] to win the Triple Crown for the people of America." [...] Steve Haskin of Blood-Horse magazine summarized the race stating, [...] "when I think back... the one image that will last forever will be of an exhausted colt walking back through the tunnel with a bloodstained foot, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> breathing hard, and every vein protruding from his sweat-soaked body. He had given every ounce of himself, and with it all, still was beaten only [...] lengths." ...|$|E
60|$|Emerging {{from his}} cabin, the marquis met him walking {{slowly along the}} beach, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> lips {{slightly}} moving {{as though he were}} repeating something, a prayer or a poem, to himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faint--stuff--how horridly stupid!" [...] but he {{was obliged}} to lay <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> again; <b>and</b> Ethel, {{scarcely}} less trembling, crept carefully towards the stairs, but a dread of what she might meet came over her, and she turned towards the nursery.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{my mother}} consents," [...] said Richard, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> uttering the words {{with the more}} difficulty, because he felt so {{strongly}} drawn towards his cousin, who never seemed so mighty as in his condescension.|$|R
500|$|... "Practice Date" [...] {{marked a}} turning point for the {{character}} Jerry. Prior to the episode, Jerry had appeared in every episode, but his personality had not yet been developed. Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked Jim O'Heir, so they cast him in the show and [...] "figured we'd work it out later". After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals Jerry was adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after [...] "Practice Date", [...] "We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who wants to put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> get his pension, but is asking for it all the time. In the next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. [...] "Practice Date" [...] marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that they made him a recurring character.|$|E
2500|$|On March 29 the two met, Mosby having {{brought with}} him a small pepper-box pistol {{in the hope of}} dissuading Turpin from an attack. When the two met and Mosby said, [...] "I hear you have been making assertions ..." [...] Turpin put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> charged. At that point, Mosby pulled out the pistol and shot his adversary in the neck. The distraught 19-year-old Mosby went home to await his fate. He was arrested and arraigned on two charges: {{unlawful}} shooting (a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $500 fine) and malicious shooting (a felony with a maximum sentence of 10 years in the penitentiary). After a trial that almost resulted in a hung jury, Mosby was convicted of the lesser offense but received the maximum sentence. Mosby later discovered that he had been expelled from the university before he was brought to trial.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood before}} her, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> sighed bitterly.|$|E
60|$|He let <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sink {{suddenly}} <b>down</b> <b>and</b> forward, hunching {{his shoulders}} and dropping his underjaw.|$|R
60|$|At once several sprang behind Dick {{and forced}} him to move <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Casaubon {{pronounced}} {{this little}} speech {{with the most}} conscientious intention, blinking a little and swaying <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> concluding with a smile. He had not found marriage a rapturous state, {{but he had no}} idea of being anything else than an irreproachable husband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved to be.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} shining with a {{wonderful}} light of joy. She drew <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kissed him.|$|E
60|$|Octavia drew <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> {{whispered in}} his ear, But {{that is one}} of the tales they brought behind them.|$|E
60|$|She drew <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed his}} lips, then {{turned her face}} to his breast--then joy and {{confidence}} came back to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Play the game--don't talk," [...] The Maltese Cat whickered; and all {{the ponies}} wriggled with excitement, and the {{soldiers}} and the grooms gripped the railings and shouted. A black pony with blinkers had singled out old Benami, and was interfering with him in every possible way. They could see Benami shaking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> flapping his under lip.|$|R
60|$|It is {{a little}} past noon, {{and many of the}} women come to their doors and look curiously after a miner, who, in his working clothes, and black with coal-dust, walks rapidly towards his house, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> thick felt hat slouched over his eyes.|$|R
60|$|And she was right. The venturesome man had, {{with his}} {{accustomed}} hardihood, attempted {{that day to}} scale the mountain side, and had fallen into a hole {{by the side of}} the track, from which he could by no means extricate himself, because of its being a tightish fit, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> being <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> legs were in the air.|$|R
60|$|On rare {{occasions}} the beast would bolt {{into the ditch}} as a vehicle drew near; but usually he paused abruptly, put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> apparently went to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Ronald, {{listening}} with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> without interposing a word {{on his own}} part, made {{an extraordinary}} answer. [...] "Leave it," [...] he said. [...] "Leave it till tomorrow." ...|$|E
60|$|She drew <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed him}} upon the lips. Tallente knew then {{why he had}} come. The whole {{orchestra}} of life was playing again. He {{was strong enough to}} overcome mountains.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Lucy," [...] he began, nodding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> as he coiled up his string again, [...] "what do {{you think}} I mean to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye-es," [...] drawled Shaw, putting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> the {{skylight}} <b>and</b> speaking {{into the gloom}} of the cabin. [...] "I {{thought there was a}} light air, and--but it's gone now. Not a breath anywhere under the heavens." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{class were}} {{glad to hear that}} a young, new lecturer, who had just {{graduated}} would be taking over the lessons of the old professor from that day onwards, except for Young-min, who felt rather sorry for his plight. The old professor walked out of the classroom, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bowed <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> Young-min looked on as the new lecturer started his lessons.|$|R
