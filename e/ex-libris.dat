25|$|The {{study of}} and the taste for {{collecting}} bookplates hardly date farther back than the year 1860. The first real impetus {{was given by}} the appearance of A Guide to the Study of Book-Plates (<b>Ex-Libris),</b> by Lord de Tabley (then the Hon. J. Leicester Warren M.A.) in 1880 (published in London by John Pearson of 46 Pall Mall). This work, highly interesting from many points of view, established what is now accepted as the general classification of styles of British ex-libris: early armorial (i.e., previous to Restoration, exemplified by the Nicholas Bacon plate); Jacobean, a somewhat misleading term, but distinctly understood to include the heavy decorative manner of the Restoration, Queen Anne and early Georgian days (the Lansanor plate is Jacobean); Chippendale (the style above described as rococo, tolerably well represented by the French plate of Convers); wreath and ribbon, belonging to the period described as that of the urn, etc. Since then the literature on the subject has grown considerably.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not before}} the 17th century that printed <b>ex-libris</b> became common in France. Up to that time, the more luxurious habit of blind or gold-stamping the book's binding with a {{personal}} device had been more widespread: the supralibros. From {{the middle of the}} century, however, the <b>ex-libris</b> proper became quite popular; examples of that period are numerous, and, as a rule, very handsome. It may be here pointed out that the term [...] "ex-libris", used as a substantive (Exlibris (written in one word) in German) found its origin in France.|$|E
2500|$|A bookplate (or book-plate, [...] {{as it was}} {{commonly}} styled {{until the}} early 20th C.), also known as <b>ex-librīs</b> , is usually a small print or decorative label pasted into a book, often on the inside front cover, to indicate its owner. Simple typographical bookplates are termed [...] "booklabels".|$|E
2500|$|The {{scholars}} in Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco and Middlemarch by George Eliot are named Casaubon. Mary Gentle named {{a character in}} her novels Rats and Gargoyles and the Architecture of Desire Casaubon, as an homage to Isaac Casaubon. Ross King makes mention of Casaubon in his novel <b>Ex-Libris</b> where {{he is said to}} have debunked the Corpus Hermeticum as a forgery (which he probably took from Frances Yates' Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Of {{this kind}} the best-defined English genre may be recalled: the library interior—a term which {{explains}} itself—and book-piles, {{exemplified by the}} <b>ex-libris</b> of W. Hewer, Samuel Pepys's secretary. We have also many portrait-plates, of which, perhaps, the most notable are those of Samuel Pepys himself and of John Gibbs, the architect; allegories, such as were engraved by Hogarth, Bartolozzi, John Pine and George Vertue; landscape-plates, by wood-engravers of the Bewick school, [...] In most of these the armorial element plays but a secondary part.|$|E
2500|$|A {{sketch of}} the history of the bookplate, as a symbolical and {{decorative}} print used to mark ownership of books, begins in Germany. The earliest examples known are German, but also they are found in great numbers long before the fashion spread to other countries, and are often of the highest artistic interest. Albrecht Dürer is known to have engraved at least six plates (some quite large) between 1503 and 1516, and to have supplied designs for several others. Notable plates are ascribed to Lucas Cranach and to Hans Holbein, and to the so-called Little Masters (Masters of the small format—the Behams, Virgil Solis, Matthias Zundt, Jost Amman, Saldorfer, Georg Hupschmann and others). The influence of these draftsman over the decorative styles of Germany has been felt through subsequent centuries down to the present day, notwithstanding the invasion of successive Italian and French fashions during the 17th and 18th centuries, and the marked effort at originality of composition observable among modern designers. [...] The ornate and elaborate German style does not seem to have affected neighbouring countries; but as it was undoubtedly from Germany that the fashion for ornamental bookplates spread, the history of German <b>ex-libris</b> remains of great interest to all those who are interested in their development.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{in their}} modern form, they evolved from simple {{inscriptions}} in books which were common in Europe in the Middle Ages, when various {{other forms of}} [...] "librarianship" [...] became widespread (such {{as the use of}} class-marks, call-numbers, or shelfmarks). The earliest known examples of printed bookplates are German, and date from the 15th century. One of the best known is a small hand-coloured woodcut representing a shield of arms supported by an angel, which was pasted into books presented to the Carthusian monastery of Buxheim by Brother Hildebrand Brandenburg of Biberach, about the year 1480—the date being fixed by that of the recorded gift. The woodcut, in imitation of similar devices in old manuscripts, is hand-painted. An example of this bookplate {{can be found in the}} Farber Archives of Brandeis University. In France the most ancient <b>ex-libris</b> as yet discovered is that of one Jean Bertaud de la Tour-Blanche, the date of which is 1529. Holland comes next with the plate of Anna van der Aa, in 1597; then Italy with one attributed to the year 1622. The earliest known American example is the plain printed label of Stephen Daye, the Massachusetts printer of the Bay Psalm Book, 1642.|$|E
