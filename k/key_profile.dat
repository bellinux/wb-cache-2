Modeling the residual stress profile is currently tedious and inaccurate. This study introduces a new method of understanding the residual stress profile in terms of quantifiable key measures: peak tensile stress at the surface, magnitude and depth of peak compressive stress, and depth at which residual stress becomes near-zero. Experiments in turning IN- 100 and milling GTD- 111 have been conducted and subsequent X-ray Diffraction measurements have been utilized to obtain residual stress profiles. Using a sinusoidal decay function fitted to measured residual stress profiles, these four <b>key</b> <b>profile</b> measures are extracted and then the effects of process parameters such as cutting speed, feed, cutting edge radius, and tool coating on these measures are investigated...|$|E

The method {{is based on}} the extraction of chromagrams using a new approach for tonal component selection taking into account auditory masking. The extracted chromagrams were used to train three key profiles for major and three key profiles for minor keys. The three trained key profiles differ in their temporal weighting of information across the duration of the song. One profile is based on uniform weighting while the other two apply emphasis on the beginning and ending of the song, respectively. The actual key extraction is based on comparing the key profiles with three average chromagrams that were extracted from a particular piece of music using the same temporal weighting functions as used for the <b>key</b> <b>profile</b> training.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a probabilistic model of melody perception, which infers {{the key of}} a melody and also judges the probability of the melody itself. The model uses Bayesian reasoning: For any “surface” pattern and underlying “structure, ” we can infer the structure maximizing P (structure | surface) based on knowledge of P(surface, structure). The probability of the surface can then be calculated as ∑ P(surface, structure), summed over all structures. In this case, the surface is a pattern of notes; the structure is a key. A generative model is proposed, based on three principles: (a) melodies tend to remain within a narrow pitch range; (b) note-to-note intervals within a melody tend to be small; and (c) notes tend to conform to a distribution (or <b>key</b> <b>profile)</b> {{that depends on the}} key. The model is tested in three ways. First, it is tested on its ability to identify the keys of a set of folksong melodies. Second, it is tested on a melodic expectation task in which it must judge the probability of different notes occurring given a prior context; these judgments are compared with perception data from a melodic expectation experiment. Finally, the model is tested on its ability to detect incorrect notes in melodies by assigning them lower probabilities than the original versions...|$|E

Objective: The purpose of our study was to examine Facebook as a strategy to recruit participants, especially Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) eligible persons, to view and evaluate an online nutrition education program intended to be offered as having some evidence base for SNAP-Ed programming.

40|$|The Bremstein Fault Complex {{is located}} on the Mid-Norwegian Continental Margin, where it {{functions}} as a boundary zone between the Halten Terrace and the Trøndelag Platform. There has been ongoing activity along the Bremstein Fault Complex since approximately the Middle Triassic, indicated by growth along individual faults. The fault complex was finalized by the downfaulting on the platform-terrace boundary, in the Late Cretaceous, resulting in individual terrace and platform structures. The study focuses on the mechanisms responsible for the structural geometry of the Bremstein Fault Complex, with emphasis on the role of inherited Late Paleozoic structures and reactivated, as well as the extent and control of halokinesis and detachments. Detailed 2 D seismic interpretation has been carried out, in order to constrain the timing of faulting and the subsequent structuring. The study area was divided into three segments, each segment represented by a <b>key</b> <b>profile,</b> illustrating the segments main structural style. Four main tectonic events were recorded on the Bremstein Fault Complex: (1) the Permo-Triassic, (2) the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic, (3) the late-Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and (3) the Late Cretaceous-Eocene. The events are evident in the seismic data in the form of structures related to growth faults. The tectonic movement, in the Permo-Triassic is most likely due to pre-existing zones of weakness, related to a Caledonian structural grain. Tectonic activity in the late-Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous has resulted in two distinct levels on the Bremstein Fault Complex, based on difference in fault populations and geometries. The evaporite layers functioned as a detachment, dividing the complex into pre-and post-evaporite structural settings...|$|E

The main objective of the paper is to present an overview of the development level for logistics services market in Romania, by analyzing representative statistical data in the supply chain management domain. The research methodology focuses on collection of statistical data about Romanian logistics sector, especially from official data published by the INS, identifying <b>key</b> <b>profile</b> companies operating in Romania and analyze their development over the past five years, using indicators such as quantity of logistic spaces put into operation annual, occupancy rate, sale price / rental, logistics services for customers and other related services. This information are taken from the websites of the companies and from studies made public by consulting companies. The quality of the logistics services offered to customers by companies in Romania is being compared to the European average on various specific categories. In this respect, we used the logistic performance index that summarizes the statistical aspects of the supply chain management at national and international level, using a set of predefined criteria. The results of the research concern the positioning Romania in terms of logistics in relation to other European countries and propose solutions applicable to improving their quality. The preoccupation for identifying opportunities to improve the efficiency of supply chain management leads to analysis of information systems for supply chain management, which are designed to facilitate communication both between company departments and between it and its partners in the extended supply chain.

It continues their cross-track scanning geometry, but for the first time, provides Nyquist sample spacing. All this is accomplished with approximately V. the volume, Y, the mass, and Y, the power of the three AMSUs. A description will be given of its performance from its first year of operation as determined by post-launch calibration activities. These activities include radiometric calibration using the on-board warm targets and cold space views, and geolocation determination.

Kostenki 12 complements Kostenki 14 (Markina Gora), which is a <b>key</b> <b>profile</b> for the interval 42 - 27 ka. The new data from Kostenki 12 show that the East European Upper Paleolithic began similar to 45 ka. The stratigraphy exhibits similarities to that of Borschevo 5. The Kostenki 12 pollen diagramis correlated with: 1) other pollen diagrams from Kostenki-Borschevo region; 2) the most detailed climatostratigraphical scale of the Russian Plain Late Pleistocene; 3) O- 16 /O- 18 Greenland GISP 2 scale; 4) C- 13 /C- 14 record from stalagmite at Villars Cave (France), as well as with pollen records (5 - 7) from: 5) Lake Monticchio (Italy), 6) southern Black Sea (M 72 / 5 - 25 -GC 1) and 7) Glinde and Moershoofd (northern Germany). The results of the supra-regional paleoenvironmental correlations demonstrate that the lowest Paleolithic layer V and paleosol D, characterized by elm dominance, correlate to {{the second half of the}} optimum of the Glinde interstadial at 51 - 48 ka, corresponding to DO 14. The earliest Upper Paleolithic layer IV and paleosol B, characterized by coexistence of elm forests and wet meadows, began to form during the second part of the Moershoofd interstadial optimum at 46 - 44 ka, correlating with DO 12. Paleosol A and layer III (Kostenki-Strelets culture) began to form after the abrupt end of the Moershoofd interstadial similar to 43. 5 ka, during unstable conditions, according to pollen and paleozoological data (steppe with horse dominance and later spruce forest tundra with reindeer dominance in paleozoological complex). These correlations provide more accurate dating of the Paleolithic layers and paleosols at Kostenki-Borschevo, suggesting that previously reported radiocarbon dates on units below CI tephra layer are too young, but that the OSL chronology is generally accurate.
