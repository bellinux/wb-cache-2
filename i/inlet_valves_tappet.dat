50|$|The XLV750R (Honda type designation: RD01) was Honda's first dual-sport {{motorcycle}} {{with two}} non-parallel cylinders. It has an air-/oil-cooled V-twin engine with hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>tappets</b> and a shaft drive. Those two construction features make the XLV {{a very low}} maintenance motorcycle. Other technical highlights {{at the time of}} introduction were the dry sump lubrication system (with the main frame acting as an oil tank), the three valves per cylinder (two <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> / one exhaust valve), the two spark plugs per cylinder and the crankshaft with off-set pins.|$|R

50|$|The VL I was a V-12 liquid-cooled {{four-stroke}} Otto cycle engine, {{with individual}} {{grey cast iron}} cylinders, with a cylinder bore of 140 mm, piston stroke of 180 mm, and displacement of 33.255 L. The crankshaft was supported in roller-bearings and was fitted with a vibration damper for smooth operation. The overhead <b>valves,</b> one large <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> and two smaller outlet valves per cylinder, were operated by a camshaft running between the cylinder banks, operating the <b>valves</b> with <b>tappets,</b> pushrods and rocker arms.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> in the pistons {{by using a}} single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>valve.</b> The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the <b>valve</b> <b>tappet</b> rollers, a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The system aims at {{modifying the}} {{position}} and diameter of the exhaust valve {{in order to reduce}} the probability of knocking (both in SI and in CI) and lessen the dilution of charge because of the small size of exhaust valve when compared to the size of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve.</b> The size of the exhaust valve is smaller when compared to the size of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve.</b> It is done so because the region closer to the exhaust valve is at a higher temperature compared to that of the temperature surrounding the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve.</b> Now if the exhaust valve size is increased there will be higher possibility of knocking because the charge coming inside the combustion chamber has a higher probability of combusting at exhaust valve’s surface (due to large surface area). On the other hand if the size is too small then, there will be greater possibility of dilution in the intake charge because there is no enough space for the burnt gas to leave the chamber. To reduce these problems, modifications in the engine is proposed. In general <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>valves</b> are positioned vertically along the axis of the combustion chamber. Now if the exhaust valve is placed along the horizontal axis (i. e. perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and if the size of the valve is increased then there will be less possibility for the dilution. But the probability of knocking increases. Since the exhaust valve is placed along the horizontal axis, the outer surface of the exhaust valve will be in contact with the water cooling system of the combustion chamber (outside the chamber). Thus this cooling system or the coolant will be able to release the heat at the outer surface of the exhaust valve and transfer heat from the seat surface of the exhaust <b>valve</b> (commonly in <b>tappet</b> <b>valves).</b> The rate of Heat Transfer will be high because the surface area perpendicular to heat flow direction is large thereby enhancing heat transfer. The possibility of the dilution is reduced because, during the piston movement from BDC (Bottom Dead Center) to the TDC (Top Dead Center) the piston pushes the burnt gases outside through the exhaust valve since the size of the exhaust valve is increased, it is easie...|$|R

50|$|A four valves per {{cylinder}} design {{usually has}} two valves for intake and two for exhaust, which requires two camshafts per cylinder bank. If {{there are two}} camshafts in the cylinder head, the cams can sometimes bear directly on cam followers on the <b>valve</b> stems (<b>tappets).</b> The cam followers aid in noise reduction, dampened vibration, shock absorption and the carrying of axial load. This latter arrangement is the most inertia free, allows the most unimpeded gas flows in the engine and is the usual arrangement for high performance automobile engines. It also permits the spark plug to {{be located in the}} center of the cylinder head, which promotes better combustion characteristics. Beyond a certain number of valves, the effective area covered decreases, so four is the common-most number. Odd numbers of valves necessarily means the intake or exhaust side must have one valve more.
