Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided to take one year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla").

5|$|On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines {{route from}} Molde to Bergen {{was taken over}} by Widerøe. However, while Scandinavian Airlines {{previously}} flew from Molde at 06:45, Widerøe's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen. Krohn Air had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen. The Bergen service was started on 31 August. On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August. Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
500|$|Bert Berns, Them’s {{producer}} and composer of their 1965 hit, [...] "Here Comes the Night", persuaded Morrison {{to return to}} New York to record solo for his new label, Bang Records. Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied. Then, during a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967, eight songs were recorded, originally intended {{to be used as}} four singles. Instead, these songs were released as the album Blowin' Your Mind! without Morrison being consulted. He said he only became aware of the album's release when a friend mentioned on a phone call that he had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> copy of it. He later commented to Donal Corvin in a 1973 interview: [...] "I wasn't really happy with it. He picked the bands and tunes. I had a different concept of it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Jacket" [...] {{was written}} by Seinfelds co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. The episode's storyline was based on one of David's personal experiences; when he was dating Monica Yates, {{she wanted him to}} meet her father, Richard Yates, a respected novelist. David had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> suede jacket, and met Richard Yates at the Algonquin Hotel. Richard was, as David stated in an interview, [...] "...every bit as intimidating as Alton Benes". David's story is similar to what happened in the episode, as, when they headed out to the restaurant, his jacket was ruined by the snow. Additional dialogue at the store where Jerry buys his jacket was cut before broadcast, it featured a reference to Gary Gilmore. The material was later included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. [...] "The Jacket" [...] is the only episode in which one of Elaine's parents appears; Louis-Dreyfus once suggested Mary Tyler Moore to portray Elaine's mother, but the character never appeared on the show. The episode also contains the first mention to Elaine's job as a manuscript reader for Pendant Publishing, in early drafts of the script her job was an optician. Also in early drafts, in the final scene Kramer entered Jerry's house with a dove on his shoulder.|$|E

He expects that because his tannery is causing all the contamination, his son-in-law Dr. Stockmann will back off and let the issue go because now his family's money is also at jeopardy if he continues this battle. Dr. Stockmann refuses Morten Kiil's suggestions, and also ignores Peter's advice of leaving town for a few months. Dr. Stockmann has alienated everyone but stays true to his principles, {{even though he is}} standing alone. Dr. Stockmann knows that his family will always be by his side, and decides to accept his fate and become [...] "the enemy of the people" [...] if that is what it takes to do what is right.|$|R

500|$|Blink-182 entered Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe, California in December 1996 {{to record}} Dude Ranch. Big Fish was a {{converted}} guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before. However, the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink-182 at all, {{and what was}} a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group; bassist Mark Hoppus had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> new video camera and he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time such as having Mark run around naked as Tom explained to the camera {{what happened in the}} fire and that it's [...] "Mating Season". Thanks to improved economics, the band had more time in the studio to record the album they wanted to make. The trio were listening to music such as Jawbreaker, Bad Religion and Lagwagon, setting the backdrop for the recordings under guidance of Mark Trombino, who provided additional piano and keyboards on Dude Ranch. The trio picked Trombino based on his work he had done on Jimmy Eat World's Static Prevails (1996). The group spent much time trying to get Trombino to laugh at their antics, to no avail. Hoppus' sister, Anne Hoppus, described Trombino as very quiet and [...] "very much his own person." [...] In addition to the record, Trombino produced [...] "I Won't Be Home for Christmas", a holiday song recorded during the Dude Ranch sessions.|$|E

He didn't make you feel small, {{but he was just}} so perfect in what he did.... I still {{remember}} watching him singing, but he would accompany himself on the alto, and you were convinced he was playing the alto while he was singing.... the breath hadn't gone from his last word before he was playing his alto and it seemed to be simultaneous.... He got a very raw deal from history... In the Chick Webb band there were two regular singers – Ella [...] and Louis Jordan. And yet really history has consigned him to just being a comedy vocal thing with a bit of rock and roll, and the first alto... but he was such a consumately good singer that it's sad that he wasn't known more for it." ...|$|E

30|$|These two classic models lie at {{the core}} {{of a large number of}} generalizations in the {{subsequent}} work. Bhagat et al. (2012) adapt the LT model to what they called linear threshold with color (LT-C) model. They show that there exist tattlers who are activated without adopting the product themselves. These tattlers serve as information bridges in influence propagation and significantly affect product adoption. It is no doubt that distinguishing tattlers from adopters is an important step toward a more realistic model. However, a tattler does not have to be activated in order to spread influence in reality. For example, Tom <b>bought</b> <b>an</b> iPhone, and told his friend Jeff that it is cool and he likes it. When Jeff chats with their friend Nick at lunch, he simply tells Nick that Tom <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> <b>an</b> iPhone and he really likes it. Jeff does not have to be activated or form his opinion about the iPhone, but he does pass Tom’s influence on to Nick indirectly. Just like Jeff, many tattlers are simply messengers who pass WOM messages on to their friends and implicitly pass indirect/passive/informational influence around. This is an important feature of WOM communication, as described in the network coproduction model (Kozinets et al. 2010). In fact, messengers play an important role in WOM marketing, and should be distinguished and included explicitly in influence-diffusion modeling.|$|R
