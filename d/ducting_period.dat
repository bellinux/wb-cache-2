40|$|Signal {{strength}} measurements at 2 GHz {{have recently}} been made on three over-sea paths in the British Channel Islands. This paper focuses on explaining the propagation characteristics during periods of normal reception and periods of enhanced signal strength with particular emphasis on a 48. 5 km transhorizon path between Jersey and Alderney. Evaporation ducting and diffraction {{appear to be the}} dominant propagation mechanisms at most times. The influence of the evaporation <b>duct</b> during <b>periods</b> of normal propagation has been confirmed by modeling the over-sea propagation conditions using Paulus-Jeske evaporation duct refractivity profiles as input to the parabolic equation method. During periods of enhanced propagation, which occur approximately 8 % of the time on the longest path (48. 5 km), the presence of additional higher-altitude ducting/super-refractive structures has been verified and their influence has been modeled with reasonable success...|$|R

40|$|Background: Vitellointestinal duct (VID) or omphalomesenteric duct {{anomalies}} are {{secondary to}} {{the persistence of the}} embryonic vitelline duct, which normally obliterates by weeks 5 – 9 of intrauterine life. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a total of 16 patients of symptomatic remnants of vitellointestinal <b>duct</b> from <b>period</b> of Jan 2009 to May 2013. Results: Male to female ratio (M:F) was 4. 3 : 1 and mean age of presentation was 2 months and their mode of presentation was: patent VID in 9 (56. 25 %) patients, umbilical cyst in 2 (12. 25 %), umbilical granuloma in 2 (12. 25 %), and Meckel diverticulum as content of hernia sac in obstructed umbilical hernia in 1 (6. 25 %) patient. Two patients with umbilical fistula had severe electrolyte disturbance and died without surgical intervention. Conclusion: Persistent VID may have varied presentations in infancy. High output umbilical fistula and excessive bowel prolapse demand urgent surgical intervention to avoid morbidity and mortality...|$|R

40|$|Thoracic duct-venous shunts were {{prepared}} in yearling calves. A lymph filtration apparatus was then {{inserted into the}} system, thus allowing {{for the removal of}} thoracic duct lymphocytes via closed-circuit extracorporeal filtration. Long term thoracic duct flow rates and lymphocyte concentrations averaged 20 litres per day and 22, 000 /mm 3 respectively. Filtration proved very effective in removing cells from the thoracic <b>duct</b> lymph. Filtration <b>periods</b> of 9 – 11 days removed an average of nearly 2 × 1012 lymphocytes. Such periods of cell removal decreased the thoracic duct cell concentration to nearly 10 % of the original level. Six weeks following cessation of filtration, this level had risen to only 29 %. It is concluded that closed-circuit extracorporeal filtration of thoracic duct lymph offers an important and effective new tool for achieving lymphocyte depletion...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{post-operative}} complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) {{are largely}} due to pancreatic fistula onset. The occlusion of the main pancreatic duct using synthetic glue may prevent these complications. Aim {{of this study is}} to describe this technique and to report short- and long-term results as well as the post-operative endocrine and exocrine insufficiency. Two hundred and four patients who underwent PD with occlusion of the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> in a <b>period</b> of 15  years were retrospectively analyzed. Post-operative complications and their management were the main aim of the study with particular focus on pancreatic fistula incidence and its treatment. At 1 -year follow-up endocrine and exocrine functions were analyzed. We observed a 54  % pancreatic fistula incidence, most of which (77 / 204 patients) were a grade A fistula with little change in medical management. Twenty-eight patients developed a grade B fistula while only 2  % of patients (5 / 204) developed a grade C fistula. Nine patients required re-operation, 5 of whom had a post-operative grade C fistula. Post-operative mortality was 3. 4  %. At 1 -year follow-up, 31  % of patients developed a post-operative diabetes while exocrine insufficiency was encountered in 88  % of patients. The occlusion of the main pancreatic duct after PD can be considered a relatively safe and easy-to-perform procedure. It should be reserved to selected patients, especially in case of soft pancreatic texture and small pancreatic duct and in elderly patients with comorbidities, in whom pancreatic fistula-related complications could be life threatening...|$|R
40|$|The {{secretory}} end-pieces of the submandibular gland of rats {{during the}} first week of postnatal development are studied with regard to the fine structure of the secretion granules in these end-pieces. The terminal ends of the secretory <b>ducts</b> during this <b>period</b> consist of two types of cells; one cell is an acinar-type and the other is a duct-type found in the gland of adult rats. The secretion granules of the acinar-type cells are similar in appearance to those of the acinar cells in the gland of adult rats, and the structure of these granules remains the same throughout the week. However, granules widely different in appearance are present in the duct-type cells, and their structure varies in different cells as well as within a single cell at different stages of development. These granules contain unusual substructures which are not found in the secretion granules of adult rats, suggesting that the granules are transitory. Granules containing short tubular profiles are predominant in the gland of one day-old rats. A large number of granules in three day-old rats contain elongated tubules. More granules of widely different substructures are present in the gland of seven day-old rats than in the gland of younger rats. The matrix of the granules in seven day-old rats is of higher density than that of the granules in younger rats. In the dense matrix of these granules, less dense tubules form fingerprint-like or somewhat more irregular patterns...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} numerical study of multidimensional viscous flows at speeds exceeding 8 km/s is reported. Experiments were {{performed in the}} X 3 superorbital expansion tube with air and nitrogen test flows at a Mach number and total enthalpy of 10 and 40 MJ/kg, respectively. Laminar skin friction, heat flux and pressure measurements were obtained at regular intervals along one wall of a rectangular duct. The spatial resolution of the transducers was chosen to capture the multidimensional flow phenomena within the <b>duct.</b> Quasi-steady flow <b>periods</b> were established along {{the entire length of}} the duct in the test times offered by the expansion tube. Direct skin friction measurements were accomplished through the use of ‘in house’ acceleration compensated transducers. The successful operation of these skin friction transducers in a high performance expansion tube was demonstrated. Furthermore, the systematic uncertainty in measured shear stress was significantly reduced with the development of a new pressure calibration technique. For the conditions tested, Reynolds analogy was shown to be valid to within experimental uncertainty. The experimental data was in excellent agreement with numerical estimates. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the diverging duct revealed that the flowfield structure in the vicinity of the corners differs from that of an unbounded corner or a constant area duct. Real gas effects other than those present in the residual nonequilibrium levels of freestream dissociation were negligible for the conditions tested. A computational study of two waverider configurations recently tested in the X 3 superorbital expansion tube was conducted to assist in the interpretation of past results. The off-design aerodynamic performance was also analyzed and showed that blunting the leading edges dramatically degraded the performance by increasing drag and decreasing lift for the conditions considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Present {{strategies}} for surveillance, prevention, {{and control of}} arbovirus dis eases in western North America have been developed from more than 4 decades of epi demiological {{research and development of}} mosquito control technology. Methods of pre diction of outbreaks remain imprecise, although our understanding of sources of variation associated with indicators used for prediction is improving. Well organized and funded systematic mosquito abatement remains the most effective method of prevention of human cases of mosquito-borne virus disease, although emergency methods must be employed when outbreaks are imminent. The development of information management systems technology, use of recent developments of sampling theory, and research on vector com petency and related areas should permit much better precision in estimates of impending outbreaks. The development of {{strategies for}} the surveil lance, prevention, and control of arthropod-borne virus diseases in North America grew out of stud ies of the epidemiology of these diseases con <b>ducted</b> during the <b>period</b> preceding World War II. Approaches have been refined over the years, and materials and equipment have been im proved, but the basic concepts remain relatively unchanged since those times. I will examine these concepts and discuss their validity in light of the present state of knowledge of arbovirus disease ecology. If the name â€œReevesâ€•appears frequent ly in this discussion it is because his contribu tions to this area have been so extensive. Early concepts incrimination ofvectors and pathogen, and iden tification ofhosts must always receive the highest priority in epidemiological studies of newly emerging diseases. In the case of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis enceph alitis (SLE) in western North America, it was only after Culex tarsalis had been incriminated as the primary vector, and birds as the primary hosts, that sound surveillance methods could be developed. Studies which resulted in this incrim ination were described in a series of papers pub lished by Hammon, Reeves, and associates i...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} and the circulation of lymphocytes has been examined in the sheep fetus where neither foreign antigen nor immunoglobulins occur. It was found that as the lymphoid organs increased in size during fetal life, the numbers and the output of lymphocytes in the thoracic duct lymph increased. The recirculating pool of lymphocytes {{was estimated to be}} 5. 5 +/- 1. 5 X 10 (8) cells in fetal lambs 95 - 100 days of age, 5. 7 +/- 1. 2 X 10 (9) cells in fetuses 130 - 135 days of age, and 1. 2 +/ 0 9. 3 X 10 (10) cells in fetuses near to term. The rate of addition of lymphocytes to the recirculating pool was 3. 2 +/- 1. 9 X 10 (6) cells/h in fetuses of 100 days and 3. 4 +/- 0. 9 X 10 (7) cells/h in fetuses of 130 days of age. Lymphocytes recirculated from blood to lymph in fetuses; labeled cells injected into the blood stream reappeared in the thoracic duct lymph promptly and reached maximum levels around 12 - 18 h after they were injected. Labeled lymphocytes were detected subsequently in greatest numbers in the lymph nodes, particularly in the mesenteric lymph nodes and in the interfollicular areas of the Peyer's patches. Chronic drainage of thoracic duct lymph from fetuses in utero for periods of up to 36 days had no obvious effects on the growth or development of the fetus and only minimal effects on the content of lymphocytes in the various lymphoid tissues even though the number of cells in the blood and lymph were reduced to between 20 - 30 % of normal levels. Thymectomy done in fetuses about 2 mo befor cannulation of the thoracic duct reduced the output of cells in the thoracic duct to about 25 % of normal levels and caused a significant reduction in the content of lymphocytes in the various lymphoid tissues. Thymectomized fetal lambs subjected to thoracic <b>duct</b> drainage for <b>periods</b> up to 2 wk in utero had a similar complement of lymphocytes in their lymphoid tissues to intact thymectomized fetal lambs. Lymphocytes obtained from the thoracic duct lymph of lambs thymectomized 2 mo previously recirculated from blood to lymph when they were injected intravenously, although they did this at a significantly slower rate than did lymphocytes from normal lambs...|$|R
