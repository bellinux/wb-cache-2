40|$|Abstract: A common {{view in the}} {{literature}} is {{that the effect of}} <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks on macroeconomic aggregates is asymmetric in <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> increases and decreases. We show that widely used asymmetric VAR models of the transmission of <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks are misspecified, resulting in inconsistent parameter estimates, and that the implied impulse responses have been routinely computed incorrectly. As a result, the quantitative importance of <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> increases for the U. S. economy has been exaggerated. In response to this problem, we develop alternative regression models, estimation methods and methods of computing responses to <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks that yield consistent estimates regardless of the degree of asymmetry. We also introduce improved tests of the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> increases and decreases. An empirical study reveals little evidence against the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks. Our analysis has important implications for the theoretical literature on the transmission of <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks and for the debate about policy responses to <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks...|$|R

5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting <b>energy</b> <b>prices.</b> The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E
5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future <b>energy</b> <b>prices.</b> Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E

Only 26 countries other than the United States have a {{gross domestic}} product exceeding Houston's regional gross area product (GAP).

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} impacts of joint <b>energy</b> and output <b>prices</b> {{uncertainties}} on the inputs demands in a mean-variance framework. We find that an increase in expected output price will surely cause the risk averse firm to increase the inputs’ demand, while an increase in expected <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> will surely cause the risk averse firm to decrease the demand for energy and increase the demand for non-risky inputs. Further, increasing the variance of <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> will necessarily cause the risk averse firm to decrease the demands for the non-risky inputs. Furthermore, we investigate the two cases with only uncertain <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> and only uncertain output price. In the case with only uncertain <b>energy</b> <b>price,</b> {{we find that the}} uncertain <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> has no impact on the demands for the non-risky inputs. ...|$|R

We observe larger <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> induced technological change effects in developed countries in comparison to developing countries in the periods after first (1974), and second (1980) world oil crisis that caused substantial <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> increases.

5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local <b>energy</b> <b>prices,</b> subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E
5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E

40|$|Should {{a central}} bank {{accommodate}} <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks? Should the central bank use core inflation or headline inflation with the volatile energy component in its Taylor rule? To answer these questions, we build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with energy use, durable goods, and nominal rigidities to {{study the effects of}} an <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shock {{and its impact on the}} macroeconomy when the central bank follows a Taylor rule. We then study how the economy performs under alternative parameterizations of the rule with different weights on headline and core inflation after an increase in the <b>energy</b> <b>price.</b> Our simulation results indicate that {{a central bank}} using core inflation in its Taylor rule does better than one using headline inflation because the output drop is less severe. In general, we show that the lower the weight on <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> inflation in the Taylor rule, the impact of an <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> increase on gross domestic product and inflation is also lower. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses a {{theoretical}} model with Directed Technical Change to analyse the observed heterogeneous energy intensity developments. Based on the empirical {{evidence on the}} underlying drivers of energy intensity developments, we decompose changes in aggregate energy intensity into structural changes in the economy (Sector Effect) and within-sector energy efficiency improvements (Efficiency Effect). We analyse how <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> growth and the relative productivity of both sectors affect the direction of research and hence {{the relative importance of}} the aforementioned two effects. The relative importance of these effects is determined by <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> growth and relative sector productivity that drive the direction of research. In economies that are relatively more advanced in sectors with low energy intensities, the Sector Effect dominates energy intensity dynamics given no or moderate <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> growth. In contrast, the Efficiency Effect dominates energy intensity developments in economies with a high relative technological level within their energy-intensive industries if moderate <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> growth is above a certain threshold. We further show that temporal <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> shocks might induce a permanent redirection of innovation activities towards sectors with low-energy intensities...|$|R
