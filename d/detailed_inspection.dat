Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a <b>detailed</b> <b>inspection</b> of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E

Early medical abortion regimens using mifepristone, followed 24–48 hours later by buccal or vaginal misoprostol are 98% effective up to 9 weeks gestational age.

5000|$|Aircraft {{maintenance}} {{checks are}} periodic inspections {{that have to}} be done on all commercial/civil aircraft after {{a certain amount of time}} or usage; military aircraft normally follow specific maintenance programmes which may or may not be similar to those of commercial/civil operators. Airlines and other commercial operators of large or turbine-powered aircraft follow a continuous inspection program approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States, or by other airworthiness authorities such as Transport Canada or the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Under FAA oversight, each operator prepares a Continuous Airworthiness Maintenance Program (CAMP) under its Operations Specifications or [...] "OpSpecs".The CAMP includes both routine and <b>detailed</b> <b>inspections.</b> Airlines and airworthiness authorities casually refer to the <b>detailed</b> <b>inspections</b> as [...] "checks", commonly one of the following: A check, B check, C check, or D check.

25|$|Shiremark Mill slowly became derelict, an {{inspection}} by Rex Wailes in 1933 {{resulted in an}} estimated repair cost of £100. The cap boarding was repaired but the mill was again left to deteriorate. In 1950, Capel Parish Council approached the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings {{and the owner of}} the mill with a view to securing the mill's preservation. The mill had been listed as an antiquity by Surrey County Council by 1951. In 1952, a <b>detailed</b> <b>inspection</b> of the mill found that the sills and lower part of the cant posts were rotten. Thompson's, the Alford millwrights estimated that the mill would cose £2,500 to restore. The main beams of the first floor were supported by brick piers, but no other work was done. Although the mill had all four sails in 1928, the sails fell off one by one, with the last falling in 1956. Photographs show that the cap was intact in August 1958, but by May 1966 the roof had gone, exposing the brake wheel to the weather.|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} {{results indicate that}} cracks can initiate, grow, and coalesce more rapidly in fuselage lap joints that have experienced partial or complete debonding. Computational analysis in this paper shows that stress concentrations and stress intensity factors at the rivet holes are far less severe when the bond is intact. Debonding hastens the initiation of widespread fatigue cracks and significantly increases crack growth rate. Thus, debonded regions serve as "breeding grounds" for widespread fatigue damage. Therefore, the effectiveness of lap joint inspection programs may be enhanced if <b>detailed</b> <b>inspections</b> are focused on areas in which debonding has been detected...|$|R
