Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating {{to work in an}} inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.|$|E

500|$|Maulbetsch was {{inducted}} posthumously into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973. [...] Since 1956, the John F.

500|$|During the 1960s, the {{ceremony}} of assenting by commission was discontinued {{and is now}} only employed once a year, {{at the end of}} the annual parliamentary session. In 1960, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend {{the ceremony}}. The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent. As the attorney-general explained, [...] "there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of resentment not only at the loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused." [...] The granting of assent by the monarch in person, or by commission, is still possible, but this third form is used on a day-to-day basis.|$|E

The main Lanfranco, now at Alnwick Castle, is clearly related to the Domenichino, but has substantial differences, being in a horizontal format and with [...] none of the poses of the figures exactly the same, and several substantially different. [...] The possibility remains that Bellori was [...] "slightly mistaken" [...] and that the phantom Carracci Adoration was never painted and that Domenichino was only working from drawings by Carracci, who painted little after a serious illness in 1605, but did produce an etching of this subject in about 1606.|$|E

[...] Standing with Reagan, McCain said, [...] "This is an important, most important kind of expression of confidence in my ability to lead the party that I could have."

2500|$|During Wolfowitz's pre-war {{testimony}} before Congress, he dismissed General Eric K. Shinseki's {{estimates of the}} size of the post war occupation force which would be needed. General Shinseki testified to the US Senate Armed Services Committee on February 25, 2003 that [...] "something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers" [...] would probably be required for postwar Iraq. [...] By contrast, Wolfowitz estimated that fewer than 100,000 troops would be necessary in Iraq. Two days after Shinseki testified, Wolfowitz said to the House Budget Committee on February 27, 2003:There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of comment—some of it quite outlandish—about what our postwar requirements might be in Iraq. Some of the higher end predictions we have been hearing recently, such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq, are wildly off the mark. It is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of Saddam's security forces and his army—hard to imagine.|$|E
2500|$|Don Tallon first {{appeared}} as a wicket-keeper in 1933 and was a shock exclusion for the Ashes tour in 1938. In 1939 he equalled Ted Pooley's record by dismissing 12 batsman in a first class match and another when he held 7 catches in another match. He was 30 {{when he made his}} Test debut and proved to be an excellent keeper, but in his eagerness would move in front of the slips, denying them the full view of the ball. Tallon was also [...] "one of the most notorious appealers of all time" [...] and [...] "was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision which so greatly affected Washbrook". Tallon had scooped up a ball from the ground which the batsmen and other observers thought touched the ground, but having made the appeal Bradman backed Tallon and Washbrook was given out. However he improved on his performances and [...] Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "I have never seen a better keeper than Tallon as he was in England in 1948. Otherwise Australia had a fine fielding team which was younger and quicker than their English opponents. Bradman himself <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mid-fielder, but was probably restricted by fibrositis and was unable to field in the Second Test due to a pulled leg muscle. Keith Miller [...] "was a captain's dream, because he is alert, sure and fast in no matter what position he is placed". Ian Johnson and Colin McCool were noted slip fielders and Sid Barnes was a good catcher close to the wicket at short-leg.|$|E
