[...] Cox has added that, although he believes in some of the ethical reasons for vegetarianism, he is not strictly a vegan or even a vegetarian because he consumes oysters.|$|E
2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates both {{note how}} anyone would {{consider}} Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to {{his love of}} learning which [...] "trees and open country won't teach," [...] while [...] "men in the town" [...] will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading {{him out of his}} native land: [...] "Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for getting me out (dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (en bibliois) I don't <b>doubt</b> <b>you</b> can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please." ...|$|E

In my opinion, Dupin was a very {{inferior}} fellow... He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he {{was by no means}} such a phenomenon as Poe appears to imagine". Alluding to an episode in [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", where Dupin deduces what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, [...] Holmes remarks: [...] "That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial"; nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in [...] "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box".|$|E
2500|$|... 24-year-old Patrick Flynn {{was tried}} at Belfast Crown Court for double {{manslaughter}} {{and possession of}} explosives after his recovery from his injuries. Flynn was severely disfigured and badly scarred from the extensive burns the incendiary device had inflicted upon him. The judge was asked and agreed to take this into account for sentencing after reviewing the evidence and finding Flynn guilty due to his proximity to the explosion, his known IRA affiliation and the discovery of telephone numbers for The Samaritans and Belfast Central station in his jacket, {{to be used to}} telephone bomb warnings. Mr Justice Kelly sentenced Flynn to ten years prison for each manslaughter as well as seven years for the explosives offences, to be served concurrently. He concluded by summing up with the words:"I am satisfied beyond reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>you</b> were one of the bombers. I am satisfied you and your associates did not intend to kill. Nevertheless, the explosion and fire caused the death of three people in most horrific circumstances. In sentencing you I am conscious you have suffered severe burns and scars, {{for the rest of your}} life which will be a grim reminder to you of the events of that day." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Wei Shu, Guo Jia advised Cao Cao on how {{to handle}} Liu Bei when Liu Bei came to join Cao Cao in 196, after Lü Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu's general Zhang Fei. On Cao Cao's suggestion, Emperor Xian {{appointed}} Liu Bei as the Governor (牧) of Yu Province (豫州). Someone told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has the ambition of a hero. If you don't eliminate him now, he'll become a threat to you in the future." [...] Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, [...] "That's true. However, when you raised an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve under you based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to <b>doubt</b> <b>you</b> and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals? Therefore, it's imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining your good reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you." [...] Cao Cao laughed and said, [...] "I understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{is widely}} seen as an iconic and revolutionary figure in history of Ajax, Barça, and the Oranje. David Winner, the author of , wrote about Cruyff's {{influential}} career in the football world, [...] "There have been lots of brilliant football figures down the years, but none has been as significant as Johan Cruyff. As a player with Ajax, Barcelona and the Netherlands, he put himself in the pantheon along with greats such as Pelé, Diego Maradona, Ferenc Puskás, Lionel Messi and Zinedine Zidane. As coach at Ajax and Barcelona, he built thrilling sides, nurtured a remarkable number of genius players and influenced {{many of the most}} important teams in the world. The all-conquering Spain and Barcelona of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, brilliant Bayern Munich and Germany of today, AC Milan of the late 1980s and many other memorable champions would have been unthinkable without Cruyff. Once radical and revolutionary, Cruyffian principles have become standard throughout the modern game. His blueprint for developing young players has been copied all over the world." [...] Gabriele summed up Cruyff's footballing greatness: “There may have been better players {{in the history of the}} game, though I <b>doubt</b> <b>you</b> can count them on more than one hand. And there may have been better managers, too, if only because his coaching career only lasted 10 and a half years (during which he won 14 trophies, not a bad return). But it's tough to argue that any man has exerted a greater influence – on the pitch and on the bench – on the game as we know it today.” ...|$|E
