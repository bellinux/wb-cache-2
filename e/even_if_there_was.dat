SN, for SuperNova, is a standard prefix. Until 1987, two-letter designations were rarely needed; since 1988, however, they have been needed every year.|$|E

25|$|Some comic books, {{especially}} superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the {{exclamation point}} {{instead of the}} period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or {{they do not know}} what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.|$|E

However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, it would certainly have been logical to crown a successor before one's death to prevent a struggle for the crown.|$|E

500|$|In Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2004), the Court of Appeal {{considered}} whether law in Article 9(1) includes {{principles of}} customary international law. In that case, the appellant argued that effecting {{a death sentence}} for drug trafficking by hanging is unconstitutional {{as a form of}} cruel and inhuman punishment not [...] "in accordance with law". The Court agreed that there was a prohibition against torture and cruel and inhumane treatment in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that this is considered customary international law. However, a customary international law rule had to be [...] "clearly and firmly established" [...] before it was adopted by the courts, and there was insufficient practice among states to hold that death by hanging was within the ambit of this prohibition. Also, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a customary international law rule against death by hanging, domestic statutes would prevail in the event of conflict.|$|E
500|$|The LIRR's appeal {{took the}} case to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, for the Second Department, the state's {{intermediate}} appeals court. In its briefs before the Appellate Division, the LIRR argued that the verdict had been contrary to the law and the evidence. It stressed that it had no foreknowledge that the package was dangerous, and that no law required it to search the contents of passenger luggage. The brief stated that given this, there was no negligence in helping a man make a train, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> that negligence was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries. Wood, for Palsgraf, argued that the jury verdict finding negligence was supported by undisputed facts, and should not be questioned by the appellate courts. The plaintiff's brief also suggested that the failure of the railroad to call as witnesses the employees who had aided the man should decide any inferences of negligence against it. Wood deemed the trainmen guilty of a [...] "dereliction of duty", misconduct that was the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries.|$|E
500|$|Prosecutors {{agreed that}} Cisneros was guilty {{under the law}} of the parties - that she was guilty of the crime of murder even though she did not commit the crime directly. However, {{prosecutors}} failed to word her charge appropriately, suggesting that Cisneros [...] "directly" [...] hired Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez to murder Fischer instead of working through intermediaries. On February 14, a state appeals court in Corpus Christi ordered Cisneros released on a US$50,000 bond, about one-sixth of the original bond posted for her trial. The order stated that the prosecution did not agree to the bail, but the document stated they had failed to file the appropriate paperwork within the mandatory ten days. On February 22, a judge ordered her released from prison. She was unavailable for comment, and it was not known if she returned to Brownsville. Fischer's family denounced the ruling and said the appeals court [...] "seemed to have lost sight" [...] that their son was killed. Brownsville prosecutors said <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not enough evidence to convict Cisneros for capital murder, she could still be convicted of ordinary murder, since the appeal was approved because there was no direct evidence linking Cisneros with a murder-for-hire charge. The reversal was upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in November 1996.|$|E

500|$|The LIRR was {{entitled}} {{by law to}} take the case to the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) as there had been a dissent in the Appellate Division, and it did. The railroad argued again that Palsgraf had failed to establish that she had come to harm through the railroad's negligence: that there was no negligence, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> that neglect had not harmed Palsgraf, since such injury was not [...] "a natural and probable consequence of assisting a man to board a train". Its brief alleged that the trainmen could not have stopped the man from boarding, and once he had flung himself onto the train, {{had little choice but to}} help him, [...] "faced with such an emergency they cannot be charged with negligence because they elected to assist the man rather than stand idly by and leave him to his fate." [...] Wood, for his part, argued that negligence had been found by the jury, and by both majority and dissenting justices in the Appellate Division. He wrote that there were many facts from which the jury could have found negligence, including the fact that the train had not shut its doors as it departed (though whether this was to allow latecomers to board or because it was a summer day is uncertain). The case was argued before the Court of Appeals in Albany on February 24, 1928.|$|E
