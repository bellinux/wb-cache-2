He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with Münzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the Führer when his motorcade drove past a café the England team were dining in. The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team {{that they had}} to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6–3 with Matthews himself <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard having got the better of Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris.

5|$|The Palisades Interstate Parkway {{begins at}} the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Passengers from the upper level of the GWB can {{directly}} get on the PIP northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through GWB Plaza on US9W before <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parkway. Passengers riding northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near {{the northern tip of}} the island of Manhattan at the Harlem River. After this, the PIP parallels US9W and the Hudson River for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US9W, or within mere feet of the route. The PIP leaves New Jersey into New York in the borough of Rockleigh.|$|E
