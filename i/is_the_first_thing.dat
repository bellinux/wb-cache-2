In mediæval art, thought <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> execution the second; in modern art execution <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> and thought the second. And again, in mediæval art, truth is first, beauty second; in modern art, beauty is first, truth second. The mediæval principles led up to Raphael, and the modern principles lead down from him.|$|E
25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E
500|$|The {{households}} {{of medieval}} kings were {{in many ways}} simply aristocratic households on a larger scale: as the Burgundian court chronicler Georges Chastellain observed of the splendidly ordered court of the dukes of Burgundy, [...] "after the deeds and exploits of war, which are claims to glory, the household <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that strikes the eye, and which it is, therefore, most necessary to conduct and arrange well." [...] In some ways though, they were essentially different. One major difference was {{the way in which}} royal household officials were largely responsible for the governance of the realm, as well as the administration of the household.|$|E

2500|$|The Beatles' publicist, Derek Taylor, {{remembered that}} Paul McCartney had {{the name for}} the new company when he visited Taylor's company flat in London: [...] "We're {{starting}} a brand new form of business. So, what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that a child is taught when he begins to grow up? A is for Apple". McCartney then suggested the addition of Apple Core, {{but they could not}} register the name, so they used [...] "Corps" [...] (having the same pronunciation). McCartney later revealed that he had been inspired by René Magritte's painting, Le Jeu de Mourre, featuring an apple with the words [...] "Au revoir" [...] painted on it. Harriet Vyner’s 1999 book about the late lamented charismatic London art dealer Robert Fraser, [...] "Groovy Bob", contains this anecdote by McCartney about the first time he laid eyes on the painting that would inspire the company logo in 1967: ...|$|E
2500|$|Prophet Muhammed is {{reported}} to have said [...] "The first duty that Allah, the Supreme, has ordained upon my nation is that of offering Prayer, and indeed Prayer <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that will be taken account of on the Day of Resurrection." [...] as well as [...] "Whoever keeps the Prayer established, has kept his religion established - and whoever leaves Prayer has demolished religion (i.e. left the fold of Islam)". While, the Qur'an makes it clear that the purpose for creation is to worship Allah alone, and that the most excellent way of praying is to offer Salaah standing before Allah in devout obedience. The Islamic Adhaan (call for prayer) which is recited at time of each prayer contains two verses (each recited twice) [...] "Hayya’ala-Salaah" [...] and [...] "Hayya’ala-Falaah" [...] which translate to [...] "Come to Salaah" [...] and [...] "Come to success" [...] respectively, indicating that by performing Salaah, one may attain eternal success.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tactics of}} the Fulani were {{continually}} refined over time, as they gained more victories and themselves began to acquire numbers of horses for their own cavalry arm. Dan Fodio wrote on tactics employed by his forces as the jihad campaign unfolded: The infantry armed themselves with large shields (diraq) and carried long lances and javelin. Grouped into ranks, a spearman knelt on the left knee, holding his round shield before him. Behind the ranks of spearmen the archers stood ready. They were ordered to shoot at the enemy horse and men in chain mail (duru). As the enemy cavalry approached the infantry would launch its javelins and the archers would keep shooting. If the enemy wavered, the infantry formation would then part left and right, so that their own cavalry was unleashed in pursuit. The writings of Dan Fodio on tactics echo a sentiment that would be approved by many a military commander: [...] "Concentration <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> in victory: the beginning of defeat is dispersion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{whole process}} unravels when H arrives {{at its own}} number K. We will proceed with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...3214, and this number is unsuccessful. Then H {{increments}} N to produce K = 4355...3215, i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must by definition {{go on and on}} testing, ad infinitum, because it is [...] "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions. What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> the simulation will do? This simulation K-aka-H either creates a new N or “resets” the “old” N to 1. This [...] "K-aka-H" [...] either creates a new R or “resets” the “old” R to 0. Old-H “runs” new [...] "K-aka-H" [...] until it arrives at its 12th figure.|$|E
