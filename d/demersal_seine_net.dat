40|$|Demersal Seining is {{an active}} fishing method {{applying}} two long seine ropes and a <b>seine</b> <b>net.</b> <b>Demersal</b> seining relies on fish responding to the seine rope as it moves during the fishing process. The <b>seine</b> ropes and <b>net</b> are deployed in a specific pattern encircling an area on the seabed. In some variants of demersal seining the haul-in procedure includes a towing phase where the fishing vessel moves forward before starting to winch in the seine ropes. The initial seine rope encircled area, the gradual change in it during the haul-in process and the fish's reaction to the moving seine ropes {{play an important role}} in the catch performance of <b>demersal</b> <b>seine</b> fishing. The current study investigates this subject by applying computer simulation models for <b>demersal</b> <b>seine</b> fishing. The <b>demersal</b> <b>seine</b> fishing is dynamic in nature and therefore a dynamic model, SeineSolver is applied for simulating the physical behaviour of the seine ropes during the fishing process. Information about the seine rope behaviour is used as input to another simulation tool, SeineFish that predicts the catch performance of the <b>demersal</b> <b>seine</b> fishing process. SeineFish implements a simple model for how fish at the seabed reacts to an approaching seine rope. Here, the SeineSolver and SeineFish tools are applied to investigate catching performance for a Norwegian <b>demersal</b> <b>seine</b> fishery targeting cod (Gadus morhua) in the coastal zone. The effect of seine rope layout pattern and the duration of the towing phase are investigated. Among the four different layout patterns investigated, the square layout pattern was predicted to perform best; catching 69 %- 86 % more fish than would be obtained with the rectangular layout pattern. Inclusion of a towing phase in the fishing process was found to increase the catch performance for all layout patterns. For the square layout pattern, inclusion of a towing phase of 15 or 35 minutes increased the catch performance by respectively 37 % and 48 % compared to fishing without a towing phase. These results highlights the importance of the selected seine rope layout pattern and the duration of the towing phase when fishermen try to maximize the catch performance of their fishery. To our knowledge this is the first time the combination of models for the physical behaviour of seine ropes and for fish behaviour in response to seine rope movements have been applied to predict catch performance for demersal seining...|$|R

40|$|Demersal Seining is {{an active}} fishing method {{which is based on}} seine ropes and a <b>seine</b> <b>net.</b> The <b>seine</b> ropes and <b>net</b> are laid out on the fishing ground {{in a way that they}} {{encircle}} an aggregation of fish. Because the area the seine ropes encircle is much larger than area swept by the <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> during the hauling process, the catching efficiency of a <b>demersal</b> <b>seine</b> depends to a large extent on the herding efficiency of the seine ropes. During the fishing operation, the fish is gradually herded by the seine ropes into the path of the net. Knowledge about how the size and shape of the area encircled by the seine ropes gradually change during the fishing process is important for an efficient fishery. The purpose of the project ”Danish Seine: Computer based Development and Operation” (MAROFF- 2 project no. 225193 / FHF 900861), funded by Research Council of Norway (RCN) and Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF), is to develop software tools to investigate Danish Seine fishing. An important aspect of the research is to be able to simulate the physical behaviour of the seine ropes during the fishing process. This report describes flume tank experiments carried out with the purpose of later being able to validate a numerical simulation model for seine rope behaviour. The flume tank experiments were conducted by using two rope with varying physical properties and by varying the initial shape of ropes. The seine ropes were hauled back from the tank floor at different speeds. We applied a motion tracking system based on stereo vision with six underwater cameras to record the gradual change in the geometry of the area defined by the ropes. Information about the kinematic behaviour of the seine ropes and its dependency on its physical properties, initial layout pattern and hauling speed were acquired...|$|R

By 1895 there were eighty-four seines on the Columbia, and Robert Hume started hauling them with teams of horses. The seines were operated from day break to dawn around islands and along beaches. At Puget Sound salmon were caught by fishing boats using purse <b>seine</b> <b>nets.</b> Purse <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> are used to encircle a school of salmon and then trap them by drawing ("pursing") {{the bottom of the}} net together, as you would with a string purse. By 1905 the boats used engines for hauling the seine lines. In 1922 it was made illegal to use salmon purse seiners on and around the Columbia.

40|$|Exploratory {{investigations}} of optimal sampling designs are {{a critical component}} of the decision-making process in ecology where inherent natural variation can lead to erroneous conclusions if left unexamined. Pilot studies and exploratory analyses that investigate the precision of sampling regimes may reduce the chances of erroneous results and can be used to optimise processing time in larger ecological research programs. In our study, we calculated optimal precision estimates for sampling macroinvertebrates and ichthyofauna in surf-zone wrack accumulations by investigating the precision of the mean for sub-samples of <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> and also for the number of replicate <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> to guide future sampling regimes. We discovered that the processing time for individual <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> samples could be reduced by 50 % using sub-sampling and that time to process replicate <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> samples could be reduced by 25 % while maintaining acceptable precision. In future, we suggest that the use of pilot studies with similar exploratory approaches should be less of an exception and more {{a critical component of}} ecological investigations, particularly in under-studied or newly-developing areas of research. Further, these types of exploratory approaches are crucially important in a variety of extremely patchy environments where variability is likely to be high...|$|R
