40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>the</b> {{problem of}} <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control of hydrogen fueled {{internal combustion engine}} (H 2 ICE) using model predictive control (MPC) and sampled data control (SDC) theories. In the first step, results from SDC theory and a version of MPC are collectively employed to obtain a rigorously developed new generic control strategy. Here, a controller, based on a family of approximate discrete time models, is designed within a previously proposed framework to have guaranteed practical asymptotic stability of the exact (unknown) discrete time model. Controller design, accomplished using MPC theory, is facilitated by successive online linearizations of the nonlinear discrete time model at each sampling instant.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} two novel {{controller}} design methodologies <b>are</b> proposed for <b>the</b> design of regulation systems. <b>The</b> first methodology <b>is</b> a nonlinear controller design methodology {{for a class}} of regulating systems subject to quantitative time domain constraints. The time domain specifications appear as an allowable tolerance on the output deviations and allowable control effort. <b>The</b> design goal <b>is</b> to maximize <b>the</b> size of an external step disturbance beyond that of linear control which is also subject to time domain specifications. <b>The</b> controller design <b>is</b> executed in <b>the</b> frequency domain and <b>is</b> applicable when <b>the</b> frequency response of a linear design cannot satisfy the gain and phase characteristics required by the quantitative time domain specifications. The resulting gain and phase distortions associated with the sinusoidal input describing function (SIDF) of the dynamic nonlinear element are used to achieve the desirable open loop gain and phase characteristics required by the time domain constraints. The SIDF approach, automated by the Volterra Series, facilitates the nonlinear controller design. To illustrate the proposed nonlinear controller design technique, <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control of a 1992 Ford 4. 6 L V- 8 fuel injected engine subject to a nonmeasurable external torque load disturbance <b>is</b> employed. <b>The</b> controller performance <b>is</b> validated through experimental implementation, and, finally, closed loop bounded-input-bounded-output stability <b>is</b> assessed. ^ <b>The</b> second controller design methodology extends the notions of linear H∞ synthesis to a class of nonlinear systems modeled by a truncated Volterra series. <b>The</b> methodology <b>is</b> based on <b>the</b> selection of performance weights to trade-off between closed loop performance and the largest allowable disturbance which can enter a system. This proposed synthesis procedure <b>is</b> applied to <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control of a nonlinear model Ford 4. 6 L V- 8 fuel injection engine. A performance trade-off curve is then used to synthesize a linear feedback controller. To further enhance {{the performance of the}} synthesis methodology, a precompensator design procedure is presented which acts to linearize the nonlinearities in the plant. Issues regarding the implementation of a precompensator <b>are</b> also addressed. <b>The</b> effect of the precompensator on enlarging the bound on the largest allowable disturbance injected into the closed loop system is then quantified. ...|$|R

While the variation of the rotational speed of engine could sense the power shift of the load, it provides a new method to adjust the power matching between engine and pump through engine speed. Based on negative flux hydraulic system, an intelligent hydraulic excavator control system was designed based on rotational speed sensing method to improve energy efficiency. <b>The</b> control system <b>was</b> consisted of engine control module, pump power adjusted module, engine idle module and system fault diagnosis module. Special PLC with CAN bus was used to acquired the sensors and adjusts the pump absorption power according to load variation. Four energy saving control strategies with constant power method were employed to improve the fuel utilization. Three power modes (H, S and L mode) were designed to meet different working status; Auto idle function was employed to save energy through two work status detected pressure switches, 1300 rpm <b>was</b> setting as <b>the</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> according to <b>the</b> engine consumption fuel curve.
