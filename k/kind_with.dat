Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls.

5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some <b>kind,</b> <b>with</b> a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Chinese {{sentiment}} {{during the}} Cold War was largely {{the result of}} the Red Scare and McCarthyism. McCarthyism coincided with increased popular fear of communist espionage consequent to the Chinese Civil War and China's involvement in the Korean War.

Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, did in fact have a past or present connection of some <b>kind</b> <b>with</b> the Communist Party. But for the vast majority, both the potential for them to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous. Among these victims were Chinese Americans, who were suspected of being affiliated with the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China.|$|E

25|$|Regional {{differences}} in mortality rates {{were influenced by}} several factors, including the effects of migration and of natural disasters immediately prior to {{the onset of the}} famine. In general, excess mortality was higher in the east, even though the relative shortfall in the rice crop was worst in the western districts of Bengal. Eastern districts were relatively densely populated (and incidentally had higher Muslim populations), were closest to the Burma war zone, and normally ran grain deficits in pre-famine times. These also were subject to the boat denial policy and had relatively high jute production. Workers in eastern districts were more likely to receive monetary wages than payment in <b>kind</b> <b>with</b> a portion of the harvest, unlike in the western districts. When prices rose sharply, their wages failed to follow suit; this drop in real wages left them less able to purchase food.|$|E

Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and league system. The English top division, the Premier League, is the most watched football league in the world.

This attack would not kill many civilians, and leave the US with only a few ICBMs and bombers, along with the US Navy's Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) fleet. However, the SLBMs of that era were not accurate enough to attack missile silos, the US {{would not be able to}} respond with a counterforce attack against the substantial numbers of remaining Soviet ICBMs. The only option left would be a general attack on Soviet cities, which would cause the Soviets to respond in <b>kind</b> <b>with</b> their remaining fleet.

25|$|Continental {{emerged from}} {{bankruptcy}} on June 30, 1986, with improved asset and cash flow positions {{and a more}} competitive route structure with routes radiating to every large U.S. city from major hubs at Denver and Houston. Continental also began developing its Midwest hub at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in 1986, just as United Airlines began to transfer its Cleveland hub operations to Washington Dulles International Airport in Fairfax County, Virginia. In October 1986, American Airlines senior vice president Thomas G. Plaskett became the president and CEO of Continental Airlines. On February 1, 1987, People Express, Frontier, New York Air, and several commuter carriers were merged into Continental Airlines to create the third-largest U.S. airline (and sixth largest airline in the world) and led to Continental became an even larger player in the northeastern markets. However, the overnight merger of multiple airlines led to poor service that caused an initial loss of passengers. In July 1987, Plaskett was dismissed and Lorenzo returned to the position. 1987 saw the creation of Continental's OnePass frequent flier program (jointly with Eastern Airlines); and, in 1988, Continental formed its first strategic partnership (and the first international airline alliance of its <b>kind)</b> <b>with</b> Scandinavian Airlines.|$|E
25|$|A {{certain number}} of seats used for {{domestic}} purposes are of great interest. A {{good example of the}} long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the Musée Cluny, Paris. In the Museum at Rouen is a long seat of a movable <b>kind</b> <b>with</b> a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there {{is a good example of}} the typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th-12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth. The shadows, curves and twists only being emphasized by a few well-disposed cuts with a V tool; and of course the whole effect greatly improved by colour. A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, offer patterns that might well be imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the hackneyed Elizabethan forms.|$|E
25|$|Due to the fragmentary remains {{generally}} {{known for}} this family, its possible only describe some general {{aspects of the}} appearance and biology of Langstonia. As mentioned above, the fossil type of the species is larger than Sebecus icaeorhinus with jaws and teeth even more flattened, although its general proportions are reminiscent of this species, which suggests that their skull would be higher and laterally flattened, in contrast to modern crocodilians, which generally have a horizontally flattened skull with conical teeth. Teeth are of the zyphodont <b>kind,</b> <b>with</b> very flattened sides, slightly curved back and with serrated edges with small denticles (between 5-6 denticles per millimeter {{in the teeth of}} this genus) and also without any grooves on its surface. This type of teeth appears in the close relatives of sebecids, the peirosaurids and baurusuchids of the Cretaceous and some crocodilians of the Cenozoic as the pristichampsids and some mekosuchines. These forms were land animals that used their teeth to cut and tear their prey, because the traditional method of capture of the crocodiles, using its pressure force to retain and drown his victims is not viable on land; these crocodylomorphs also had more elongated limbs, stiff back, ideal to hold the weight and give strength to run. Langston had already suggested that these teeth were indicative that this animal had more terrestrial habits than those of existing species and the Miocene contemporary crocodylians, and in the modern world only could be vaguely compared with the less aquatic habits of the caimans of the genus Paleosuchus, which have a higher muzzle and a higher degree of ossification around the eye socket, so that they partially resemble sebecids. Busbey suggested the fact that his skull was high implied that these animals seek not to make pressure during the bite indefinitely, but to produce cuts then back quickly so that the bleeding weakens their prey slowly up to devour, similar to the current Komodo dragon, thereby adopting a strategy of stalking in areas where prey transit frequently.|$|E
