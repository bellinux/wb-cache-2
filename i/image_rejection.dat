40|$|We {{introduce}} a new supervised algorithm for <b>image</b> classification with <b>rejection</b> using multiscale contextual information. Rejection is desired in image-classification applications that require a robust classifier but not the classification of the entire image. The proposed algorithm combines local and multiscale contextual information with rejection, improving the classification performance. As a probabilistic model for classification, we adopt a multinomial logistic regression. The concept of rejection with contextual information is implemented by modeling the classification problem as an energy minimization problem over a graph representing local and multiscale similarities of the <b>image.</b> The <b>rejection</b> is introduced through an energy data term associated with the classification risk and the contextual information through an energy smoothness term associated with the local and multiscale similarities within the image. We illustrate the proposed method on the classification of images of H&E-stained teratoma tissues. Comment: 21 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

However, if fLO is set to fRF+fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO+fIF will also produce a heterodyne at fIF; the frequency [...] fLO+fIF is called the image frequency and must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage.

40|$|Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is {{commonly}} challenged by subject motion during data acquisition, which {{often leads to}} corrupted image data. Currently used procedure in DTI analysis is to correct or completely reject such data before tensor estimations, however assessing the reliability and accuracy of the estimated tensor in such situations has evaded previous studies. This work aims to define the loss of data accuracy with increasing <b>image</b> <b>rejections,</b> and to define a robust method for assessing reliability of the result at voxel level. We carried out simulations of every possible sub-scheme (N= 1, 073, 567, 387) of Jones 30 gradient scheme, followed by confirming the idea with MRI data from four newborn and three adult subjects. We assessed the relative error {{of the most commonly}} used tensor estimates for DTI and tractography studies, fractional anisotropy (FA) and the major orientation vector (V 1), respectively. The error was estimated using two measures, the widely used electric potential (EP) criteria as well as the rotationally variant condition number (CN). Our results show that CN and EP are comparable in situations with very few rejections, but CN becomes clearly more sensitive to depicting errors when more gradient vectors and images were rejected. The error in FA and V 1 was also found depend on the actual FA level in the given voxel; low actual FA levels were related to high relative errors in the FA and V 1 estimates. Finally, the results were confirmed with clinical MRI data. This showed that the errors after rejections are, indeed, inhomogeneous across brain regions. The FA and V 1 errors become progressively larger when moving from the thick white matter bundles towards more superficial subcortical structures. Our findings suggest that i) CN is a useful estimator of data reliability at voxel level, and ii) DTI preprocessing with data rejections leads to major challenges when assessing brain tissue with lower FA levels, such as all newborn brain, as well as the adult superficial, subcortical areas commonly traced in precise connectivity analyses between cortical regions...|$|R

However unlike the superheterodyne, the frequency of the local oscillator is not offset from, but identical to, the received signal's frequency.

In order to suppress local oscillator leakage and provide a slight amount of <b>image</b> <b>rejection,</b> a varactor and a coil provide one stage of tracking bandpass filtering.

50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or homodyne receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate-frequency (IF) stage between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an IF stage, and does not need an <b>image</b> <b>rejection</b> filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion RF front-end suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a homodyne receiver, control of IQ imbalance is necessary to limit signal demodulation error.|$|E

The radio receiver is responsive to any signal at its designed IF frequency, including unwanted signals. For example, with a LO tuned to 110 MHz, there are two incoming signal frequencies that can generate a 10 MHz IF frequency. A signal broadcast at 100 MHz (the wanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create the sum frequency of 210 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency at the desired 10 MHz. However, a signal broadcast at 120 MHz (the unwanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create a sum frequency of 230 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency also at 10 MHz.
