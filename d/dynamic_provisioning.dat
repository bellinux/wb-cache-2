40|$|The {{view that}} central banks must play {{a greater role}} in {{preserving}} financial stability has gained considerable ground {{in the aftermath of the}} crisis and macroprudential policy has become a central pillar to deal with financial stability. The policy frame of macroprudential policy, its toolbox and interactions with other policies is not completely established yet, though. In this context, Spain’s ten-year experience with its <b>dynamic</b> <b>provision</b> is a key reference. The analysis shows that, during the current financial crisis, <b>dynamic</b> <b>provisions</b> have proved useful to mitigate —to a limited extent— the build-up of risks and, above all, to provide substantial loss absorbency capacity to the financial institutions, suggesting that it could be an important tool for other banking systems. However, it is not the macro-prudential panacea: it needs to be complemented and be consistent with the rest of policies, either within the macro-prudential or in the broader context of macroeconomic management, including monetary policy. While there is a higher awareness of the contribution of monetary policy to financial stability, its role is in practice limited. The case of the euro area is particularly telling in this respect: macro-financial imbalances developed in sectors where financial integration was low and the effects hence were confined to the domestic economies. The asymmetry between a supranational monetary policy plus macroprudential surveillance and domestic implementation of macroprudential policies raises a set of issues which are worth exploring.

40|$|Risk-sensitive capital requirements, such {{as those}} {{established}} in Basel 2 / 3, and loan loss provisions based on incurred losses or on short-horizon expected losses, increase procyclicality in the banking system. They could, therefore, contribute to fuelling credit bubbles in good times, as rising risks are not properly covered either with capital or provisions, and credit crunches in bad times, as requirements are sharply increased {{to compensate for the}} former undercapitalisation and under-provisioning, and banks respond by cutting credit to households and firms.

40|$|Abstract — Batch schedulers {{commonly}} used to manage access to parallel computing clusters are not typically configured to enable easy configuration of application-specific scheduling policies. In addition, their sophisticated scheduling algorithms can be relatively expensive to execute. Thus, for example, applications that require the rapid execution of many small tasks often do not perform well. Frey proposed that these problems be overcome by separating the two tasks of provisioning and scheduling. The provisioning component uses batch submissions (Condor “schedd ” services in Frey’s work) to acquire resources for application execution. The scheduling component dispatches application tasks to those resources. We introduce here a <b>dynamic</b> resource <b>provisioning</b> Web Services-based architecture, DRP, and use this architecture to evaluate new methods designed to optimize both the <b>dynamic</b> resource <b>provisioning</b> and task scheduling within dynamically provisioning resource sets. The task scheduling is implemented in a separate system DeeF, a distributed execution environment framework, which has DRP integrated to offer the necessary <b>dynamic</b> resource <b>provisioning</b> for generic execution of arbitrary codes on the DRP managed resources. Based on our performance evaluation, DRP can allocate resources {{in less than a}} minute after which a pool of resources can be maintained, increased, and decreased based on the load of the application using DRP. Our execution framework DeeF can process 100 K fine granular tasks in 160 seconds; in such a high throughput workload, the overhead per task is 1. 6 ms per task, a low enough cost that DeeF and DRP can enable a wide range of applications to run significantly more efficiently, due to efficient task dispatch and the <b>dynamic</b> resource <b>provisioning</b> that makes the compute resource management trivial from the application’s viewpoint. We also address the performance implications various security mechanisms have on the execution framework and the <b>dynamic</b> resource <b>provisioning.</b> Index Terms — <b>dynamic</b> resource <b>provisioning,</b> batch scheduler, interactive resource usage, Grid computin...|$|R
