This process is called multi-pass drawing and {{involves}} <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> smaller and smaller die openings. Material is generally annealed between each drawing pass to remove cold work and to increase ductility.|$|E
500|$|In 1919 Kanae {{founded the}} Japan Children's Free Drawing Association and {{held its first}} exhibition. [...] The public was {{impressed}} by its democratic ideals, as the idea of democratic education was gaining momentum in Japan during the Taishō period (1912–26). [...] Kanae propounded the importance of teaching students freedom, without which they cannot grow, and denigrated the tradition of teaching <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> copying. [...] He promoted this ideas in 1921 with the book Free Drawing Education and the monthly magazine Education of Arts and Freedom. [...] Kanae's methods were widely adopted, and it became common for teachers to take students outdoors to draw from nature. [...] These ideas did not escape criticism, {{and the rise of}} militarism in Japan put an end to Kanae's movement in 1928; {{it was not to be}} revived until after World WarII.|$|E
2500|$|In medieval England as well, those {{convicted of}} high treason were paraded {{through the streets}} in an open wagon to their executions. Originally they had been dragged by horses, but some arrived almost dead from that treatment, unable to live through the hanging, castration, disemboweling and drawing and {{quartering}} that followed. While being transported, they were often pelted with objects thrown at them by onlookers. [...] "This was a symbolic process that led the criminal to oblivion," [...] observed Charles Spencer in Killers of the King, his 2014 account of the regicides of Charles I, {{many of whom were}} executed this way. [...] "The <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> the streets provided a final, degrading journey from the living world." ...|$|E

60|$|Still {{she did not}} go, {{and there}} was an {{interval}} in which she had the air of vaguely waiting. To Westover's vision, the young people still passing to and from the ballroom were like the painted figures of a picture quickened with sudden animation. There were scarcely any elders to be seen now, except the chaperons, who sat in their places with iron fortitude; Westover realized that he was the only man of his age left. He felt that the lights ought to have grown dim, but the place was as brilliant as ever. A window had been opened somewhere, and the cold breath of the night was <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> the heated rooms.|$|E
60|$|From the top I had a {{good view}} of the offing, and of the coast for leagues. We were now quite a mile at sea, and, though the tide was no longer of any use to us, we were <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> the water quite at the rate of two knots. I thought that the flood had made, and that it took us a little on our lee-bow, hawsing us up to windward. Just as I had got the last lanyard fastened, the canoes began to appear, coming round the island by the farther passage, and {{promising}} to overtake us in the course of the next twenty minutes. The crisis demanded decision, and I determined to get the jib on the ship. Accordingly, I was soon on deck.|$|E
60|$|When they at last {{got tired}} of the kitchen, {{they went to a}} window at {{the back side of the}} sitting-room, which looked out toward the garden, and {{commanded}} also a beautiful prospect beyond. They opened this window in order to see the garden better. A fresh and delightful breeze came in immediately, which the children enjoyed very much. The breeze, however, in <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> the house, shut all the doors which the children had left open, with a loud noise, and then having no longer any egress, it ceased to come in. The air seemed suddenly to become calm; the children stood for some time at the window, looking out at the garden, and at the pond, and the mountains beyond.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, {{you can get}} a good, stout knitting-needle for a beam. Tie a silk thread {{around the}} middle of it to hold it up by, and slip it along until you get it so that the needle will exactly balance. Then for scales, you must cut out two round pieces of thin pasteboard. Then take three threads for each scale, and run them through the pasteboard, near the edge, and at equal {{distances}} from each other. You must tie knots at the lower ends of the threads to keep them from <b>drawing</b> <b>through.</b> Then you must gather the other ends of the threads together, about half a foot from the pasteboard, and tie them {{to the ends of the}} knitting-needle, one on each side; and that will make a very respectable pair of scales for you." ...|$|E
60|$|They found a {{clump of}} bushy hollies which afforded a shelter from the wind, and sat down under it, some tufts of dead fern, crisp and dry, that {{remained}} from the previous season forming a sort of nest for them. But it was cold, nevertheless, on this March night, particularly for Grace, who with the sanguine prematureness of youth in matters of dress, had considered it spring-time, and hence was not so warmly clad as Mrs. Charmond, who still wore her winter fur. But after sitting a while the latter lady shivered no less than Grace as the warmth imparted by her hasty walking began to go off, and they felt the cold air <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> the holly leaves which scratched their backs and shoulders. Moreover, they could hear some drops of rain falling on the trees, though none reached the nook {{in which they had}} ensconced themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... “Don’t lie, you black rascal!” cried Richard, {{stepping}} on the snow- bank {{to measure the}} distance from his lash to the negro’s back; “speak truth, or I trounce you.” While speaking, the stock was slowly rising in Richard’s right hand, and the lash <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> his left, in the scientific manner with which drummers apply the cat; and Agamemnon, after turning each side of himself toward his master, and finding both equally unwilling to remain there, fairly gave in. In a very few words he made his master acquainted with the truth, {{at the same time}} earnestly conjuring Richard to protect him from the displeasure of thc lodge I’ll do it, boy, I’ll do it,” cried the other, rubbing his hands with delight; “say nothing, but leave me to manage ‘Duke. I have a great mind to leave the deer on the hill, and to make the fellow send for his own carcass; but no, I will let Marmaduke tell a few bounces about it before I come out upon him. Come, hurry in, Aggy, I must help to dress the lad’s wound; this Yankee* doctor knows nothing of surgery—I had to hold out Milligan’s leg for him, while he cut it off.|$|E

6000|$|... 'There is no {{saying how}} much I rejoice that I {{can write to}} you and [...] Lucy again under the same roof. I hope soon to see you {{together}} [...] again, and revive old times, but we are delayed by the discovery that [...] the swamp lying full in the Grand Ottawa and Superior Line is [...] impracticable, and would not only be the death of all the navvies [...] employed thereon, but would swallow bodily the funds of the G. O. and [...] S. Company. So we are carrying our survey in other directions, [...] before making out our report, after which I hope to be permanently [...] engaged on the construction. This will give me three months to spend [...] at home, in knitting up old links, and considering how to dispose of [...] my poor little encumbrance till I can set him {{to make his way}} here. [...] You or Lucy would perhaps look out for some lady who takes Indian [...] children, or the like. I am my own man now, and can provide the [...] wherewithal, for my personal expenses are small, and engineering is [...] well paid. Lucy must not think of bringing him out, for even at her [...] fastest the Far West would be no place for her. Let her think of [...] Glendalough, and realize that if she were here she would look back on [...] it as a temple of comfort, civilization, and civility, and this place [...] is the last attempt at social habitation for 200 and odd miles. It [...] stands on a lake of its own, with an Indian name, [...] "which no man can [...] speak and no man can spell." [...] It is colonial to the highest degree, [...] and inhabited by all denominations, chiefly agreed in worshipping us [...] as priests of the G. O. and S. Line, which is to make their fortune; [...] and for their manners, least said soonest mended, though there are [...] some happy exceptions, French Canadian, Lowland Scots, etc. and a [...] wiry hard-working parson, whose parish extends nearly to Lake [...] Superior, and whose remaining aroma of University is refreshing. [...] There is also a very nice young lad, whose tale may be a moving [...] example of what it is to come out here expecting to find in the [...] backwoods Robinson Crusoe's life and that of the Last of the Mohicans [...] combined. That is, it was not he, but his father, Major Randolf, an [...] English officer, who, knowing nothing of farming, less of Canada, and [...] least of all of speculation, got a grant of land, where he speculated [...] only to lose, and got transferred to this forlorn tract, only to [...] shiver with ague and die of swamp fever. During the twenty-five [...] years of this long agony, he had contrived to have two wives, the [...] first of whom left this son, whom he educated as a scholar, intending [...] to finish him in England when the tide should turn, but whereas it [...] never did, he must needs get a fresh partner into the whirlpool, a [...] Yankee damsel out of a boarding-house. By the time she had had a [...] couple of children, he died, and the whole weight remains bound about [...] young Randolf's neck, tying him down to work for dear life in this [...] doleful spot, without a farthing of capital, no stock, no anything. [...] I came upon the clearing one day {{in the course of my}} surveying, and [...] never did I see Gone to the Dogs more clearly written on any spot; [...] the half-burnt or overthrown trees lying about overgrown with wild [...] vines and raspberries, the snake fence broken down, the log-house [...] looking as if a touch would upset it, and nothing hopeful but a [...] couple of patches of maize and potatoes, and a great pumpkin climbing [...] up a stump. My horse and myself were done up, so I halted, and was [...] amazed at the greeting I received from the youth, who was hard at [...] work on his hay, single-handed, except for the two children tumbling [...] in it. The lady in her rocking-chair was contrast enough to make me [...] heartily glad to find that she was his stepmother, not his wife. [...] Since that, I have seen a good deal of him; he comes to Lakeville, [...] five miles across the bush and seven across the lake, to church on [...] Sunday, and spends the day with the parson, and Mr. Currie has given [...] him work in our press of business, and finds him so effective, that [...] he wants to take him on for good; but this can't be while he has got [...] these three stones about his neck, for whom he works harder and lives [...] worse than any day-labourer at Hiltonbury; regular hand to mouth, no [...] chance of making a start, unless the Company will fortunately decide [...] on the line I am <b>drawing</b> <b>through</b> the heart of his house, which will [...] force them to buy him out of it. I go out to-morrow to mark the said [...] line for Mr. Currie to report upon, and will finish my letter to [...] travel with said report.|$|E
