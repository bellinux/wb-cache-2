25|$|Mild to {{moderate}} fires burn {{in the forest}} understory, removing small trees and herbaceous groundcover. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns {{of the trees and}} kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any <b>ground</b> <b>fuel</b> support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates complex early seral forest habitat, or snag forest with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil. Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as climate and topography {{play an important role in}} determining fire severity and fire extent. Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.|$|E
2500|$|... 26 March 1939 – Braniff Trip 1, {{operating}} from Chicago to Brownsville, Texas, crashed on takeoff from Oklahoma City Municipal Air Terminal, today known as Will Rogers World Airport. Early that March morning, the aircraft, a Douglas DC-2, registration NC13727, suffered {{an explosion in}} the left engine that, in turn, caused the engine's cowling to open up, creating serious drag on the left wing. The flight's captain, Claude Seaton, struggled to keep the aircraft stable while turning back for an emergency landing at Oklahoma City. The aircraft's compromised wing hit an embankment on the section line road forming the airport's western boundary and cartwheeled across the ground. Seaton ordered the aircraft's fuel to be cut off, but in vain, as, when the plane came to rest on the <b>ground,</b> <b>fuel</b> came in contact with the still-hot engines and caught fire. Seaton and First Officer Malcolm Wallace were thrown free on impact and survived with serious injuries, which ended the flying career of the captain. Flight attendant Louise Zarr and seven passengers died in the post-crash fire.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred years}} of fire {{suppression}} in a mixed-conifer forest which evolved with frequent natural fires has shifted successional patterns, increased the density of small trees, produced an unnatural accumulation of <b>ground</b> <b>fuels.</b> Analysis of species composition, vegetation structure and age distribution in each of four forest types within the mixed-conifer zone of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, California, has documented {{a substantial increase in}} young, shade tolerant white fir in each type. The original dominant species have decreased in relative abundance in most cases. The sequioa type has been most affected by the fire suppression policy. Giant sequioa show poor reproduction in the absence of fire. The sequoia type also exhibits the greatest accumulation of <b>ground</b> <b>fuels.</b> The ponderosa pine, white fir and mixed forest types also show successional changes as well as significant accumulations of flammable <b>ground</b> <b>fuels</b> following a century of fire exclusion.

40|$|Abstract. A physics-based {{computational}} model was utilised {{to better understand}} the interactions of fires generated by burning of neighbouring shrubs. The model included large-eddy simulation for flow field turbulence and a two-phase approach for the coupling of solid fuel and gas phases. Two different arrangements consisting of two and three identical shrubs placed adjacent to each other were considered. All shrubs were simultaneously ignited from their base with the aid of separate <b>ground</b> <b>fuels.</b> Both crown and <b>ground</b> <b>fuels</b> were modelled as porous media with thermophysical properties of chamise and excelsior respectively. Modelling results indicated that the peakmass-loss rate and the vertical fire spread rate within a shrub decrease when the shrub separation distance increases. At zero separation, heat release rate normalised by the number of shrubs is enhanced by 5 and 15 % for the two-shrub and the three-shrub arrangements, respectively. Generation of strong vorticity by higher gravitational torque appeared to be the cause for enhanced burning in the three-shrub arrangement. This effect was seen to be much weaker for the two-shrub arrangement. Interactions between the individual fires cease for a centre-to-centre distance of 1. 5 and 2 times the shrub diameter for the two-shrub and the three-shrub arrangement respectively...|$|R
40|$|Variation in the {{structure}} of <b>ground</b> <b>fuels,</b> i. e. the moss and litter (M/L) layer, may be an important control on fire severity in heather moorlands and thus influence vegetation regeneration and soil carbon dynamics. We completed experimental fires in a Calluna vulgaris-dominated heathland to study the role of the M/L layer in determining (i) fire-induced temperature pulses into the soil and (ii) post-fire soil thermal dynamics. Manually removing the M/L layer before burning increased fire-induced soil heating, both at the soil surface and 2 cm below. Burnt plots where the M/L layer was removed simulated the fuel structure after high severity fires where <b>ground</b> <b>fuels</b> are consumed but the soil does not ignite. Where the M/L layer was manually removed, either before or after the fire, post-fire soil thermal dynamics showed larger diurnal and seasonal variation, as well as similar patterns to those observed after wildfires, compared to burnt plots where the M/L layer was not manipulated. We used soil temperatures to explore potential changes in post-fire soil respiration. Simulated high fire severity (where the M/L layer was manually removed) increased estimates of soil respiration in warm months. With projected fire regimes shifting towards higher severity fires, our results can help land managers develop strategies to balance ecosystem services in Calluna-dominated habitats...|$|R

30|$|Most {{reported}} {{applications of}} fire-use in the coast redwood forest were targeted at grasslands or oak woodlands. These fires were intentionally ignited and certainly burned {{into the surrounding}} areas. Coast redwood forests have the highest canopy cover, height, and densities for any vegetation type in the Santa Cruz Mountains and such characteristics influence their local microclimate (Dawson 1998). Specific microclimate changes include increases in relative humidity, decreases in surface air temperatures, and reduction in ground level windspeeds. Surface and <b>ground</b> <b>fuels</b> would subsequently have higher moisture contents in coast redwood forests {{when compared to the}} surrounding grasslands and oak savannahs.|$|R
50|$|Supporters {{of the law}} {{contend that}} this will reduce {{wildfire}} risk by thinning overstocked stands, clearing away vegetation and trees to create shaded fuel breaks, providing funding and guidance to reduce or eliminate hazardous fuels in National Forests, improving forest fire fighting, and researching new methods to halt destructive insects. To proponents, much of {{the basis for the}} law revolves around the overcrowding of forests due to the suppression of low intensity fires.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the structural characteristics of vegetation in the Los Alamos region, the authors conducted two years of field surveys and associated analyses. This report introduces field methods, lists the summarized field data, and discusses the results of preliminary spatial analyses. During 1998 and 1999, seventy-six terrestrial plant communities were sampled for topographic characteristics, soil surface features, and vegetational conditions. A nested, randomized design was used to select the plot locations and to guide the sampling of the plot. The samples included a variety of fuel types, including surface <b>fuels</b> and <b>ground</b> <b>fuels,</b> shrubby and small tree fuels, and overstory fuels. Species composition data were also collected. The fuels data were summarized by vegetation type and evaluated for the topographic and spatial relationships of major field categories. The results of these analyses indicate {{that many of the}} fuels categories depend on topographic factors in a linear and curvilinear fashion. In particular, middle elevations within the Los Alamos region tend to support more surface <b>fuels</b> and <b>ground</b> <b>fuels,</b> whereas large-diameter trees are most dense at higher elevations and are specific to community types at these elevations. Small-diameter trees occur in more dense stands at lower and middle elevations and on specific soil and topographic conditions. Areas that burned in 1954 were found to be relatively free of fuels. The implications are that the western portions of the Los Alamos region are at risk from wildfire during dry, summer periods...|$|R
50|$|This stove may be {{built from}} a {{discarded}} tin can {{of any size}} by removing {{the top of the}} can, punching several small holes near the upper edge, and a larger opening {{on the side of the}} can near the bottom, for fuel and air. The bottom of the can is generally left in place, as this yields a stronger stove structure and minimizes spread of fire to combustible material on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Fuel</b> is placed in the can and ignited. Convection draws air in through the bottom/side orifice, and heat emerges from the top. A cooking vessel may be placed on the top. The bottom/side hole may face the wind for more heat or it may be partially covered with scrap metal if the fire is too hot.|$|E
5000|$|A third {{concept of}} Defensible Space is [...] "Fuel Ladder" [...] management. Like rungs on a ladder, {{vegetation}} can {{be present at}} varying heights from groundcovers to trees. <b>Ground</b> <b>fuel</b> 'rungs' such as dried grasses, can transmit fire to shrub rungs, which then transmit up tree branch rungs into the tree canopy. A burning tree produces embers that can blow to new areas spreading and so {{making it more difficult}} to control a wildland fire. One guideline is for a typical separation of three times the height of the lower fuel to the next fuel ladder. For example, a 2 ft shrub under a tree would need a spacing of 6 ft to the lowest limbs of the tree. Since wildfires burn faster uphill than on flat land, fuel ladder spacing may need to be greater for slopes.|$|E

Here we present a post-burn assessment of a fire on a lowland raised bog in Co. Offaly, Ireland (All Saints Bog).

50|$|In the wild, many trees {{depend on}} fire as a {{successful}} way to clear out competition and release their seeds. In particular, the Giant sequoia depends on fire to reproduce: the cones of the tree open after a fire releases their seeds, the fire having cleared all competing vegetation. Due to fire suppression efforts during the early and mid 20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires also led to <b>ground</b> <b>fuel</b> build-up and the dense growth which posed the risk of catastrophic wildfires.

Eucalyptus regnans or Mountain Ash of Australia also depends on fire but in a different fashion. They carry their seeds in capsules which can deposit at any time of the year. Being flammable, during a fire the capsules drop nearly all of them and the fire consumes the Eucalypt adults, but most of the seeds survive using the ash as a source of nutrients; at their rate of growth, they quickly dominate the land and a new Eucalyptus forest grows.|$|E
30|$|D. Kailidis (1972) {{reports that}} from 1956 to 1971 {{the average number}} of {{wildfires}} registered all over Greece per year amounted to 612, and had destroyed, on average, 10 150 ha of forest and brushlands, with an estimated damage of about $ 7 336 000.

More than 60 percent of the total burnt area is coniferous forest of Pinus halepensis and P. brutia of the lower Mediterranean zone, and maquis and garrigues formations. The surface burnt and losses from wildfires would be much greater, if forests in this zone were not broken in relatively small size stands by the interval of non-forested land.

40|$|Temperate {{peatland}} wildfires are {{of significant}} environmental concern but {{information on their}} environmental effects is lacking. We assessed variation in burn severity and fuel consumption within and between wildfires that burnt British moorlands in 2011 and 2012. We adapted the Composite Burn Index (pCBI) to provide semi-quantitative estimates of burn severity. Pre- and post-fire surface (shrubs and graminoids) and ground (litter, moss, duff) fuel loads associated with large wildfires were assessed using destructive sampling and analysed using a Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Consumption during wildfires was compared with published estimates of consumption during prescribed burns. Burn severity and fuel consumption were related to fire weather, assessed using the Canadian Fire Weather Index System (FWI System), and pre-fire fuel structure. pCBI varied 1. 6 fold between, and up to 1. 7 fold within, wildfires. pCBI was higher where moisture codes of the FWI System indicated drier fuels. Spatial variation in pre- and post-fire fuel load accounted for a substantial proportion {{of the variance in}} fuel loads. Average surface fuel consumption was a linear function of pre-fire fuel load. Average <b>ground</b> <b>fuel</b> combustion completeness could be predicted by the Buildup Index. Carbon release ranged between 0. 36 and 1. 00 kg C m− 2.
