2500|$|Both the cognoscenti and {{the public}} adored him. The {{librettist}} Paolo Rolli, a close friend and supporter of Senesino, commented: [...] "Farinelli has surprised me so much that I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had hitherto heard {{only a small part}} of the human voice, and now have heard it all. He has besides, the most amiable and polite manners ...." [...] Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: [...] "One God, one Farinelli!" [...] and was immortalised in a detail of Plate II of William Hogarth's [...] "A Rake's Progress" [...] (she may also appear in Plate IV of his series [...] "Marriage à la mode" [...] of 1745).|$|E
2500|$|Morton's {{claim to}} have invented jazz in 1902 aroused resentment. The jazz historian, musician, and {{composer}} Gunther Schuller says of Morton's [...] "hyperbolic assertions" [...] that there is [...] "no proof to the contrary" [...] and that Morton's [...] "considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation". Alan Lomax, who recorded extensive biographical interviews of Morton at the Library of Congress in 1938, did not agree that Morton was an egoist: In being called a supreme egotist, Jelly Roll was often a victim of loose and lurid reporting. If we read the words that he himself wrote, we learn that he almost had an inferiority complex {{and said that he}} created is own style of jazz piano because [...] "All my fellow musicians were much faster in manipulations, I thought than I, and I did not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was in their class." [...] So he used a slower tempo to permit flexibility through the use of more notes, a pinch of Spanish to give a number of right seasoning, the avoidance of playing triple forte continuously, and many other points". --Quoted in John Szwed, Dr Jazz.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{lost all}} close relatives, {{he moved in}} with his mother's family (the Kurodas). However, in January 1916, he moved into a {{boarding}} house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) {{to which he had}} formerly commuted by train. Through many of Kawabata’s works the sense of distance in his life is represented. He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation. In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote: “I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> have never held a woman’s hand in a romantic sense Am I a happy man deserving of pity?”. Indeed, this {{does not have to be}} taken literally, but it does show the type of emotional insecurity that Kawabata felt, especially experiencing two painful love affairs at a young age. One of those painful love episodes was with Hatsuyo Ito ( [...] , 1906-1951) whom he met when he was 20 years old. His unsent love letter to her was recently found at his former residence in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. According to Kaori Kawabata, Kawabata's son-in-law, an unpublished entry in the author's diary mentions that Hatsuyo was raped by a monk at the temple she was staying at, which led her to break off their engagement.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Honora. [...] "I {{should want}} to go on and see {{everything}} in the world worth seeing. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> positively <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should die if I had to stay here in St. Louis." ...|$|R
5000|$|In The American Conservative, Weiss {{detailed}} his {{split from}} The Observer and wrote [...] "Blogging about such matters sometimes made me <b>feel</b> wicked, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was betraying my tribe.

2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hide that!" [...] he whispered, [...] "hide that, lest {{it should}} bewitch me. Indeed, already I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were being bewitched. It is the Great Medicine itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want to get}} away. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{at moments}} <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could bolt for it.... Silly, isn't it? Undisciplined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're parting--as people {{part in a}} play. It's distressing. But <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you and <b>I</b> {{were really}} never {{to see each other}} again for years. Do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{landed the}} job all right," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "but I {{feel like a}} crook. I don't know {{how in the world}} I ever came to stand for those letters of recommendation. They were the things that got me the job all right, but <b>I</b> {{honestly}} <b>feel</b> just <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had stolen something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> {{were going}} to die," [...] he {{answered}} hoarsely. [...] "My head is splitting, my body is trembling, and I am as sick as a cat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no heart}} for it, Mildred, I don't <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could work; and, if you cannot make me forget, I am sure I {{do not know}} what will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I revere {{him as a}} saint, and <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> drew my {{sword in}} a holy cause when I fight for him," [...] said Leonard, raising himself with {{glittering}} eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} there is none," [...] he continued. [...] "I feel, Mrs. Fenwick, that I do {{not know what to do}} with myself or how to hold myself. Of course it is {{nonsense}} to talk about dying, but <b>I</b> do <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> if <b>I</b> didn't die I should go crazy. I can't settle my mind to a single thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No ship!" [...] he repeated, {{and seemed}} to forget my denial forthwith. [...] "I suppose," [...] said he slowly, [...] "we're both dead. But the rummy part is <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> just <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> still had a body. Don't {{get used to it}} all at once, I suppose. The old shop was struck by lightning, I suppose. Jolly quick thing, Bellows--eigh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Algernon," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "you know that I am not very scrupulous. We {{both of us}} want success--a certain sort of success--and we have both of us been content to pay the price. You have {{spent a good deal}} of money and you have succeeded very well indeed. Somehow or other, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> to-day <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were {{spending}} more than money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O gin I {{could see}} a {{mountain}} top again, I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could lay me down and die content. What garred ye come daundering to these weary flats of France?' ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{walked on}} in silence to the door. As they stood there he said: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> {{were about to}} say good-bye to you forever, and it makes my heart ache." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man will}} tell you what has happened. I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was [...] mad. I do not know who to send to. Will you come to me, only for [...] a few minutes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no idea," [...] Clara answered. [...] "All that I {{do know is}} that he {{has gone}} away for three weeks, and that I am going to stay with the Duchess till he comes back. It is very nice of her, and all that, of course, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> rather <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were going into prison. The Duchess isn't exactly the modern sort of chaperon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a fancy of mine," [...] he said, smiling, [...] "to {{say goodbye}} to you all here. You {{see that there is}} nothing in this room which is not really the product of Japan. Here <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> indeed, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had crossed the seas and were back under the shadow of my own mountains. Here I feel, indeed, your host, {{especially}} as I am going to distribute my treasures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{say that}} I do," [...] he admitted. [...] "I've got {{a sort of}} feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I'd been all tied-up like, lately. Haven't been able to enjoy myself properly, and gone mooning about after shadows. To-night <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> just <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were coming into my own again a bit. I say," [...] he added, admiringly, [...] "you do look stunning! Come and have some supper--no one will know--and let me drive you home afterwards. Do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Privately I did not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were {{answered}} {{at all and}} I was sure that I know {{nothing of the kind}} she indicated, but thinking it best to leave the subject, I went on, ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{the clear}} dark holds up unblemished. The only warning is the {{electric}} skin-tension (I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were a lace-maker's pillow) and an irritability which the gibbering of the General Communicator increases almost to hysteria.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "I like it very much; {{it is so}} restful, and I sleep sound {{upon that}} cartel. I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should like to trek on {{for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much {{the same}} as usual. In fact, he is saying his prayers in the corner, looking like a melancholy brigand with rifles, revolvers, and knives stuck all over him. I wish he wouldn't say his prayers," [...] added Higgs, and his voice reached me in an indignant squeak; [...] "it makes me <b>feel</b> uncomfortable, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> ought to join him. But not having been brought up a Dissenter or a Moslem, I can't pray in public as he does. Hullo! Wait a minute, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ours {{was such}} a {{marriage}} of convenience," [...] she went on, [...] "and you were so very plain-spoken about it, Henry. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were breaking a compact when I turn round and ask you whether {{it is not possible}} that we might be, perhaps, some day, a little more to one another. You know why I am almost afraid to say this. It has not been with you as it has been with me. I have always felt that she has been there--Pauline." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I did," [...] he {{answered}} simply. [...] "My common sense {{tells me that}} I have chosen well, and then sometimes, in the nights, or when I am alone, other thoughts come to me, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had been faithless, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had simply chosen the easier way. Look how pleasant it is all being made for me! I am no longer an outcast; I bask in the sun of your uncle's patronage; people ask me to dinner, seek my friendship, people whom I feel ought to hate me. I am not sure about it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last, just as I was {{beginning}} to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were being mesmerised, a move was made. Without the slightest warning, {{a man from the}} other side of the circle called out in a loud voice-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can’t {{tell you}} any more," [...] ses Miss Gill, [...] "and I wouldn’t ’ave {{told you that}} only you asked me, and somehow I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> ’ave to tell you things, when you want me to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps. I hope so, Godfrey, but {{at present}} I often <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} in nothing, except that I am I {{and you are}} you, and my father is--there he's calling me. Goodbye," [...] and she was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "The days here," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "have {{been very}} pleasant. It has all been--such a {{different}} life for me. A {{few months ago}} I knew no one except {{a few of the}} Medchester people, and was working hard to make a modest living. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> here <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were a modern Aladdin. There is a sense of unreality about Lord Arranmore's extraordinary kindness to me. To-night, more than ever, I cannot help feeling that it is something like a dream which may pass away at any moment." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{we played}} the Christmas pageant together, who would you be this year? ...This year I would be the donkey, I suppose. I would be a donkey {{who used to be}} a warrior horse. The ravages of failure, age and illness, though, have {{transformed}} me into something more humble and comical — and I say that with no disrespect toward donkeys. It <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> maybe <b>I</b> am only beginning to understand what it means to carry the promised Christ on my back. Only just beginning to understand this remarkable journey, but even in my stubborn single-mindedness I have been invited to a place of honour on the journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is doubtless {{known to}} you," [...] the Count continued, [...] "and {{the story of}} my life, which, I am proud to remember, is closely {{interwoven}} with the history of your Order. Your faces, alas! are strange to me. My old comrades, whom, I had hoped to meet, and whose sympathy I had counted on, are no more. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> somewhat <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had stepped out of the shadows of a bygone life, and everything is a little strange to me. I have grown unaccustomed even to speech itself. You must pardon me if I do not make myself understood with ease. The past seems very, very far away." ...|$|R
