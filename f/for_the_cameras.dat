5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned {{out the window to}} direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|E
5|$|The P variant {{had similar}} {{features}} to the Do 17M-1, with added blind flying and camera equipment for reconnaissance work. The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines {{with a maximum}} performance of 865PS (853hp, 636kW) each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (Funkgerät), the PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - Funkblindlandegerät). The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom (EiV -Eigenverständigungsanlage). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} {{transmitted}} {{in black and}} white {{for the majority of the}} 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> could not be found and the footage was shot {{in black and white}}. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like BBC1, the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.|$|E
25|$|F. G. Miles, chiefly {{responsible}} for its design and manufacture, built the replica Bristol Boxkite with the original standard twin rudder installation and powered the replica with a Rolls-Royce-manufactured version of the 65hp Continental A65. In the course of testing, Wheeler had a third rudder inserted between the other two (some original Boxkites also had this fitting) to improve directional control, and substituted a more powerful 90hp Rolls-Royce C90 that still barely delivered {{the power of the}} original 50hp Gnome rotary at the power settings used for the Boxkite. The replica achieved a 45mph top speed. The Boxkite was tractable, however, and the scene in the film when the aircraft loses a pair of main wheels just after take off but lands smoothly, was repeated 20 times <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> In the penultimate flying scene, a stuntman was carried in the Boxkite's undercarriage and carried out a fall and roll (the stunt had to be repeated to match the principal actor's roll and revival). Slapstick stunts on the ground and in the air were a major element and often the directors requested repeated stunts; the stuntmen were more than accommodating; it meant more pay.|$|E

500|$|To the Australian Daily Telegraph, Gaga {{explained}} that [...] "Paparazzi" [...] was about struggling to balance success and love. Further explanations {{said that the}} song was about trying to win the paparazzi and the media in one's favor. [...] "It's a love song <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> but it's also a love song about fame or love – can you have both, or can you only have one", she concluded. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] was the album's third single in Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom, the fourth in Canada and the United States and the fifth in Australia, France and New Zealand. Although released on July 6, 2009, in the United Kingdom and four days later in Australia, [...] "LoveGame" [...] initially had been planned as the third single release in the former but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, {{it was decided that}} [...] "Paparazzi" [...] would be released instead.|$|E
500|$|Lucas Oil Stadium was {{equipped}} with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky for the halftime show. Lighting designer Al Gurdon of Incandescent Designs enlisted console group PRG to help him install 204 Sharpys across the main stage. According to Gurdon, Madonna conceived the main idea; the choreography-driven show, centered on the main stage, was less logistically challenging than those in previous years. However, Gurdon had {{to ensure that the}} audience could enjoy the show from a distance and that Madonna was highlighted properly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> He and board operator Mike Owen brainstormed in England and tried a number of schemes for a week with CAST software. A [...] "cleaner" [...] approach was taken to prevent interference between the video projections and lighting. Gurdon placed the Sharpys together in rectangular areas, with 16 to 20 lights in each. This resulted in a strong, compact, moving light which could be split into smaller beams as needed.|$|E

500|$|Several {{minutes of}} the film showed Palestinians playing at war <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> they wrote, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away.

Christine Delavennat, France 2's communications director, said {{that none of the}} scenes in the footage had been staged. Jeambar and Leconte concluded that the shots had come from the Palestinian positions, given the trajectory of the bullets. Leconte said in an interview: [...] "If they had been Israeli bullets, they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner." [...] He dismissed France2's explanation—that perhaps the bullets that hit the boy had ricocheted off the ground. [...] "It could happen once, but that there should be eight or nine of them, which go around a corner? They're just saying anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the {{producers}} {{always wanted to}} find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, Friends was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience {{was an integral part of}} the series. When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> lighting, and [...] "for the audience to be able to see what's going on"; the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts. The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because {{the producers}} were aware of the series' popularity in the UK. The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.|$|E
500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions.

500|$|Most of the Kardashian sisters' {{significant}} others {{have appeared on}} the reality series. Kim's relationship with football player Reggie Bush was featured on the show when they were dating; after the breakup, Bush commented on appearing on the show saying that he never felt comfortable being followed by cameras, adding: [...] "I do it because it's important to [...]" [...] Rob's relationship with singer Adrienne Bailon has also been documented on the show when they were dating from 2007 to 2009; although Bailon later admitted {{that the decision to}} appear on the show, and be associated with the family, hurt her career. Kim's ex-husband Kris Humphries first appeared on the show during the premiere of the sixth season; their relationship was chronicled throughout the season and ended with the couple's wedding special [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event". They eventually went through a highly publicized divorce; Kardashian's former publicist later claimed that Humphries was allegedly set up to be portrayed on the show in a negative way and that the short-lived marriage was staged <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> as a ploy to generate money.|$|E
500|$|The {{motel room}} that Cranston and Beaver appear in {{was a set}} {{constructed}} by Breaking Bad production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Director Michelle MacLaren wanted a genuine [...] "rundown motel feel", but believed {{it would be too}} difficult to film in an actual motel room because it would be too small for the cast and crew to fit inside. Instead, the set was designed so that several of the walls could be removed to make space <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and crew. This allowed greater flexibility in shooting and camera angles, and the walls could be placed back into position if they were needed for the background of a shot. The first shot of the episode includes Walter speaking directly into the camera, and it quickly revealed he is speaking into a mirror in the motel room. MacLaren filmed the shot so it would be deliberately disorienting and unclear to the viewer where Walter was until the camera movement revealed the motel room. New York magazine writer Logan Hill interpreted Walter's speaking into the mirror as a symbol for self-reflection: [...] "He stares at a mirror reflection of himself, studying his own image, wondering if the Walt other people see gives any hint of what he’s carrying inside." ...|$|E
500|$|The rivalry {{extended}} {{into the stands}} {{in the second game}} of the Smythe Division final in Edmonton. During the game, trainer Bearcat Murray went into the stands to rescue his son Al, also a trainer for the Flames, and tore ligaments in his leg in the process. [...] Al had gone into the stands in an attempt to retrieve Gary Suter's stick, which had been knocked into the crowd and was being hidden by Oiler fans. [...] Fearing for his son's safety, Bearcat jumped into the fray himself, suffering the injury. While being wheeled into an ambulance, Murray blew kisses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> [...] The incident caught the attention of a group of fans in Boston, who formed the [...] "Bearcat Murray Fan Club", and began showing up at the Boston Garden wearing skull caps and oversized moustaches mimicking Murray's looks when the Flames played there. [...] The Flames lost players on the ice during the physical series as well, as Carey Wilson required surgery to remove his spleen after he was [...] "skewered" [...] by Steve Smith, according to Johnson. Suter had his season ended after suffering torn ligaments in his knee following a low hit by Mark Messier.|$|E
