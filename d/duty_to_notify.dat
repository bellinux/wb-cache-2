[...] And then she turned to Isabel, who, after noting what has just been mentioned, had ceased to notice and had let her eyes wander as far as the limits of the room would allow. She wished never to look at Madame Merle again. [...] "You're {{surprised}} to find me here, and I'm afraid you're not pleased," [...] this lady went on. [...] "You don't see why I should have come; it's as if I had anticipated you. I confess I've been rather indiscreet--I ought to have asked your permission." [...] There was none of the oblique movement of irony in this; it was said simply and mildly; but Isabel, far afloat on a sea of wonder and pain, could not have told herself with what intention it was uttered. [...] "But I've not been sitting long," [...] Madame Merle continued; [...] "that is I've not been long with Pansy. I came to see her because it occurred to me this afternoon that she must be rather lonely and perhaps even a little miserable. It may be good for a small girl; I know so little about small girls; I can't tell. At any rate it's a little dismal. Therefore I came--on the chance. I knew of course that you'd come, and her father as well; still, I had not been told other visitors were forbidden. The good woman--what's her name? Madame Catherine--made no objection whatever. I stayed twenty minutes with Pansy; she has a charming little room, not in the least conventual, with a piano and flowers. She has arranged it delightfully; she has so much taste. Of course it's all none of my business, but I feel happier since I've seen her. She may even have a maid if she likes; but of course she has no occasion to dress. She wears a little black frock; she looks so charming. I went afterwards to see Mother Catherine, who has a very good room too; I assure you I don't find the poor sisters at all monastic. Mother Catherine has a most coquettish little toilet-table, with something that looked uncommonly like a bottle of eau-de-Cologne. She speaks delightfully of Pansy; says it's a great happiness for them to have her. She's a little saint of heaven and a model to the oldest of them. Just as I was leaving Madame Catherine the portress came to say to her that there was a lady for the signorina. Of course I knew it must be you, and I asked her to let me go and receive you in her place. She demurred greatly--I must tell you that--and said it was her <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the Mother Superior; it was of such high importance that you should be treated with respect. I requested her to let the Mother Superior alone and asked her how she supposed I would treat you!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{investigations}} came {{to light}} {{after a series of}} probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in May 2006, discussing the apparent [...] "backdating" [...] of stock options, in a then-common process called options backdating. Backdating involves manipulating the timing of options grants so they look as though they were made on days when the stock's value was lower. Doing that boosts recipients' windfall when they sell the stock. The backdating was approved by the board of directors, according to the Journal. Several shareholder classes filed lawsuits accusing former UnitedHealth's directors of failing in their fiduciary <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> properly <b>notify</b> shareholders of the scheme.|$|R

2500|$|A law on {{explosives}} (Sprengstoffgesetz) was {{the subject}} of two application ordinances (on 17 November 1970 and 24 August 1971) and a general regulatory provision (19 May 1971), which covered respectively the application of the law to nationals of EC Member States, the <b>duty</b> of employers <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> in time the inspection authorities of detonation plans, the interpretation of the purpose and field of application of the law, authorizations for transport of explosives, and control and recognition of training courses on work with explosives. Taking into account the enormous high peaks of air traffic noise and its concentration at a limited number of airports, the Law for Protection against Aircraft Noise of 1971 sought to balance two conflicting demands, the first being the legitimate demand by industry, business and the public for an efficient air-traffic-system, and secondly, the understandable and by no means less legitimate claims of the affected people for protection and compensation. The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called [...] "Lärmschutzzonen" [...] (protection areas against aircraft noise) for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet air craft, and the law also authorised the Federal Department of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the [...] "Bundesrat," [...] the representation of the German Federal States.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} anxiety-producing {{situations}} for all mental health professionals is working with clients who may be dangerous to others or to themselves. It is likely that {{in the course of}} their career, providers of psychological services will be confronted with clients who will threaten to or actually harm others and who will die by suicide. What is the current the standard of care for working with these clients? What are the ethical, legal, and professional responsibilities in working with these populations? In a recent study, 90 percent of psychologists were confident of the accuracy of their knowledge of legal responsibilities with dangerous clients, but as many as 75 percent of the sample were misinformed about their legal duties (Pabian, Welfel, & Beebe, 2007). Partly because of these facts, The <b>Duty</b> <b>to</b> Protect: Ethical, Legal, and Professional Considerations for Mental Health Professionals should be read by every provider of mental health services as well as by those who teach and supervise them. This edited volume is a comprehensive resource for information on how to implement best practices across a broad array of dangerous situations. One {{of the most}} important and basic contributions of The <b>Duty</b> <b>to</b> Protect is the clarification of the distinction between the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> warn and the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> protect.

50|$|Liberal Dealing Profitable.—M. DUTIEL, {{in selling}} grain, used a half-bushel measure a little {{larger than the}} law required. Some of his neighbors called his {{attention}} to the fact that he was giving more grain than was necessary, when he replied, “Well, I know it; but I would rather give too much than too little.” This becoming known, DUTIEL always sold out his surplus grain before his neighbors could sell a bushel. Easily Scared.—Mons. DUDUIT, unlike most of his fellow-countrymen, took naturally to the woods, and soon became an expert hunter and woodsman. Before his removal to the Grant, he had been employed by Col. SPROAT to scour the woods between Marietta and the Scioto, in company with Major Robt. SAFFORD. It was their <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the settlements of the approach of hostile Indians. On one occasion DUDUIT was out hunting with several of his countrymen, when he fired at and killed a deer; whereupon his companions, supposing they had been fired upon by Indians, fled to the settlement, and reported that the Indians had killed DUDUIT and were coming to raid the village. DUDUIT hung up his deer and hastened back to the village, which he found in an uproar and the settlers panic-stricken; but he soon quieted their fears, and induced some of them to assist him in bringing in the deer he had killed.|$|E

In international sales law the buyer is entitled to rely on the lack of conformity of the goods even when he fails to notify the seller in two specific cases. First, if the lack of conformity relates to the facts of which the seller knew or could not have been unaware and which he did not disclose to the buyer.

40|$|This article {{considers}} to {{what extent}} database possessors (such as credit card companies and universities) can {{be held liable for}} harm caused to data subjects (such as consumers, applicants, and alumni) when information relating to those persons is hacked or otherwise subject to improper access. Addressing common-law and statutory sources (including new legislation in 17 states) the article clearly differentiates the duty to safeguard data from the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> data subjects that the security of their information has been breached. By analogy to the “medical-monitoring damages” which some states award in toxic-exposure cases, the article argues that “security-monitoring damages” should be available in database-intrusion cases. More specifically, the article proposes that, in cases of ordinary negligence, the interests of society will be best served by limiting recoverable economics losses to the cost of security-monitoring damages once a database possessor discloses to the affected individual the fact that data has been improperly accessed. This approach will encourage database possessors to discover and reveal instances of data intrusion. It will also place data subjects in a position to protect their own interests by monitoring their economic and personal security when there is heightened vulnerability...|$|E
