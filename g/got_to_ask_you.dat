6000|$|Mr. Van Reinberg {{led the way}} silently {{into the}} smoking-room, and ordered Scotch whisky. [...] "Mr. Courage," [...] he said {{from the depths of}} his easy-chair, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. What do you think of us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Korner's {{sluggishness}} {{of comprehension}} irritated Miss Greene. She {{leaned across the}} table and shook him. [...] "Don't you understand? You have done it on purpose to teach her a lesson. It is she who has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to forgive her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, doctor, and I {{spend my}} money in helping those who will help the people. Now, before you give me any answer, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a thing or two," [...] and he drew a paper from his pocket. [...] "Are you {{prepared}} to support the abolition of 'tied' houses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question," [...] says he, {{the moment}} I appeared. [...] "When you found your master's yacht gone, {{did you hear}} which way she had sailed? Was it northward toward Scotland? Speak up, young man, speak up!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{observed}} the boatswain, as he busied himself in uncoiling {{and making a}} running noose on the rope, [...] "I'm ordered to prewent you from carryin' out your intentions--wotiver these may be--by puttin' a coil or two o' this here rope round you. Now, wot I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of <b>you</b> is-- Will ye submit peaceable like to have it done?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... (I've {{never seen}} an electoral {{campaign}} like this. Not even in 1948, in the post-war period, when there were... when there were tremendous emotions. It never happened. I've <b>got</b> something else <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Giovanna.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] {{said the}} guide, quickly, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to move on. This {{is one of}} Peter Sadler's camps, and he has strict rules against strangers stoppin' in any of them. If you've lost your way, I'll {{tell you that this}} road, if you don't turn to the right or the left, will take you {{straight}} to Sadler's, and there's time enough for you to get there before dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`No, Mr Powell, they aren't ready, worse luck,' {{says that}} skipper. `I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{to strike out}} my second officer.' He seemed excited and bothered. He {{explained}} that his second mate {{had been working on}} board all the morning. At one o'clock he went out to get a bit of dinner and didn't turn up at two as he ought to have done. Instead there came a messenger from the hospital with a note signed by a doctor. Collar-bone and one arm broken. Let himself be knocked down by a pair-horse van while crossing the road outside the dock gate, as if he had neither eyes nor ears. And the ship ready to leave the dock at six o'clock to-morrow morning! ...|$|E
3000|$|As with time, {{patients}} expressed {{ambivalence about}} their desires for attention and clinician needs for efficiency, a point emphasized by one clinician: “I find that before we {{jump into the}} computer, I explore. “What brings you here today?” I sit back, I look comfortable. I look them in the eye. I’ll explore first. It only takes like 5 or 10  min. You can build up some trust in that short period of time. And you say, “We only have {{a certain amount of}} time. I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> these questions that we have listed in the computer.”” [...]...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you never}} broken a dog by showing him the whip, Anne? I have <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of <b>you,</b> and I wish {{to get you}} into a generous frame of mind first. Listen now, I am going to read you a few extracts from a past that is so vividly recorded here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you need}} not be afraid. I have <b>got</b> {{permission}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> What do you think? I actually talked to my father for ten whole minutes yesterday; he wanted to avoid me when he saw me, but I caught him in a corner. He {{took advantage of the}} opportunity to try to prevent me from going to see Pigott, but I would not listen to him, so he gave it up. What did he mean by that? Why did he send her away? What does it all mean? Oh! Arthur, when will you come back, Arthur?" [...] and, to Mr. Fraser's infinite distress, she burst into tears.|$|R
500|$|The video {{opens with}} Odd Future's R crooner Frank Ocean {{in bed with}} the unnamed [...] "she" [...] of the video, and the singer stops when he sees a masked Tyler staring outside of her bedroom window. The rapper {{eventually}} enters the room as the girl falls asleep, caressing her and writing a note on her mirror while spitting the song's first verse; [...] "I finally <b>got</b> the courage <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> on a date, so just say yes and let the future fall into place," [...] a [...] "twitchy Tyler asks the girl – before the cops show up and arrest him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Carrie; {{you think}} I'm going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> love me. I'm not. And I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{come back to}} Gopher Prairie!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘But for Mr. Honeythunder’s eloquence, I {{might have}} had no need <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> what I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> This Mr. Edwin Drood, sir: I think that’s the name?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for myself," [...] Jeanne {{continued}} {{with her hands}} clasped together as if in some small learnt prayer--"I'm <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for myself if you won't positively come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] she continued, eyeing him {{now with}} a sudden nervousness, [...] "emboldens me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a {{question}} which I have been dying <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{for the last few}} years. I wonder whether you will answer it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Then if I was <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{for a small}} loan—” {{began the}} greybeard fawningly, edging nearer on the seat and hurriedly {{wondering}} how large he might safely make his request, “if I was <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for, say—” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do be quiet, Payne,' {{interposed}} the lieutenant. 'Will <b>you</b> {{allow me}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> sir,' he said, addressing Mr. Pickwick, who was considerably mystified by this very unpolite by-play--'will <b>you</b> allow me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Sir, whether that person belongs to your party?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Miss Morse," [...] the Inspector said quietly, [...] "to {{find you}} so unsympathetic. Had I found you {{differently}} disposed, I was going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{put yourself in}} my place. I was going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> look at these two tragedies {{from my point of}} view and from your own at the same time, and I was going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> whether any possible motive suggested itself to you, any possible person or cause, which might be benefited by the removal of these two men." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY PLYMDALE. Lord Windermere, I've {{something}} most particular <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] he answered, {{looking into}} her face, [...] "there {{is a great}} gulf between us, a gulf, perhaps, of more than years. Miss Lois, I am not going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> too much, but I would like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one thing. Have these days meant just a little to you also?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something," [...] he went on. [...] "I've {{been wanting}} to know something. That's why I've hung on here. You never spoke to me, never noticed me, never {{gave me a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> But now I'm going over--over the border. And I want to know. Why did you refuse to listen to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! You think so? When I saw you I didn't {{know why}} you were here. I was glad when you spoke to me because {{this is exactly what}} I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you ever meet Captain Anthony--by any chance--anywhere--you are a sailor too, are you not?--that you, would never mention--never--that--that you had seen me over there." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "May I (respectfully) request <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> whom I cherish, {{for your}} honorable surname?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Verranno a chiederti del nostro amore (They'll come <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{about our}} love) (4:19) ...|$|R
60|$|FANNY. Do. If you don't, they'll think it's because I {{was frightened}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
60|$|KIT (with ARETHUSA'S hand). Captain Gaunt, I {{have come}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for your daughter.|$|R

60|$|Gwendolen. Mr. Worthing, I have {{something}} very particular <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Much {{depends on your}} reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{have told}} you {{something}} very interesting," [...] she said, [...] "and in return I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. You quarrelled with her, did you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Little Bill, slowly, {{and with}} an earnest look, [...] "Jenkins is very anxious {{to know if you}} are fond of him, and he {{actually}} says that he's afraid <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry him! Isn't that funny? I said that even I would not be afraid <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> if I wanted you--How red you are, Elise! Have you been running?" ...|$|R
60|$|VILLAGER (to Kagekiyo) Many a fine {{thing is}} gone, sir; your {{daughter}} would like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you....</b>|$|R
