2500|$|Literacy is {{communication}} in all forms such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing. [...] Literacy development begins in infancy {{and continues to}} mature into adulthood.

Literacy skills are not a prerequisite to utilizing a semantic compaction system, however this system can be used to promote the development of literacy skills. [...] Essential components of literacy development include phonological awareness, vocabulary development, phonics, word identification, and comprehension. [...] Semantic compaction is a rule driven system that supports the development of literacy through vocabulary development, morphology development, and comprehension. [...] In addition, the icons can be used to help teach phonological awareness. [...] For example, when teaching phonological awareness and segmenting initial sounds the instructor will say a phoneme and visually present the phoneme at the same time. [...] Then the student will point to a picture that starts with that phoneme. To develop literacy skills, semantic compaction systems needs to be paired with an <b>instructional</b> <b>program</b> that meets the unique needs of the person using AAC.|$|E
