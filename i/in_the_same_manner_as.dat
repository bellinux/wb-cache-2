5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E

5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> a tree's trunk. The cells {{beneath the}} epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over {{that of a}} woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height {{in order to support}} itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the dorsal sail of Spinosaurus was {{homologous}} to the dorsal fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids have otherwise round or crescent-shaped dorsal sails, whereas in Spinosaurus, the dorsal neural spines form a shape that is roughly rectangular and similar in shape to the dorsal fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its dorsal neural sail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Electronic Arts and Fox Entertainment {{released}} , {{which has}} been labelled a rip-off of the Crazy Taxi formula by game reviewers.

Sega sued Fox Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and developer Radical Games Ltd. over infringement of the 138 patent. The case, Sega of America, Inc. v.

The 138 patent itself remains valid, and {{is considered to be}} one of the most important patents in video game development today.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, {{during times}} of {{economic}} prosperity, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor put aside their differences and joined forces to thwart Nigeria, which, {{in an attempt to}} establish itself in West Africa, had created the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA), which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French-speaking regions. However, after assurances from Nigeria that ECOWAS would function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> the earlier Francophone organisations, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor decided to merge their organization into ECOWAS in May 1975.|$|E

NJPW did not recognize Angle as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion, instead it viewed Angle as the second IWGP 3rd Belt Champion.|$|E
