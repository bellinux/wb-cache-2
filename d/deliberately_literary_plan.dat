40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 24 : 47 in lengthPini di Roma (Pines of Rome) is chronologically the second installment in Italian composer Ottorino Respighi's "Roman trilogy". It is a symphonic tone poem scored {{for a very}} large orchestra and is set in four movements. The musical content is representative of a <b>literary</b> <b>plan.</b> In Pines of Rome, Respighi succeeds spectacularly in this representation, producing a colorful and exciting group of impressions that capture the imagination without wandering or becoming digressive. Ottorino Respighi was born on July 9 th, 1879, in Bologna. A reserved boy of obvious musical talent, he began studying the violin {{when he was only}} eight and became very adept with the instrument very quickly. He was also a brilliant viola player and a more than competent pianist. At thirteen Respighi began studying composition and in 1900 composed his first major work, the Symphonic Variations, written for his final school examinations. Taking advantage of his talent on both the violin and viola, he applied for and was offered a job with the Imperial Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia. He later also played with the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. Soon fluent in Russian, he spent some five months studying with Rimsky-Korsakov. The Russian master quickly recognized and appreciated the young Italian's flair for both composition and orchestration and looked over Respighi's shoulder offering suggestions when appropriate. It can be seen that Respighi's brilliant, colorful scores do owe something to his studies with Rimsky-Korsakov. Respighi also attended lectures and studied for a short time with Max Bruch in Berlin. One critic has described Respighi's music as "new old music. " Respighi's profound love of and identification with his Italian musical past and deliberate homage to almost forgotten composers from that past inspired such works as Ancient Airs and Dances. He paid homage in other ways also. Initially introduced to Gregorian plain chant by his wife Elsa, Respighi brilliantly used this device in many of his pieces including the second movement of Pines of Rome. Respighi was appointed Professor of Composition at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome in 1913. (See more in text. ...|$|R

Dr. Drinkard, my Washington physician, (and a first-rate one,) {{said it was the}} result of too extreme bodily and emotional strain continued at Washington and [...] "down in front," [...] in 1863, '4 and '5. I doubt if a heartier, stronger, healthier physique, more balanced upon itself, or more unconscious, more sound, ever lived, from 1835 to '72. My greatest call (Quaker) to go around and do what I could there in those war-scenes where I had fallen, among the sick and wounded, was, that I seem'd to be so strong and well. (I consider'd myself invulnerable.) But this last attack shatter'd me completely. Quit work at Washington, and moved to Camden, New Jersey--where I have lived since, receiving many buffets and some precious caresses--and now write these lines. Since then, (1874-'91) a long stretch of illness, or half-illness, with occasional lulls. During these latter, have revised and printed over all my books--bro't out [...] "November Boughs"--and at intervals leisurely and exploringly travel'd to the Prairie States, the Rocky Mountains, Canada, to New York, to my birthplace in Long Island, and to Boston. But physical disability and the war-paralysis above alluded to to have settled upon me more and more the last year or so. Am now (1891) domicil'd, and have been for some years, in this little old cottage and lot in Mickle street, Camden, with a house-keeper and man nurse. Bodily I am completely disabled, but still write for publication.

The final version of this article may be found at [URL] (login may be required). The version made available in OpenBU was supplied by the author. This paper explores the ideological currents running through Maximianus's subversive revival of the genre of Augustan love elegy in the beleaguered Rome of the mid-sixth century. The third elegy narrates an apparent childhood reminiscence of the poet, a failed romance with a young girl, Aquilina. But it soon becomes clear that, in the character of Aquilina, Maximianus has <b>deliberately</b> blurred the <b>literary</b> archetypes of the elegiac puella and the virgin martyr from Christian hagiography. This bizarre configuration allows the elegist simultaneously to provoke questions about the representation of female figures in both genres. By likening the elegiac puella to the martyr, Maximianus highlights the latent violence of elegiac topoi. By likening the martyr to the elegiac puella, Maximianus highlights the eroticism that often has a prominent place in accounts of virgin martyrdom. Not merely a formal experiment or the product of Augustan nostalgia, Maximianus's elegies represent a real attempt to reinvent elegy's questioning stance in a new social and religious context...|$|R

Educated Muslim women {{appear to have a}} great deal of expression, interest and passion to offer the process. The study investigates the new emerging social sub group of professional Muslim women in Sierra Leone society and explores their views and experiences of identifying and attempting to overcome the burdens of patriarchy, oppression and exploitation perpetrated by religious, social and cultural beliefs. The research and thesis consider in what ways these women and their views ‘fit’ in or challenge society and their perceptions of the potential they have as models to impact on the lives of Sierra Leonean Muslim women nationwide. Using feminist influenced research practices in order to focus on the stories and voices of these women, the study contributes to the growth of knowledge related to the emergent changing roles and perceptions of Muslim women in present day Sierra Leone. This qualitative and interdisciplinary research develops a critical focus and <b>deliberately</b> combines <b>literary</b> sources in an informative context, with feminist research methods of interviews and focus groups on issues of gender equality and empowerment. Through the interviews and focus group discussions conducted, the research portrays the perceptions of the emerging social sub group of professional Muslim women, a cross section of grass-root Muslim women and a selection of male Muslims regarding empowerment, knowledge, culture, independence and oppression. These are also illustrated as the ways the participants embrace the concept of feminism and adapt it by drawing on their Sierra Leonean, Islamic, cultural and social traditions. The research examines the various ideologies that stifle the growth of Sierra Leonean Muslim women from their perspective and it analyses the strategies used by the professional women to tackle the oppressive and repressive customs and stand up against patriarchy. It was discovered through the findings that the research gives an insight into the determination and the conviction of professional Muslim women in advocating for social change and in making their voices heard. As an outcome, it is evidenced that this emerging social sub group of Muslim women appear to be inspiring self-development moves and changes not only among the uneducated grass-root majority, but in the fold of their Muslim men-folk, resulting in a visible impact of self development and self empowerment among Sierra Leonean Muslim women...|$|R
