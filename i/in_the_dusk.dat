5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusk</b> sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusk</b> magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusk.</b> Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, {{and he thought he}} would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck said it was not his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E

40|$|Energetic (greater than tens of keV) magnetospheric {{particle}} {{escape into}} the magnetosheath occurs commonly, irrespective of conditions that engender reconnection and boundary-normal magnetic fields. A signature observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, simultaneous monohemispheric streaming of multiple species (electrons, H+, Hen+), is reported here as unexpectedly common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dayside, <b>dusk</b> quadrant of <b>the</b> magnetosheath {{even though that}} region {{is thought to be}} drift-shadowed from energetic electrons. This signature is sometimes part of a pitch angle distribution evolving from symmetric <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnetosphere, to asymmetric approaching the magnetopause, to monohemispheric streaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnetosheath. While monohemispheric streaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnetosheath may be possible without a boundary-normal magnetic field, the additional pitch angle depletion, particularly of electrons, on the magnetospheric side requires one.

2500|$|Saturn has bright polar aurorae, {{which have}} been {{observed}} in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared light.

From time to time either aurorae can assume a spiral shape instead of oval.

Fifteen minutes later, after the lookout spotted a red light, Captain Dugat altered course {{a point to}} port, heading southeast half south. Just moments later the green lights of an approaching vessel appeared. When Captain Dugat realized he had swung across the bow of a steamer, he blew one blast on the whistle and ordered a hard turn, {{but it was too}} late. Shipwreck historian Janice Gerred reported that the [...] "Canadian steamer Manitoba struck the Comet stem on about , forward the stern on the port side right down to the water’s edge." [...] The Toronto Globe reported an eye witness account that Comets hull parted and sank almost immediately; the upper works crumbled and sank within one minute. Two men were crushed when the steamers collided. One man was hanging from a window sash on Manitoba, lost his grip, and was heard exclaiming, “Oh Lord, I am gone” as the suction of the wreck pulled him down. Ten men, including those below deck, did not survive. Six men jumped from the wreck to the decks of Manitoba whose boats picked up four more survivors. Captain Dugat, the master, two shipmates, two wheelsmen, one fireman, one lookout, and one porter survived. Manitoba made every effort to save everyone possible. She took the rescued to Sault Ste.

40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 exhibits global biphasic circadian oscillations in {{gene expression}} under constant-light conditions. Class I genes are maximally expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subjective <b>dusk,</b> whereas class II genes are maximally expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subjective dawn. Here, we identify sequence features that encode {{the phase of}} circadian gene expression. We find that, for multiple genes, an 70 -nucleotide promoter fragment is sufficient to specify class I or II phase. We demonstrate that the gene expression phase can be changed by randommutagenesis and that a single-nucleotide substitution is sufficient to change the phase. Our study provides insight into how the gene expression phase is encoded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cyanobacterial genome.
