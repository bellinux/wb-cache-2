60|$|While the old {{method of}} {{presenting}} truths {{in the abstract}} has been falling out of use, {{there has been a}} corresponding adoption of the new method of presenting them in the concrete. The rudimentary facts of exact science are now being learnt by direct intuition, as textures, and tastes, and colours are learnt. Employing the ball-frame for first lessons in arithmetic exemplifies this. It is well illustrated, too, in Professor De Morgan's mode of explaining the decimal notation. M. Marcel, rightly repudiating the old system of tables, teaches weights and measures by referring to the actual yard and <b>foot,</b> <b>pound</b> and ounce, gallon and quart; and lets the discovery of their relationships be experimental. The use of geographical models and models of the regular bodies, etc., as introductory to geography and geometry respectively, are facts of the same class. Manifestly, a common trait of these methods is, that they carry each child's mind through a process like that which the mind of humanity at large has gone through. The truths of number, of form, of relationship in position, were all originally drawn from objects; and to present these truths to the child in the concrete is to let him learn them as the race learnt them. By and by, perhaps, it will be seen that he cannot possibly learn them in any other way; for that if he is made to repeat them as abstractions, the abstractions can have no meaning for him, until he finds that they are simply statements of what he intuitively discerns.|$|E

5000|$|In the United Kingdom (with the {{exception}} of Northern Ireland), possession of almost any handgun by most civilians has been outlawed since the Dunblane massacre of 1996; the only exclusions were single-shot, rimfire, and muzzleloading pistols/revolvers. So called [...] "long barreled" [...] cartridge-firing revolvers and semiautomatic pistols (.22LR only) are still legal providing that they meet the following requirements: overall length not less than 24 inches, barrel length not less than 12 inches. As with all other legal firearms in the UK, possession requires a Firearm Certificate. The application and vetting process is {{carried out by the}} local police force and is very in depth. Good reason (justification) for holding a firearm certificate in the UK would be target shooting (as part of a Home Office Approved Club) or hunting. [...] "Self-defence" [...] or other reasons of this nature are not allowed. The open carrying of any firearm in a public place is illegal in the UK unless you have a valid reason to do so, this also requires that you carry it in a gun carry case. Concealed carry of any firearm in a public place would normally be illegal, unless authorised by a firearms licence. Air pistols are still legal, however, those with energy levels over 6 foot pounds (8 joules) (half the limit for air rifles, which is 12 <b>foot</b> <b>pound</b> or 16.25 joules) are classified as firearms.|$|E

The Firearms Act 1968 {{defines a}} firearm [...] "a lethal barreled weapon of any {{description}} from which any shot, bullet or other :missile can be discharged".51 In this context, a [...] "lethal weapon" [...] means a weapon capable of firing a projectile with sufficient :force to inflict {{more than a}} trivial injury, i.e. with a force sufficient to puncture the skin.52 The force with which a firearm :is able to deliver a projectile is normally {{expressed in terms of}} the kinetic energy it generates at its muzzle—the [...] "muzzle energy". :This energy is normally expressed in units of foot-pounds (ft·lbs) or joules (J).53"26. The Home Office and the Forensic Science Service considers that the lowest level of muzzle energy capable of inflicting a penetrating wound is one <b>foot</b> <b>pound</b> force (1.35 J): below these power levels, weapons are [...] "incapable of penetrating even vulnerable parts of the body, such as the eye".54 However, more recent analysis by the Forensic Science Agency for Northern Ireland has indicated that a more reasonable assessment of the minimum muzzle energy required to inflict a penetrating wound lies between 2.2 and 3.0 ft·lbf (3 to 4 J).55 We will deal more fully with this discrepancy at paragraphs 123 to 130 below.""123. The power level at and above which an air weapon is considered a firearm in law is presently set at 1 ft·lbf. However, the Forensic Science Agency of Northern Ireland has more recently assessed the power level at which a barreled weapon is capable of inflicting a lethal wound as between 2.2 and 3 ft·lbf, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has proposed that the law relating to firearms in Northern Ireland be amended to take this into account.201" ...|$|E

5000|$|Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, had {{observed}} the frictional heat generated by boring cannon at the arsenal in Munich, Germany circa 1797. Rumford immersed a cannon barrel {{in water and}} arranged for a specially blunted boring tool. He showed that the water could be boiled within roughly {{two and a half}} hours and that the supply of frictional heat was seemingly inexhaustible. Based on his experiments, he published [...] "An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat which is Excited by Friction", (1798), Philosophical Transaction of the Royal Society p. 102. This scientific paper provided a substantial challenge to established theories of heat and began the 19th century revolution in thermodynamics. The experiment inspired the work of James Prescott Joule in the 1840s. Joule's more exact measurements on equivalence were pivotal in establishing the kinetic theory at the expense of the caloric theory. The idea that heat and work are equivalent was also proposed by Julius Robert von Mayer in 1842 in the leading German physics journal and independently by James Prescott Joule in 1843, in the leading British physics journal. Similar work was carried out by Ludwig A. Colding in 1840-1843, though Colding's work was little known outside his native Denmark. A collaboration between Nicolas Clément and Sadi Carnot in the 1820s had some related thinking near the same lines. In 1845, Joule published a paper entitled [...] "The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat", in which he specified a numerical value for the amount of mechanical work required to produce a unit of heat. In particular Joule had experimented on the amount of mechanical work generated by friction needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit and found a consistent value of 778.24 <b>foot</b> <b>pound</b> force (4.1550 J·cal−1). Joule contended that motion and heat were mutually interchangeable and that, in every case, a given amount of work would generate the same amount of heat. Von Mayer also published a numerical value for mechanical equivalent of heat in 1845 but his experimental method wasn't as convincing.|$|E
40|$|The Velocity Control Propulsion Subsystem (VCPS) was {{designed}} the propulsion required for trajectory and lunar orbit corrections of the spacecraft. A GFE clamp assembly physically attaches the VCPS to the spacecraft and {{the unit is}} ejected after completing the required corrections. The VCPS is physically and functionally separated from the spacecraft except for the electrical and telemetry interfaces. A GFE transtage provides the superstructure on which the VCPS is assembled. The subsystem consists of two 5 <b>foot</b> <b>pound</b> rocket engine assemblies, 4 propellant tanks, 2 latching valves, 2 fill and drain valves, a system filter, pressure transducer, gas and propellant manifolds and electrical heaters and thermostats. The RAE-B VCPS program covered the design, manufacture and qualification of one subsystem. This subsystem was to be manufactured, subjected to qualification tests; and refurbished, if necessary, prior to flight.
