500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that it is such a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.'

2500|$|Sigsworth {{created a}} demo backing track that was [...] "{{finished}} enough to impress, {{but not so}} finished as to restrict Madonna's freedom to write {{over the top of}} it." [...] According to him, [...] "'What It Feels Like For a Girl' was done very quickly. 'I sent her a backing track, and she wrote a top line to it, we put it together and four days later we had a record. And what was kind of good for me was that we decided on day one that we liked all the noises I'd already used on the demo, and it was more a matter of repositioning them in the arrangement around M's top line. So the whole job, apart from recording the voice, was moving things around in Pro Tools", he claimed. He remarked that he sent her two sketches and that she chose the more unusual one. [...] "And at the start of it, I put this sample from a movie of the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> M would fall in love with that, and she did", he declared.|$|E

5000|$|... "45" [...] was {{the first}} song written for Handwritten. Lead singer, Brian Fallon said of the song, [...] "This record was different, because when we started out, I didn't know what was gonna happen, you know, and after American Slang after The '59 Sound, I was like, 'What am I gonna do? Is there anymore Gaslight songs?' It's a scary thing when that feeling, it hits you.

When Dawg informs Henery that Foghorn is a chicken {{as they see}} the rooster doing pull-ups, Dawg convinces him to put Foghorn in a cooking pot and cook him. When Henery does so, {{the heat from the}} fire causes Foghorn to rocket out in pain and crash-land into some trash where the rooster quickly figures out Dawg was responsible for what had just happened ("I ju..., <b>I</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> marble-headed mongrel is back of all this.").|$|R
50|$|The movie debuted at the Sundance Film Festival {{and proved}} very controversial, {{in part because}} it was made by a female director. Shea:I always told New Line {{it was going to be}} {{different}} from what they thought. I'm out to prove it's possible to make a film that's really artistic, that's an honest expression that comes from me and that can still be commercial.

5000|$|... “Most fans {{remember}} the ‘Great Burndown’ {{between me and}} Steve Carbone at Indy in 1971,” Garlits recalled. “But {{do you know how}} much Carbone made when he won, and we’re talking here about one of the most famous Top Fuel finals in history. He got $3,000; that was it. I thought that was terrible and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> NHRA, which was the bigger of the two associations, could afford to pay a lot better than that. So, I came up with the idea of the Professional Racers Association and the PRA Challenge, which I was determined to run opposite NHRA’s Nationals in 1972. I approached Jim Tice and he thought we could pull it off.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Patricia McKenna - In an {{interview}} with O'Toole in May 2009, former Green Party MEP announced her decision to quit the party and run as an independent candidate in the Euo elections. McKenna gave a hugely controversial and provocative critique of the Green Party's performance since entering coalition with Fianna Fáil. McKenna was particularly scathing about the Green representatives in Government, dismissing the Greens in the Dáil as [...] "nothing but hypocrites". She continued: [...] "I feel embarrassed about {{being a member of}} the Green Party ... because of what we said in the past and the promises we made, which we failed to deliver on. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I couldn’t run under a Green Party ticket and pretend that everything was alright because I’d be lying." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nora Williamson from TV and Film Review gave a mixed {{review to}} the episode saying that [...] "...episode {{had a few}} good moments, but {{otherwise}} I thought the episode {{could have been a}} lot funnier. I also don’t like it when the story lines are quite separate. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the three families can’t spend every episode together, but when they do, that is when Modern Family is at its best. ... "Rash Decisions" [...] definitely has some witty lines and funny moments but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Modern Family can do so much better.

5000|$|The tree-sit {{and action}} since created this very {{particular}} role that Julia Butterfly Hill fulfills. And, because I'm a person committed to growth, to looking for where my edge is, that role is now too narrow for me.

And I'm not discounting that role - I've been able to help communities that I love very much. And at the same time, I'm looking for what's next for me, and it's so easy to stay in that role that myself and this world co-created together. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there's aspects of it that need to shed.|$|R

What I write usually emerges from things I've witnessed, experiences I've had myself, or that people around me have had … I don't invent a book out of thin air. I need —or I did at the time I wrote The Children's Bach— a bed of detail for the things {{to be based on}} before I can start to make something up". Garner goes on to say that, [...] "I didn't know what was going to happen. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I wanted this family and {{that there would be a}} little boy who had something wrong with him, so you could only reach him through music.

They moved to a Mormon community in San Diego where she attended a regular public high school for a week. Because of the post-9/11 tension in the U.S., her schoolmates did not welcome her. She stated that the return was not easy: [...] "I hated it. I was called a whore {{on the first day of}} school, and somebody said they thought my dad funded terrorism. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> nobody was ever going to want to be my friend there.
