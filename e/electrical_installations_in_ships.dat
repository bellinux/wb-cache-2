40|$|Galvanized iron (Gl) {{trunking}} {{used for}} mechanical protection <b>in</b> low-voltage <b>electrical</b> <b>installations</b> has demonstrated {{some degree of}} magnetic shielding. This paper investigates extremely-low-frequency magnetic shielding by commercial Gl trunking based on numerical analysis and experimental studies. First general shielding characteristics are discussed where the shielding material is considered linear. Since galvanized iron is a ferromagnetic material, and exhibits non-linear properties associated with its permeability, the variation in shielding performance resulting from the nonlinearity is then discussed. The shielding impact of both source and shield parameters associated with ferromagnetic trunking is determined. It is concluded that galvanized iron trunking is a cost-effective shielding measure for LV <b>electrical</b> <b>installations</b> <b>in</b> buildings if properly designed and installed.
