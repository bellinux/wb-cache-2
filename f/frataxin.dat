25|$|Friedreich ataxia (FA) is {{the most}} common genetic cause of ataxia in children. Like A-T, FA is a {{recessive}} disease, appearing in families without a history of the disorder. FA is caused by mutation in the <b>frataxin</b> gene, most often an expansion of a naturally occurring repetition of the three nucleotide bases GAA from the usual 5-33 repetitions of this trinucleotide sequence to greater than 65 repeats on each chromosome. Most often the ataxia appears between 10 and 15 years of age, and differs from A-T by the absence of telangiectasia and oculomotor apraxia, a normal alpha fetalprotein, and the frequent presence of scoliosis, absent tendon reflexes, and abnormal features on the EKG. Individuals with FA manifest difficulty standing in one place that is much enhanced by closure of the eyes (Romberg sign) that is not so apparent in those with A-T – even though those with A-T may have greater difficulty standing in one place with their eyes open.|$|E
50|$|Friedreich's ataxia is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder {{that occurs when}} the FXN gene contains amplified intronic GAA repeats (an example of Trinucleotide repeat expansion). The FXN gene encodes the protein <b>frataxin.</b> GAA repeat expansion causes <b>frataxin</b> levels to be reduced. <b>Frataxin</b> is an iron-binding protein responsible for forming iron-sulphur clusters. One result of <b>frataxin</b> deficiency is mitochondrial iron overload which can cause damage to many proteins. The exact role of <b>frataxin</b> in normal physiology remains unclear. The gene is located on chromosome 9.|$|E
50|$|Low <b>frataxin</b> levels lead to {{insufficient}} biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters {{that are}} required for mitochondrial electron transport and assembly of functional aconitase and iron dysmetabolism of the entire cell. In normal individuals, the FXN gene encodes <b>frataxin,</b> a mitochondrial matrix protein. This globular protein consists of two α helices and seven β strands and is highly conserved, occurring in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. <b>Frataxin</b> {{has a variety of}} known functions. <b>Frataxin</b> assists iron-sulfur protein synthesis in the electron transport chain to ultimately generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency necessary to carry out metabolic functions in cells. <b>Frataxin</b> also regulates iron transfer in the mitochondria in order provide a proper amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to maintain normal processes. Without <b>frataxin,</b> the energy in the mitochondria fails, and excess iron causes extra ROS to be created, leading to further cell damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frataxin</b> mRNA is {{predominantly}} expressed in tissues {{with a high}} metabolic rate (including liver, kidney, brown fat and heart). Mouse and yeast <b>frataxin</b> homologues contain a potential N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, and human <b>frataxin</b> has been observed to co-localise with a mitochondrial protein. Furthermore, disruption of the yeast gene {{has been shown to}} result in mitochondrial dysfunction. Friedreich's ataxia is thus believed to be a mitochondrial disease caused by a mutation in the nuclear genome (specifically, expansion of an intronic GAA triplet repeat in the FXN gene, which encodes the protein <b>frataxin.).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Reduced {{expression}} of <b>frataxin</b> {{is the cause}} of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a lethal neurodegenerative disease. The reduction in <b>frataxin</b> gene expression may be attributable from either the silencing of transcription of the <b>frataxin</b> gene because of epigenetic modifications in the chromosomal entity or from the inability of splicing the expanded GAA repeats in the first intron of the pre-mRNA as seen in Bacteria and Human cells or both. The expansion of intronic trinucleotide repeat GAA results in Friedreich's ataxia. [...] This expanded repeat causes R-loop formation, and using a repeat-targeted oligonucleotide to disrupt the R-loop can reactivate <b>frataxin</b> expression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frataxin</b> is {{localized}} to the mitochondrion. The {{function of}} <b>frataxin</b> {{is not entirely}} clear, {{but it seems to}} be involved in assembly of iron-sulfur clusters. It has been proposed to act as either an iron chaperone or an iron storage protein.|$|E
50|$|Nicotinamide {{administration}} on patients {{was associated with}} a sustained improvement in <b>frataxin</b> concentrations towards those seen in asymptomatic carriers during 8 weeks of daily dosing. The daily oral administration of 3.8 g nicotinamide resulted in a 1.5-times increase, whereas 7.5 g resulted in a doubling of <b>frataxin</b> protein concentration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frataxin</b> {{has been}} shown to biologically {{interact}} with the enzyme PMPCB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frataxin</b> is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the FXN gene.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{reducing}} {{expression of}} <b>frataxin,</b> long tracts of GAA repeats induce chromosome breaks in in vivo yeast studies.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the frataxin-like domain is {{a protein}} domain found in proteins including eukaryotic <b>frataxin</b> and bacterial CyaY.|$|E
50|$|An {{overexpression}} of <b>frataxin</b> in Drosophila {{has shown}} {{an increase in}} antioxidant capability, resistance to oxidative stress insults and longevity.|$|E
50|$|As {{the beta}} subunit of Mitochondrial-processing peptidase, PMPCB forms a {{heterodimer}} with the subunit Mitochondrial-processing peptidase subunit alpha. In addition, PMPCB {{has been shown}} to interact with PMPCA and <b>Frataxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{particular}} {{genetic mutation}} (expansion of an intronic GAA triplet repeat in the FXN gene) leads to reduced {{expression of the}} mitochondrial protein <b>frataxin.</b> Over time this deficiency causes the aforementioned damage, as well as frequent fatigue due to effects on cellular metabolism.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacterial}} CyaY proteins are iron-sulphur cluster (FeS) metabolism proteins {{which are}} homologous to eukaryotic <b>frataxin.</b> Partial phylogenetic profiling suggests that CyaY most likely functions {{as part of}} the ISC system for FeS cluster biosynthesis, and is supported by expermimental data in some species.|$|E
50|$|FA is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by pathological GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FXN gene. The encoded protein <b>frataxin</b> {{is directed to}} the mitochondrial inner membrane and {{is involved in the}} assembly of iron-sulphur cluster, which are a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes.|$|E
50|$|Current {{knowledge}} indicates mitosomes probably {{play a role}} in Fe-S cluster assembly, {{since they}} do not display any of the proteins involved in other major mitochondrial functions (aerobic respiration, haem biosynthesis) and they do display proteins required for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (like <b>frataxin,</b> cysteine desulfurase, Isu1 and a mitochondrial Hsp70).|$|E
50|$|The mutant gene {{contains}} expanded GAA triplet repeats in {{the first}} intron; in a few pedigrees, point mutations have been detected. Because the defect is located in an intron (which {{is removed from the}} mRNA transcript between transcription and translation), this mutation does not result in the production of abnormal <b>frataxin</b> proteins. Instead, the mutation causes gene silencing (i.e., the mutation decreases the transcription of the gene) through induction of a heterochromatin structure {{in a manner similar to}} position-effect variegation.|$|E
5000|$|Sphingolipids {{have also}} been implicated with the <b>frataxin</b> protein (Fxn), the {{deficiency}} of which is associated with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Loss of Fxn in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA. [...] Other {{research has demonstrated that}} iron accumulation in the nervous systems of flies enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of mitochondrial proteins is nuclear-coded, which necessitates proper translocations of mitochondrial targeting proteins. Many mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in a precursor form that contains mitochondria targeting sequence. These precursors are usually cleaved by peptidases and proteases before they arrive their sub-organellar locations. It {{is likely that}} altered activity of the mitochondrial processing peptidases is essential to ensure the correct maturation of mitochondrial proteins and that altered activity of these proteases will have dramatic effects in the activity, stability and assembly of mitochondrial proteins. Evidences showed that MPP {{was involved in the}} proteolytic maturation of <b>Frataxin,</b> a protein responsible for iron homeostasis. Accordingly, MPP deficiency was shown to be involved in Friedreich ataxia, an autossomic recessive neurodegenerative disorder ...|$|E
5000|$|In humans, {{mutations}} in DLD {{are linked to}} a severe disorder of infancy with failure to thrive, hypotonia, and metabolic acidosis. [...] DLD deficiency manifests itself in a great degree of variability, which {{has been attributed to}} varying effects of different DLD mutations on the stability of the protein and its ability to dimerize or interact with other components of the three α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes.With its proteolytic function, DLD causes a deficiency in <b>frataxin,</b> which leads to the neurodegenerative and cardiac disease, Friedreich ataxia. Future research hopes to assess how the proteolytic activity of DLD contributes to the symptoms of DLD deficiency, Friedreich ataxia, and ischemia reperfusion injury and whether this activity could be a target for therapy for these conditions.|$|E
50|$|Ferrochelatase {{interacts with}} {{numerous}} other enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport, including protoporphyrinogen oxidase, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, ABCB10, ABCB7, succinyl-CoA synthetase, and mitoferrin-1. Multiple {{studies have suggested}} {{the existence of an}} oligomeric complex that enables substrate channeling and coordination of overall iron and porphyrin metabolism throughout the cell. N-methylmesoporphyrin (N-MeMP) is a competitive inhibitor with protoporphyrin IX and is thought to be a transition state analog. As such, N-MeMP as been used extensively as a stabilizing ligand for x-ray crystallography structure determination. <b>Frataxin</b> acts as the Fe+2 chaperone and complexes with ferrochelatase on its mitochondrial matrix side. Ferrochelatase can also insert other divalent metal ions into protoporphyrin. Some ions, such as Zn+2, Ni, and Co form other metalloporphyrins while heavier metal ions such as Mn, Pb, Hg, and Cd inhibit product release after metallation.|$|E
5000|$|Certain DLD {{mutations}} can simultaneously {{induce the}} loss of a primary metabolic activity and the gain of a moonlighting proteolytic activity. The moonlighting proteolytic activity of DLD is revealed by conditions that destabilize the DLD homodimer and decrease its DLD activity. [...] Acidification of the mitochondrial matrix, as a result of ischemia-reperfusion injury, can disrupt the quaternary structure of DLD leading to decreased dehydrogenase activity and increased diaphorase activity.The moonlighting proteolytic activity of DLD could also arise under pathological conditions. Proteolytic activity can further complicate the reduction in energy metabolism and an increase in oxidative damage as a result of decreased DLD activity and an increase in diaphorase activity respectively. [...] With its proteolytic function, DLD removes a functionally vital domain from the N-terminus of <b>frataxin,</b> a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism and antioxidant protection.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of human protoporphyrin metalation remains under investigation. Many researchers have hypothesized {{distortion of the}} porphyrin macrocycle as key to catalysis. Researchers studying Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase propose a mechanism for iron insertion into protoporphyrin in which the enzyme tightly grips rings B, C, and D while bending ring A 36o. Normally planar, this distortion exposes the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the nitrogen in ring A to the Fe+2 ion. Subsequent investigation revealed a 100o distortion in protoporphyrin bound to human ferrochelatase. A highly conserved histidine residue (His183 in B. subtilis, His263 in humans) is essential for determining the type of distortion, as well as acting as the initial proton acceptor from protoporphyrin. Anionic residues form a pathway facilitating proton movement away from the catalytic histidine. <b>Frataxin</b> chaperones iron to the matrix side of ferrochelatase, where aspartate and histidine residues on both proteins coordinate iron transfer into ferrochelatase. Two arginine and tyrosine residues in the active site (Arg164, Tyr165) may perform the final metalation.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder caused by GAA triplet repeat expansions or point mutations in the FXN gene and, ultimately, a deficiency in {{the levels of}} functional <b>frataxin</b> protein. Heterozygous carriers of the expansion express approximately 50 % of normal <b>frataxin</b> levels yet manifest no clinical symptoms, suggesting that therapeutic approaches that increase <b>frataxin</b> may be effective even if <b>frataxin</b> is raised only to carrier levels. Small molecule HDAC inhibitor compounds increase <b>frataxin</b> mRNA and protein levels, and have beneficial effects in animal models of FRDA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To gather data supporting the use of <b>frataxin</b> as a therapeutic biomarker of drug response we characterized the intra-individual stability of <b>frataxin</b> over time, determined the contribution of <b>frataxin</b> from different components of blood, compared <b>frataxin</b> measures in different cell compartments, and demonstrated that <b>frataxin</b> increases are achieved in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. <b>Frataxin</b> mRNA and protein levels were stable with repeated sampling over four and 15 weeks. In the 15 -week study, the average CV was 15. 6 % for protein and 18 % for mRNA. Highest levels of <b>frataxin</b> in blood were in erythrocytes. As erythrocytes are not useful for <b>frataxin</b> assessment in many clinical trial situations, we confirmed that PBMCs and buccal swabs have <b>frataxin</b> levels equivalent to those of whole blood. In addition, a dose-dependent increase in <b>frataxin</b> was observed when PBMCs isolated from patient blood were treated with HDACi. Finally, higher <b>frataxin</b> levels predicted less severe neurological dysfunction and were associated with slower rates of neurological change. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data {{support the use of}} <b>frataxin</b> as a biomarker of drug effect. <b>Frataxin</b> levels are stable over time and as such a 1. 5 to 2 -fold change would be detectable over normal biological fluctuations. Additionally, our data support buccal cells or PBMCs as sources for measuring <b>frataxin</b> protein in therapeutic trials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFriedreich ataxia is an {{inherited}} neurodegenerative disease {{that leads to}} progressive disability. There is currently no effective treatment and patients die prematurely. The underlying genetic defect leads to reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein <b>frataxin.</b> <b>Frataxin</b> insufficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately cell death, particularly in peripheral sensory ganglia. There is an inverse correlation {{between the amount of}} residual <b>frataxin</b> and the severity of disease progression; therefore, therapeutic approaches aiming at increasing <b>frataxin</b> levels are expected to improve patients' conditions. We previously discovered that a significant amount of <b>frataxin</b> precursor is degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome system before its functional mitochondrial maturation. We also provided evidence for the therapeutic potential of small molecules that increase <b>frataxin</b> levels by docking on the <b>frataxin</b> ubiquitination site, thus preventing <b>frataxin</b> ubiquitination and degradation. We called these compounds ubiquitin-competing molecules (UCM). By extending our search for effective UCM, we identified a set of new and more potent compounds that more efficiently promote <b>frataxin</b> accumulation. Here we show that these compounds directly interact with <b>frataxin</b> and prevent its ubiquitination. Interestingly, these UCM are not effective on the ubiquitin-resistant <b>frataxin</b> mutant, indicating their specific action on preventing <b>frataxin</b> ubiquitination. Most importantly, these compounds are able to promote <b>frataxin</b> accumulation and aconitase rescue in cells derived from patients, strongly supporting their therapeutic potential...|$|E

40|$|Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is {{a severe}} genetic {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused by reduced {{expression of the}} mitochondrial protein <b>frataxin.</b> To date, there is no therapy to treat this condition. The amount of residual <b>frataxin</b> critically affects {{the severity of the}} disease; thus, attempts to restore physiological <b>frataxin</b> levels are considered therapeutically relevant. <b>Frataxin</b> levels are controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; therefore, inhibition of the <b>frataxin</b> E 3 ligase may represent a strategy to achieve an increase in <b>frataxin</b> levels. Here, we report the identification of the RING E 3 ligase RNF 126 as the enzyme that specifically mediates <b>frataxin</b> ubiquitination and targets it for degradation. RNF 126 interacts with <b>frataxin</b> and promotes its ubiquitination in a catalytic activity-dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is {{a devastating}} orphan disease, with no {{specific}} treatment. The disease {{is caused by}} reduced expression of the protein <b>frataxin,</b> which results in mitochondrial defects and oxidative damage. Levels of residual <b>frataxin</b> critically affect onset and progression of the disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate <b>frataxin</b> stability and degradation may, therefore, be exploited {{for the design of}} effective therapeutics. Here we show that <b>frataxin</b> is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that K(147) is the critical residue responsible for <b>frataxin</b> ubiquitination and degradation. Accordingly, a K(147) R substitution generates a more stable <b>frataxin.</b> We then disclose a set of lead compounds, computationally selected to target the molecular cleft harboring K(147), that can prevent <b>frataxin</b> ubiquitination and degradation, and increase <b>frataxin</b> levels in cells derived from FRDA patients. Moreover, treatment with these compounds induces substantial recovery of aconitase activity and adenosine- 5 '-triphosphate levels in FRDA cells. Thus, we provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of directly interfering with the <b>frataxin</b> degradation pathway...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to unravel the {{function}} of <b>frataxin.</b> The function of <b>frataxin</b> is not known yet and is a mystery.

While unraveling the <b>frataxin</b> function by capturing interacting partner proteins through immunoprecipitation, a novel protein of 54 kDa was identified beside previously known 30 kDa and 18 kDa precursor and mature proteins of <b>frataxin</b> respectively. Immunohistochemistry of normal human brains sections revealed the perfect specificity of <b>frataxin</b> protein that we used for the immunoprecipitation. Given that 30 kDa and 18 kDa <b>frataxin</b> proteins previously reported, we report here the presence of a 54 kDa protein which could be an interacting partner protein of <b>frataxin.</b> Further investigations are required to identify type of protein and its relevant role in the appropriate functioning of <b>frataxin...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{defective}} {{expression of}} <b>frataxin</b> causes the hereditary neurodegenerative disorder Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA). Human <b>frataxin</b> is synthesized as a 210 amino acid precursor protein, which needs proteolytic processing into mitochondria {{to be converted}} into the functional mature form. In vitro processing of human <b>frataxin</b> was previously described to yield a 155 amino acid mature form, corresponding to residues 56 – 210 (<b>frataxin</b> 56 – 210). Here, we studied the maturation of <b>frataxin</b> by in vivo overexpression in human cells. Our data show that the main form of mature <b>frataxin</b> is generated by a proteolytic cleavage between Lys 80 and Ser 81, yielding a 130 amino acid protein (<b>frataxin</b> 81 – 210). This maturation product corresponds to the endogenous <b>frataxin</b> detected in human heart, peripheral blood lymphocytes or dermal fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that <b>frataxin</b> 81 – 210 is biologically functional, as it rescues aconitase defects in frataxin-deficient cells derived from FRDA patients. Importantly, our data indicate that <b>frataxin</b> 56 – 210 can be produced in vivo when the primary 80 – 81 maturation site is unavailable, suggesting the existence of proteo-lytic mechanisms that can actively control {{the size of the}} mature product, with possible functional implications...|$|E
40|$|Friedreich ataxia (FA) Is {{caused by}} {{decreased}} <b>frataxin</b> expression {{that results in}} mitochondrial iron (Fe) overload. However, the role of <b>frataxin</b> in mammalian Fe metabolism remains unclear. In this investigation we examined the function of <b>frataxin</b> in Fe metabolism by implementing a well-characterized model of erythroid differentiation, namely, Friend cells induced using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). We have characterized the changes in <b>frataxin</b> expression compared to molecules that play key roles in Fe metabolism (the transferrin receptor [TfR] and the Fe transporter Nramp 2) and hemoglobinization (beta-globin). DMSO induction of hemoglobinization results in a marked decrease in <b>frataxin</b> gene (Frda) expression and protein levels. To a lesser extent, Nramp 2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were also decreased on erythroid differentiation, whereas TfR and beta-globin mRNA levels increased. Intracellular Fe depletion using desferrioxamine or pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone, which chelate cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Fe pools, respectively, {{have no effect on}} <b>frataxin</b> expression. Furthermore, cytoplasmic or mitochondrial Fe loading of induced Friend cells with ferric ammonium citrate, or the heme synthesis inhibitor, succinylacetone, respectively, also had no effect on <b>frataxin</b> expression. Although <b>frataxin</b> has been suggested by others to be a mitochondrial ferritin, the lack of effect of intracellular Fe levels on <b>frataxin</b> expression is not consistent with an Fe storage role. Significantly, protoporphyrin IX down-regulates <b>frataxin</b> protein levels, suggesting a regulatory role of <b>frataxin</b> in Fe or heme metabolism. Because decreased <b>frataxin</b> expression leads to mitochondrial Fe loading in FA, our data suggest that reduced <b>frataxin</b> expression during erythroid differentiation results in mitochondrial Fe sequestration for heme biosynthesis.
