40|$|Spray forming is a {{near-net-shape}} fabrication {{technology in}} which a spray of <b>finely</b> <b>atomized</b> liquid <b>droplets</b> is deposited onto a suitably shaped substrate or mold to produce a coherent solid. The technology offers unique opportunities for simplifying materials processing without sacrificing, and oftentimes substantially improving, product quality. Spray forming can be performed {{with a wide range}} of metals and nonmetals, and offers property improvements resulting from rapid solidification (e. g., refined microstructures, extended solid solubilities and reduced segregation). Economic benefits result from process simplification and the elimination of unit operations. Researchers at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) are developing spray-forming technology for producing near-net-shape solids and coatings of a variety of metals, polymers, and composite materials. Results from several spray forming programs are presented to illustrate the range of capabilities of the technique as well as the accompanying technical and economic benefits. Low-carbon steel strip greater than 0. 75 mm thick and polymer membranes for gas/gas and liquid/liquid separations that were spray formed are discussed; recent advances in spray forming molds, dies, and other tooling using low-melting-point metals are described...|$|R
40|$|Performance and {{reliability}} are primary drivers for military aircraft engine design. However, more stringent environmental regulation will require future engines {{to have lower}} emissions as well. It will be challenging to improve the flammability and combustion efficiency while reducing emissions. Modern high performance liquid-fueled combustors typically operate at high space heat release rates, requiring that the fuel be rapidly atomized, evaporated and mixed with the oxidizer. <b>Finely</b> <b>atomized</b> fuel <b>droplets</b> evaporate quickly (even {{if it is a}} low vapor pressure fuel like JP- 8), thereby reducing the amount of unburned hydrocarbons.

40|$|Exploitation of {{the natural}} {{reserves}} of petroleum products has put a tremendous onus on the automotive industry. Increasing pollution levels and the depletion of the petroleum reserves have lead {{to the search for}} alternate fuel sources for internal combustion engines. Usage of vegetable oils poses some challenges like poor spray penetration, valve sticking and clogging of injector nozzles. Most of these problems may be solved by partial substitution of diesel with vegetable oil. In this work, the performance and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine fueled by waste cooking oil-diesel emulsion with different water contents are evaluated. The use of waste cooking oil-diesel emulsion lowers the peak temperature, which reduces the formation of NOx. Moreover the phenomenon of micro explosion that results during the combustion of an emulsified fuel <b>finely</b> <b>atomizes</b> the fuel <b>droplets</b> and thus enhances combustion.

40|$|Rapid {{compression}} machines (RCMs) {{are well}} characterized laboratory scale devices capable of achieving internal combustion (IC) engine relevant thermodynamic environments. These machines {{are often used}} to collect ignition delay times as targets for gas-phase chemical kinetic fuel autoigntion models. Modern RCMs utilize creviced piston(s) to improve charge homogeneity and allow for an adequate validation of detailed chemistry mechanisms against experiments using computationally efficient, homogeneous reactor models (HRMs). Conventionally, experiments are preformed by introducing a premixed gas of fuel + oxidizer + diluent into the machine, which is compressed volumetrically via a piston. Experiments investigating low-vapor pressure fuels (e. g. diesels, biodiesels, jet fuels, etc.) and surrogates can be conducted by preheating both the charge {{as well as the}} machine. This method of fuel loading can lead to pretest fuel pyrolysis as well as machine seal degradation. Under some conditions loading a fuel aerosol of <b>finely</b> <b>atomized</b> liquid <b>droplets</b> in an oxidizer + diluent bath gas (i. e. wet compression) has been suggested to extend the capabilities of RCM experiments to involatile fuels. This work investigates phase-change effects during RCM experiments, especially for aerosol-fueling conditions, while the methodology can be applied to gas-phase fuel experiments where fuel condensation can occur at the compressed conditions within the boundary layer region. To facilitate this study a reduced-order, physics-based model is used. This work highlights important machine-scale influences not investigated in previous work, and provides additional detail concerning an aerosol RCM’s capabilities and limitations. A transient formulation is developed for the multi-phase transport within the RCM reaction chamber as well as the flow to the piston crevice region during both the compression and delay periods. The goal of this work is threefold. First, an a priori knowledge of the stratification present under various conditions can help determine an optimum machine geometry so that discrepancies between experimental data sets and 0 D kinetics simulations are minimized for involatile fuels. Second, the model is computationally tractable to prescribe heat loss rates to an HRM during simulations of experiments so that physical effects can be incorporated into simulations using detailed chemistry. Finally, heat loss rates that are prescribed to the HRM are only a function of machine geometry, and are independent of ad hoc and empirically derived fits that vary between facilities. Thus a more adequate comparison of data between RCM facilities and with existing literature can be made...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the number of drug particles or droplets contained in metered dose inhaler (MDI) aerosols. Equations were developed to estimate this. The number of drug particles was estimated to be as high as about 300 million for QVAR® solution MDIs and as low as 670, 000 for Beclovent™ MDIs. The number of particles in MDI aerosols was shown to be highly dependent on the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation, and to a lesser extent the total mass of the aerosol. It was demonstrated that when the number of particles are calculated assuming that the aerosol is monodisperse and using the MMAD as the particle size, the number of particles are significantly underestimated. The number of <b>droplets</b> <b>atomized</b> from HFA- 134 a MDIs was estimated to range from about 220 million to about 1. 1 billion droplets per actuation. For solution MDIs, each of the <b>atomized</b> <b>droplets</b> contains drug and thus the number of drug particles is the same as the number of <b>atomized</b> <b>droplets.</b> However, for suspension MDI formulations many of the droplets do not contain any micronized drug particles and the number of drug particles is much lower than the number of <b>atomized</b> <b>droplets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} and controlling mechanisms of a charge injection electrostatic atomization method for insulating liquids {{have been investigated}} using a sharp electrode as a current source, which is placed inside the atomizer and held at a high electrical potential. The method is applicable to highly insulating liquids such as hydrocarbon oils and oil-based solutions, and potential uses of this technology include combustion systems and high-quality spray coating/deposition applications. Subcritical and supercritical flow regimes of atomizer operation are delineated by different types of electrical breakdown. The subcritical flow regime is limited by an insulation failure of the liquid hydrocarbon itself and occurs inside the atomizer. This regime, although of interest to understand the fundamental nature of the electrohydromechanics, does not produce <b>finely</b> <b>atomized</b> sprays. Atomization performance in the supercritical flow regime {{is characterized by the}} maximum spray specific charge being limited by a partial discharge in the gas outside the nozzle, around the liquid jet as it emerges from the nozzle. In this case, <b>finely</b> <b>atomized</b> sprays are possible, and with no electrical limitation on the upper flow rate limit. The maximum spray specific charge achievable in the supercritical regime has been found to increase at larger nozzle exit velocities and also for smaller orifice diameters. These two factors, combined with the increased aerodynamic shear acting on the charged liquid jet as it emerges from the orifice at higher velocities, enhances the destabilization of the charged liquid jet to produce <b>finely</b> <b>atomized</b> and well-dispersed sprays of insulating liquids...|$|R

The microstructure of over spray powder and the preform are studied. Spray atomization produces various sizes of droplets, ranging from 5 to 300 μ m.
