A postal questionnaire was sent to 540 consultant <b>gynaecologists</b> and 225 consultant and senior registrar members of the British Association of Dermatologists. 350 <b>gynaecologists</b> and 161 dermatologists returned completed questionnaires. The workload of LS and Paget's disease was evenly distributed, with 54 % of dermatologists and 58 % of <b>gynaecologists</b> seeing more than six cases of LS per annum and less than 1 % seeing more than five cases of Paget's disease. 92 % of responding <b>gynaecologists</b> saw at least one case of VIN per year whereas 43 % of dermatologists saw no cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} {{the use of}} {{clinical}} prediction models improves concordance between <b>gynaecologists</b> with respect to treatment decisions in reproductive medicine. DESIGN: We constructed 16 vignettes of subfertile couples by varying fertility history, postcoital test, sperm motility, follicle-stimulating hormone level and Chlamydia antibody titre. SETTING: Thirty-five <b>gynaecologists</b> estimated three probabilities, i. e. the 1 -year probability of spontaneous pregnancy, the pregnancy chance after intrauterine insemination (IUI) and the pregnancy chance after in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Subsequently they proposed therapeutic regimens for these 16 fictional couples, i. e. expectant management, IUI or IVF. Three months later, the participant <b>gynaecologists</b> again had to propose therapeutic regimes for the same 16 fictional cases but this time accompanied by pregnancy chances obtained from prediction models: predictions on spontaneous pregnancy, IUI and IVF. POPULATION: Thirty-five <b>gynaecologists</b> working in academic and nonacademic hospitals in the Netherlands. METHODS: Setting section. Main outcome measures The concordance between <b>gynaecologists</b> of probability estimates, expressed as interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the concordance between <b>gynaecologists</b> of treatment decisions, analysed by calculating Cohen's kappa (kappa). RESULTS: The <b>gynaecologists</b> differed widely in estimating pregnancy chances (ICC: 0. 34). Furthermore, {{there was a huge}} variation in the proposed therapeutic regimens (kappa: 0. 21). The treatment decisions made by <b>gynaecologists</b> were consistent with the ranking of their probability estimates. When prediction models were used, the concordance (kappa) for treatment decisions increased from 0. 21 to 0. 38. The number of <b>gynaecologists</b> counselling for expectant management increased from 39 to 51 %, whereas counselling for IVF dropped from 23 to 14 %. CONCLUSION: <b>Gynaecologists</b> differed widely in their estimation of prognosis in 16 fictional cases of subfertile couples. Their therapeutic regimens showed likewise huge variation. After confrontation with prediction models in the same 16 fictional cases, the proposed therapeutic regimens showed only slightly better concordance.

25|$|Midwives {{were known}} by many {{different}} titles in antiquity, ranging from iatrinē (Gr. nurse), maia (Gr., midwife), obstetrix (Lat., obstetrician), and medica (Lat., doctor). It appears as though midwifery was treated {{differently in the}} Eastern end of the Mediterranean basin {{as opposed to the}} West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of midwife (maia) to that of <b>gynaecologist</b> (iatros gynaikeios, translated as women's doctor), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors. One example of such a midwife is Salpe of Lemnos, who wrote on women’s diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the Netherlands LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure) is {{treatment}} of choice for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Complication risk is low and effectiveness is high: 70 % to 95 % of patients has normal cytology after treatment. Thermal artifacts may be a disadvantage of the technique. It is assumed that effectiveness of LEEP is higher among oncological <b>gynaecologists</b> compared to general <b>gynaecologists.</b> The objective {{of this study is}} to test this assumption. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was performed in Medisch Spectrum Twente, a teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Medical records of patients who underwent LEEP between July 2009 and December 2011 were reviewed. LEEP results from oncological and general <b>gynaecologists</b> were compared for cytology after six months, treatment for residual disease and complications. Besides we independently reviewed part of LEEP specimens to compare for resection margins, limitations of interpretability and artifacts. Logistic regression was used to correct for confounders. Results: In total 349 patients were included, 227 operated by oncological <b>gynaecologists</b> and 122 by general <b>gynaecologists.</b> Percentages of abnormal cytology six months after LEEP were 8. 0 % and 16. 7 % respectively (OR 0. 40, 95 %-CI 0. 20 - 0. 80). Oncological gynaecologists’ patients underwent less frequent treatment for residual disease (OR 0. 36, 95 %-CI 0. 17 - 0. 78), but there was no difference in complications (OR 0. 95, 95 %-CI 0. 51 - 1. 77). A total of 147 LEEP specimens were reviewed. There was neither difference in limitations of interpretability (OR 1. 07, 95 %-CI 0. 54 - 2. 15) nor in artifacts (OR 2. 15, 95 %-CI 0. 80 - 5. 81) between <b>gynaecologists.</b> Oncologists removed more tissue fragments and therefore had higher rates of positive resection margins (OR 2. 24, 95 %-CI 1. 01 - 4. 97). Positive resection margin did not correlate with abnormal cytology in follow-up. Conclusion: Our results confirm the assumption that effectiveness of LEEP is higher among oncological <b>gynaecologists</b> compared to general <b>gynaecologists.</b> It is therefore eligible to restrict LEEP technique to oncological <b>gynaecologists</b> only. Complications and artifacts did not differ between <b>gynaecologists.</b> Positive resection margins in fragmented specimens are less predictive of abnormal cytology after LEEP. ...|$|R

A total of 582 <b>gynaecologists</b> filled the questionnaire (mean age 49 years (SD 10); 58. 1 % males). Results. Most <b>gynaecologists</b> thought that the most common symptom observed in women with PMS is irritability and the resolution of symptoms after menstruation is the most useful criteria for the diagnosis of PMS. Forty percent of <b>gynaecologists</b> who filled the questionnaire thought that the diagnosis of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) as indicated by the DSM IV is similar to the diagnosis of PMS, 35. 7 % indicated a more severe condition and 24. 1 % a less severe condition.
