25|$|The {{book was}} {{dedicated}} to his good friend Friedrich Wannieck and in the introduction before <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the runes there is {{a copy of a}} correspondence between Wannieck and List.|$|E
25|$|One of Carr's most lasting {{contributions}} to modern-day conspiracy theory was <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> an alleged plan for three world wars (often referred as the 3WW), which he believed {{was developed by}} Confederate general and Masonic scholar Albert Pike.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> {{the rise}} and fall of {{powerful}} dynasties provide a political moral. His commentaries on methodology are sparse, other than assertions of accuracy.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> {{foreign policy}} with Zbigniew Brzezinski led by {{journalist}} David Ignatius {{were published in}} a 2008 book titled America and the World: Conversations on the Future of American Foreign Policy.|$|R
5000|$|Orend's works {{focus on}} just war theory and human rights. He is most {{well known for}} <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> jus post bellum (justice after war), which deals with the {{termination}} phase of war.|$|R
25|$|Rashi, {{while his}} {{commentary}} on the verses describing the days of creation teaches them as literal days, brackets <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> Genesis ch. 1 with comments stating that the entire world was created at once, with no duration of existence before Adam being specified.|$|E
25|$|Russell Doolittle: Doolittle, upon whom Behe based much of <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> blood clotting, {{described}} it as misrepresenting a simplified explanation he had given in a lecture, and presenting a fallacious creationist miscalculation of improbability by omitting known options, which {{also contributed to the}} original publisher turning down the book for publication.|$|E
25|$|Bultmann's {{analysis}} is still widely applied in German-speaking countries, although with many corrections and discussions. Wide-ranging replies {{have been made}} to this analysis. Today, most Christian exegetes reject much of Bultmann's theory, but accept certain of his intuitions. For instance, J. Blank uses Bultmann in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the Last Judgment and W. Thüsing uses him to discuss the elevation and glorification of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> {{rational}} psychology, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) {{identified the}} soul as the [...] "I" [...] in the strictest sense, {{and argued that}} the existence of inner experience can neither be proved nor disproved.|$|R
50|$|Christine is blind. She {{falls in}} love with Burrows, enjoying <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the spirit and the soul but knowing little of his past. One day she is struck by a {{streetcar}} and knocked unconscious, causing Burrows to once again question his faith.|$|R
50|$|Shankara in <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the Advaita Vedanta {{philosophy}} {{referred to}} the early Upanishads to explain the key difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, stating that Hinduism asserts that Atman (soul, self) exists, whereas Buddhism asserts {{that there is no}} soul, no self.|$|R
25|$|Pāṇini (c. 5th century BC) {{formulated}} {{the rules}} for Sanskrit grammar. His notation was similar to modern mathematical notation, and used metarules, transformations, and recursion. Pingala (roughly 3rd–1st centuries BC) in his treatise of prosody uses a device corresponding to a binary numeral system. <b>His</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the combinatorics of meters corresponds to an elementary version of the binomial theorem. Pingala's work also contains the basic ideas of Fibonacci numbers (called mātrāmeru).|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of Lectio Divina, {{a form of}} prayer that centers on scripture reading, was developed in its best-known form in the sixth century, through the work of Benedict of Nursia and Pope Gregory I, and described and promoted more widely in the 12th century by Guigo II. The 9th century saw the development of mystical theology through {{the introduction of the}} works of sixth-century theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, such as On Mystical Theology. <b>His</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the via negativa was especially influential.|$|E
25|$|Freud had greatly {{admired his}} {{philosophy}} tutor, Brentano, {{who was known}} for his theories of perception and introspection, as well as Theodor Lipps {{who was one of the}} main contemporary theorists of the concepts of the unconscious and empathy. Brentano discussed the possible existence of the unconscious mind in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). Although Brentano denied its existence, <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the unconscious probably helped introduce Freud to the concept. Freud owned and made use of Charles Darwin's major evolutionary writings, and was also influenced by Eduard von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869).|$|E
50|$|While Ellul {{is perhaps}} most noted for his sociological work, {{especially}} <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> technology, he saw his theological work as an essential aspect of his career, and began publishing theological discussions early, with such books as The Presence of the Kingdom (1948).|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} writing, Wells incorporated into <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the World State {{a notion of}} universal human rights that would protect and guarantee {{the freedom of the}} individual. His 1940 publication The Rights of Man laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|R
50|$|The work of Democritus only survives in secondhand reports, some {{of which}} are {{unreliable}} or conflicting. Much of the best evidence of Democritus' theory of atomism is reported by Aristotle in <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> Democritus' and Plato's contrasting views on the types of indivisibles composing the natural world.|$|R
25|$|Disenchanted with French {{academic}} life, Ricœur taught {{briefly at}} the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium, before taking a position at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1970 to 1985. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. His study culminated in The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language published in 1975 and the three-volume Time and Narrative published in 1983, 1984, 1985 Ricœur gave the Gifford Lectures in 1985/86, published in 1990 as Oneself as Another. This work built on <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> narrative identity and his continuing interest in the self.|$|E
25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, {{in that it}} is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any {{particular}} races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E
25|$|In other {{departments}} of physics may be mentioned his {{paper on the}} conduction of heat in crystals (1851) and his inquiries in connection with Crookes radiometer; his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside {{the outline of a}} dark body seen against the sky (1883); and, still later, his theory of the x-rays, which he suggested might be transverse waves travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains. Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and Clairaut's theorem, and the other on the variation of gravity at {{the surface of the earth}} (1849)—also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847) and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850) and <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), research related to his evidence given to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures after the Dee bridge disaster of 1847.|$|E
5000|$|Christiaan Huygens {{coined the}} term [...] "centrifugal force" [...] in his 1659 De Vi Centrifuga and wrote of it in his 1673 Horologium Oscillatorium on pendulums. Isaac Newton {{coined the term}} [...] "centripetal force" [...] (vis centripita) in <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> gravity in <b>his</b> 1684 De Motu Corporum.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a closer}} {{understanding}} {{of the way in}} which ideas of honour (and related shame) are linked to social structures such as law and religion, a reading of the works of the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu is worthwhile, particularly with reference to <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the idea of [...] "habitus".|$|R
50|$|The {{philosophers}} whose writings {{have made}} the greatest impact upon Ben-Ze'ev are Aristotle, Baruch Spinoza and Immanuel Kant. Kant’s main influence is most evident in Ben Ze'ev's discussions on epistemology and perception. Aristotle’s and Spinoza’s impact is more apparent in <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the mind-body problem and in {{his work on the}} emotions.|$|R
25|$|In the 19th century, the {{connection}} between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat {{is a form of}} energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics—a restatement of the law of conservation of energy—which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.|$|E
500|$|Allen praises Beddard's [...] "commendable conservatism" [...] in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> camouflage, {{which he}} compares to the [...] "credulous spirit" [...] of other authors. Reviewing {{the chapter on}} warning coloration, Allen remarks that the great horned owl is known to prey on the skunk, showing that even such a disagreeably pungent animal can be subject to predation.|$|E
500|$|He {{spent his}} {{last three years}} in impoverished exile. He took the name [...] "Sebastian Melmoth", after Saint Sebastian, and the titular {{character}} of Melmoth the Wanderer (a Gothic novel by Charles Maturin, Wilde's great-uncle). Wilde wrote two long {{letters to the editor}} of the Daily Chronicle, describing the brutal conditions of English prisons and advocating penal reform. <b>His</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the dismissal of Warder Martin for giving biscuits to an anaemic child prisoner repeated the themes of the corruption and degeneration of punishment that he had earlier outlined in The Soul of Man under Socialism.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Cohn has {{included}} the first movement of this concerto in <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> triadic progressions from a Neo-Riemannian perspective. [...] Cohn has also analysed such progressions mathematically. Cohn notes several progressions that divide the octave equally into three parts, and {{which can be}} analyzed using the triadic transformations proposed by Hugo Riemann.|$|R
50|$|His Oratio ad Graecos (Address to the Greeks) condemns paganism as worthless, and {{praises the}} {{reasonableness}} and high antiquity of Christianity. As early as Eusebius, Tatian was praised for <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the antiquity of Moses and of Jewish legislation, {{and it was}} because of this chronological section that his Oratio was not generally condemned.|$|R
5|$|As {{one of his}} favourites, Hazlitt places Cymbeline {{first in}} <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare's plays, {{according}} it extensive treatment. This includes his personal impressions of individual characters—as the book's title would lead us to expect—but also the kind of broader consideration for which {{he would not be}} credited for at least a century and a half.|$|R
500|$|But {{difficulties}} remain. Bailey, in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> ġē names, {{has pointed}} out that Ely would be anomalous if really from ēlġē [...] "eel district", being remote from the areas where possible examples of ġē names occur, and moreover, there is no parallel for the use of a fish-name in compounds with ġē. More seriously, the usual English spelling remains Elig, even in the dative case used after many prepositions, where Elige would be expected if the second element were īġ [...] "island". This is in conflict with all the other island names which surround Ely.|$|E
500|$|Still, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, {{and sources}} {{received}} substantial criticism from historians. Marian DeB. Kilson's {{review in the}} American Historical Review described Blassingame's aims as [...] "imperfectly realized" [...] because he [...] "lacks a clear analytical perspective". She found <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> slave personality types [...] "fascinating" [...] and [...] "his methodological aims ... important" [...] but [...] "not systematically pursued". Kilson believes that Blassingame ultimately failed in his analysis because [...] "his intellectual integration of social and psychological orientations {{has yet to be}} fully achieved." [...] Orville W. Taylor contends in the Journal of Negro History that Blassingame had a tendency to overgeneralize and make [...] "unsubstantiatable claims to originality and uniqueness".|$|E
500|$|Ælfric, who was {{described}} by Claudio Leonardi as [...] "the highest pinnacle of Benedictine reform and Anglo-Saxon literature", shared in the movement's monastic ideals and devotion to learning, {{as well as its}} close relations with leading lay people. His works included two series of forty homilies, lives of saints, a Latin grammar in English, and a discussion of trades and occupations. He was an adviser of the king, and an authority on church practice and canon law. Matthew Parker, Queen Elizabeth I's first Archbishop of Canterbury, cited him in support of Protestant doctrines, and <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> Eucharistic theory was cited in theological controversies until the nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|Before {{entering}} political life, Qaadri was commentator in the Canadian {{media for}} <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> medical issues (which he usually {{presented in a}} populist manner, intended for non-specialists). He has written numerous articles on medicine for journals such as The Medical Post Qaadri has been granted the position of Designated Medical Practitioner by the Canadian government.|$|R
50|$|As {{one of his}} favourites, Hazlitt places Cymbeline {{first in}} <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare's plays, {{according}} it extensive treatment. This includes his personal impressions of individual characters—as the book's title would lead us to expect—but also the kind of broader consideration for which {{he would not be}} credited for at least a century and a half.|$|R
5000|$|His {{skill as}} an {{observer}} and computer is further shown in valuable material published in the volumes of the “Washington Observations”, and his work comprised many special investigations. Of these the most important include <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> “The Orbit of the Great Comet of 1843”, originally contributed and published through several issues of Benjamin Apthorp Gould’s “Astronomical Journal”.|$|R
