25|$|A neutron bomb, {{technically}} {{referred to}} as an <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>weapon</b> (ERW), {{is a type of}} tactical nuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic neutron radiation. This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons, which are designed to capture this intense neutron radiation to increase its overall explosive yield. In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type atomic weapon. Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb. Meanwhile, relative to other nuclear weapons, damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure (though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated).|$|E

5000|$|Some {{tactical}} nuclear weapons have specific features meant to enhance their battlefield characteristics, such as variable yield which allow their explosive power to be varied {{over a wide range}} for different situations, or <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>weapons</b> (the so-called [...] "neutron bombs") which are meant to maximize ionizing radiation exposure while minimizing blast effects.|$|R
50|$|Technically speaking, all {{low yield}} nuclear <b>weapons</b> are <b>radiation</b> <b>weapons,</b> {{including}} non-enhanced variants. Up to about 10 kilotons in yield, all nuclear weapons have prompt neutron radiation as their furthest-reaching lethal component, after {{which point the}} lethal blast and thermal effects radius begins to out-range the lethal ionizing <b>radiation</b> radius. <b>Enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>weapons</b> also fall into this same yield range and simply enhance the intensity and range of the neutron dose for a given yield.|$|R
25|$|So-called neutron bombs (<b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>weapons)</b> {{have been}} {{constructed}} which release a larger fraction of their energy as ionizing radiation (specifically, neutrons), but these are all thermonuclear devices which rely on the nuclear fusion stage to produce the extra radiation. The energy dynamics of pure fission bombs always remain at about 6% yield of the total in radiation, as a prompt result of fission.|$|R

50|$|A neutron bomb, officially {{defined as}} a type of <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>weapon</b> (ERW), is a low yield {{thermonuclear}} weapon designed to maximize lethal neutron radiation in the immediate vicinity of the blast while minimizing the physical power of the blast itself. The neutron release generated by a nuclear fusion reaction is intentionally allowed to escape the weapon, rather than being absorbed by its other components. The neutron burst, which is used as the primary destructive action of the warhead, is able to penetrate enemy armor more effectively than a conventional warhead, thus making it more lethal as a tactical weapon.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Cox Report, as of 1999 the United States {{had never}} {{deployed}} a neutron weapon. The {{nature of this}} statement is not clear; it reads [...] "The stolen information also includes classified design information for an <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>weapon</b> (commonly known as the [...] "neutron bomb"), which neither the United States, nor any other nation, has ever deployed." [...] However, the fact that neutron bombs had been produced by the US was well known at this time {{and part of the}} public record. Cohen suggests the report is playing with the definitions; while the US bombs were never deployed to Europe, they remained stockpiled in the US.|$|E
50|$|Neutron bombs, or more precisely, <b>enhanced</b> neutron <b>radiation</b> <b>weapons</b> {{were also}} to find use as {{strategic}} anti-ballistic missile weapons, {{and in this}} role they are believed to remain in active service within Russia's Gazelle missile.|$|R
5000|$|Development of ER warheads for Lance continued, but in {{the early}} 1970s {{attention}} had turned to using modified versions of the W70, the W70 Mod 3. Development was subsequently postponed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 following protests against his administration's plans to deploy neutron warheads to ground forces in Europe. On November 17, 1978, in a test the USSR detonated its first similar-type bomb. [...] President Ronald Reagan restarted production in 1981. The Soviet Union began a propaganda campaign against the US's neutron bomb in 1981 following Reagan's announcement. In 1983 Reagan then announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, which surpassed neutron bomb production in ambition and vision and with that the neutron bomb quickly faded {{from the center of the}} public's attention.Three types of <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>weapons</b> (ERW) were deployed by the United States. The W66 warhead, for the anti-ICBM Sprint missile system, was deployed in 1975 and retired the next year, along with the missile system. The W70 Mod 3 warhead was developed for the short-range, tactical MGM-52 Lance missile, and the W79 Mod 0 was developed for nuclear artillery shells. The latter two types were retired by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, following the end of the Cold War. The last W70 Mod 3 warhead was dismantled in 1996, and the last W79 Mod 0 was dismantled by 2003, when the dismantling of all W79 variants was completed.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the use of deep sub-wavelength(sub-&# 61548;) nano-photonic structures to <b>enhance</b> <b>radiation</b> of optical emitters. The deep sub-wavelength designs are based on high permittivity contrast of materials involving either purely dielectric interfaces or metal. The optical properties of metal at infrared and optical frequencies enable optical structures that can confine light to dimension smaller than the wavelength. The building blocks of these nano-photonic system are non-resonant, broadband waveguides with dramatic field confinement in the nano-scale low permittivity region. Strong interaction and <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> leads to efficient coupling into the primary optical mode of the structures which improves fluorescence brightness, saturation, speed, emission efficiency, single photon fidelity at a single emitter-single photon level and holds promise for solid-state lighting, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing application. The first part of the dissertation explores deep sub-wavelength waveguiding structures as non-resonant optical component that <b>enhances</b> <b>radiation</b> and collects emitted photon with high fidelity. The last part explores the design of small resonator that is constructed from a subwavelength waveguide for use as addressing optical emitters. The benefits of non-resonant design are highlighted throughout...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: In this study, we {{investigated}} the {{mechanisms by which}} temozolomide <b>enhances</b> <b>radiation</b> response in glioblastoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a panel of four primary human glioblastoma cell lines with heterogeneous O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein expression, normal human astrocytes, and U 87 xenografts, {{we investigated}} (a) the relationship of MGMT status with efficacy of temozolomide-based chemoradiation using a panel of in vitro and in vivo assays; (b) underlying mechanisms by which temozolomide <b>enhances</b> <b>radiation</b> effect in glioblastoma cells; and (c) strategies to overcome resistance to radiation + temozolomide. RESULTS: Temozolomide <b>enhances</b> <b>radiation</b> response most effectively in glioblastomas without detectable MGMT expression. On concurrent radiation + temozolomide administration in MGMT-negative glioblastomas, {{there seems to be}} decreased double-strand DNA (dsDNA) repair capacity and enhanced dsDNA damage compared either with radiation alone or with sequentially administered temozolomide. Our data suggest that O(6) -benzylguanine can enhance the antitumor effects of concurrent radiation + temozolomide in MGMT-positive cells by enhancing apoptosis and the degree of dsDNA damage. O(6) -Benzylguanine was most effective when administered concurrently with radiation + temozolomide and had less of an effect when administered with temozolomide in the absence of radiation or when administered sequentially with radiation. Our in vivo data using U 87 xenografts confirmed our in vitro findings. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that temozolomide <b>enhances</b> <b>radiation</b> response most effectively in MGMT-negative glioblastomas by increasing the degree of radiation-induced double-strand DNA damage. In MGMT-positive glioblastomas, depletion of MGMT by the addition of O(6) -benzylguanine significantly enhances the antitumor effect of concurrent radiation + temozolomide. These are among the first data showing mechanisms of synergy between radiation and temozolomide and the effect of MGMT...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{hardness}} of semiconductor detectors {{based on}} silicon is, first of all, determined by an introduction rate of point defects and aggregation of defect clusters. So introduction of electrically inactive impurity of oxygen promotes taking a vacancy stream {{aside from a}} doping impurity of phosphorus.

Use of neutron transmutation doping method allows to receive silicon with <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> hardness. The preliminary irradiation with neutrons or charged particles with subsequent annealing also allows to increase radiation hardness of material.

40|$|Along the auroral field lines, a {{fraction}} of the energetic electrons injected from the magnetotail is reflected by the earth's convergent geomagnetic field. The reflected loss-cone electrons are unstable with respect to the cyclotron maser instability, resulting in the auroral kilometric radiation. This paper investigates the kinetic friction force exerted on the energetic electrons by the <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> field. It is found that the <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> results in a deceleration of reflected electrons, thereby providing an effective resistivity. In addition, the rate of decrease (increase) of effective perpendicular (parallel) kinetic temperatures is also evaluated.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the project is to develop {{austenitic}} stainless steel structural materials with <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> resistance.

To achieve such <b>enhanced</b> <b>radiation</b> resistance, three experimental paths have been chosen: bulk composition engineering, grain boundary composition engineering, and grain boundary structural engineering. The program involves the use of high-energy proton irradiation as a rapid screening tool to systematically test combinations of alloy composition and thermomechanical treatment conditions to isolate the controlling mechanisms and develop an understanding of how these factors can be engineered to improve material properties...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the effects of <b>enhanced</b> ultraviolet-B (UV-B) <b>radiation</b> on soybean yield components and seed growth characteristics, three determinate soybean cultivars, Hai 339 (H 339), Heinong 35 (HN 35) and Kennong 18 (KN 18) were grown for 2 years in a field experiment exposed to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation.</b> <b>Enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> decreased plant height, dry weight of individual stem and yield per plant of three soybean cultivars on average by 15. 5 %, 16. 9 % and 43. 7 %, respectively. Pod number per plant was the most responsible component for yield change under UV-B radiation in the 2 -year study. Seed number per pod was less affected by change in light treatment in our experiment, compared with the pod number per plant. UV-B radiation had no significant effect on effective filling period, however, seed size was negatively impacted by UV-B radiation and it decreased 12. 3 % for three soybean cultivars. Reduction of seed size was mainly due to the decrease of cotyledon cell number. <b>Enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> had no significant effect on cotyledon cell volume, cell growth rate or cell weight. Our results suggested that the reduction of seed ABA concentration was directly responsible for lower cotyledon cell number under <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation...</b>|$|R

Once we understood the importance of oxygen contamination in increasing the specific heat and wall losses of uranium-based cocktails, we implemented new manufacturing and handling techniques for cocktail hohlraums that led to our demonstration of {{a significant increase in}} radiation temperature (up to + 7 eV at 300 eV) compared to a pure Au hohlraum. This data agrees well with modeling and suggests we can expect an 18 % reduction in wall loss (and 10 % reduction in laser energy) for the current ignition design by switching to cocktail hohlraums...|$|R

No significant effects of <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> were found on biomass allocation, gas exchange (except for P-n), photochemical efficiency of photosystem II or water use efficiency. Moreover, different sensitivity to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> {{between males and females}} was detected. Under <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation,</b> males exhibited significantly higher basal diameter and leaf nitrogen, and lower Chl a/b, ABA content, UV-B-absorbing compounds, as well as less decrement of leaf area and dry matter accumulation than did females. However, no significant sexual differences in these traits were found under ambient UV-B radiation. Our results suggest that males may possess a greater UV-B resistance than do females, with males having a more efficient antioxidant system and higher anthocyanin content to alleviate UV-B penetration stress than females.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> on growth, root morphology, leaf morphology and anatomy, pigment concentrations and gas exchange of seedlings of four tree species (Abies faxoniana, Acer mono, Picea asperata and Swida hemsleyi) from the southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China. Potted seedlings were exposed outdoors in Sichuan Province, China to two levels of UV-B (ambient UV-B, 11. 02 KJ m(- 2) day(- 1); and enhanced UV-B. 14. 33 KJ m(- 2) day(- 1)). Exposure to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> had significant effects on seedling growth and morphological and photosynthetic traits of the four species. Total and belowground biomass was lower in seedlings exposed to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> in all four species. Concentrations of photosynthetic pigments (Chl (a + b)) and UV-B-absorbing compounds in the leaves of all four species was lower in seedlings exposed to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation,</b> but the Chl a/b ratio was not affected. Enhanced UV-B markedly reduced the net photosynthetic rate and increased the intercellular CO(2) concentration in the four species. Differences in stomatal conductance to water vapor were observed in all four species. Responses differed among the four species. Generally, exposure to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> led to shrinkage and curling of leaves in A. mono and S. hemsleyi seedlings, and reduced the leaf number and mass in A. mono seedlings. Exposure to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> markedly reduced the palisade tissue thickness in A. mono leaves but led to thicker leaves in S. hemsleyi seedlings. These results imply that broad-leaved tree seedlings were more sensitive to <b>enhanced</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> than conifer seedlings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
