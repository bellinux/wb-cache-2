40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of crown diameter and growing period of runner tips in 128 cell-trays on growth and yield of strawberry in the field. Treatments consisted of three classes of runner tip crown diameters, between 2. 0 to 3. 9 mm; 4. 0 to 5. 5 mm and 5. 6 to 7. 0 mm, respectively, and four growing periods <b>in</b> <b>trays,</b> 24; 39; 54 and 69 days, respectively. Higher shoot dry mass of transplants at planting and earlier yield of plants in the field were obtained in transplants grown for 69 days <b>in</b> <b>trays.</b> Larger runner tips lead to more vigorous transplants at planting and plants with higher vegetative growth in the field, with minor impact on yield. Increasing the growing time of runner tips <b>in</b> <b>trays</b> improved early fruit yield and decreased plant vegetative growth in the field. 201...|$|R

Using the men provided, as well as a seating chart, teams had to choose the proper dishes for each course from a table full of unmarked plates and serve them to the passengers in the dining room at the drydock. When the waiter was satisfied that each passenger received the correct order for each course, the team was allowed to move on to the next course. Once all five courses were served correctly, a Captain Edward Smith impersonator gave them their next clue. In Spray It, teams had to go to a skate park located in a warehouse where they had to finish half of a graffiti painting using a photograph as reference. When the crew approved of the job, teams received their next clue. The clue sent teams to the Pit Stop at Ulster Hall.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1996 HP {{introduced}} the network-ready LaserJet 5Si, a major revision and upgrade to the 3Si (IIISi) and 4Si, which {{had used the}} Canon NX engine. The 5Si, based on the Canon WX engine, could thus provide 11"x17" [...] printing at an unprecedented 24 pages per minute and at 600 dpi with resolution enhancement. An internal duplexer enabled full-speed double-sided printing. Automatic personality switching (between PCL and PostScript), a feature that first appeared on the 4SiMX, was standard on the 5SiMX. The 5Si series were true workhorses, but initial models were somewhat hobbled by a vulnerability to slightly low voltage (i.e. crashing if mains voltage was less than 120 Volts) {{as well as a}} weak clutch <b>in</b> <b>Tray</b> 3 (thus resulting in paper jamming for Tray 3 as well as the optional 2,000-sheet Tray 4), and also a weak solenoid in the manual feed tray (Tray 1). These paper-handling issues were easily dealt with. Many 5Si LaserJets remain in service today. The Color LaserJet 5 and 5M were introduced in March 1996, with 1200 dpi resolution. In October 1996 HP introduced its first printers in the LaserJet 6 range, the 6P and 6 MP, both aimed at small offices. They included infrared technology, for wireless printing. In November 1996 the HP 5Si Mopier was introduced, claimed to be the first network printers optimized to produce multiple original prints (mopies). It had a 100 000 copies per month duty cycle, and 24 ppm print speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that drying maize using biomass driers increase the quality of grains delays insect infestation mold and aflatoxin contamination in relation to direct sunlight drying. Most importantly biomass drying takes shorter time. It is therefore important to undertake performance of these driers to investigate the possibility of empirical control of such systems in remote areas. In this paper we present results of thermal performance of typical biomass-powered drier batch type. The results show that under natural convection temperature behavior within the drying chamber is unpredictable. However the use of exhaust fan forced convection gives predictable temperature distribution within the drying chamber. For burner shutter open at 50 and using maize cob as the fuel for forced convection the drying chamber attained a maximum temperature of 93 amp 730 C after 28 minutes and minimum temperature of 69 amp 730 C after 37 minutes in the lower tray tray 1. For burner shutter open at 100 the drying chamber attained a maximum temperature of 91 amp 730 C after 41 minutes and minimum temperature of 67 amp 730 C <b>in</b> <b>tray</b> 1. With burner 50 open tray 2 attained a maximum temperature of 62 amp 730 C after 30 minutes and minimum temperature of 56 amp 730 C after 40 minutes. With the burner 100 open tray 2 attained a maximum temperature of 61 amp 730 C after 39 minutes and minimum temperature of 52 amp 730 C after 52 minutes. From these results the optimal operating conditions of the burner operation were achieved when the shutter was open at 50. It took 76 minutes to dry 5 kg of maize with about 0. 8 kg including dampness from rains moisture content <b>in</b> <b>tray</b> 1. It took 140 minutes to dry the same quantity and moisture content of maize <b>in</b> <b>tray</b> 2.
