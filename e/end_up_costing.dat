However, Black knows she is {{doing the right thing}} and is {{determined}} to continue. Her fears for Sara are confirmed when it is discovered she and the elder Bangs have gone missing.

500|$|The {{original}} estimates {{put forth by}} the Port Authority had the costs for construction of the World Trade Center at $350 million—an optimistic figure. [...] In December 1966, the Port Authority announced increased cost estimates, bringing the estimated total to $575 million. [...] This announcement brought criticism of the project from private real estate developers, The New York Times, and others in New York City. [...] The critics charged that the Port Authority figure was an unrealistically low estimate, and they estimated the project would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> $750 million. When the World Trade Center twin towers were completed, the total costs to the Port Authority had reached $900 million. The project was financed through tax-exempt bonds issued by the Port Authority.|$|E

2500|$|The Edward R. Roybal Learning Center (previously {{known as}} Belmont Learning Center or Vista Hermosa Learning Center), in the densely {{populated}} Westlake district {{just west of}} downtown, was originally envisioned as a mixed-use education and retail complex to include several schools, shops and a public park. After {{more than a decade}} of delays stemming from the environmental review process, ground was broken for construction in 1995 [...] Midway through construction it was discovered that explosive methane and toxic hydrogen sulfide were seeping from an old underground oil field. Later, an active surface fault was found under one of the completed buildings, necessitating its removal. The LAUSD had spent an estimated $175 million on the project by 2004, with an additional $110 million budgeted for cleanup efforts. The total cost is estimated by LAUSD at $300 million. Critics have speculated that it may <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> closer to $500 million. Designed by architectural firm DLR Group WWCOT, the school opened in 2008 as Edward R. Roybal Learning Center.|$|E
2500|$|By 1948, Walt Disney's {{interest}} in model trains was evolving into an {{interest in}} larger, ridable miniature trains after observing the trains and backyard railroad layouts of several hobbyists. These hobbyists included Disney animator Ollie Johnston, who had a ridable miniature railroad; and Disney animator Ward Kimball, who owned the full-size, [...] narrow-gauge Grizzly Flats Railroad. On June 1, 1949, Walt Disney purchased [...] of vacant land in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. The property consisted of a bluff, which was [...] in size; and a level shelf of land behind it, which Disney named Yensid Valley. The word Yensid is Disney spelled backwards. Disney purchased this land {{in order to build}} a new residence for himself and his family, and an elaborate backyard railroad behind it. The railroad's layout was planned to include [...] of [...] gauge track with eleven switches, as well as gradients, overpasses, a trestle, and an elevated dirt berm. The layout would completely surround the house. Disney's wife, Lillian Disney, objected to the plan that part of the layout be built in an area where she intended to plant a flower garden. As a compromise, Disney had an S-curve tunnel built underneath the future spot for the garden. Aided by a Walt Disney Studios' attorney, Disney had a tongue-in-cheek legal contract written to establish his right to own and operate the railroad's right of way, which was signed by him and his wife, and witnessed by their two daughters. Disney named his railroad Carolwood Pacific Railroad (CPRR) in reference to his address at 355 Carolwood Drive. The railroad would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> $50,000, split evenly between its layout and rolling stock.|$|E
