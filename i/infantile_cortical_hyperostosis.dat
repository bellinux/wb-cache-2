The disease was demonstrated radiographically by massive cortical diaphyseal thickening and also extensive periosteal new bone formation surrounding several bones. Results in blood count were as follows: discrete anemia, moderate leukocytosis, and elevated sedimentation rate.

A genome-wide screen for genetic linkage in a large family with an autosomal dominant form of Caffey disease (ADC) revealed a locus on chromosome 17 q 21 (LOD score, 6. 78). Affected individuals and obligate carriers were heterozygous for a missense mutation (3040 CT) in exon 41 of the gene encoding the 1 (I) chain of type I collagen (COL 1 A 1), altering residue 836 (R 836 C) in the triple-helical domain of this chain. The same mutation was identified in affected members of 2 unrelated, smaller families with ADC, but not in 2 prenatal cases and not in more than 300 chromosomes from healthy individuals. Fibroblast cultures from an affected individual produced abnormal disulfide-bonded dimeric 1 (I) chains. Dermal collagen fibrils of the same individual were larger, more variable in shape and size, and less densely packed than those in control samples. Individuals bearing the mutation, whether they had experienced an episode of <b>cortical</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> or not, had joint hyperlaxity, hyperextensible skin, and inguinal hernias resembling symptoms of a mild form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III.

Radioclinical features, including sclerosis of the cranial and tubular bones and cranial nerve deficit, become more prominent in older patients. Defective modeling of tubular bones, cortical thickness and medullary width progress with age. Radioclinical abnormalities of van Buchem patients become more prominent in older patients, which suggests that the van Buchem gene is very actively involved in bone metabolism throughout life.

In this issue of the JCI, Gensure et al. undertook fine mapping of the genetic locus for this disease in a large kindred of individuals with the autosomal dominant form of the condition. The authors found a novel missense mutation in COL 1 A 1, the gene encoding the α 1 chain of type I collagen, in all affected individuals in 3 discrete pedigrees. This is a surprising finding, as all other reported mutations affecting the synthesis of type I collagen lead to conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, in which quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis give rise to bone fragility and/or connective tissue hyperextensibility.

Herein, we sought to identify the genetic cause of hyperphosphataernia and tibial hyperostosis in a 19 -year-old girl of Colombian origin. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted and sequencing analysis of the GALNT 3 and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23) genes performed. Serum levels of intact and C-terminal FGF 23 were measured using two different ELISA methods. Results: Mutational analysis identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 6 of GALNT 3 (1584 G>A), leading to an amino acid shift from Arg to His at residue 438 (R 438 H). The mutation was not found in over 200 control alleles or in any single nucleotide polymorphism databases. The R 438 residue is highly conserved throughout species and in all known GalNAc-transferase family members. Modelling predicted the substitution deleterious for protein structure. Importantly. the phosphaturic factor FGF 23 was differentially processed. as reflected by low intact (15 pg/ml) but high C-terminal (839 RU/ml) serum FGF 23 levels. Conclusions: We report on the first missense mutation in GALNT 3 giving rise to HHS, since previous GALNT 3 mutations in HHS caused aberrant splicing or premature truncation of the protein. The R 438 H substitution likely abrogates GALNT 3 activity, in turn causing enhanced FGF 23 degradation and subsequent hyperostosis/hyperphosphataemia...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Melorheostosis, an {{uncommon}} mesenchymal dysplasia, rarely affects the axial skeleton. We describe the imaging findings of melorheostosis involving the cervical and upper thoracic spine. Radiographs and CT showed unilateral well-marginated undulating zones of <b>cortical</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> involving multiple vertebrae that were contiguous with a coalescent ossified right paravertebral mass. MR imaging showed zones of signal intensity void on all pulse sequences without contrast enhance-ment. Conservative management was elected {{because of lack}} of interval clinical and imaging changes for 8 years. Melorheostosis (Leri disease) is a rare nonhereditary scle-rosing mesenchymal dysplasia of bone originally de-scribedmore than 80 years ago. 1 This dysplasia occurs in early childhood 2 and in 40 %– 50 % of cases is evident by 20 years of age. 2 - 5 The bony lesions commonly present as wavy longitudi-nal bars of hyperostosis resembling molten wax flowing down one side of a candle 6; hence, the common reference to this abnormality as having a “flowing candle wax ” appearance. 7 - 10 One or multiple adjacent bones are often affected, often in a sclerotomal distribution. 7, 11 - 13 Melorheostosis commonly in-volves limb bones andmay extend across synovial joints. 14 - 16 Le-sions may be associated with ossification in adjacent soft tis-sues. 14 - 16 Melorheostosis limited to the spine is rare. 2, 17 Melorheostosis affecting thoracic vertebrae with involvement of facet joints associated with back pain has been described recent-ly. 14 The current report describes the radiographic, CT, andMR imaging features ofmelorheostosis involvingmultiple lower cer-vical and T 1 vertebrae.
