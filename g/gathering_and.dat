5|$|During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted {{away from}} hunting and <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> used more domesticated plants, {{although}} wild food was still important.

5|$|Tung's main {{military}} programme was {{a scheme}} in which Army of the Republic of Vietnam personnel attempted to infiltrate North Vietnam {{in order to}} engage in intelligence <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> sabotage.

Tung was also reported to be planning an assassination attempt on Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the United States Ambassador to South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} the stops on the Westside MAX, {{displays}} of public artwork {{were included in the}} construction of the stop. Overall the artwork at the station reflects the <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> dispersal of people and the harvest. Christine Bourdette, a sculptor, working with the architects from OTAK designed some of the artwork at Hatfield Station. Described as a “clash of sensibilities” and “organically abstract”, items include sculptures of bronze baskets and granite balls installed at the southern end of the station. Attached to the station's building is a bronze work entitled “Gathering Rail” which resembles twine woven together and is intended to represent the various themes of the community coming together.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage, but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|In 1826 commissioners for {{the social}} and {{economic}} improvement of Oldham were established. The town was made part of a parliamentary borough, in 1832, though it was in 1849 when Oldham was incorporated as a municipal borough, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom, and in 1850 the Borough Council obtained the powers of the improvement commissioners. In 1880, parts of the Hollinwood and Crossbank areas of Chadderton and Ashton-under-Lyne townships were added to the Borough of Oldham. Oldham Above Town and Oldham Below Town were, from 1851 until c. 1881, statistical units used for the <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> organising of civil registration information, and output of census data.|$|E

5|$|In human culture, domesticated mammals {{played a}} major role in the Neolithic revolution, causing farming to replace hunting and <b>gathering,</b> <b>and</b> leading to a major {{restructuring}} of human societies with the first civilizations. They provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as various commodities such as meat, dairy products, wool, and leather. Mammals are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Palaeolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Defaunation of mammals is primarily driven by anthropogenic factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to combat this.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{originally}} inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family {{such as the}} Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett. While cultivation of crops like squash and corn supplemented their diets, these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> fishing {{for most of their}} food. Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses, and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report.

On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E

5|$|The Bubonic Plague {{struck again}} in 1839 {{and the city}} stagnated, as it lacked {{political}} and economic stability. In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza, with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought about more death and destruction, just barely after the city began {{to recover from the}} plague. The Church of Saint Porphyrius was renovated in 1856, and in 1874, French orientalist Charles Clermont-Ganneau visited Gaza, <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail. Sultan Abdul Hamid II had the wells of Gaza restored in 1893.|$|E
5|$|The Mesa Verdeans survived using a {{combination}} of hunting, <b>gathering,</b> <b>and</b> subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first pueblos sometime after 650, {{and by the end of}} the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|The Slavic people cremated their dead, {{typical for}} the {{inhabitants}} of their region for centuries. The burials were usually single, the graves grouped in small cemeteries, with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground indentations. The number of burial sites found is small {{in relation to the}} known settlement density. The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation, hunting, fishing, <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> cattle breeding (swine, sheep and goats bred to a lesser extent).|$|E

5|$|The church {{remained}} incomplete {{for over}} ninety years. By 1957 Anglican services {{were being held}} in St Stephens, a wooden church next to the apparent ruin. Around this time some in the church showed interest in completion of the old structure, {{partly due to the}} approaching centenary of construction beginning. In April of that year a gathering of people from the Parish of Carrick was held in the unfinished building, and a prayer held to bless its completion. The <b>gathering,</b> <b>and</b> associated committee, were led and chaired by W R Barrett, assistant bishop of Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} {{costs of the}} Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource <b>gathering</b> <b>and,</b> despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E
