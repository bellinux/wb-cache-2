500|$|The {{violence}} in the game drew the attention of U.S. Representative Joe Baca, who was the sponsor of a legislation to fine those who sell adult-themed games to players younger than 17. Baca said of Manhunt, [...] "it's telling <b>kids</b> <b>how</b> to kill someone, and it uses vicious, sadistic and cruel methods to kill". The media was also drawn into the debate. For example, The Globe and Mail wrote [...] "Manhunt is a venal disconnect for the genre. There's no challenge, just assembly-line, ritualistic slaughter. It's less a video game and more a weapon of personal destruction. This is about stacking bodies. Perhaps the scariest fact of all: Manhunt is so user-friendly that any sharp 12-year-old could navigate through the entire game in one sitting." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff members}} of Idolator showed high favoritism for the {{acclaimed}} the campaign, further stating {{the fact that}} [...] "when Beyonce tells people to dance, they tend to listen" [...] and so they considered that it was [...] "a pretty genius move" [...] on Michelle Obama’s part to get Beyoncé in on her 'Let's Move!' campaign to fight childhood obesity. On April 9, 2011, an instructional video featuring a group of teenagers dancing to [...] "Move Your Body" [...] was released online. After a few days, Beyoncé has said that she [...] "would record her {{own version of the}} exercise routine" [...] to show <b>kids</b> <b>how</b> it is done by shooting a new music video featuring a series of fun workouts to accompany the track. On April 26, 2011, Beyoncé released a video directed by Melina Matsoukas for [...] "Move Your Body". In the video, students join Beyoncé to perform choreography by Frank Gatson. In the choreography, Beyoncé and the students mix salsa, dancehall, The Running Man, Dougie, stomp. The music video for [...] "Move Your Body" [...] takes place as a four-minute long flash mob. The video begins during lunch hour at what looks like a junior high cafeteria. Everything is normal until Beyoncé, wearing short shorts and green knee-high socks, enters the cafeteria doors to begin the song. After Beyoncé's entry, all the kids jump to their feet, following along as Beyoncé leads the group through all kinds of dances.|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide praised [...] "David Schwimmer for {{throwing}} himself into this role" [...] as Jared, [...] "this rather unlikable lout." [...] Webb Mitovich also wrote that [...] " [...] party {{in and of}} itself has to be one of 30 Rocks finest and most manic moments." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. It was a fine bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get carried away with the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo and the whole thing just felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and tell the <b>kids</b> <b>how</b> outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] was the sort of dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'." [...] The episode of Friends referred to includes Schwimmer's character, Ross, shouting at his boss for eating his special Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.|$|E
