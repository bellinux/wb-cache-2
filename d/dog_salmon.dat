50|$|The wheels {{primarily}} catch {{salmon and}} can be owned {{by more than one}} person. All salmon caught using a fish wheel must be reported to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and wheels must be operated within state fishing guidelines. The type of salmon caught varies with the time of year because not all salmon migrate and spawn at the same time. Summer season includes Chinook, summer chum, pink and sockeye salmon; Fall season includes fall chum and coho salmon. Typically, by the time a salmon reaches the fish wheels in the upper portion of the Yukon River, the fish are more mature and burning off fat to make the journey to the spawning grounds. The sockeye and Chinook salmon captured in fish wheels on the Copper River are considered good quality but are not migrating as far upstream before capture. Most chum salmon caught with fish wheels in the Yukon River are used as food for sled <b>dogs.</b> Yukon River <b>salmon</b> have the highest oil content of any stock because of the long distances they travel to spawn.|$|R

In 1903, the North Alaska Salmon Company built and operated a cannery on the opposite shore from the Alaska Packers Association; it changed its name after several years to that of its new owners, Libby, McNeill & Libby. The cannery plants operated about 6 mi from the mouth, the river being about 2 mi wide at the point of the canneries. Only gillnetting was employed for commercial fishing, with fishing operations occurring from about 3 mi above the canneries to the South Spit, near the mouth.

40|$|In the {{physiological}} study of fertilization in fish eggs, T. Yamamoto (1961) found that Ringer's solution {{is not only}} excellent {{for the preservation of}} ripe unfertilized eggs of medaka, but can be used as an insemination solution. According to him, the medaka eggs are activated by the penetration of spermato-zoa and undergo embryonic development in Ringer's solution. In the <b>dog</b> <b>salmon,</b> the ripe eggs retain their fertilizability for several hours in Ringer's solution {{as in the case of}} medaka but are not activated by insemination in this solution (K. Yamamoto, 1951). It is possible to assume that such a failure of activation is due to the absence of real penetration of the <b>dog</b> <b>salmon</b> egg by a spermatozoon. To examine this possibility, Kusa (1950) carried out an interesting experiment and concluded that the effective spermatozoon had actually penetrated into the egg in Ringer's solution. However he did not observe the behavior of spermatozoa which had penetrated such eggs. Therefore the fate of spermatozoa after penetrat-ing <b>dog</b> <b>salmon</b> eggs in Ringer's solution was traced cytologically in the present study. Materials and Methods The materials used in the present study were derived from matured individuals of the <b>dog</b> <b>salmon,</b> Oncorhynchus keta. Ripe eggs taken from the abdominal cavity of the females were repeatedly washed with Ringer's solution and were artificially inseminated in the same solution.

At the same time, various substances pour forth from the egg into the surrounding medium (Ishihara, 1964; Fodor et aI., 1975). For example, the fish egg discharges the contents of cortical alveoli into the interstice between the ooplasmic surface and the egg membrane. Similarly, various substances seem to be effused from other sites of the egg after fertilization or parthenogenetic activation (Ohtsuka, 1964). Among them, certain substances are diffused through the egg membrane into the surrounding medium. Kanoh (1956) demonstrated the efflux of calcium ions occurring at parthenogenetic activation of the <b>dog</b> <b>salmon</b> egg and suggested that the efflux is {{a manifestation of the}} rise of the free calcium level in the ooplasm. Recent investigations with aequorin revealed that the free calcium level of the ooplasm explosively rises at fertilization of the eggs of the sea urchin (Steinhardt et aI., 1977) and the medaka (Ridgway et aI., 1977).

40|$|Born in Victoria, BC in 1920, Bill Reid {{was brought}} up in a cross {{cultural}} home with a German/Scottish-American father (William) and an Anglican-educated Haida mother (Sophie). In his early life Reid was unaware of his Haida ancestry until his teenage years, though was influenced by the Haida designs on jewelry worn by his maternal aunts. At 23 Reid visited Skidegate, his mother’s home-village, and was introduced to family members familiar with Haida traditions. Reid worked as radio announcer in BC, Western Canada, and then for the CBC. During this time he studied jewelry making in Toronto and went on to work with materials including gold, silver, platinum, copper, ivory and wood. Influenced by the work of Charles Edenshaw, Reid studied works of Haida art through publications and museum collections, and existing works in the Haida Gwaii community (and beyond), developing his own body of work. In addition to his role as artist, Reid was a writer, poet, and story-teller who used his fame to champion Haida land claims. He {{is a member of the}} Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.
