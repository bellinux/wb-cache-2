5|$|On April 1, 1970, Judge George Luzerne Hart, Jr., of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, {{ordered the}} Interior Department to not issue a {{construction}} permit for {{a section of}} the project that crossed one of the claims. Less than two weeks later, Hart heard arguments from conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which had gone into effect {{at the start of the}} year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction permit and halting the project <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E

5|$|While XXXVI Corps was {{struggling}} against the Soviets, III Corps' situation {{was not much}} better, despite reinforcements arriving from the transfers of XXXVI Corps to the south. Group F's new drive on Ukhta was immediately stopped <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> by recent reinforcements of the 88th Rifle Division. The Soviets now launched a heavy counterattack. The Finns, who were still reorganising with the recently arrived German units for a revived push to the east, were forced to retire. To counter the new threat AOK Norwegen now threw in everything it had available to bolster the Finnish front. New assignments included another regiment from XXXVI Corps as well as parts of the 14th Finnish Infantry Regiment pulled from Operation Platinum Fox, the German front in the far north. The new reinforcements helped to stabilise the front.|$|E

5|$|A second {{column of}} 25 T-34 tanks {{approached}} the Task Force within an hour. This second T-34 formation advanced singly or by twos, and threes, close together {{with no apparent}} formal organization. The howitzer battery hit another tank from this column <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks,</b> disabling it, and damaged three more. The North Korean tanks had destroyed the forward howitzer (number six) and wounded one of its crew members, had killed or wounded an estimated twenty infantrymen, and had destroyed all the parked vehicles behind the infantry line. At the main battery position {{one of the five}} remaining 105mm guns had been slightly damaged by a near-hit. Several {{of the men in the}} artillery battery began deserting their positions but Perry managed to convince most of them to return. Although Smith later stated that he believed that the rounds had deteriorated with age, the ineffectiveness of the 2.36-inch bazooka had been demonstrated repeatedly during World War II against German armor. Because of peacetime defense cutbacks the 24th Infantry Division had never received improved U.S. M20 3.5-inch bazookas with M28A2 HEAT antitank ammunition, capable of defeating Soviet tanks. After the last tanks passed their lines, no North Korean forces were spotted for around an hour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{large number}} of Germans poured through the breach in the Roman {{frontline}} and charged the centre of the Roman rear line. This position was held by the elite Primani legion, which stopped the German attack <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> and then counterattacked, routing the breakthrough force. The breach in the front line was presumably filled, either by the separated wings of the front line reconnecting, or by the Primani advancing from the rear line (Ammianus does not specify which). The front line, now extended on the left flank by the rear line left wing, (and presumably by Severus' victorious division), began pushing the Germans back, and gradually hemmed them in from the flanks. At this point, the Germans were already exhausted and demoralised by their lack of progress and severe losses. The mass of their army was now trapped in an ever-tighter Roman crescent, with the troops on the edges being methodically cut down and the ones in the middle packed tightly together and unable to move. Finally, after more relentless pressure from the Romans, the German line collapsed: as panic spread through their ranks, the Germans broke formation and ran for their lives. Many did not run fast enough: pursued {{all the way to the}} Rhine by Roman cavalry and infantry, many were cut down as they ran. Large numbers attempted to swim across the river, but many drowned, hit by Roman missiles or weighed down by their armour.|$|E

Mussolini counted on a quick victory, but the Greek army halted the Italian one <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> and soon advanced into Albania. The Greeks took Korçë and Gjirokastër and threatened to drive the Italians from the port city of Vlorë.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, the IRA {{launched}} a campaign of attacks on Northern security targets along the border (the Border Campaign). The Irish government first detained the IRA's leaders under the Offences Against the State Act and later introduced internment for all IRA activists. This helped to halt the campaign <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks,</b> and the IRA called it off in 1962. In the aftermath of this episode, the southern government under Seán Lemass, himself an IRA veteran of the War of Independence and Civil War, tried to forge closer ties with the authorities in Northern Ireland to promote peaceful co-operation on the island. He and Northern premier Terence O'Neill exchanged visits, {{the first of the}} respective heads of state to do so since the very early days of partition in 1922.|$|E

It took part in Army Group North's capture of the Latvian city of Daugavpils ("Dvinsk", in Russian), sweeping north-eastward to Leningrad where it was finally stopped <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> during the siege effort. During the early months of 1942, the II Army Corps was subject to a Soviet counteroffensive to relieve Leningrad, resulting in five army divisions (the 12th, included) and the SS-Totenkopf division being encircled along with several other elements of the 16th Army in the Demyansk Pocket. With support from Hermann Göring, planes containing supplies were flown in to aid {{the division}}s while they were in the pocket for some 81 days between 8 February and 20 March. Göring would later gloat about his success in freeing the pocket during the Battle of Stalingrad later that year, when a similar airlift concept was applied. While liberated, the 12th Infantry had left the pocket in a much-weakened state.|$|E

25|$|By the First French Republic, {{artillery}} {{was recognized}} as one of the three main combat arms, alongside infantry and cavalry. During the Napoleonic era field artillery became the decisive element on many battlefields. At the crisis of the Battle of Wagram in 1809, Napoleon quickly formed a massed battery of 112 guns to fill a gap in his battle line. This stopped a dangerous Austrian attack <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> and helped to achieve victory. In 1800 French armies deployed about two artillery pieces per 1,000 soldiers. The ratio approached five guns per 1,000 by 1812 as the quality of French foot soldiers declined. Under Napoleon batteries usually included eight pieces and the 12-pounder was often employed in army and corps artillery reserves. A corps reserve battery often consisted of six 12-pounders and two howitzers. Another typical organization was four cannons and two howitzers. Napoleon lovingly called the 12-pounders his belles filles and increased their number. All field pieces had similar muzzle velocities but the 12-pounders had the greatest hitting power. They also made the most frightening sound when discharged. Another attribute was their greater range. Some 8-pounders were replaced in order to increase the proportion of 12-pounders. At the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 Napoleon had 600 artillery pieces or three guns per 1,000, but the victorious Allies used 900 guns on that field.|$|E

After sharing another Albatros two-seater on 20August, Pentland led a raid on Marcke aerodrome, home of Baron von Richthofen's Jasta11, on 26August. On the way, he helped bring down a DFWC.V, then achieved complete surprise at the airfield, which he and his flight proceeded to shoot up. On the return journey, he strafed an enemy train until his guns jammed and then, having managed to clear them, engaged two more German scouts.

500|$|Neill was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him {{in charge of the}} Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks.</b> [...] He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. [...] Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.|$|E

[...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
