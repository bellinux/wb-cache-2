5000|$|Balaenidae [...] is {{a family}} of whales of the parvorder Mysticeti that {{contains}} two living genera. Historically, it {{is known as the}} right whale family, as it was thought to contain only species of right whales. Through most of the 20th Century, however, that became a much-debated (and unresolved) topic amongst the scientific community. Finally, in the early 2000s, science reached a definitive conclusion: the bowhead whale, once commonly known as the <b>Greenland</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> was not in fact a right whale. [...] The family of Balaenids, therefore, comprises the right whales (genus Eubalaena), and in a genus all to its own, the very closely related bowhead whale (genus Balaena).|$|E

Using his advice, the Company sent these six whalers, as well as the Mary Margaret (150 tons), Steven Bennet, master, and the Elizabeth (60 tons), Jonas Poole, master, to Spitsbergen in 1611- the first voyage made to the island to hunt what was called the <b>Greenland</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Whale</b> (Balaena mysticetus).

The author reconstructed these whaling activities, examined how the changing climate affected whaling productivity, and considered the consequences of climate and whaling on the species and on the North Atlantic ecosystem. Annual catch records made it possible to calculate the original size of the whale population; its natural migration pattern in the Greenland Sea could be reconstructed using shipping logs and itineraries. Other written sources revealed that besides human hunting activities, climate change {{played an important role in}} the elimination of the <b>Greenland</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> from the Arctic marine ecosystem.

There are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the <b>Greenland</b> or <b>Right</b> <b>whale,</b> would perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.

60|$|BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).--This whale, {{among the}} English of old vaguely {{known as the}} Trumpa whale and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest {{inhabitant}} of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, {{by far the most}} valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the <b>Greenland</b> or <b>Right</b> <b>Whale.</b> It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.|$|R

In this body of work we quantify the relationship between <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and their prey, ricegrain sized crustaceans called copepods, and employ a spatial model to predict the potential distribution of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> on a weekly basis. Time series datasets of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> abundance and copepod concentration were analyzed to quantify the relationship between <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and their prey.
