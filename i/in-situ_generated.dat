50|$|Earlier {{mechanistic}} {{proposals for}} the EPOC phenomenon with solid electrolytes mainly emphasized tuning {{of the local}} work function of the surface of conductive catalysts by spilled-over species, which are <b>in-situ</b> <b>generated</b> during electrochemical polarization processes. It has been proposed that the spilled-over species can subsequently modulate the chemisorption strength between surface adsorbates (intermediates) and catalyst binding sites, thereby influencing the rate or selectivity of the target reactions significantly. Particularly {{in the case of}} oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte systems, for instance, the migrated anionic O species from the solid electrolyte to the metal-gas interface has been suggested as the origin of the corresponding EPOC effects along with the evidence that the migrated charged species on the surface can be identified via in-situ spectroscopic methods. On the other hand, the hypothesis of modification of the local work function to explain the origin of EPOC was recently criticized with a different view that heterogeneous catalysis needs to be explained by more recent concepts such as d-band center theory, rather than the surface work function, which might play a more trivial role in understanding of surface reactions.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen can be {{considered}} a nonpolluting and inexhaustible energy carrier for the future. However, hydrogen is not readily available for use as a fuel. It exists in bound form with other elements (e. g. water, hydrocarbons) and as such energy is required to abstract molecular hydrogen from various feedstocks. Solar energy due to its abundance and low cost is being considered as the energy source for environmentally safe hydrogen generation. This dissertation focuses on the development and characterization of nano-structured materials for solar thermochemical hydrogen generation, on the principle that concentrated solar radiation can be employed as the high-temperature energy source for driving an endothermic hydrogen generation process. The reaction mechanism and kinetics of different solar thermochemical processes using those nano-structured materials as reactants or catalysts were investigated. The experimental works in this dissertation can be divided into two main areas. The first area is to study the properties and reactivity of <b>in-situ</b> <b>generated</b> Zn nanocrystals (NCs) for solar thermochemical Zn/ZnO water splitting cycle for hydrogen production. The particle size-resolved kinetics of Zn NCs oxidation, evaporation, and hydrolysis were studied using a tandem ion-mobility method in which the first mobility characterization size selects the NCs, whereas the second mobility characterization measures changes in mass resulting from a chemical reaction of the NCs. The second part of the dissertation is concentrated on the investigation of <b>in-situ</b> <b>generated</b> nano-sized metal particles as catalysts in liquid hydrocarbon decomposition process for hydrogen generation.

HYpervalent organoiodine reagents have attracted {{much interest in}} {{the last twenty years}} due to their powerful oxidizing capabilities and low toxicity. Besides the alcohol oxidation, many other oxidative transformations have been established using hypervalent iodine reagents and highly toxic solvents. These newly developed oxidative transformations make use of more environmentally friendly conditions to prepare important pharmaceutical and industrial products from some simple, inexpensive starting materials. The preparation of terminally-oidinated esters uses elemental iodine and hydrogen peroxide as a co-oxidant in an alcoholic solvent. Elemental iodine is a nontoxic, abundant resource that leaves no harmful by-products after the reaction completion, while hydrogen peroxide disproportionates into water and singlet molecular oxygen. Terminally-iodinated esters {{can be used in a}} variety of subsequent reactions such as nucleophilic substitutions and carbonyl additions/substitutions. a,B-Unsatturated ketones and a-trifluoroacetylated ketones are derived from cyclic and ayclic and acyclic ketones and hypervalent iodine reagents <b>generated</b> <b>in-situ</b> from iodobenzene and potassium peroxymonosulfate (OXONE).

The model incorporates all of the features of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) thermosphere-ionosphere- electrodynamics general circulation model (TIE-GCM) but the lower boundary has been extended downward from 97 to 30 km (10 mb) and it includes the physical and chemical processes appropriate for the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. The first simulation used Rayleigh friction to represent gravity wave drag in the middle atmosphere and although it was able to close the mesospheric jets it severely damped the diurnal tide. Reduced Rayleigh friction allowed the tide to penetrate to thermospheric heights but did not close the jets. A gravity wave parameterization developed by Fritts and Lu (1993) allows both features to exist simultaneously with the structure of tides and mean flow dependent upon the strength of the gravity wave source.
