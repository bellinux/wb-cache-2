The cover slip can be glued to the slide so as to seal off the specimen, retarding dehydration and oxidation of the specimen. Microbial and cell cultures can be grown directly on the cover slip before it is placed on the slide, and specimens may be permanently mounted on the slip instead of on the slide.|$|E

30|$|In the {{previous}} studies {{we have used}} a homebuilt multifunction spectrophotometer (MFS) for the measurement of refractive index of liquids. Furthermore, the MFS has been useful for the measurement of the refractive index of isotropic, and also effective refractive index of anisotropic (birefringent) pigments by using the <b>immersion</b> <b>liquid</b> method [22 – 24]. The advantages of the MFS over conventional devices that are used for the refractive index measurement of particles are: (1) refractive indices of both the <b>immersion</b> <b>liquid</b> and the pigment can be estimated using only one device; (2) measurement can be done both in the light transmission or scattering mode; and (3) the probe wavelength can be freely chosen in the UV–visible spectral range.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the refractive index of thermally modified Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) wood by an <b>immersion</b> <b>liquid</b> method. The immersion method has been popular for determination of the refractive index of microscopic minerals, identification of unknown solids [19], and inspection of the heterogeneity of the cell population in microbiology [20]. In addition, immersion method has been utilized in tissue measurements in medicine. Anisotropic minerals have been studied with the immersion method [21]. Wood, which has a much more complicated structure than a mineral, has also anisotropy in its structure. The advantages of the immersion method are that it is independent of the shape and size of a particle, and the measurement is relatively easy and fast to perform [17]. The principle of the immersion method is to match the refractive index of solid particles with that of the <b>immersion</b> <b>liquid.</b> In the event of a perfect match between the index of the light non-absorbing particles and the <b>immersion</b> <b>liquid,</b> the light transmittance will be 100 % and the scattering intensity of light will be zero. However, in the presence of insoluble birefringent (double refraction of light) particles, which form a two-phase system with the <b>immersion</b> <b>liquid,</b> the light transmission measurement method usually fails in situations where the particle density is high and a relatively long optical path is required for the measurement of the transmittance. On the contrary, another type of measurement method that can be used for the detection of the effective refractive index of birefringent particles, namely the light backscattering measurement technique which was exploited in this study, is free from such problems.|$|E

40|$|As an {{emerging}} technique, immersion lithography offers {{the capability of}} reducing critical dimensions by increasing numerical aperture (NA) due to the higher refractive indices of <b>immersion</b> <b>liquids</b> than that of air. Among the candidates for <b>immersion</b> <b>liquids,</b> water {{appears to be an}} excellent choice due to its high transparency at a wavelength of 193 nm, as well as its immediate availability and low processing cost. However, in the process of forming a water fluid layer between the resist and lens surfaces, air bubbles are often created due to the high surface tension of water. The presence of air bubbles in the immersion layer will degrade the image quality because of the inhomogeneity induced light scattering in the optical path. Therefore, it is essential to understand the air bubble induced light scattering effect on image quality. Analysis by geometrical optics indicates that the total reflection of light causes the enhancement of scattering in the region where the scattering angle is less than the critical scattering angle, which is 92 degrees at 193 nm. Based on Mie theory, numerical evaluation of scattering due to air bubbles, polystyrene spheres and PMMA spheres was conducted for TE, TM or unpolarized incident light. Comparison of the scattering patterns shows that the polystyrene spheres and air bubbles resemble each other with respect to scattering properties. Hence polystyrene spheres are used to mimic air bubbles in studies of lithographic imaging of “bubbles ” in immersion water. In direct interference lithography, it is found that polystyrene spheres (2 µm in diameter) 0. 3 mm away from the resist surface would no...|$|R

To investigate the machining characteristics, bisphenol A polycarbonate has been laser machined in air and under a controllable open liquid film. To provide quantitative analysis, ablation threshold, ablation rate and the attenuation coefficient of the immersing DI water fluid were measured. In ambient air the threshold fluence was measured to be 37 mJ. cm- 2. Thin film immersion displayed two trends: threshold fluences of 58. 6 mJcm- 2 and 83. 9 mJcm- 2. The attenuation of DI water was found to be negligible; thus, the change in ablation rate resulted from increased confinement of the vapour plume by the liquid medium, generating higher Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the beam, lowering the laser etch rate. Simultaneously, splashing motivated by the confined ablation plume allowed release of plume pressure before plume etching commenced. This contributed to the loss of total etching efficiency. Two interaction scenarios were obsereved as a result of splashing: (i) intermediate threshold fluence, where splashing occured after every pulse in a mode that interrupted the flow entirely, leaving an ambient air interaction for the following pulse; (ii) high threshold fluence, where splashing occured for every pulse in a mode that allowed the flow to recommence over the image before the next pulse causing every pulse to experience Bremsstrahlung attenuation.
