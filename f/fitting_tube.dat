40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a report of the}} electrophoretic {{velocities}} of cellophane and collodion suspensions in ThC 14 solutions of various concentrations, and of the electroosmotic velocities of the same solutions through cellophane and collodion membranes. EXPER rM'F. NTAL Cdlaphane. [...] For the dectrophoresis determinations a colloidal suspension of cellophane was prepared by soaking cellophane (previously washed free of glycerin and dried) in a mixture of about equal parts of acetone and ether for several days, putting a few cubic centimeters of this mixture into 100 cc. of water and aerating to remove the acetone and ether. On two occasions out of several trials satisfactory suspensions were obtained; they remained stable for several weeks. We regret that we are unable to specify the factors responsible for {{the success or failure of}} this procedure. This suspension was examined in a Northrop-Kunitz cell of predetermined cross-section and the current measured. It varied from 1 × 10 - 6 amp. in water to 5 X 10 - 8 in 4 X 10 - 2 M ThCI 4. The specific resistance of each solution was determined in the usual way and the volts per centimeter across the cell calculated as IR, as suggested by Abramson (1929). Zeta was 14 × micra/sec. calculated in m~ll~volts as, zeta = The results are shown in volts/cm. Fig. 1, where zeta in mill~volts is plotted against the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of ThCI,. The isodectric point is between 3 and 4 × 10 - 6 K. The electroosmotic isoelectric point was then determined on intact cellophane membranes. A side arm was sealed to a tube of 2. 5 cm. bore and 6 cm. length and a capillary of 1 ram. bore fitted to the side arm. A cellophane sheet was tied over one end of the large tube and sealed tight with collodion. The upper end of the tube was fitted with a rubber stopper and sealed with beeswax-rosin cement. This stopper was perforated by a tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>tube</b> forming an agar-KC 1 bridge...|$|E

40|$|For 30 years, the {{dynamics}} of entangled polymers have been explained using the phenomenological “tube” model, where the “tube” represents the confining effects of surrounding chains, but the tube properties, such as its length and diameter, could only be inferred indirectly by <b>fitting</b> the <b>tube</b> model to rheological data.

40|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{pressure}} vessel industry. Current research on <b>tube</b> <b>fittings</b> serves to determine means of decreasing the cost and increasing the efficiency of their manufacture. With this motivation, several new tube forming processes have been proposed in recent years. The current study focuses on the finite element simulation of two new manufacturing processes for tube fittings; i. e. hydroforming and tube push-bending. For tube hydroforming, used to produce T and Y joints, there is a working range defined by the combination of internal pressure and axial load. To ensure that a satisfactory product is obtained, {{it is essential that}} the loading path be inside the working range. The working range for several tube hydroforming models are predicted, and the results are validated with existing theoretical and experimental values. The new tube push bending process has the advantage that tube bends with a small bending radius can be produced. In this study, finite element simulations are carried out to demonstrate this advantage. The spring-back and material waste factors are determined through simulation, as well as the maximum axial load. The results obtained are validated against existing theoretical and experimental values. The study ends with some conclusions about the suitability of finite element simulations in tube forming processes, and with some suggestions for further research...|$|R

40|$|I:~q: Summary. [...] The {{formulae}} {{which give}} the thrust theoretically obtainable {{in a system}} where the ejector exhaust is mixed with the engine cooling air are of considerable mathematical complexity, {{and it is not}} therefore evident under what conditions the greatest benefit can be obtained from such a system. By considering a special case, it is shown that there is an optimum size of the mixing duct in relation to the exhaust-pipe diameter; and also that the effect of mixing the exhaust gas and cooling air streams is only beneficial when the available total pressure head behind the engine is small. 1. Introduction. [...] It is well known that the reaction thrust obtainable from a jet of gas can be considerably increased by the provision of a mixing tube into which a secondary air stream is induced. With the relatively small amount of momentum available in the exhaust gas from a reciprocating engine, the possible gain by <b>fitting</b> secondary <b>tubes</b> to the exhaust pipes would be inconsiderable, and would not pay for the increased aerodynamic drag...|$|R
