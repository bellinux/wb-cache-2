5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye <b>know</b> <b>on</b> earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E

500|$|As {{the poem}} {{comes to a}} close, the narrator once again {{addresses}} the urn as a single object. However, his tone becomes sharper as he seeks answers {{from the work of}} art that it appears unable to answer. In the final couplet, the poet provides a line for the urn, which complicates the narrative and has generated a multitude of critical responses as to the author's intent: [...] "Beauty is truth—truth beauty / that is all ye <b>know</b> <b>on</b> earth and all ye need to know" [...] (lines 49–50).|$|E
500|$|The book found a large audience, {{partly because}} of its {{distribution}} through bookstores rather than the direct market comic shops where comic books were normally sold. [...] Maus was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to <b>know</b> <b>on</b> which shelves to place it. [...] Though Pantheon pushed for the term [...] "graphic novel", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as [...] "graphic novels" [...] {{whether or not they}} had novelistic qualities. [...] He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books. [...] Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with Drawn and Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the Book Industry Study Group in the early 2000s to include [...] "graphic novel" [...] as a category in bookstores.|$|E

Instead of {{deleting}} his account, Stan is forcibly transported by the software into the virtual world of Facebook, where he meets [...] "profiles" [...] of everyone he knows who communicate in Facebook lingo, and is forced to engage in Facebook activities such as Yahtzee. Unexpectedly winning on the first roll, Stan escapes and finds his way to Kyle's Farm Town farm, blaming Kyle for getting him [...] "sucked into Facebook" [...] in the first place. Stan orders Kyle to check out his profile status and Kyle finds out that Stan is supposedly hosting a party elsewhere in Facebook at Café World. Kyle makes it to Stan's party, only to find that Isiah has refused to be his friend because of Kip. Desperate to retain some friends, Kyle finally deletes Kip, leaving him with no friends. Kip, too, is disheartened to find his friend has abandoned him.|$|E
500|$|The first skeleton, {{known as}} the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was {{unearthed}} in 1861 near Langenaltheim, Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the Natural History Museum in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by Richard Owen as Archaeopteryx macrura, allowing for the possibility it {{did not belong to}} the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin described how some authors had maintained [...] "that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we <b>know,</b> <b>on</b> the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archaeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Acton's book {{is divided}} into {{chapters}} with brief, often single word titles such as [...] "Fish". In a marked departure from eighteenth century English cookery books like Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, these are written as connected wholes. The chapter on fish begins with an essay on how to choose fish for freshness; there follows some {{advice on how to}} bake fish, and on the kinds of fat best used for frying fish. Suitable pans are illustrated. The recipes follow; these too are written as stories rather than simply as instructions. Where appropriate, recipes end with a list of ingredients, as well as the cooking time, in marked change from eighteenth century practice. Recipes are grouped, in the case of fish by species, and they form a connected story. Acton adds comments where she sees fit, indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from, and how much she likes it. For example, she begins her account of the John Dory with a recipe which is more of an introductory essay than a set of instructions, though given the simplicity of the recipe, it says all that a cook would need to <b>know</b> <b>on</b> the matter: ...|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Société des Amis des Livres, which he found too {{conservative}} and too {{concerned with the}} reissue of old works, he started two new bibliographic societies, the Société des Bibliophiles Contemporaines (1889–1894) and the Societé des Bibliophiles Indépendants (1896–1901). The first consisted of 160 people, including the writers Jules Claretie and Jean Richepin, the artists Albert Robida and Paul Avril, and the journalist and critic Francisque Sarcey. Uzanne also edited two magazines, Conseiller du bibliophile (literally, Adviser of bibliophile, 1876–1877) and Les miscellanées bibliographiques (The Bibliographical Miscellany, 1878–1880), and then ran three consecutive bibliophilic magazines: Le livre : bibliographie moderne (literally, The Book: Modern Bibliography, 1880–1889), Le livre moderne : revue du monde littéraire et des bibliophiles contemporaines (literally, The Modern Book: Journal of the Literary World and Contemporary Bibliophiles, 1890–1891), and L'Art et l'Idée : revue contemporaine du dilettantisme l'littéraire et de la curiosité (Art and Ideas: Contemporary Journal of the Literary Dilettantism and Curiosity, 1892–1893). In the early 1890s, he {{was considered to be}} [...] "...the best authority that book lovers <b>know</b> <b>on</b> subjects specially interesting to book lovers". Nevertheless, such books as Le Miroir du Monde (The Mirror of the World) or L'ombrelle – le gant – le manchon (The Sunshade, Muff, and Glove) received negative reviews from some newspapers for Avril's illustrations.|$|E
500|$|Like many of Keats's odes, [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] {{discusses}} art and art's audience. He {{relied on}} depictions of natural music in earlier poems, and {{works such as}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual. Keats reverses this when describing an urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] to focus on representational art. He previously used {{the image of an}} urn in [...] "Ode on Indolence", depicting one with three figures representing Love, Ambition and Poesy. Of these three, Love and Poesy are integrated into [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] with an emphasis on how the urn, as a human artistic construct, is capable of relating to the idea of [...] "Truth". The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities: an attempt at courtship, the making of music, and a religious rite. The figures are supposed to be beautiful, and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic. Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator, the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images. The narrator interacts with the urn {{in a manner similar to}} how a critic would respond to the poem, which creates ambiguity in the poem's final lines: [...] "'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye <b>know</b> <b>on</b> earth, and all ye need to know." [...] The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words, to whom they are speaking, and what is meant by the words, which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator.|$|E
