5|$|As {{leader of}} the third largest party, Clegg had {{announced}} that the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party (SNP) signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government {{as part of a}} rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal.|$|E
5|$|Neither Wetherby nor Clements {{enjoyed the}} support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson {{suffered}} a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took him away from the campaign trail for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E
5|$|While {{the bill}} had been {{proposed}} by Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Mel Martinez, {{it also had}} the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have delayed it.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, {{this would}} be the last time that a <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> win the {{presidency}} without carrying Minnesota.|$|R
50|$|As {{was common}} at the time, the Democratic primary had higher turnout {{than the general}} election, {{as it was a}} given the <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> win.|$|R
50|$|After {{the loss}} of Gravel's seat, no Alaska <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> win a congressional race again until Mark Begich's narrow, {{protracted}} triumph in Alaska's 2008 Senate election.|$|R
5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{election}} {{was held on}} June 7, 2005. U.S. Senator Jon Corzine won the Democratic nomination with no serious opposition. Former Mayor Doug Forrester received the Republican nomination with a plurality of 36%. Corzine defeated Forrester in the general election. Despite being a reliable blue Democratic state, {{this was the first}} gubernatorial election since 1977, when a <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> be elected for consecutive terms, with that same year to this day being the most recent one where the same <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> be elected governor twice in a row.|$|R
25|$|The 2002 South Australian state {{election}} {{was the last}} time an Australian <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> be elected to an Australian parliament. Sandra Kanck was re-elected to a second eight-year term from an upper house primary vote of 7.3 percent.|$|R
5000|$|This {{would be}} the last time to date that a <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> win a double-digit margin in the popular vote and over four-fifths of the electoral vote. Republicans have won such margins in two {{elections}} since: 1972 and 1984.|$|R
5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June, the six parties {{came to an}} {{agreement}} on forming a coalition government. The Katainen government will have 19 ministers with the portfolios divided with the NCP and the SDP both having six ministers, while the Left Alliance, the Greens and the SPP would each have two ministers and the Christian <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have one. The NCP, SDP, SPP and the Christian Democrats announced their candidates for minister positions on 18 June, while the Left Alliance—with some of its notable members opposing joining the government—confirmed its participation in the government and its candidates for ministeral portfolios on its party council on 19 June. The Green League announced its ministers on 20 June. On 22 June, the parliament elected Katainen as prime minister {{by a vote of}} 118–72; two Left Alliance MPs voted against Katainen, for which they were formally reprimanded by the Left Alliance parliamentary group. President Tarja Halonen then formally inaugurated the government at the government palace in Helsinki the same afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The fusion effort {{failed and}} Grant was easily reelected. Liberal Republicans {{were unable to}} deliver many votes, and Greeley was only {{successful}} in areas the <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have carried without him. Federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 {{percent of the popular}} vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.|$|E
50|$|New Hampshire was won by Democratic candidate, {{incumbent}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt won {{the state}} over New York governor Thomas E. Dewey by a narrow margin of 4.24 percent. No <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> carry New Hampshire again in a Presidential election until 1964.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> not win {{election}} in the 3rd district until 1986, when David R. Nagle won election to an open seat created by the retirement of T. Cooper Evans. Nagle would become the first Democrat from the district to serve more than one term.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{announcing his}} Senate campaign, Donnelly commented {{that he was}} {{confident}} that a <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to win}} the district, noting that then-Senator Barack Obama would have received 49% of the vote in the district in the 2008 presidential election had it been held under the newly drawn boundaries.|$|R
5|$|With Goebel dead, {{tensions}} {{began to}} ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was more palatable {{to much of}} the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. <b>Democrats</b> <b>would,</b> in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.|$|E
25|$|After the 1922 general election, the Democratic caucus regained {{control of}} the House. The <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> {{maintain}} their {{control of the}} House for the next eighty years.|$|E
25|$|Blagojevich {{disagreed}} with many state Democrats while in office, with House and Senate Republican leaders Frank Watson and Tom Cross often refereeing among the Democrats. During 2008, Blagojevich even expressed fear that House <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> gain more seats {{and he would}} face more opposition.|$|E
50|$|Sanders won the Democratic primary, but {{declined}} the nomination, leaving no Democratic nominee on the ballot. This victory ensured that no <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> {{appear on the}} general election ballot to split the vote with Sanders, an ally of the Democrats, who has been supported by leaders in the Democratic Party.|$|R
50|$|De Gasperi {{served as}} Prime Minister until 1953 and would die a year later. No Christian <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> match his {{longevity}} in office and, {{despite the fact}} that DC's share of vote was always between 38 and 43% from 1953 to 1979, the party was more and more fractious. As a result, Prime Ministers changed more frequently.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 Walker was {{defeated}} in the Democratic primary, losing to Secretary of State Michael Howlett, the candidate supported by Mayor Daley, by a 54% to 46% margin. In the general election, Howlett was overwhelmingly defeated by James R. Thompson. A <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> not preside over the governorship of the state for the next 26 years, when Rod Blagojevich was elected in 2003.|$|R
25|$|Cramer said {{achieving}} a Republican-majority Senate {{could result in}} the removal of controversial Democratic Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He had long opposed the Vietnam War. In response, Chiles noted that if Republicans controlled the Senate, other southern <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> also forfeit committee chairmanships earned and long controlled through their seniority.|$|E
25|$|In the Victorian state {{by-election}} in Albert Park District the Australian Democrats stood candidate Paul Kavanagh, who polled 5.75 {{per cent}} of the primary vote, despite {{a large number of}} candidates, and media attention focusing on the battle between Labor and Greens candidates. Psephologist Psephos remarked that ten years earlier the <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have got at least ten per{{cent of the}} vote.|$|E
25|$|Paul troubled NAWSA leaders {{by arguing}} that because <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> not act to enfranchise women even though they {{controlled}} the presidency and both houses of Congress, the suffrage movement should work for the defeat of all Democrats regardless of an individual candidate's position on suffrage. NAWSA's policy was to follow the opposite approach, supporting any candidate who endorsed suffrage, regardless of political party.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the third}} time New Jersey voted Democratic {{since the end of}} World War II. After this election, despite the very slim margin for this year, the <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> always win New Jersey by more than 10 points, except in 2004, when John Kerry couldn't even win it by at least 10 points (he still managed to carry the Garden State).|$|R
2500|$|While the Louisiana state Republican Party offered guarded support, {{national}} Republicans offered forgiveness. The Nation {{predicted that}} the Republican Party {{would be in a}} [...] "forgiving mood", because if he were to resign, Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco, a <b>Democrat,</b> <b>would</b> likely appoint a Democrat to take Vitter's place until a special election could be held, thus increasing Democratic control over the US Senate.|$|R
50|$|John P. Hale {{was elected}} June 1846 as an Independent <b>Democrat.</b> He <b>would</b> later become a Free Soiler.|$|R
25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the deal, the two filibustered nominees not {{mentioned}} in it (David W. McKeague and Richard Allen Griffin) were confirmed. Despite these agreements, however, some observers noted that the chances were still high that the <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> filibuster any of the ten originally filibustered nominees if he or she were later nominated to the Supreme Court, especially Owen, Pryor or Brown.|$|E
25|$|In December, Nixon met {{privately with}} the {{steelmakers}} and cautioned them that Congress would soon begin {{hearings on the}} steel strike. Neither Republicans nor <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> support the steel companies if the strike triggered an election-year recession, and Nixon urged management to accept {{the terms of the}} Kaiser Steel settlement. Industry executives agreed to a new contract similar to the Kaiser Steel settlement the last week of December.|$|E
25|$|In Rove's analysis, 10 of the 28 House seats Republicans lost were sacrificed {{because of}} various scandals. Another six, he said, were lost because incumbents did not {{recognize}} and react quickly enough to the threat. Rove argued that, without corruption and complacency, The <b>Democrats</b> <b>would</b> have gained around a dozen seats and Republicans could have kept narrow control of the House regardless of Bush's troubles and the war.|$|E
50|$|North Carolina {{strongly}} {{voted for}} the Republican nominee, President Ronald Reagan, over the Democratic nominee, Vice President Walter Mondale in a landslide. The final margin was 61.90% to 37.89%, which {{compared to the other}} southern states, was close to the southern average. This margin was a huge swing from 1980, where Reagan had only narrowly carried the state. No <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> win in North Carolina again until 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Chandler {{represented}} the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky in the United States House of Representatives since {{a special election}} in 2004 until 2013. Although Chandler is a Democrat, the Sixth Congressional District strongly leans Republican, rated by Charlie Cook in his Cook Partisan Voting Index as [...] "R + 7," [...] meaning a generic Republican running against a generic <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> win by 7 points more than he would nationally.|$|R
5000|$|Treen and a Republican [...] "search committee" [...] {{had offered}} to support Bauer for the House seat in 1972 if the <b>Democrat</b> <b>would</b> switch parties, but Bauer {{remained}} Democrat and instead expected to face Treen in the general election. Bauer's father, Ralph Norman Bauer, and Cecil Morgan of Shreveport had in 1929 as freshman state representatives led the impeachment for abuses of power against Governor Huey Pierce Long Jr.|$|R
