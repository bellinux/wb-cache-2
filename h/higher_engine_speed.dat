5000|$|... the European {{version was}} {{equipped}} with the pre-production 75-degree crank pin offset for smoother operation at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since the {{hydraulic}} pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is {{directly proportional to}} the <b>speed</b> of the <b>engine.</b> This means that at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> the steering would naturally operate faster than at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and flow-control valve direct some of the pump's output back to {{the hydraulic}} reservoir at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> A pressure relief valve prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure when the hydraulic cylinder's piston reaches {{the end of its}} stroke.|$|R
50|$|A variable-geometry {{turbocharger}} {{provides an}} improved response at widely-varied engine speeds. With variable-incidence under electronic control, {{it is possible}} to have the turbine reach a good operating speed quickly or at lower engine speed without severely diminishing its utility at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|In November 2009, BMW {{announced}} some {{revisions to}} the R1200RT for the 2010 model year. The new model had the same horsepower, but more torque at , a <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of 8,500 rpm, and double overhead camshafts that were first used on the BMW HP2 Sport.|$|E
50|$|For {{markets with}} {{stringent}} emissions requirements like the United States, Lotus introduced the first fuel-injected Esprits.

50|$|Centrifugal superchargers add {{additional}} boost as {{the speed}} of the motor increases. This means the centrifugal supercharger will provide more horsepower at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and less boost at lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Engines {{modified}} {{for power}} at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> such as auto racing engines, {{tend to have}} very rough idle unless the idle speed is raised significantly.|$|R
50|$|When {{maximum power}} is demanded (<b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and load), intake valve closing timing is retarded to {{synchronize}} the intake air pulsations for larger air volume.|$|R

50|$|When Rolls-Royce Diesels {{introduced}} their C range engine, it {{was adopted}} by locomotive builders for use in Diesel-hydraulic locomotives.

50|$|The first {{electrical}} accessory {{connection was}} supplied by a DC generator. Voltage varied with engine speed {{and because of}} technological limitations, complicated mechanical devices were used to regulate it. Even so, voltage at idle was too low to be useful. A lead-acid battery was used to provide proper voltage when the generator could not, and was recharged at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> or lower electrical load. The automobile self starter was an early engine system to use this.|$|E
5000|$|While small-displacement, short-stroke automomobile {{engines are}} capable of very <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{motorcycle}} <b>engines</b> can have even higher redlines because of their comparatively lower reciprocating mass. For example, the 1986-1996 Honda CBR250RR inline 4-stroke has a redline of about 19,000 rpm. (Though due to regulations in Japanese motorcycle manufacturing this was later lowered to 18,000). While 4-stroke engines of small displacement {{are capable of}} very <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> it is once again the lack of useful torque at lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> due to [...] "efficiency" [...] requirements mandating small displacement engines with supposedly reduced emissions that require high speeds.|$|R
50|$|It {{performs}} {{similarly to}} BMW's Valvetronic system but with desmodromic {{control of the}} output cam, allowing VVEL to operate at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> (RPM). Other similar systems are offered Toyota (Valvematic).|$|R
50|$|Extreme {{oversquare}} {{engines are}} found in Formula One racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be achieved through <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed, enabling <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> of 18,000 RPM while remaining reliable for multiple races.|$|R
50|$|This may {{refer to}} a 2-liter DOHC Sequential Twin Turbo and {{intercooled}} engine (EJ20H/EJ20R/EJ206/EJ208). However, similar to the EJ20T, the term was never used by Subaru. Used from 1994 to 2005 in various iterations listed below. Due to the tight confines of the engine bay, the twin turbo engine was installed in Japanese-spec Legacies only, which were right-hand drive. The Pistons were lighter with a shorter skirt than the WRX EJ20T to allow for <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use is in motor vehicles, where the {{transmission}} adapts {{the output of}} the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels. Such engines need to operate at a relatively high rotational speed, which is inappropriate for starting, stopping, and slower travel. The transmission reduces the <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> to the slower wheel speed, increasing torque in the process. Transmissions are also used on pedal bicycles, fixed machines, and where different rotational speeds and torques are adapted.|$|E
5000|$|Another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), is {{determined}} at 900 rpm engine speed {{instead of the}} 600 rpm for RON. [...] MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on {{the composition of the}} fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON. Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.|$|E
50|$|The N45 was {{enlarged}} to 2.0 litres, to homologate the E90 320si for the World Touring Car Championship. The N45 {{was chosen}} over the N46, because {{its lack of}} variable valve timing allows <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Later {{versions}} featured DOHC with 16 valves {{for increased}} efficiency at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and a smoother power delivery. The hydraulic lifters are interchangeable between all DOHC RB and VG series engines accepting those with solid lifters.|$|R
50|$|At lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the {{position}} of the camshaft is moved so the valves are opened later, as this improves idling quality and smooth power development.As the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> increases, the valves are opened earlier: this enhances torque, reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions.At <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the valves are opened later again, because this allows full power delivery.|$|R
5000|$|Benz sales {{literature}} from 1921 shows {{a return of}} the 10/30 PS with a water-cooled engine {{the same size as}} before, but thermosyphon cooling had now replaced the earlier pump based cooling system. Claimed maximum output remained at [...] but this was now achieved at the <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of 2,000 rpm.The position of the gear lever moved in 1923 from the outside of the car on the right side to what would subsequently become a more conventional position {{in the middle of the}} floor. [...] (The driver of a Benz 10/30 PS sat on the right side of the car, which at this time was still virtually universal in Europe.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The gearbox of the middle-weight Kontio {{model was}} changed when the [...] Leyland O.375 engine was {{replaced}} by the [...] O.400 power unit in 1962. Despite being more powerful, the new engine reached maximum output only at a much <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> with maximum torque now achieved at 1600 rpm rather than 1100 rpm. The very different torque curve of the new engine required a new set of gear ratios, and the Kontio now received a six-speed gearbox in which the lower gears applied higher ratios than in the previously used five-speed box. The ratio of the top (now sixth) gear was approximately the same in both the old five speed and the new six speed transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|From March 1974 Opel {{added the}} a lower {{compression}} 1.0 litre {{version of the}} engine to the range, this featured the same 993 cc capacity as when first seen in the Kadett A, although now the compression ratio was slightly higher (7.9 :1) than in 1962. Maximum power at [...] was also {{the same as in}} 1962, though now at a slightly <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of 5400 rpm. Performance, with a top speed at 127 km/h (79 mph) for the [...] "Limousine" [...] and 122 km/h (76 mph) for the [...] "Caravan" [...] was, by the standards of 1974, distinctly underwhelming with this power unit. Quoted fuel consumption was slightly better than with the 1.2 litre cars, but in terms of overall running costs for the cars there was no corresponding reduction in running costs when choosing the 1.0 engine in preference to the 1.2N. A more powerful [...] "1.0 S" [...] engine was also available in export markets where it suited the tax structure, with [...] at 5600 rpm.|$|E
50|$|A multi-plate wet {{slipper clutch}} {{transfers}} {{power to a}} six-speed, close-ratio transmission ideal for closed-course competition. The back-torque limiter automatically disengages the clutch (partially) under hard downshifting at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to prevent rear wheel hop during corner entry.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Honda {{released}} their Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC) system. Which {{switches to}} a separate cam profile at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to improve peak power. Later versions added VVT as well as 3 stage valve lift.|$|R
50|$|At <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and torques, the tumble flap {{is opened}} {{to achieve a}} better degree of filling. During this {{homogeneous}} mode of combustion, the engine functions like a conventional fuel injection <b>engine,</b> but with <b>higher</b> efficiency due to the higher compression.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pressure}} is actually {{created by the}} resistance to {{the flow of the}} oil around the engine. [...] So, the pressure of the oil may vary during operation, with temperature, engine speed, and wear on the engine. Colder oil temperature can cause higher pressure, as the oil is thicker, while higher engine speeds cause the pump to run faster and push more oil through the engine. Because of variances in temperature and normal <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> upon cold engine start up, it’s normal to see higher oil pressure upon engine start up than at normal operating temperatures, where normal oil pressure usually falls between 30 and 45 psi. [...] Too much oil pressure can create unnecessary work for the engine and even add air into the system. To ensure that the oil pressure does not exceed the rated maximum, once pressure exceeds a preset limit a spring-loaded pressure relief valve dumps excess pressure either to the suction side of the pump, or directly back to the oil pan or tank.|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycling writer Kevin Cameron {{characterized}} Harley-Davidson as [...] "outside {{the mainstream}} of engine development in general, {{to say nothing of}} the racing mainstream," [...] noting that, for example, their first use of overhead valves (OHV) on a production motorcycle was one year after the last time an AMA TT race was won by an OHV engine, overhead camshaft (OHC) becoming the only competitive technology in TT racing thereafter. American brands Harley-Davidson and Indian favored flathead engines because Americans rode far longer distances than Europeans, over much rougher roads, with lower octane fuel, and had greater need for low-RPM torque than the greater power offered at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of OHV engines. Additionally, while the low-priced Ford Model T car dominated the US motor vehicle market ever since World War I and kept motorcycling in a recreational niche market, in Europe, motorcycles were still mainstream, mass-market transportation, with sales and profits that justified ongoing technological investment. That changed after World War II, with lighter, faster and more utilitarian British imports pouring into the US as the UK was desperate for foreign currency to repay war debts, Harley-Davidson and Indian were forced to respond quickly to a newly-competitive and fast-changing market.|$|E
50|$|Sequential turbos {{refer to}} a set-up in which the motor uses one {{turbocharger}} for lower engine speeds, and a second or both turbochargers at higher engine speeds. Typically, larger high-flow turbochargers are not as efficient at low RPM, resulting in lower intake manifold pressures under these conditions. On the other hand, smaller turbos spool up quickly at low RPM but cannot supply enough air at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> During low to mid engine speeds, when available spent exhaust energy is minimal, only one relatively small turbocharger (called the primary turbocharger) is active. During this period, all of the engine's exhaust energy is directed to the primary turbocharger only, providing the small turbo's benefits of a lower boost threshold, minimal turbo lag, and increased power output at low engine speeds. As RPM increases, the secondary turbocharger is partially activated in order to pre-spool prior to its full utilization. Once a preset engine speed or boost pressure is attained, valves controlling compressor and turbine flow through the secondary turbocharger are opened completely. (The primary turbocharger is deactivated {{at this point in}} some applications.) In this way a full twin-turbocharger setup provides the benefits associated with a large turbo, including maximum power output, without the disadvantage of increased turbo lag.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing more air at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the system also creates a swirl in the combustion chamber at lower rpms. The swirl makes for more efficient combustion, and {{is due to the}} asymmetric nature of the airflow with one intake runner closed.|$|R
50|$|The {{crossover}} hybrid {{has four}} different operating modes: Auto (the electronics automatically control the entire system), ZEV (all electric), {{four wheel drive}} mode (4WD) and sport (<b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> than normal mode). A 200v nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery pack {{is located in the}} rear.|$|R
5000|$|... i-VTEC is {{the acronym}} for {{intelligent}} VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control), an evolution of Honda's VTEC engine. The i-VTEC engine works by controlling {{the timing and}} lifting of the camshafts depending on <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The valves open a small amount during low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. The valves will open wider at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve <b>higher</b> performance.|$|R
