40|$|I conduct {{experiments}} to investigate how episodic knowledge obtained from prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> auditor or a manager affects audit committee members' judgment {{in supporting the}} auditor in a disagreement with management. This paper sheds light on the advantage of first-hand accounting-related experience in the important oversight task. It also brings to bear the potential benefit from direct manager <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> claimed by researchers and regulators. I find that the episodic knowledge obtained from prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> auditor, especially the experience of having been a diligent auditor, strengthens the degree of auditor support {{of participants in the}} role of an audit committee member. By contrast, the effect of episodic knowledge from first-hand <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manager on the likelihood of auditor support varies with the manager type. While the episodic knowledge acquired from direct <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggressive manager augments the level of auditor support, such knowledge attained by prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conservative manager has no significant effect.

5|$|Essai remains Cantillon's only {{surviving}} {{contribution to}} economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, {{but was not}} published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, probably in the late 1770s, and considered essential reading for political economy. Despite having much influence on the early development of the physiocrat and classical schools of thought, Essai was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his <b>experiences</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> banker, and especially by the speculative bubble of John Law's Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially William Petty.|$|E
