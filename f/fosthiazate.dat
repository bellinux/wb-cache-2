40|$|<b>Fosthiazate</b> is an organophosphorus {{nematicide}} {{which was}} recently included in Annex I of the Directive 91 / 414 /EEC under the clause {{that it should}} be used with special care in soils vulnerable to leaching. Thus, the leaching of <b>fosthiazate</b> was investigated in columns packed with three different soils which represented situations of high (site 2), intermediate (site 1) and low (site 3) leaching potential. The recommended dose of <b>fosthiazate</b> was applied at the surface of the soil columns and <b>fosthiazate</b> fate and transport was investigated for the next two months. <b>Fosthiazate</b> concentrations in the leachate collected {{from the bottom of the}} columns packed with soil from site 2 exceeded 0. 1 μg l- 1 in most cases. This soil was characterized as acidic, indicating longer <b>fosthiazate</b> persistence, with low organic matter content, indicating weak adsorption, thus representing a situation vulnerable to leaching. In contrast, the lowest concentrations of <b>fosthiazate</b> in the leachate were evident in the columns packed with soil from site 3. This soil was characterized as alkaline, indicating faster degradation, with higher organic matter content, indicating stronger adsorption, thus representing a situation not favoring leaching of <b>fosthiazate.</b> The highest concentration of <b>fosthiazate</b> in the leachate from the columns packed with soil from site 2 was 3. 44 μg l- 1 compared to 1. 17 and 0. 16 μg l- 1, which were the corresponding maximum values measured in columns packed with soil from sites 1 and 3, respectively. The results of the current study further suggest that <b>fosthiazate</b> is mobile in soil and can leach under conducive soil conditions like acidic soils with low organic matter content. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|One grower {{trial and}} two {{experiment}} station {{tests were conducted}} to evaluate a new nematicide, <b>fosthiazate,</b> for management of Meloidogyne javanica in Florida flue-cured tobacco. <b>Fosthiazate</b> was applied broadcast and incorporated at rates ranging from 21 to 84 g/ 100 m² and compared with 1, 3 -dichloropropene at 240 and 460 ml/ 100 m² and fenamiphos at 67 g/ 100 m². All <b>fosthiazate</b> treatments increased tobacco yields and reduced root galling. Application of 1, 3 -D provided the highest tobacco yields and greatest reductions in root galling. The fenamiphos treatment outperformed all <b>fosthiazate</b> treatments in tobacco yield and root gall reduction. <b>Fosthiazate</b> may therefore have limited utility compared with 1, 3 -D and fenamiphos as a nematicide for tobacco in peninsular Florida...|$|E
40|$|The {{nematicide}} <b>fosthiazate</b> {{was evaluated}} over a 3 -year period for management of Meloidogyne incognita race 3 (site 1) and M. arenaria race 2 (site 2) in flue-cured tobacco. <b>Fosthiazate</b> was applied broadcast and incorporated at rates ranging from 22 to 88 g a. i. / 100 m², and {{compared with the}} nematicides fenamiphos (67 g a. i. / 100 m²), 1, 3 -D (56. 1 L/ha, 670 ml/ 100 -m row), and an untreated control. Root-gall indices and leaf yields were averaged over the 3 -year period. Root galling was negatively correlated in a linear relationship with <b>fosthiazate</b> application rate at sites 1 and 2. Leaf yields were positively correlated with <b>fosthiazate</b> application rate at site 1 and could be described by a quadratic equation. Leaf yields were greater at 33 and 88 g a. i. / 100 m² application rates (site 2) than the untreated control. Leaf yields in <b>fosthiazate</b> (88 g a. i. / 100 m²) -treated plots infested with M. incognita or M. arenaria were not different from plots fumigated with 1, 3 -D. Plants in plots with <b>fosthiazate</b> applied in a row band (1993) had a lower root-gall index than those in plots with the same rate of <b>fosthiazate</b> applied broadcast. <b>Fosthiazate</b> may provide an alternative to fumigation for control of M. incognita and M. arenaria...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} and adsorption of the organophosphorus nematicide <b>fosthiazate</b> were investigated in nine soils with various physicochemical and biological characteristics. <b>Fosthiazate</b> was more persistent in acidic soils (pH 7), with t 1 / 2 ranging from 14. 1 to 20. 7 days. Application of antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics to soil samples {{resulted in a}} significant inhibition of <b>fosthiazate</b> degradation only {{in two of the}} three acidic soils. In contrast, soil autoclaving resulted in doubling the t(1 / 2) of <b>fosthiazate</b> in all studied soils, suggesting that both microbial and abiotic processes contribute to <b>fosthiazate</b> degradation. Statistical analysis indicated a significant negative correlation (P < 0. 01) between soil pH and t(1 / 2). <b>Fosthiazate</b> was generally weakly adsorbed with Freundlich adsorption coefficient (K-f) values ranging from 1. 23 to 2. 74 mL/g. <b>Fosthiazate</b> concentration was strongly correlated with soil organic matter content with higher Kf values in soils with higher organic matter content (P < 0. 01). The mean t(1 / 2) and Kf values derived from the laboratory studies were used to parametrize the FOCUS groundwater (GW) models PRZM, PELMO, PEARL, and MACRO for nematicide application in potato and tomato crops. Predicted environmental concentrations produced by the models PEARL and MACRO suggested a potential risk for GW in several scenarios, unlike PELMO and PRZM, which predicted low risk for GW. These findings suggest that the environmental fate of <b>fosthiazate</b> is strongly influenced by soil characteristics and that this nematicide should be used with care in acidic, light soils with low organic matter content...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{limited number}} of {{pesticides}} are available for the control of soil pests in potato. This, together with the monoculture nature of potato cultivation, does not favour chemical rotation, increasing the risk of reduced biological efficacy due to microbial adaptation. The dissipation of three major organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, ethoprophos and <b>fosthiazate)</b> was studied in comparison with fipronil, an insecticide recently introduced in potato cultivation, in 17 soils from potato monoculture areas in Greece to explore the extent of enhanced biodegradation development. RESULTS: The dissipation time of the four pesticides varied in the different soils, with DT 50 values of 1. 7 - 30. 8 days, 2. 7 - 56 days, 7. 0 - 31. 0 days and 24. 5 - 116. 5 days for <b>fosthiazate,</b> chlorpyrifos, ethoprophos and fipronil, respectively. A rapid dissipation of ethoprophos and <b>fosthiazate</b> in two soils with previous exposure to these nematicides provided first evidence {{for the development of}} enhanced biodegradation. Sterilisation of the given soils inhibited the dissipation of <b>fosthiazate.</b> Additionally, <b>fosthiazate</b> dissipation in the soils increased upon repeated applications. CONCLUSION: The development of enhanced biodegradation of <b>fosthiazate</b> in soils from potato monoculture regions was verified. This is the first report of enhanced biodegradation for this chemical. Further studies will focus on the isolation of microorganisms responsible for the dissipation of <b>fosthiazate.</b> © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

The interactive effects of <b>fosthiazate</b> and metalaxyl-M mixtures {{were found to be}} additive for most of the concentration combinations tested. For the binary mixtures of <b>fosthiazate</b> and copper the interactive effect was antagonistic for all concentration combinations tested.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} and validated for the determination of residues of the organophosphorus nematicide <b>fosthiazate</b> in soil and water by using reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection. Good recoveries (> 85 %) of <b>fosthiazate</b> residues were obtained from water samples (drinking water, groundwater, and liquid chromatography water) after passage of 0. 5 - 2 L water through solid-phase extraction (SPE) C- 18 cartridges and subsequent elution with ethyl acetate. Residues in soil were extracted with methanol-water (75 + 25, v/v) on a wrist-action shaker, and the extract was cleaned up on C- 18 SPE cartridges before analysis. The method was validated by analysis {{of a range of}} soils with different physicochemical characteristics; recoveries exceeded 87 % at fortification levels ranging from 0. 02 to 5. 0 mg/kg. The precision values obtained for the method, expressed as repeatability and reproducibility, were satisfactory (< 11 %). <b>Fosthiazate</b> detection limits were 0. 025 mu g/L and 0. 005 mg/kg for water and soil samples, respectively. The decline in the levels of <b>fosthiazate</b> residues in soil was measured after application of <b>fosthiazate</b> to protected tomato cultivation.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} <b>fosthiazate</b> on potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber yields and populations of root lesion {{nematodes}} (primarily Pratylenchus penetrans) were studied during 1991 - 1994 in experimental plots on Prince Edward Island. Tuber yields were greater in treated plots {{when compared to}} untreated plots by 8 % and 30 % during 1991 and 1993, respectively. Numbers of nematodes in roots were reduced by the treatments in every year, and nematode populations in soil were suppressed in 1991, 1993, and 1994. Tuber yields in 1993 and 1994 were higher, and nematode counts in soil and roots in 1991, 1993, and 1994 were lower in plots treated with the emulsifiable concentrate formulations of <b>fosthiazate</b> than in plots treated with the granular formulations. Yields of plots treated with <b>fosthiazate</b> did not differ consistently from yields of plots treated with aldicarb.

40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} three agrochemicals (<b>fosthiazate,</b> metalaxyl-M and imidacloprid) and copper were {{investigated}} {{in this study}} on the crustacean Daphnia magna. Copper was the most toxic tested compound with the lowest EC 50 value, equal to 0. 11 mg/L. Among the three agrochemicals, <b>fosthiazate</b> was the most toxic with an EC 50 value equal to 0. 32 mg/L, about two orders of magnitude lower than the EC 50 of metalaxyl-M and imidachloprid. The interactive effects of binary mixtures of <b>fosthiazate,</b> metalaxyl-M or imidacloprid and copper were also investigated.

40|$|The uptake of 14 C-labeled <b>fosthiazate</b> (0. 75 mg. L– 1 ) by {{tomato plants}} was studied in {{solution}} culture {{both in the}} presence or absence of 2, 4 dinitrophenol (DNP, 1 × 10 – 2 mM), a metabolic inhibitor. <b>Fosthiazate</b> was rapidly taken up by tomato plants and nearly one third of the finally absorbed quantity was taken up in the first half an hour. The translocation of <b>fosthiazate</b> to the shoot part was under metabolic control during the initial stage of uptake. The kinetics of uptake both in the presence and absence of DNP conformed well to the dual phase than a single phase. In the presence of DNP, the uptake capacity (Vmax 1 ) for the initial phase suffered, approximately three fold reduction in comparison to the absence of DNP while Vmax 2 for the latter phase was statistically similar to the value observed in the absence of DNP signifying the metabolic dependence of the initial uptake phase.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{synthetic}} pesticides {{on the soil}} microbial community have been thoroughly investigated in the past mostly by culture-dependent methods and only few recent studies have used culture-independent approaches for this purpose. However, {{it should be noted}} that most of these studies have been conducted in microcosms where the soil microbial community is exposed to unrealistic concentrations of the pesticides, providing an unrealistic exposure scheme for soil microorganism. On the other hand, little is known regarding the potential impact of botanical pesticides on the soil microbial community. Therefore, a laboratory study and a field study were conducted to investigate the effects of synthetic (metham sodium [MS], sodium tetrathiocarbonate [SoTe], and <b>fosthiazate)</b> and botanical pesticides (azadirachtin, quillaja, and pulverized Melia azedarach fruits [PMF]) on the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the results of the laboratory study indicated that the application of PMF resulted in significant changes in the soil microbial community. This was obvious by the proportional increase in the abundance of fatty acids 18 : 1 omega 9 cis, 18 : 1 omega 9 trans, which are common in gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi, and 18 : 2 omega 6, 9, which is a fungal indicator. This response was attributed to the release of copious amounts of organic carbon and nutrients in the soil by the PMF. On the other hand, MS inhibited fungi and gram-negative bacteria, while <b>fosthiazate</b> and the botanical pesticides quillaja and azadirachtin did not impose significant changes in the soil microbial community. Similar results were obtained by the field study where application of the fumigants MS and SoTe significantly altered the structure of the soil microbial community with the former having a more prominent effect. <b>Fosthiazate</b> imposed mild changes in the soil microbial community, whereas quillaja and azadirachtin again did not show a significant effect. Overall, botanical pesticides, at their recommended dose, did not alter the structure of the soil microbial community compared to synthetic nonfumigant and fumigant pesticides which induced significant changes...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{yields of}} spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cvs. AC Barrie, AC Walton, AC Wilmot, Belvedere, Glenlea) in field plots over a 3 -year period were {{increased}} (P < 0. 001) {{by an average}} of 0. 56 (25. 1 %) and 1. 17 (52. 5 %) tonnes/ha in comparison to untreated check plots when aldicarb at 2. 24 kg or <b>fosthiazate</b> at 13. 5 a. i. /ha, respectively, were broadcast and incorporated into the soil to suppress nematodes. The planned F test using orthogonal coefficients indicated that the mean response of grain yields to nematicide treatments of AC Barrie and Glenlea, which are grown primarily in the prairie provinces of Canada, was greater (48. 5 %) than the mean response of Belvedere, AC Walton, and AC Wilmot (33. 7 %), which are more common in the Maritime region of Canada (P < 0. 001). Root lesion nematodes (primarily Pratylenchus penetrans) in wheat roots and in root zone soil at harvest were reduced by the nematicide applications (P < 0. 001). Bacterial-feeding nematodes (primarily Diplogaster lheritieri (Maupas)) in root zone soil were also suppressed by <b>fosthiazate</b> (P < 0. 01) but not by aldicarb.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of factors affecting pesticide transfers to catchment outlet {{is still at}} a very early stage in tropical context, and especially on tropical volcanic context. We performed on-farm pesticide use surveys during 87 weeks and monitored pesticides in water weekly during 67 weeks at the outlet of a small catchment in Martinique. We identified three types of pollution. First, we showed long-term chronic pollution by chlordecone, diuron and metolachlor resulting from horticultural practices applied 5 - 20 years ago (quantification frequency higher than 80 %). Second, we showed peak pollution. High amounts of propiconazole and <b>fosthiazate</b> applied at low frequencies caused river pollution peaks for weeks following a single application. Low amounts of diquat and diazinon applied at low frequencies also caused pollution peaks. The high amounts of glyphosate applied at high frequency resulted into pollution peaks by glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in 6 and 20 % of the weeks. Any intensification of their uses will result in higher pollution levels. Third, relatively low amounts of glufosinate-ammonium, difenoconazol, spinosad and metaldehyde were applied at high frequencies. Unexpectedly, such pesticides remained barely detected (< 1. 5 %) or undetected in water samples. We showed that AMPA, <b>fosthiazate</b> and propiconazole have serious leaching potential. They might result in future chronic pollution of shallow aquifers alimenting surface water. We prove that to avoid the past errors and decrease the risk of long-term pollution of water resources, it is urgent to reduce or stop the use of pesticides with leaching potential by changing agricultural practice...|$|E
40|$|Second-stage juveniles (J 2) and egg {{masses of}} root-knot {{nematodes}} {{as well as}} root debris heavily infected by the latter were exposed for different periods of time to six different doses of the nematicides cadusafos and fenamiphos. The efficacy of the nematicides increased significantly with increasing exposure time. Both nematicides were more effective against J 2, although they could not provide acceptable control of J 2 inside egg masses or heavily galled root debris. The effect of different application strategies on the efficacy and persistence of certain nematicides was also assessed in a field study. Cadusafos, fenamiphos, <b>fosthiazate</b> and oxamyl were applied in field micro-plots either as a single full dose {{at the time of}} crop establishment or as multiple reduced-rate applications at 14 -day intervals throughout the cropping period, and their efficacy and persistence were determined using bioassays and analytical studies. <b>Fosthiazate</b> was the most efficient nematicide studied, and this was mainly attributed to its long soil persistence. Oxamyl also provided adequate nematode control for the first 48 - 56 days after its application, regardless of the application method used and its relatively rapid field dissipation. Fenamiphos and cadusafos failed to provide adequate nematode control, although cadusafos was the most persistent of the nematicides tested. The failure of fenamiphos to provide adequate nematode control was mainly attributed to its rapid degradation by soil micro-organisms, which were stimulated after its repeated low-rate application at 14 -day intervals. In contrast cadusafos failure was attributed to the inability of the nematicide to reduce nematode populations even at relatively high concentrations in soil.

40|$|Three {{commonly}} used test organisms of different trophic levels (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Daphnia magna) {{were exposed to}} selected agrochemicals (<b>fosthiazate,</b> metalaxyl-M, imidacloprid) and copper, in single doses or in binary mixtures. The toxicity of each single compound varied up to two orders of magnitude, depending on the test species examined. V fischeri was the most sensitive test organism regarding <b>fosthiazate</b> and metalaxyl-M, indicating an IC 50 value of 0. 20 mg/L (0. 17 - 0. 25 mg/L) and 0. 88 mg/L (0. 35 - 1. 57 mg/L), respectively. Imidacloprid was the least toxic compound, indicating an EC 50 value on D. magna of 64. 6 mg/L (43. 3 - 122. 5 mg/L) and an IC 50 value on V fischeri of 226 mg/L (159322 mg/L), while for imidacloprid at a concentration of 1000 mg/L the effect on P subcapitata was lower than 50 %. Copper was the most toxic compound towards all test organisms exhibiting the highest toxic effect on P. subcapitata, with an IC 50 value of 0. 05 mg/L (0. 003 - 0. 008 mg/L). The toxic effects of the binary mixtures have been compared to the theoretically expected effect, resulting from a simple mathematical model based on the theory of probabilities. The independent action model was used in order to predict the theoretically expected effect. The interactive effects were mostly antagonistic or additive, while in few cases (interactive effects of metalaxyl-M and copper on V. fischeri) a synergistic mode of action was observed for some concentration combinations. Experiments showed that interactive effects of chemicals may {{vary depending on the}} test species used {{as well as on the}} chemicals and their respective concentrations. Although most of the concentrations of chemicals tested in this study are higher than the ones usually found in natural environment, the evaluation of their interactive toxic effects using a battery of bioassays may comprise a useful tool for the estimation of the environmental hazard of chemicals.

40|$|BACKGROUND Three field {{experiments}} {{evaluated the}} performance of the nematicide fluensulfone against the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida in Shropshire, England. RESULTS Experiments 1 and 2 showed reduced root infection and lowered multiplication of G. pallida following fluensulfone (Nimitz 15 G®) soil treatments at five rates (1. 95, 3. 00, 4. 05 (full rate), 5. 05 and 6. 00 kg AI ha− 1) and Nimitz 480 EC® at the full rate. Experiment 3 demonstrated a positive interaction between the full rate of Nimitz 15 G and the potato variety Santé in the reduction of G. pallida. The fluensulfone treatments at the full rate had more consistent effects than the lower rates, and there were no greater effects for the treatments higher than this full rate. Generally, fluensulfone was less efficacious than oxamyl or <b>fosthiazate,</b> which suggests that the treatment may not be reliably integrated within shorter potato rotations. CONCLUSION The data suggest that fluensulfone soil application could make a useful addition to the few available nematicide treatments for the control of G. pallida rather than be a substitute for these treatments...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{compounds}} to control phytonematodes is significantly increasing, {{as most of the}} old synthetic pesticides have been banned due to their eco-hostile character. Plant secondary metabolites are now evaluated as biologically active molecules against Meloidogyne spp. but their target site in the nematode body is rarely specified. Herein, we report on the ultrastructure modifications of the Meloidogyne incognita J 2 after treatment with nematicidal plant secondary metabolites, that is acetic acid, (E) - 2 -decenal, and 2 -undecanone. The commercial nematicide <b>fosthiazate</b> acting on acetylcholinesterase was used as control. For this reason, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy have been employed.

RESULTS: The most potent acetophenones were 4 -nitroacetophenone and 4 -iodoacetophenone, with EC 50 / 24 h values of 12 [*]±[*] 5 and 15 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mg[*]L- 1 respectively, somewhat weaker than that of the chemical control <b>fosthiazate</b> in our previous experiments (EC 50 / 24 h 0. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 3 [*]mg[*]L- 1). When we converted the acetophenones to chalcones, the nematicidal activity differed, based on their substitution pattern. The condensation of 4 -nitroacetophenone with 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxybenzaldehyde to give the corresponding chalcone (E) - 1 -(4 -nitrophenyl) - 3 -(2, 4, 6 -trihydroxyphenyl) prop- 2 -en- 1 -one led to a slight reduction in activity (EC 50 / 24 h value 25 [*]±[*] 17 [*]mg[*]L- 1). Moreover, (E) - 3 -(2 -hydroxy- 5 -iodophenyl) - 1 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) prop- 2 -en- 1 -one showed better activity (EC 50 / 24 h value 26 [*]±[*] 15 [*]mg[*]L- 1) than 4 -methoxyacetophenone (EC 50 / 24 h value 43 [*]±[*] 10 [*]mg[*]L- 1). CONCLUSIONS: Acetophenones and chalcones may represent good leads in the discovery of new nematicidal compounds and may have potential use in crop management as active ingredients...|$|E
40|$|Corky ringspot disease (CRS) of potato, {{caused by}} tobacco rattle virus that is {{vectored}} by stubby-root nematodes (Paratrichodorus spp.), is often controlled by aldicarb. When use of aldicarb on potato was suspended in 1989, {{an increase in}} crops rejected due to CRS in the Columbia Basin of the U. S. Pacific Northwest occurred. During 1992 - 94, several fumigant and nonfumigant nematicides were tested alone and in combination for control of P. allius and CRS. Aldicarb alone significantly reduced CRS but not to acceptable levels. Metam sodium or ethoprop alone did not control CRS, but metam sodium plus ethoprop provided adequate control under light disease pressure. Two or three postemergence applications of oxamyl, either with or without metham sodium, appeared to control CRS at low pressure. <b>Fosthiazate</b> reduced CRS incidence when used alone but not in combination with metam sodium. At low P. allius population densities, 1, 3 dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) controlled CRS at 94 liters/ha, and rates of 140 liters/ha or greater were adequate at higher population densities. Treatment with 1, 3 -D plus chloropicrin was no better than 1, 3 -D alone and did not always control CRS. Combinations of 1, 3 -D at 94 liters/ha or greater plus metam sodium at 374 liters/ha or greater controlled CRS. Paratrichodorus allius numbers were higher and severity of CRS greater after wheat than after field corn, but P. allius declined rapidly after potato was planted and remained at low levels until harvest...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a single-drop microextraction (SDME) method was {{extended}} for {{the determination of}} multiclass pesticides (metribuzin, vinclozolin, <b>fosthiazate,</b> procymidone, fludioxonil, kresoxim-methyl, fenhexamid, iprodione, bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, indoxacarb and azoxystrobin) in tomatoes and validated in comparison with a robust solvent extraction method in order to estimate the feasibility of SDME in more complicated determinations in terms of extraction efficiency, pesticides chromatographic stability and chromatographic induced matrix effects in pesticide residue analysis in food samples. Both sample preparation methods: (i) a single-drop microextraction method (SDME) developed recently in our laboratory, and (ii) a modified acetone-partition extraction procedure (APE) method that is being applied today for routine analysis {{of fruits and vegetables}} in many laboratories of pesticide residues analysis, were validated under ISO 17025 norms and SANCO Guide recommendations. For all pesticides studied, with the exception of pyrethroids, SDME exhibited good analytical characteristics by reporting from similar to 138 times lower LODs as compared with APE. The enrichment factors of the SDME procedure applied in tomato extracts ranged from 0. 7 for bifenthrin to 812 for fenhexamid whereas, the concentration factors for the whole SDME studied ranged from < 0. 1 for bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin to 52 for fenhexamid. Relative recoveries ranged from 67 to 90 % for SDME and from 90 to 120 % for APE. Matrix effects assessment performed for both methods studied indicated that matrix matched standards should be used for quantitation purposes. However, the estimation of the gas chromatographic matrix effects by SDME indicated that SDME is a more selective sample preparation method than APE...|$|E
40|$|Restricted {{usage of}} {{chemical}} nematicides {{has led to}} development of environmentally safe alternatives. A culture filtrate of Aspergillus niger F 22 was highly active against Meloidogyne incognita with marked mortality of second-stage juveniles (J 2 s) and inhibition of egg hatching. The nematicidal component was identified as oxalic acid by organic acid analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Exposure to 2 mmol/L oxalic acid resulted in 100 % juvenile mortality at 1 day after treatment and suppressed egg hatching by 95. 6 % at 7 days after treatment. Oxalic acid showed similar nematicidal activity against M. hapla, but was not highly toxic to Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. The fungus was incubated on solid medium and dried culture was used for preparation of a wettable powder-type (WP) formulation as an active ingredient. Two WP formulations, F 22 -WP 10 (ai 10 %) and oxalic acid-WP 8 (ai 8 %), were prepared using F 22 solid culture and oxalic acid. In a field naturally infested with M. incognita, application of a mixture of F 22 -WP 10 + oxalic acid-WP 8 at 1, 000 - and 500 -fold dilutions significantly reduced gall formation on the roots of watermelon plants by 58. 8 and 70. 7 %, respectively, compared to the non-treated control. The disease control efficacy {{of the mixture of}} F 22 -WP 10 + oxalic acid-WP 8 was significantly higher than that of a chemical nematicide, Sunchungtan (ai 30 % <b>fosthiazate).</b> These results suggest that A. niger F 22 {{can be used as a}} microbial nematicide for the control of root-knot nematode disease...|$|E
40|$|A proteomic {{analysis}} of wheat defense response {{induced by the}} widely used organophosphorus nematicide <b>fosthiazate</b> is reported. Seed germination and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) experiments were performed using a Chinese wheat cultivar, Zhenmai No. 5. Root and shoot elongation decreased but thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content in embryos increased with increasing pesticide concentration. More than 1000 protein spots were reproducibly detected in each silver-stained gel. Thirty-seven protein spots with at least 2 -fold changes were identified using MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis. Of these, 24 spots were up-regulated and 13 were down-regulated. Proteins identified included some well-known classical stress responsive proteins under abiotic or biotic stresses {{as well as some}} unusual responsive proteins. Ten responsive proteins were reported {{for the first time at}} the proteomic level, including fatty acyl CoA reductase, dihydrodipicolinate synthase, DEAD-box ATPase-RNA-helicase, fimbriata-like protein, waxy B 1, rust resistance kinase Lr 10, putative 12. 1 protein, retinoblastoma-related protein 1, pollen allergen-like protein and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase. The proteins identified were involved in several processes such as metabolism, defense/detoxification, cell structure/cell growth, signal transduction/transcription, photosynthesis and energy. Seven candidate proteins were further analyzed at the mRNA level by RT-PCR to compare transcript and protein accumulation patterns, revealing that not all the genes were correlated well with the protein level. Identification of these responsive proteins may provide new insight into the molecular basis of the fosthiazate-stress response in the early developmental stages of plants and may be useful in stress monitoring or stress-tolerant crop breeding for environmentally friendly agricultural production.

40|$|The term ‘emerging contaminants’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to compounds previously not considered or known to be significant to groundwater (in terms of distribution and/or concentration) which are now being more widely detected. As analytical techniques improve, previously undetected organic micropollutants are being observed in the aqueous environment. Many emerging contaminants remain unregulated, but the number of regulated contaminants will continue to grow slowly over the next several decades. There is a wide variety of sources and pathways for these compounds to enter the environment and these include agriculture and urban areas. Some of these contaminants can have human or ecological health effects and {{there is a need for}} better understanding of their fate in environmental systems. This report provides a short review of the types of organic micropollutants which can be found in the aqueous environment. These include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial additives and by-products, personal care products and fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame/fire retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine metabolites and hormones. Many of the compounds are relatively small polar molecules which are not effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment using activated carbon. Pesticides and some industrial compounds are presently covered by the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Regulations and the Drinking Water Directive. Additional parameters, such as bisphenol A and nonyl-phenol are anticipated to be covered by revisions to the Drinking Water Directive. Others are currently unregulated. In order to assess the hazards presented by such compounds, information on usage, persistence, leachability and a robust sensitive analytical method is required. The UK metaldehyde problem was not originally discovered due to lack of an analytical method and was exacerbated by recalcitrance in water treatment. For many pesticides these requirements are fulfilled and an assessment of risk of leaching to groundwater can be made. However, for pesticide metabolites this information can be sparse and for compounds such as pharmaceuticals it can be lacking. A simple hazard assessment for currently approved pesticides was made from information on UK usage, persistence, sorption to soil carbon and published leaching indices. The following compounds were assessed as having the greatest potential for leaching to water: 2, 4 -D, amidosulfuron, bentazone, clopyralid, dicamba, florasulam, <b>fosthiazate,</b> imazaquin, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, maleic hydrazide, MCPA, MCPP-P, metribuzin, metsulfuronmethyl, quinmerac, oxamyl, and triclopyr with a further 46 also having potential. Of these, 19 had an octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) less than that of metaldehyde and therefore are likely to be incompletely removed by water treatment. A simple assessment for pesticide metabolites, based only on organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) and persistence data, in this study gave results which agreed in principle with other studies. The different approaches indicate that the metabolites of chlorothalonil, cyanazine, diflufenican, flufenacet, iodosulfuron-methyl, metaldehyde, metazachlor and metsulfuron-methyl are likely to pose the greatest risk to drinking water. In many cases these metabolites are derived from parents which have a lesser risk. Other organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, cannot as yet be assessed in the same way due to a lack of persistence data since the majority of persistence studies have been directed at water treatment. A range of organic micropollutants from urban settings have been detected in ground and surface water. Commonly detected compounds include: bisphenol A, carbamazepine, galaxolide, ibuprofen, iopamidol, phthalates, phenyl ethoxylates, and sulfamethoxazole. Case studies show that a small number of contaminants may be used to characterise the contaminant loading and also be used to assess the migration pathways in urban areas. Data interpreted by BGS from the Environment Agency’s monitoring programme for organic pollutants indicates that the 30 most frequently detected compounds comprise both established and emerging compounds and include a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum compounds, triazine herbicides, chlorinated solvents, degradation products and THMs, caffeine, DEET and industrial compounds such as bisphenol A and tributyl phosphate. Specific determinands include a range of currently licensed and phased out pesticides with a few metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, caffeine, nicotine and food additives and alkyl phosphates. These data exhibit hot spots which may indicate possible research areas. Future research should focus on a compound identified in the literature and detected by Environment Agency monitoring. Possible topics could be a study of migration through the unsaturated zone. In many cases the mechanism for migration of emerging contaminants from the surface to groundwater is very unclear...|$|E
