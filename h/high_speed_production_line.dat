40|$|This paper aims at {{designing}} {{an automated}} system {{to monitor the}} production in a pencil industry. The objectives of this work is to {{count the number of}} pencils in each pencil case and compare the results to check if desired number of pencils are present. The packets where the number of pencils are not equal to desired is diverted from production line, rest cases which pass the quantity check is counted and further processed. The whole system is carried on with the help of image processing technique utilizing the LabVIEW platform without disturbing the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>production</b> <b>line.</b> The images of pencil cases are captured using a high frame rate smart camera, then acquired on to the PC through RS 232 port and processed using LabVIEW platform. The proposed technique was subjected to test on a real time system and found operating successfully with 98 % accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Automatic surface {{inspection}} {{has been}} used in the industry to reliably detect all kinds of surface defects and to measure the overall quality of a produced piece. Structured light systems (SLS) are based on the recon-struction of the 3 D information of a selected area by projecting several phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns onto a surface. Due to the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> of <b>production</b> <b>lines,</b> surface inspection systems require extremely fast imaging methods and lots of computational power. The cost of such systems can easily become considerable. The use of standard PCs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for data processing tasks facilitates the construction of cost-effective systems. We present a parallel implementation of the required algorithms written in C with CUDA extensions. In our contribution, we describe the challenges of the design on a GPU, compared with a traditional CPU implementation. We provide a qualitative evaluation of the results and a comparison of the algorithm speed performance on several platforms. The system is able to compute two megapixels height maps with 100 micrometers spatial resolution in less than 200 ms on a mid-budget laptop. Our GPU implementation runs about ten times faster than our previous C code implementation...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and widely used technique for automatic identification is the use of visual codes. Identifiers encoded in various symbols and patterns make electronic reading possible, that greatly helps and speeds up processing, e. g., at cashier lines, warehouse transactions, <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> processing places, <b>production</b> <b>lines.</b> The common codes designed using geometric patterns usually identify types or entities. However, patterns can be produced that, by their nature, are unique and thus can be used to validate originality or authenticity. In this paper, we focus on the automatic localization and recognition of a kind of natural feature identifier (NFI).

40|$|Svenson (2011) {{showed that}} choices {{of one of}} two {{alternative}} productivity increases to save production resources (e. g., man-months) were biased. Judgments of resource savings following a speed increase from a low <b>production</b> <b>speed</b> <b>line</b> were underestimated and following an increase of a <b>high</b> <b>production</b> <b>speed</b> <b>line</b> overestimated. The objective formula for computing savings includes differences between inverse speeds and this is intuitively very problematic for most people. The {{purpose of the present}} studies was to explore ways of ameliorating or eliminating the bias. Study 1 was a control study asking participants to increase the <b>production</b> <b>speed</b> of one <b>production</b> <b>line</b> to save the same amount of production resources (man-months) as was saved by a speed increase in a reference line. The increases judged to match the reference alternatives showed the same bias as in the earlier research on choices. In Study 2 the same task and problems were used as in Study 1, but the participants were asked first to judge the resource saving of the reference alternative in a pair of alternatives before they proceeded to the matching task. This weakened the average bias only slightly. In Study 3, {{the participants were asked to}} judge the resources saved from each of two successive increases of the same single <b>production</b> <b>line</b> (other than those of the matching task) before they continued to the matching problems. In this way a participant could realize that a second <b>production</b> <b>speed</b> increase from a <b>higher</b> <b>speed</b> (e. g., from 40 to 60 items /man-month) gives less resource savings than the same speed increase from a first lower speed (e. g., from 20 to 40 items/man-month. Following this, the judgments of the same problems as in the other studies improved and the bias decreased significantly but it did not disappear. To be able to make optimal decisions about productivity increases, people need information about the bias and/or reformulations of the problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} new pulsed laser {{oscillator}} and {{system for the}} optical detection of ultrasound in materials. A single-frequency laser oscillator based on a pulse pumped Nd:YAG rod inside a ring cavity is proposed. The laser delivers single-frequency pulses of 35 W power. Power of about 1 kW can be obtained when the second rod of a dual-rod pumping chamber is used as an amplifier. Performance {{of the system is}} then investigated with a GaAs photorefractive crystal-based two-wave mixing phase demodulator. In particular, the intensity noise of the laser can be made low enough to allow the detection limit to be set by the shot-noise of the laser. The coherence length of the laser is about 20 m, which makes it a versatile laser-ultrasonic inspection system operated with a two-wave mixing based phase demodulator. A complete compact and affordable system is obtained when the second rod of the pumping chamber is used as a generation laser of ultrasound. Tests of this laser-ultrasonic system on metallic samples are presented. In that case the second rod of the pumping chamber is used as an ultrasound generation laser. Introduction: Laser generation and detection of ultrasound presents numerous advantages for material inspection and characterization over classical piezoelectric-based techniques [1]. In particular, lasers allow probing parts with complex shape in severe conditions, such as high temperature or parts moving at <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> on a <b>production</b> <b>line</b> [2].

5000|$|The {{distance}} {{the axis of}} the crank throws from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston stroke measurement, and thus engine displacement. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine {{is to increase the}} stroke, sometimes known as [...] "shaft-stroking." [...] This also increases the reciprocating vibration, however, limiting the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> capability of the engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation of the engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing of the intake charge. Most modern <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>production</b> engines are classified as [...] "over square" [...] or short-stroke, wherein the stroke is less than the diameter of the cylinder bore. As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length leads to better results.|$|R
