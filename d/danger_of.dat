40|$|This essay {{reflects}} {{on the use of}} computers in games and gambling, starting with the curious effect of using computers to deal playing cards for contract bridge players. The predictability of computers rules out true randomness, unless special devices are used to pick data out of noise, so algorithms to generate pseudorandom sequences are most often used, particularly linear congruential generators. The <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> this are discussed, both the technical <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> careless use of pseudorandom sequences, and the social <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> using software to encourage and addict gambling, especially online...|$|R

Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
