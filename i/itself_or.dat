The Blu-ray maintains the same features as the DVD; however, the featurettes were dropped and replaced with a subtitle pop-up trivia track that can be watched by <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> along with the audio commentary.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host <b>itself,</b> <b>or</b> another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by <b>itself,</b> <b>or</b> with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{unmanned}} missions {{have been}} designed to explore the Earth and the solar system. Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA.

5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, fly, {{and land}} {{efficiently}} and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, {{they may be}} pulled off and consumed by the cricket <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E
5|$|Swords are {{included}} in the crafts category, and either the sword <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> a sword mounting is designated as a National Treasure. Currently 110 swords and 12 sword mountings are National Treasures. The oldest designated properties date to the seventh century (Asuka period). However, 86 of the items are from the Kamakura period, with the most recent object from the Muromachi period. The designated items are located in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, museums, and private collections.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E

5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe <b>itself,</b> <b>or</b> there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|ZnO {{has also}} been {{considered}} for spintronics applications: if doped with 1â€“10% of magnetic ions (Mn, Fe, Co, V, etc.), ZnO could become ferromagnetic, even at room temperature. Such room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO:Mn has been observed, {{but it is not}} clear yet whether it originates from the matrix <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> from secondary oxide phases.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|Boitani {{discusses}} the modern {{use of the}} character of Troilus in a chapter entitled Eros and Thanatos. Love and death, the latter either as a tragedy in <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> as an epic symbol of Troy's own destruction, therefore, are the two core elements of the Troilus myth for the editor of the first book-length survey of it from ancient to modern times. He sees the character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in the manner of Ulysses and also blocked from the possibility of development as an archetypal figure of troubled youth by Hamlet. Troilus' appeal for the 20th and 21st century is his very humanity.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} liver diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV <b>itself</b> <b>or</b> other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E
