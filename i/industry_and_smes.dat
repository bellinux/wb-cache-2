40|$|Standardisation is a {{powerful}} tool to achieve better interoperability. However, it needs to overcome {{a lack of interest}} and modest participation from stakeholders. Also, promising research results are not always used as the basis for new standards. The overall goal of ResiStand is {{to find new ways to}} improve the crisis management and disaster resilience capabilities of the European Union and individual Member States through standardisation. ResiStand contributes to an improved disaster resilience by identifying and analysing the drivers, constraints and expectations of three main stakeholder communities: Standardisation Organisations, End-Users and Suppliers, consisting of researchers, <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs.</b> Based on this information, gaps in standardisation are identified and a prioritised roadmap for new initiatives will be created. The roadmap will be complemented by a critical evaluation of standards as a tool to improve disaster resilience. ResiStand aims at implementing a pre-standardisation process that supports the development of standards. The feasibility of the process will be tested by developing a new work item. The aim is that stakeholders will continuously utilize this “ResiStand Process” in the future, and that the project delivers a better understanding of the potential of standards for contributing to an improved disaster resilience. ResiStand will support the management of increasing threats to society such as armed conflicts, terrorism, pandemics and natural disasters, which have increasingly cross-border, even global consequences due to the on-going globalisation. Protection of citizens through anticipation, preparedness, response and adaptation to crisis situations – i. e. maintaining disaster resilience – will be more efficient. Collaboration between national, European and international stakeholders will be improved by unified processes and management systems as well as by technical, procedural, operational and semantic interoperability...|$|E

This research applies insights from the intraorganizational teamfield into the interorganizational team setting {{in order to determine the}} team related factorspertaining to effective collaboration in medical device innovation projects. Interorganizational collaboration has been a persistent feature within the interorganizationalrelations literature, due to the added benefits that can come with working collaborativelytowards a common goal (Berg-Weger & Schnieder, 1998). While much research has exploredthe structures and performance outcomes of engaging in this cross-boundary working, theliterature is sparse with respect to interpersonal relationships, practices and processes leadingto effective collaboration (Bergenholtz & Waldstrom, 2011; Majchrzak, Jarvenpaa & Bargherz, 2015). An interpretivist perspective has informed an exploratory mixed methods approach to datacollection, with contextual insights informing each phase of data collection. Three exploratoryphases of data collection have provided (1) qualitative ethnography data, (1 i) qualitativeinterview data and (2) quantitative survey data. The NHS has recently set out agendas to increase innovative procurement (Department ofHealth, 2008), work more closely with <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs</b> (Innovation and Procurement Plan:Department of Health, 2009) and to increase innovative practice (IHW: NHS, 2011). SMEsdeveloping novel medical devices require input from the NHS to ensure that their devices areclinically applicable and therefore will be adopted by the NHS.

40|$|Question: What {{different}} factors {{affect the}} SMEs {{to choose a}} specific bank? Purpose: The purpose with this research {{is to find out}} how SMEs perceive the value and brand of the bank they are using for the financial services of their business. We will strive to find out how they perceive their banks and what underlying factors that affected their choice of bank the most. Method:We have used a quantitative method and a deductive approach for this thesis. Hypotheses were created with theory as a base and tested on a sample population containing micro companies in the community of Halmstad, Sweden. The data were compared with mean, standard deviation and variance using SPSS. Cronbach’s alpha and Pearson’s correlation were used to improve reliability and test the correlation between statements used in the study. Theoretical framework: The theory is based on Aaker (1991) and Keller (1993) and their research and theories about branding, surrounded by findings done by other researchers within the subject. The factors circling the brand phenomenon are explained; awareness, association, attitude, loyalty and activity. The bank <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs</b> will be introduced to the reader, why branding becomes so important when dealing with services and the bank sector. Empirical framework: The empirical findings contain the data collected from the survey handed out to the sample population. The findings are explained in tables and diagrams and are further used to compare with previous research {{and come up with a}} conclusion. Conclusion: The most significant finding in the study is the importance of a personal contact at the bank, the micro company’s personal relation with one or more employees on the bank. Banks are not at all seen as unique in their supply of services, so the personal connection is an important factor which leads to loyalty. The respondents are satisfied with the performance of their banks, the supply of services covers their need. The micro companies do want the best possible solution to their specific situation, however, they do not seek for that optimal solution actively...|$|E

Based on experience gathered in the OncoTrack and eTRIKS consortia, both supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), we shall present an overview of project requirements and share experience {{in the process of}} providing the necessary legal framework. OncoTrack is an international consortium of 22 partners including academia, pharma <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs.</b> The consortium is collecting extensive data from colon cancer to aid in biomarker discovery and is using the data to refine in silico methods for prediction of tumour response to therapy. eTRIKS is developing a European translational research framework to support management and analysis of electronic data generated by IMI and other biomedical research initiatives. The consortium is engaged {{in the development of a}} platform whose core is the tranSMART open-source software. This is combined with a portfolio of services for data staging, exploration and analysis appropriate for translational research. Data warehousing, {{data processing}} and archiving data for re-use and sustainability are processes linked to distinct phases in the lifetime of a project. In the OncoTrack consortium, warehousing and a considerable part of data processing are managed by the partners under the terms of the consortial Project Agreement and the Grant Agreement with the IMI. In order to make full use of the services of eTRIKS, however, a legal agreement was needed. Large collaborative projects are usually not legal entities - contracts must be concluded among all Partners involved. The solution found for the OncoTrack-eTRIKS collaboration was a Data Processing Agreement, allowing us to reduce the number of signatories, while ensuring a framework for technical support and guarantees of data security and privacy required by EU legislation. Archiving of data after completion of a project is essential to ensure sustainability of scientific progress and controlled re-use of the data. The process now underway for OncoTrack, including discussion of the technical and legal hurdles inherent in the undertaking, which envisages a solution using facilities available at the European Genome-Phenome Archive, eTRIKS and ELIXIR, will be described...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{of small and}} medium enterprises (SMEs) in promoting economic growth in both developed and developing countries is widely accepted and documented by both scholars and policy makers. Particularly lacking are studies on the {{evidence in support of}} the importance of credit rationing to the sustainability of SMEs in an emerging economy like South Africa’s. This specific problem, especially in the developing countries, has been identified as the major bottleneck in realising socio-economic potentials of SMEs in those countries. However, one of the major ways of addressing the challenge of inadequate funding that exists within the SME sector is the use of bank credit. This study was therefore undertaken to explore the role of commercial banks in the provision of credit to the SMEs in South Africa. This study focuses {{on the issue of the}} relationship between the banking <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs.</b> In particular, the problem of credit rationing of, and discrimination against SMEs by commercial banks was investigated. Because credit rationing and finance gaps can stem from imperfections on either supply-side (banks), or demand-side (SMEs), or both, the intention of the study was to examine both of these variables in order to uncover the implications of their relationships. The empirical analysis is based on survey data collected by means of a structured questionnaire which was distributed amongst banks and SME borrowers in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Contrary to the general view that commercial banks are disinclined to provide credit to SMEs, the study found that South African banks are keen to serve the SMEs and are therefore making efforts to penetrate this potentially profitable market segment. However, several obstacles are potentially restricting the involvement of banks with SMEs in South Africa. The findings revealed that regulations such as the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) and the National Credit Act (NCA) came out strongly as major hindrances of bank financing to SMEs. Furthermore, it was shown that compliance with the NCA was ranked higher than credit history and profitability as a factor hindering the approval of SME loans. - iii - However, by using the structural equation modelling (SEM), the results also show that there is a positive and significant influence of lending technology and collateral on the supply of credit to SMEs. Variables such as creditworthiness, collateral and e-banking were found to have a positive and significant impact on the provision of credit to SMEs by commercial banks. For both the supply- and demand-side analysis, technology came out as the most important predictor of SME access to finance. This means that banks should strive to align their lending techniques with the dynamic technological developments so as to reach as many SMEs as possible even in the geographically dispersed regions. It is anticipated that improving SME access to bank credit could be the key to the growth and sustainability of SMEs, the alleviation of poverty and unemployment; and consequently leading to the growth of the South African economy.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, there has been {{increasing}} concern towards the potential effects of industrial pollutants on our eco-system. Each country has developed and enacted stringent environmental regulatory standards to address this concern. Several studies conducted in the general area of regulatory impact show significant direct impact of these regulations on organizations. Pharmaceutical industry in particular, due to the generation of variety of hazardous waste during operations, is one among the highly regulated industrial sector globally. The financial liabilities and resource shortages associated while incorporating abatement technologies and related procedural changes make Pharmaceutical Small and Medium Enterprises (PSMEs) highly vulnerable to these regulatory compliance standards. This study aims to investigate two aspects of environment regulation compliance in the PSMEs, namely To identify the nature and magnitude of vulnerabilities encountered by the PSMEs in India while complying with environmental regulations, and To explore and to analyze the adaptation mechanisms followed by the PSMEs in India, while complying with environmental regulations. Literature explorations {{in the area of}} environmental regulation, enforcement, compliance, pharmaceutical <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs,</b> gave limited studies with focus on India. Hence a questionnaire based survey was administered online and face to face. The sampling design followed was stratified random and the total sample size taken for the final analysis was 71. The survey targeted the senior executive officers of pharmaceutical firms across India. Unstructured discussions and interactions with experts in the field were also carried out to understand the gravity of each concern. Data was analyzed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for exploring and prioritizing vulnerability concerns, factor analysis for identifying the general adaptation mechanisms and systems practiced, and cluster analysis for assessing the underlying relationship among vulnerability concerns and adaptation patterns of firms under study. Findings of the analysis highlighted several significant drivers of the interaction between the PSMEs and the environment regulations. Some of them are as follows: One, conforming to literature finding, our study also found manufacturing related problems as the most significant concern for the PSMEs. However, unlike the Western countries, it was the poor quality of raw material available in the market that causes the main concern, and not the need for intensive capital investment in abatement technologies. Investigations revealed the steady global market decline for this sub-sector and the need for new innovations to meet the changing global trends. Two, marketing was a significantly higher concern for the PSMEs than regulator and regulatory management. Marketing has special relevance in the pharmaceutical industry as it deals with health and life saving issues for the people, and this got highlighted in our results. Three, the study found external management factors as the most followed coping / adaptation mechanism pursued by the PSMEs. Conforming to literature findings, our study also demonstrated smaller firms as significantly more vulnerable to adaptation in comparison with medium scale firms. The study also highlighted the attempt at balancing the local and global by the Indian PSMEs. While the process orientation was towards meeting international standards, the management of resources, marketing and regulatory requirements had a focus on the local pressures. The study provides some insight into the vulnerabilities and adaptation efforts of the Indian PSMEs and brings out the relevant strategic interventions needed from government, regulatory organizations and industry associations to develop a more sustainable business environment for the Indian PSMEs...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at {{presenting}} the first-year activities and results of COST (European COoperation in Science and Technology) Action TU 1208 “Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”. This Action {{was launched in}} April 2013 and will last four years. The principal aim of COST Action TU 1208 is to exchange and increase scientific-technical knowledge and experience of GPR techniques in civil engineering, whilst simultaneously promoting throughout Europe the effective use of this safe and non-destructive technique in the monitoring of infrastructures and structures. Moreover, the Action is oriented to the following specific objectives and expected deliverables: (i) coordinating European scientists to highlight problems, merits and limits of current GPR systems; (ii) developing innovative protocols and guidelines, which {{will be published in}} a handbook and constitute a basis for European standards, for an effective GPR application in civil- engineering tasks; safety, economic and financial criteria will be integrated within the protocols; (iii) integrating competences for the improvement and merging of electromagnetic scattering techniques and of data- processing techniques; this will lead to a novel freeware tool for the localization of buried objects, shape-reconstruction and estimation of geophysical parameters useful for civil engineering needs; (iv) networking for the design, realization and optimization of innovative GPR equipment; (v) comparing GPR with different NDT techniques, such as ultrasonic, radiographic, liquid-penetrant, magnetic-particle, acoustic-emission and eddy-current testing; (vi) comparing GPR technology and methodology used in civil engineering with those used in other fields; (vii) promotion of a more widespread, advanced and efficient use of GPR in civil engineering; and (viii) organization of a high-level modular training program for GPR European users. Four Working Groups (WGs) carry out the research activities. The first WG focuses on the design of innovative GPR equipment, on the building of prototypes and on the testing and optimisation of new systems. The second WG focuses on the GPR surveying of pavement, bridges, tunnels and buildings, {{as well as on the}} sensing of underground utilities and voids. The third WG deals with the development of electromagnetic forward and inverse scattering methods, for the characterization of GPR scenarios, as well as with data- processing algorithms for the elaboration of the data collected during GPR surveys. The fourth WG works on the use of GPR in fields different from the civil engineering, as well as on the integration of GPR with other non-destructive testing techniques. Each WG includes several Projects. COST Action TU 1208 is active through a range of networking tools: meetings, workshops, conferences, training schools, short-term scientific missions, dissemination activities. During the first year of activities, a First General Meeting was organized in Rome, in July 2013, a second meeting took place in Nantes, in February 2014, and the Second General Meeting is being held jointly with the 2014 EGU General Assembly. A training school on "Microwave Imaging and Diagnostics: Theory, Techniques, and Applications", held in March 2014, was co-organised with the European School of Antennas. Four Short-Term Scientific Missions were funded, allowing young researchers to spend a period of time in an institution abroad, in order to carry out a research project contributing to the scientific objectives of the Action. The Action’s activities were disseminated in international conferences [1]-[4], as well as in further workshops and meetings. Two volumes were published [5]-[6], and several scientific papers on peer-reviewed journals. A Springer book {{presenting the}} state of the art on civil engineering applications of Ground Penetrating Radar is being prepared and is going to be published in summer 2014. A COST Action is a wide bottom-up interdisciplinary science and technology network, open to researchers from universities, public and private research institutions, as well as to NGOs, <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs.</b> At present, About 100 Institutions from 24 COST Member Countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Macedonia, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom) have already joined the Action, together with an Institution from Armenia (Near Neighbour Country, NNC). Beyond European borders, six Institutions from U. S. A., one from Rwanda and one from Australia have joined the Action. Further applications from two NNCs (Egypt and Ukraine) and International Partner Countries (Hong Kong and Japan) are under examination. COST Action TU 1208 is still open to the participation of new parties and it is possible to include, in the scientific work plan, new perspectives and activities.

40|$|Purpose: Enhancing {{measurement}} of innovation related expenditure in non manufacturing industries. Originality: Expanding an econometric model to measure technological innovation {{on a business}} level. Key literature / theoretical perspective: This paper calls attention to the ways innovation has traditionally been measured in various <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> different business sizes. To date, technological innovation measurements generally apply to the manufacturing industry and/or businesses with a strong Research and Development (R&D) component, which are typically large businesses. Design/methodology/approach: In order to measure innovation in other <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> in order to extend the innovation measurement in Small <b>and</b> Medium Enterprises (<b>SME),</b> we propose an enhanced version of the used Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (CDM) structural economic model. We used the Australian Businesses Innovation Survey (IABS) 2003, which comprises a weighted sample of more than 4500 businesses. Findings: Innovation Related Expenditure makes a positive and significant contribution to technological innovation. We argue that our {{modified version of the}} CDM model provides a more accurate picture of innovation efforts in non-manufacturing <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>SMEs</b> that do not have a strong R&D focus. Practical and Social implications: Our findings may enable policy makers to better allocate funding and resources to enhance productivity in <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> businesses not traditionally associated with innovation. 2 page(s...|$|R
