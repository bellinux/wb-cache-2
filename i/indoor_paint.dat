40|$|International audienceGaseous {{nitrogen}} dioxide (NO 2) represents an oxidant that {{is present in}} relatively high concentrations in various indoor settings. Remarkably increased NO 2 levels up to 1. 5 ppm are associated with homes using gas stoves. The heterogeneous reactions of NO 2 with adsorbed water on surfaces lead to the generation of nitrous acid (HONO). Here, we present a HONO source induced by heterogeneous reactions of NO 2 with selected <b>indoor</b> <b>paint</b> surfaces {{in the presence of}} light (300 nm < lambda < 400 nm). We demonstrate that the formation of HONO is much more pronounced at elevated relative humidity. In the presence of light (5. 5 W m(- 2)), an increase of HONO production rate of up to 8. 6. 10 (9) molecules cm(- 2) s(- 1) was observed at [NO 2] = 60 ppb and 50 % relative humidity (RH). At higher light intensity of 10. 6 (W m(- 2)), the HONO production rate increased to 2. 1. 10 (10) molecules cm(- 2) s(- 1). A high NO 2 to HONO conversion yield of up to 84 % was observed.

40|$|People {{spend most}} of their time indoors and mostly in the dwelling. It is {{therefore}} important to investigate associations between indoor exposure in dwellings and health. Symptoms that may be related to the indoor environment are sometimes referred to as the "sick building syndrome" (SBS). SBS involves symptoms such as eye, skin and upper airway irritation, headache and fatigue. Three longitudinal studies and one prevalence study on personal and environmental risk factors for SBS in adults were performed. The prevalence study included measurements of indoor exposures in the dwellings. The longitudinal studies, with 8 - 10 years follow-up time, showed that smoking and <b>indoor</b> <b>paint</b> emissions were risk factors for SBS. Moreover, building dampness and moulds in dwellings were risk factors for onset (incidence) of general symptoms, skin symptoms and mucosal symptoms. In addition subjects living in damp dwellings have a lower remission of general symptoms and skin symptoms. Hay fever was a risk factor for onset of skin symptoms and mucosal symptoms, and asthma was a risk factor for onset of general and mucosal symptoms. Biomarkers of allergy and inflammation (bronchial reactivity, total IgE, ECP and eosinophil count) were predictors of onset of SBS symptoms, in particular mucosal symptoms. In the prevalence study, any SBS-symptom was associated with some individual volatile organic compounds of possible microbial origin (MVOC) e. g. 2 -pentanol, 2 -hexanon, 2 -pentylfuran and 1 -octen- 3 ol. Moreover, there were associations between indoor levels of formaldehyde and the plasticizer Texanol and any SBS. The result from the study indicates that individual MVOC are better indicators of SBS than the total value of MVOC. A final conclusion is that smoking, dampness and moulds and emissions from indoor painting may increase the onset of SBS. The indoor environment in dwellings over time has improved, but there is still a need for further improvements of the indoor environment in dwellings. More longitudinal SBS studies are needed...|$|E

Abstract  We examined the associations between biomarkers of allergy and inflammation, indoor environment in dwellings, and incidence and remission of symptoms included in the sick building syndrome (SBS) {{and changes in the}} home environment of 452 adults who were followed from 1992 to 2002 within the Uppsala part of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). The 10 -year incidence (onset) of general, mucosal, and dermal symptoms was 8. 5 %, 12. 7 %, and 6. 8 %, respectively. Dampness or indoor molds at baseline was a predictor of incidence of general (relative risk [RR] =  1. 98), mucosal (RR =  2. 28), and dermal symptoms (RR =  1. 91). Women had higher incidence of general (RR =  1. 74) and mucosal symptoms (RR =  1. 71). <b>Indoor</b> <b>painting</b> increased the incidence of general symptoms (RR =  1. 62). Bronchial responsiveness (BR), eosinophil counts in blood, total IgE and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in serum at baseline were predictors of incidence of SBS. At follow-up, BR, total IgE, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with increased incidence of SBS. Moreover, subjects with doctor-diagnosed asthma at baseline had a higher incidence of general (RR =  1. 65) and mucosal symptoms (RR =  1. 97). In conclusion, female gender, dampness or <b>indoor</b> molds, <b>indoor</b> <b>painting,</b> and biomarkers of allergy and inflammation were associated with a higher incidence of SBS symptoms, in particular mucosal symptoms. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The focus in Sweden on indoor environment issues over the last few decades has resulted in improvements in dwellings, and reduced tobacco smoking, which could be beneficial for public health. Reducing dampness and molds in the dwelling place is another important way of reducing occurrence of SBS symptoms in the general adult population. The association between the incidence of SBS symptoms and clinical biomarkers of allergy and inflammation suggests a common etiology between inflammatory diseases, including asthma, rhinitis, and SBS. Lastly, good agreement between self-reported and clinically diagnosed atopy indicates that questionnaire data on atopy can be used in epidemiological studies...|$|R

Such an approach is intended to measure, not only impacts on natural and non-natural resources but also building indoor environmental quality (IEQ). In many cases, building ‘running’ phase, that is maintenance operations, is strongly related to health, safety and wellbeing standards and requirements, which assure minimum IEQ levels.

This study investigated whether household exposure to paints and floor treatments and parental occupational painting were associated with CBT risk in a population-based case–control study conducted between 2005 and 2010. Methods: Cases were identified through all ten Australian pediatric oncology centers, and controls via nationwide random-digit dialing, frequency matched to cases on age, sex, and state of residence. Data were obtained from parents in mailed questionnaires and telephone interviews. Information on domestic painting and floor treatments, and parental occupational exposure to paint, in key periods relating to the index pregnancy and childhood was obtained for 306 cases and 950 controls. Data were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for frequency matching variables and potential confounders. Results: Overall, we found little evidence that parental, fetal, or childhood exposure to home painting or floor treatments was associated with risk of CBT. There was, though, some evidence of a positive association between childhood exposure to <b>indoor</b> <b>painting</b> and risk of high-grade glioma [odds ratio (OR) 3. 31, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 29, 8. 52] based on very small numbers.

40|$|Do-it-yourself (DIY) is the {{practice}} of household members undertaking home improvement or maintenance on their own, instead of hiring professional help. While DIY is a substantial and steadily growing cultural and economic phenomenon in several developed countries, in India, it is still in a stage of infancy. The objective {{of this research is}} to understand whether DIY can be introduced and developed in India as a significant consumer activity based on an understanding of the DIY markets in developed countries (like USA, UK & France) and the business models in place to service them. The concept of DIY started sometime in middle of the 20 th century in the USA and it eventually spread to UK and rest of Europe in the later part of the century. Currently, in most developed countries DIY constitutes {{a significant portion of the}} Home Improvement and repair Market and there are specialized organized retail chains to cater to the DIY demand. In India and most developing countries, DIY is not an established practice and does not contribute at all to the Home Improvement and repair Market. Organized retail in most developing countries is very small and most of the Home Improvement Market is serviced through local decorative and hardware distribution outlets. Brazil is an exceptional case due to its large organized retail structure for servicing the home improvement market. Organized retail to service the Home Improvement and repair Market in China has started in a big way and is witnessing exponential growth year on year. Similar phenomenon has started in India as well. However, both in China and India, there is no specific demand for DIY products and the same clearly needs to be created. Existing research literature on DIY, focuses mainly, on the determination of variables that influence the decision to take up a DIY or a home improvement project. Apart from this, a large number of business reports and studies profiling specific DIY markets are available over the internet. Work has also been done to trace and record the history of DIY and its impact on culture and society. While there has been some research work carried out that deals with the development of strategy for DIY markets in developed countries, no such work has been done in the context of developing countries. The purpose of this research is to do just that but the scope is limited to household painting and carpentry. The pilot study (focussed group discussions) and the questionnaire survey reveal that, in India, there is a clear bias against DIY mainly on account of perceived lack of time and knowledge. But it is possible to define a demographic profile of people that will show the highest inclination towards DIY. The survey reveals that this profile varies depending on the type of the DIY activity (Electrical, Plumbing, <b>Indoor</b> <b>Painting,</b> Outdoor Painting, carpentry and Gardening).

40|$|International audienceThere is an {{increasing}} concern about the indoor air environment, where we spend most of our time. Common methods of improving indoor air quality include controlling pollution sources, increasing ventilation rates or using air purifiers. Photocatalytic remediation technology was suggested as a new possibility to eliminate indoor air pollutants instead of just diluting or disposing them. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is a widely used photocatalyst, which is aimed to eliminate organic and inorganic pollutants. Here, we demonstrate that <b>indoor</b> photocatalytic <b>paints</b> which contain TiO 2 can substantially reduce the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). We show that the efficiency of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) removal increases with the quantity of TiO 2 in the range 0 - 7 %. The geometric uptake coefficients increase from 5 x 10 (- 6) to 1. 6 x 10 (- 5) under light irradiation of the paints. On the other hand, during the reactions of NO 2 with this paint (7 % of TiO 2) nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO) are formed. Nitrous acid (HONO) is an important harmful indoor pollutant and its photolysis leads {{to the formation of}} highly reactive OH radicals. Maximum conversion efficiencies of NO 2 to MONO and NO of 15 % and 33 % were observed at 30 % RH, respectively. A dynamic mass balance model applied to typical indoor environment predicts a steady state mixing ratio of 5. 6 ppb of MONO released upon light-induced surface reaction of NO 2 with a photocatalytic paint (7 % of TiO 2) and considering the photolysis process as the most important loss of MONO. The quantity of TiO 2 embedded in the paint is of crucial importance with respect to nitrogen oxides NO 2 remediation, but may also influence the formation of harmful intermediates like nitrous acid (MONO), which should be considered for future optimization of photocatalytic <b>paints</b> aimed for <b>indoor</b> applications.

40|$|As {{modern life}} develops, humans {{spend most of}} their time inside buildings. Understanding the effects of {{different}} building materials that exist indoors on indoor air quality is crucial to ensure comfort, health, and productivity of building occupants. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an important field of building science that focuses on studying the existence of different compounds indoors. These compounds include: airborne particles such as dust, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as carbonyls, reactive gases such as radon, ozone and others. Ozone is a strong oxidant gas that has adverse effects on human health, and is highly reactive with building materials that exist indoors. This reaction may reduce its concentration indoors, but may produce other by-products that could be more harmful for human health than ozone itself. In this dissertation, ozone reaction with different building materials is investigated in four studies. The first includes studying the effect of indoor carpet fiber type on ozone removal and carbonyl emissions. This study provides valuable data and knowledge about the importance of selecting carpet type and its effect on indoor environment. In the second study, different indoor plants were tested to evaluate their ability to remove ozone. The results from this study show wide variation between plants tested on ozone removal. Also, the ability of plants as ozone removal agent changes as light levels change. The third part studies ozone removal efficiency of HVAC filters previously installed in air handling units located on green and white membrane roofs of a commercial building. Detailed filter surface analysis using scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed to understand the nature of deposits on these filters. The reason for differences in ozone removal efficiency of two filters in comparison with new filter is also discussed. The fourth study investigated ozone removal and carbonyl emissions from three different VOC content <b>indoor</b> latex <b>paints.</b> The outcomes from this research show that zero VOC latex paint has the most ozone effective removal capacity and this paint is the least carbonyl emitter. The research presented in this dissertation adds new data, valuable knowledge, and expands the understanding of the importance of selecting indoor materials to raise indoor air quality and make the buildingsâ€™ indoor environment healthier and safer...|$|R
50|$|She painted outdoor scenes, {{somewhat}} less successfully than her <b>indoor</b> scenes, but <b>painted</b> outside whenever someone could {{take her out}} in the countryside to paint, going on many trips. In her life she visited several towns outside Sydney, as well as visiting the national capital, Canberra. She also painted in the Blue Mountains, and in Moss Vale and Exeter. Beginning in the late 1930s, she started a style which was less influenced by the modernist one, and {{more to do with}} the light and colour of Australia, and her own personal interpretation of the landscape. Her paintings show the olive green and sienna colours of the Australian bush, depicted in a style where the brush strokes are visible, made up of many similar colours. One of her best landscapes was a series of four large paintings she did called Four panels for a screen: loquat tree, gum and wattle trees, waterfall, picnic in the gully#, 1929. The first two panels show the trees in her yard, while the last two show the world further away from her home; a waterfall and people having a picnic with a billy can in a gully. It symbolises the theme and division in her landscape work between her immediate streets and trees, and further away from her home, where her friends and relatives often took her to paint. The four paintings were done on commission; however, the commission was refused, and because of this Smith would never work on a large commission again.|$|R

This study aims to describe lead contamination in the homes of children aged 6 months to 6 years in France (without overseas). Between October 2008 and August 2009, 484 housing units were investigated. Lead in tap water and total and leachable lead levels from floor dust, outdoor soils and paint chips were measured. X-ray fluorescence measurements were carried out on non-metallic and metallic substrates. Nationwide results are provided. The indoor floor dust lead (PbD) geometric mean (GM) was 8. 8 μg/m² (0. 8 μg/ft²) and 6. 8 μg/m² (0. 6 μg/ft²) for total and leachable lead respectively; 0. 21 % of homes had an indoor PbD loading above 430. 5 μg/m² (40 μg/ft²). The outdoor play area concentration GM was 33. 5 mg/kg and 21. 7 mg/kg in total and leachable lead respectively; 1. 4 % of concentrations were higher than or equal to 400 mg/kg. Outdoor floor PbD GM was 44. 4 μg/m² (4. 1 μg/ft²) that was approximately 3. 2 times higher than the GM of <b>indoor</b> PbD. Lead-based <b>paint</b> (LBP) was present in 25 % of dwellings, LBP on only non-metallic substrates was present in 19 % of homes and on metallic substrates in 10 % of dwellings. The GM of lead concentrations in tap water was below 1 μg/L; 58 % of concentrations were lower than 1 μg/L and 2. 9 % were higher than or equal to 10 μg/L. The age cut-off for homes with lead would be 1974 for paint and 1993 for indoor floor dust. This study provides, for the first time, a look at the state of lead contamination to which children are exposed in French housing. Moreover, it provides policy makers an estimate of the number of French dwellings sheltering children where abatement should be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Low slope roofs are roofs with an {{inclination}} between 1 : 16 and 1 : 4 {{and have}} been constructed and preferred for many years due to the benefits they present. The goal of the present work is to study the following problems of low slope roofs, as they are suggested by previous relevant theses and the current needs of the market. Moisture transfer in low slope roofs with constant exposure {{to high levels of}} relative humidity. Is protection against corrosion required for steel beams placed directly under the external membranes? If yes, what kind of protection is that? Roof drainage on low slope roofs The study of the first subject was based on simulations of this type of structures in order to see how external moisture affects the moisture level and the potential for corrosion on steel beams. The main goal was to conclude whether we can actually build inverted roofs with steel plates or beams lying right under the roof membrane and what kind of protection is more appropriate to apply, in case it is required. According to the literature review conducted on roof structures, corrosion and corrosion protection, as well as the results of the simulations, the main factor defining the corrosion potential is the <b>indoor</b> environment. Moreover, <b>paint</b> coating seems to be the indicated anticorrosive protection. Regarding drainage, the study focused on the literature review of the current situation, the solutions applied, the existing regulations and guidelines regarding the type of systems used (full flow or gravity, internal or external), the construction of drainage valleys (inclined or horizontal) and the placement and dimensioning of drains and overflows, {{in order to create a}} short handbook with issues to be considered by the roof engineer. The main conclusions are that drain valleys are suggested to be constructed completely horizontal, in order to facilitate the cooperation between drains, and that full-flow systems are more efficient than gravity ones and should be preferred, as long as the roof is not exposed to solid material and prone to its accumulation around drains (e. g. roofs covered with vegetation or stone ballast, with overhanging or nearby trees) ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the results of practical and theoretical research into narratives and representations of belonging, related to the 'homelessness' of thought. A new understanding of 'site-specificity' emerges through images redefined as embodied textual and sculpted 'characters' that move through 'story' and 'argument', crucially juxtaposing political and philosophical theories of belonging with their various (imagined and inherited) representations. I present new theoretical research into three twentieth century sculptural/architectural sites - The Owl House and Camel Yard by Helen Martins, in Nieu Bethesda, South Africa, The Tarot Garden by Niki de Saint Phalle, in Tuscany, Italy and The Minack Theatre by Rowena Cade, in Cornwall, England - in order to frame belonging as a relationship between character and space. The site-specific nature of these works, both pre-existing and made {{during the course of the}} project, is imagined to reflect the where and the how in our shared histories of belonging, which are considered in relation to the question of the present. Within a distinction between representation and actuality, the project has sought to remain close to the land and body-based foundations of image-based ideas. Belonging is questioned as both a condition and an activity and is discussed in relation to Hannah Arendt's 'uncommon' definition of home as the world. The practical research takes the form of one <b>indoor</b> rectangular 'polyramic' <b>painting</b> and one outdoor sculptural/ architectural enclosure. The poetic movement from the painting to the sculpture provides a visual and spatial focus for the (hi) stories, and arguments, of the site/sight of home. The theoretical enquiry offers new readings of Hannah Arendt's theoretical writings in relation to 'creative' practices and also places these in relation to Michel Foucault's history of epistemology in The Order of Things, Mieke Bal's feminist re-reading of The Book of Judges and Gillian Rose's critique of the critique of representation in Mourning Becomes the Law. The research has sought to question the traditional illegibility of the three sites of The Owl House, The Tarot Garden and The Minack Theatre, which is seen to have arisen out of their eluding the public-private distinction on which philosophies of belonging have been founded...|$|R
30|$|Bacteria {{involved}} in deterioration of monuments and artworks mainly belong to three nutritional groups: Photoautotrophs, Chemolithoautotrophs and Chemoorganotrophs. Among phototrophs and chemolithoautotrophs are mainly cyanobacteria, sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying bacteria were reported from the heritage sites. Due to their simpler nutritional (like inorganic minerals, atmospheric ammonia etc.) and ecological needs (like presence of light, CO 2 and water) these bacteria easily develop on outdoor monuments. Among these organisms, cyanobacteria {{have the ability}} to survive under the conditions of repeated drying and rehydration occurring on exposed monument’s surfaces[48] and to protect themselves by the harmful UV radiation by producing protective pigments[48]. However, their presence was also conspicuous in interior works of art[20, 93, 94] (hypogean environments of Roman Catacombs) which were subjected to inappropriate natural or artificial illumination during visitor’s hours[81, 95]. The colonization of these photosynthetic microorganisms on external surface of monuments is related to biofilm formation, corrosive inorganic and organic acid secretion resulting in mechanical deterioration (due to alternate shrinking and swelling cycles of biofilm) undesirable unaesthetic staining of the monuments (by secreted acids, pigments and metabolic bioproducts), enlargment of pore (due to hyphal penetration), alteration in pore size, distribution and water permeability of the minerals (by deposition of surfactants) and weathering (as a consequences of uptake of calcium, precipitation of calcium salt and secondary mineral formation)[18, 19]. Chemoorganotrophs and chemoheterotrophs bacteria found associated with deterioration process are mainly sulfur-reducing bacteria and actinomycetes respectively. Population of these heterotrophic bacteria and actinomycetes prevail in hypogean environment characterized by stable microclimatic conditions (high relative humidity < 90 %, constant temperature throughout year and low photon influx)[42, 96]. These bacteria are mainly responsible for the irreversible damage to the <b>indoor</b> artworks (wall <b>painting,</b> frescos, stuccoes etc) and are less {{involved in}} the deterioration of outdoor monuments. Some species belonging to order Actinomycetales like Geodermatophilaceae strains[97] and also some Micromonospor a strains[98] were also isolated from monumental stones. Actinomycetes species mainly, Streptomyces (S. julianum) may form intimate association with cyanobacterial partner as found in the hypogean environment of Roman Catacombs. Actinomycetes preferred to grow where there exist the growth of algae and chemosynthetic nitrogen fixer bacteria. Invasion and damage to the Caves of Lascaux by fungi Fusarium and associated bacterium Pseudomonas Fluorescens was mainly ascribed to the perturbations induced by illumination and visitor’s breath[57, 99].|$|R
