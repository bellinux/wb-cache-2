The city included the Navy Base and miles of beach property <b>fronting</b> on Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Bay.

5|$|Salem Chapel {{stands on}} land {{which had been}} part of the old Napoleonic Barrack Ground. Hence the name for the nearby Waterloo Road.

The land was purchased and fenced for the sum of £300 which was raised by way of a mortgage. The original meeting room, (now the Church Parlour) was built and opened in July 1840.

40|$|The Pathfinder AVHRR {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} (SST) data from 1985 – 1996 were processed with the Cayula-Cornillon edge detection and declouding algorithms. The following 11 <b>fronts</b> were distinguished: West Kamchatka, TINRO Basin, North and South Shelikhov Bay, North, West, Shantar, East Sakhalin, Central, Kashevarov Bank and Soya <b>fronts.</b> The large-scale pattern of these <b>fronts</b> {{is consistent with}} the dominant cyclonic circulation of the Okhotsk Sea. The West <b>Front,</b> TINRO Basin <b>Front,</b> Central <b>Front</b> and Shelikhov Bay <b>Fronts</b> have not been identified before. The West Kamchatka and TINRO Basin <b>fronts</b> form a double <b>front</b> observed in winter only. The North <b>Front</b> continues farther west than it was known, up to 146 °E, where it likely connects to the West <b>Front,</b> which often joins the Shantar <b>Front.</b> The latter extends from Shantar Islands to Sakhalin Bay where the Amur River Plume interrupts a nearly continuous line of <b>fronts</b> around the northern and western Okhotsk Sea. The Amur discharge feeds the East Sakhalin <b>Front</b> that follows the shelf break, branches eastward at 48 °N and 46 °N, and eventually merges with Soya <b>Front,</b> which exits the sea via Vries Strait. The 48 °N branch of the East Sakhalin <b>Front</b> seems to join the Central <b>Front,</b> which in turn merges with the TINRO Basin <b>Front,</b> thus forming the southern limb of the sea-wide frontal pattern. The Kashevarov Bank <b>Front</b> likely consists of three separate <b>fronts</b> around the namesake bank, St. Iona Island and Iona Bank. <b>Fronts</b> are seasonally persistent: they emerge and disappear in certain seasons in the same locations. Dominant frontogenetic mechanisms in the Okhotsk Sea are tidal mixing, water mass formation and advection, river discharge, and wind upwelling. Most <b>fronts</b> are generated owing to tidal mixing. <b>Front</b> genesis in the marginal ice zone and around polynyas is likely important; although these processes have not yet been investigated by in situ measurements...|$|R

5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (<b>fronting</b> of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
