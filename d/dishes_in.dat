5|$|The Greek and Latin histories, which {{represent}} {{the majority of}} materials covering Parthian history, are not considered entirely reliable since they were written {{from the perspective of}} rivals and wartime enemies. These external sources generally concern major military and political events, and often ignore social and cultural aspects of Parthian history. The Romans usually depicted the Parthians as fierce warriors but also as a culturally refined people; recipes for Parthian <b>dishes</b> <b>in</b> the cookbook Apicius exemplifies their admiration for Parthian cuisine. Apollodorus of Artemita and Arrian wrote histories focusing on Parthia, which are now lost and survive only as quoted extracts in other histories. Isidore of Charax, who lived during the reign of Augustus, provides an account of Parthian territories, perhaps from a Parthian government survey. To a lesser extent, people and events of Parthian history were also included in the histories of Justin, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, Cassius Dio, Appian, Josephus, Pliny the Elder, and Herodian.|$|E

Dishes were made with fewer components; they weren't heavily spiced and ingredients that were more flavorful had to be used sparingly. This is often why some <b>dishes</b> <b>in</b> Ashkenazic cuisine are known for being blander than <b>dishes</b> <b>in</b> Sephardic or Mizrahi cuisine.|$|E
