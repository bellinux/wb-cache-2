5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|To avoid {{identification}} with her former family or with Mormonism, Ina's mother reverted to using her maiden name, Coolbrith. The family resolved {{not to speak}} of their Mormon past, and it was only after Ina Coolbrith's death that the general public learned of her origin. Coolbrith did keep <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> Smith relations, however, including a lifelong correspondence with her first-cousin Joseph F. Smith to whom and for whom she frequently expressed her love and regard.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
60|$|As {{there was}} {{something}} mournful in his sigh, Rosa, <b>in</b> <b>touching</b> him <b>with</b> <b>her</b> tea-cup, ventured to <b>touch</b> him <b>with</b> <b>her</b> small hand too.|$|R
6000|$|Also, {{though she}} never {{admitted}} this motive to herself, {{she was always}} afraid that some day, if she kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> them, <b>her</b> husband would demand: [...] "Why don't you trot out these fussy lady friends of yours? Ashamed of me, eh?" ...|$|R
50|$|However, she {{did have}} several {{important}} and long-lasting friendships with women. Later in life, she kept up a prolonged correspondence with Irish nun Sister Mary Clare Moore, {{with whom she had}} worked in Crimea. Her most beloved confidante was Mary Clarke, an Englishwoman she met in 1837 and kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> throughout <b>her</b> life.|$|R
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have taken no part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk appears not to have been trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on that campaign, in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E
25|$|There is {{no record}} of Clarke ever visiting Turing's {{residence}} during his probation, although Turing did stay <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{after the war and}} informed her of his upcoming trial for indecency.|$|E
5000|$|According to her {{obituary}} in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "Lady Katherine lived quietly {{but remained}} <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> own and the British royal families.

The legendary Nadia Boulanger was a jury member and invited him to Paris for further study.

50|$|Mohali {{police is}} clueless about mysterious {{circumstances}} {{leading to the}} death of Anuradha Bali. The police claimed that she had spoken to 8 people before her death and the last person she spoke to was Salim Alvi of Bulandshahar, who claimed to have been <b>in</b> constant <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Salim also claimed that Bali had received death threats from some influential people in Haryana.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Morton {{wrote an}} open letter hoping her {{stepfather}} would get back <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> after being estranged for several years.

25|$|Cather {{made her}} last trip to Red Cloud in 1931 {{for a family}} {{gathering}} {{following the death of}} her mother. She continued to stay <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> Red Cloud friends and she sent money to Annie Pavelka and other country families during the Depression years.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duchess Vera {{was known}} in royal circles as an {{eccentric}} both in appearance and behavior. Although she kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> Romanov relatives, visiting Russia many times, she identified more closely with her adopted country. In 1909 she abandoned Orthodox Christianity and converted to Lutheranism. She died two years later after a stroke.|$|E
5000|$|Garver {{lives in}} Hillsborough, California, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> husband, David Travis, and son, Reid. She kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> and visited <b>her</b> Family Affair co-star Brian Keith {{until his death}} on June 24, 1997, and {{attended}} his funeral.|$|R
50|$|She remains <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Tomasz Mędrzak, <b>her</b> co-star from In Desert and Wilderness. They {{appeared}} {{together on}} Wojciech Jagielski's television talk show in 2000 when discussions were underway regarding a possible {{remake of the}} film.|$|R

25|$|Meagher did not {{formally}} move to Australia until 2009 after she {{met and married}} Tom Meagher in Ireland in 2008. After arriving in Australia, she settled in Melbourne and began working for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). She stayed <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> parents who were by then living again in Perth. In September 2012, she {{had come back to}} Melbourne after visiting her father in Perth when he had a bout of ill health.|$|E
25|$|In her Cason manuscript, Josephine or Sadie {{wrote that}} she and Dora were homesick and {{returned}} to San Francisco with Sieber's help. If Sieber helped her, the only time period that fits Josephine's story is when Sieber was in the Prescott area at Camp Verde from 1873 to 1875. Josephine said that Sieber, who was German and may have recognized Josephine's German accent, guessed her situation and got <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> brother-in-law Aaron Weiner. She said Weiner used a connection he had in Prescott to help Josephine get home. In January 1876, Josephine or Sadie left Prescott, stopped at a Los Angeles hotel, and returned to San Francisco before March 6.|$|E
25|$|While in Madras, Peter {{decided to}} officialise his {{relationship}} with Ovtchinnikova. The pair were married in a Danish consulate in September 1939. Aware of his family's disapproval of the relationship, but also possibly wishing {{to take advantage of}} the turmoil created by the recently declared Second World War, the Prince did not bother to inform either the Greek royal court or his parents about the marriage. The royal family learned of the mesalliance through the press a few weeks later. Prince George, affronted by his son's decision not to ask him or the King for permission to marry, disowned Peter and henceforward refused contact with him. Despite her own disappointment, however, Princess George remained <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> son and continued to regularly send him money.|$|E
50|$|In 1272, his {{half-sister}} Eleanor and {{her husband}} King Edward I of England came to Sicily on return from the Crusades. Eleanor's attempts to get him released from prison were unsuccessful, but she kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> him until <b>her</b> own death.|$|R

50|$|Leela Naidu's {{separation}} from {{her second husband}} Moraes was a big blow. She lived alone in a large old flat at Sargent House in the quient bylane of Colaba causeway. Her severe arthritis afflicted her social life. Naidu {{spent most of the}} last decade indoors. Financial constraints led her to keep paying guests in the house but she eventually enjoyed their company. She would call her friends and keep <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> both <b>her</b> daughters and grandsons. Her daughter Priya died of heart attack on February 8, 2008.|$|R
25|$|Four months later, Lily and Bart {{come back}} from their {{holidays}} in the Hamptons during which they renewed their vows. It also revealed that Lily has not been <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> daughter, Serena, for the whole summer. Blair is running her mother's clothing company in Paris, Dan continues the writing of his book with Georgina, Nate is working at The Spectator, and Chuck is in Dubai trying to find what his father was doing there, before he faked his death and reappeared months ago, {{with the help of}} his father's translator, Amira (Andrea Gabriel). When the group receives the news that Serena has gone missing, Blair, Dan, Georgina and Chuck fly back to New York to find her. Ivy has moved in with Rufus letting him believe that she has no money anymore and no place to live to manipulate him and destroy Lily.|$|E
500|$|Catherine, however, left Italy in 1533 {{at the age}} of {{fourteen}} and married Henry of Orléans, the second son of King Francis I of France. Though she kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> native Florence, her taste matured at the [...] royal court of France. [...] Her father-in-law impressed Catherine deeply as an example of what a monarch should be. She later copied Francis' policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone, whatever the cost. His lavish building projects inspired her own.|$|E
500|$|The next {{afternoon}} {{the two parties}} reconvened at the pool, joined by Ivanov, who had arrived that morning. There followed what Lord Denning described as [...] "a light-hearted and frolicsome bathing party, where everyone was in bathing costumes and nothing indecent took place at all". Profumo was greatly attracted to Keeler, and promised to be <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Ward asked Ivanov to accompany Keeler back to London where, according to Keeler, they had sex. Most commentators doubt this—Keeler was generally outspoken about her conquests, yet said nothing about sex with Ivanov until she informed a newspaper 18 months later.|$|E
50|$|They {{explain the}} {{disorder}} to Iris and her mother. The doctors {{believe it was}} triggered by the auto accident she was in when she was two. It appears the bruises were self-inflicted, and she probably just had sex without remembering it. The diazepam the mother gave her masked the illness, but removing it made it more apparent. The mother admits giving her diazepam for what she thought were “moods”. Chase tells Iris they have to separate her physiological symptoms from her psychological ones, which means getting <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> all <b>her</b> personalities. She will need hypnosis.|$|R
5000|$|... "Miriam" [...] {{is about}} a 61-year-old widow named Mrs. H. T.

50|$|Mabel Hardy {{moved in}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother at 4 Thornber Street, Unley Park, {{formerly}} Kyre College for boys. The well-known educator Ellen Thornber also lived on Thornber street, at number 39. Unley Park School for Girls, later {{a branch of}} Tormore House School, which Mabel once attended, was at number 37. Semi-retired, she took occasional teaching jobs: some months at Prince Alfred College in 1941 and a year at Woodlands in 1944, and kept <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> ex-students. She {{moved back to the}} Hills, not far from the Mount Lofty Railway Station, then around 1951 to Hawthorn, then finally to 74a Fisher Street, Fullarton, where she died.|$|R
500|$|Andrés' {{family is}} Jewish. His parents are Elías (Roberto Carnaghi) and Dana (Mirta Busnelli), {{and his sister}} Gabriela (Violeta Urtizberea) works at McCan and has been unlucky in love.

500|$|A club music {{song that}} lasts for three minutes, forty-one seconds, [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] appears as the ninth track on the album; track ten is a fifty-one second reprise called [...] "Up Out My Face (The Reprise)". Its {{instrumentation}} {{makes use of}} a [...] "thumping" [...] marching band coda, while its lyrics are about expressing [...] "anger at an incompatible lover". Brian Mansfield of USA Today highlights the lyrics [...] "If we were two Lego blocks, even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again" [...] {{as one of the}} album's [...] "many funny lines". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen wrote that the singer [...] "gets <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> funny bone" [...] on [...] "Up Out My Face". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the references to Lego, Harvard University and Humpty Dumpty as [...] "a whole new level of lyrical ridiculousness".|$|E
500|$|However, writer Breanne Fahs {{describes}} Solanas as {{a contradiction}} which [...] "alienates {{her from the}} feminist movement." [...] Fahs argues that Solanas {{never wanted to be}} [...] "in movement" [...] but she nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking N.O.W. members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in her lifestyle (a lesbian who sexually serviced men, claim of being asexual, confusion), a rejection of queer culture, and a non-interest in working with others despite a co-dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas's life. Solanas's life is described as one of a victim, a rebel, a desperate loner, yet Solanas's cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear said she had a [...] "groovy childhood." [...] Solanas also kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> father throughout her life, which makes one question and complicate the notion that Solanas hated her father and acted out this hatred in the shooting/manifesto. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity.|$|E
