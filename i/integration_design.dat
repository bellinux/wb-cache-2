As the prime contractor, Astrium {{is responsible for the}} satellite's design, development and <b>integration.</b> <b>Design</b> and construction began in early 2009 while launch is due for 2018. EarthCARE is an acronym standing for Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer, and the aims of the mission are to improve understanding of the cloud, radiative and aerosol processes that affect the Earth's climate. As of January 2011, the total budget for the project is £500 million (€590 million/$810 million). A significant proportion of the project will be manufactured in the UK, the main structure of the spacecraft will be built by RUAG Space in Switzerland and subsequently completed in Astrium's Stevenage facility, while one of the instruments will be made in Sevenoaks by SSTL and another in Bristol, Somerset by SEA Group Ltd, now part of Thales Alenia Space UK. In September 2014 ESA and JAXA held a joined EarthCARE International Science Workshop. From 2014 to 2015 an ongoing integration of the instruments takes place. In 2015 launch was postponed to 2018 due to problems with Lidar development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An <b>integration</b> <b>design</b> of an {{internal}} monopole antenna and a RF shielding metal case for application in a UMTS PDA phone is proposed. The monopole antenna is a low-profile (3. 5 mm only) T-shape strip monopole placed above and integrated (through shortcircuiting) to the shielding metal case, which is flushed to {{the top edge of}} the system ground plane of the PDA phone. With the integrated shielding case, possible coupling between the monopole antenna and the nearby components such as the RF module, RF circuitry and battery can be avoided. The proposed <b>integration</b> <b>design</b> can thus lead to no degrading effects on the performances of the internal monopole antenna employed in the PDA phone. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} performing large-scale <b>design</b> <b>integration,</b> taking a classical 2 D drawing envelope and interface approach and applying it to modern three dimensional computer aided design (3 D CAD) systems. Today, the paradigm often used when performing <b>design</b> <b>integration</b> with 3 D models involves a digital mockup of an overall vehicle, {{in the form of}} a massive, fully detailed, CAD assembly; therefore, adding unnecessary burden and overhead to design and product data management processes. While fully detailed data may yield a broad depth of <b>design</b> detail, pertinent <b>integration</b> features are often obscured under the excessive amounts of information, making them difficult to discern. In contrast, the envelope and interface method results in a reduction in both the amount and complexity of information necessary for <b>design</b> <b>integration</b> while yielding significant savings in time and effort when applied to today's complex <b>design</b> <b>integration</b> projects. This approach, combining classical and modern methods, proved advantageous during the complex <b>design</b> <b>integration</b> activities of the Ares I vehicle. Downstream processes, benefiting from this approach by reducing development and design cycle time, include: Creation of analysis models for the Aerodynamic discipline; Vehicle to ground interface development; Documentation development for the vehicle assembly...|$|R
