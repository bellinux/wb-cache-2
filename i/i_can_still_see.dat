25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
500|$|Alongside his {{intellectual}} pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As {{a small boy}} {{he had begun to}} visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: [...] "The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. [...] "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".|$|E

The great man was accorded a massive ovation from the Murrayfield crowd." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{memorandum}} sent to Berlin demanding {{the removal of}} German ambassador Paul Wolff Metternich because he interceded {{on behalf of the}} Armenians, Talaat reaffirmed such a commitment: [...] "the work must be done now, after the war it will be too late." [...] By the end of the war, the subsequent German ambassador Johann von Bernstorff described his discussion with Talaat: [...] "When I kept on pestering him about the Armenian question, he once said with a smile: 'What on earth do you want? The question is settled, there are no more Armenians'". A similar statement by Talaat was made to Swedish military attaché Einar af Wirsén: [...] "The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved." [...] Talaat is reported to have said the following to American ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. (as recorded in Ambassador Morgenthau's Story), who confronted Talaat on several occasions: [...] "I have accomplished more toward solving the Armenian problem in three months than Abdulhamid II accomplished in thirty years!" [...] Morgenthau then relates an exchange he had with Talaat: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Three Kingdoms {{scholar and}} doctor Huangfu Mi (215-282) took this [...] "ecstasy-inducing drug" [...] (Declercq 1998:168) {{to recover from}} a stroke, but {{suffered}} and likely died from the deleterious side effects.

Huangfu said (tr. Schipper 1993:181), [...] "The longest one can hope to live when taking the drug is ten years or so; for some, it is only five or six.

25|$|In Tudor times, Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I {{may have}} hunted in the forest, though no {{documentary}} evidence has survived to prove it.

60|$|To confess plainly, I had {{intended}} to spend my life (or any leisure I might have from Piracy upon the high seas) {{as the leader of}} a great horde of irregular cavalry, devastating whole valleys. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still,</b> looking back, <b>see</b> myself in many favourite attitudes; signalling for a boat from my pirate ship with a pocket- handkerchief, I at the jetty end, and one or two of my bold blades keeping the crowd at bay; or else turning in the saddle to look back at my whole command (some five thousand strong) following me at the hand-gallop up the road out of the burning valley: this last by moonlight.|$|R
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
