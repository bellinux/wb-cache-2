5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for <b>forgiveness</b> <b>and</b> the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
5|$|In Ascension, it is {{revealed}} that because Kratos renounced Ares, it broke his blood oath to the god and as such, Kratos was imprisoned and tortured {{by the three}} Furies. He was helped by the oath keeper Orkos and eventually overcame and killed the Furies. In order to completely be free of Ares' oath, Kratos was forced to kill Orkos, who begged Kratos to do so. Although free of his oath to the god, he was flooded with memories of killing his family. He then vowed to serve the other gods {{in order to receive}} <b>forgiveness</b> <b>and</b> relief from the nightmares of his past deeds, but he was openly defiant.|$|E

This study sought to determine whether personality and spirituality accounted for a significant portion of <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> of others. Results using Bivariate Correlations models indicated that Emotional Stability was significantly positively related to forgiveness; Agreeableness was positively related to <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> of others.

40|$|BACKGROUND: : Attitudes toward guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> may be {{important}} factors determining distress in cancer patients. Direct comparative studies in patients with different life expectancies exploring attitudes toward guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> are lacking. Also, sociodemographic and religious characteristics determining the attitudes toward guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> are unknown. OBJECTIVE: : The objective {{of this study was}} to compare attitudes toward guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients. METHODS: : A descriptive research design was used. Ninety-seven patients without evidence of disease and 55 advanced cancer patients filled out the Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument <b>and</b> the <b>Forgiveness</b> of Others Scale. RESULTS: : Both groups had an attitude of nonreligious guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness,</b> but not of religious guilt. No significant differences in attitudes toward guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> were observed between the 2 groups. In contrast to sociodemographic characteristics, religious characteristics were relevant predictors for guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness.</b> Significant differences in relations between images of God and attitudes toward guilt were observed between the 2 patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: : An attitude of nonreligious guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> was found in cancer patients, irrespective of the stage of disease. Religious characteristics were significantly associated with attitudes of guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness.</b> This correlation differed in the early and the advanced setting of disease. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: : The observed relations between religious characteristics and attitudes of guilt <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> suggest that a careful examination of the role of religious beliefs and values is relevant in the clinical care of patients with cancer, both in the setting of early and advanced disease...|$|R

5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the cat and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the cat for <b>forgiveness</b> <b>and</b> had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to leave}} the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug {{addiction}} and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's <b>forgiveness</b> <b>and</b> she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to call an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess {{to the police and}} is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} narcissism and dispositional shame on attributions for, <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> of, self <b>and</b> partner-caused betrayals in dating and marital relationships. One hundred and sixteen dating or married participants described a self-caused betrayal and a partner-caused betrayal. Participants then completed attributional <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> measures for each betrayal along with measures of narcissism, dispositional shame and relationship satisfaction. Dispositional shame and being female were positively associated with malicious attributions for partner-caused betrayals; dispositional shame was negatively associated with <b>forgiveness</b> of partner-betrayals <b>and</b> with estimated partner-forgiveness of self-caused betrayals. Hypotheses relating to narcissism were largely unsupported.

40|$|Who is {{more likely}} to forgive, given that justice is {{important}} and motivating for people? In this article, we argue that the relation between justice <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> depends on the type of justice involved; specifically, the goals of justice, i. e. retributive versus inclusive. We also explored the influence of motivational values on justice goals <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness.</b> Using data from 178 undergraduate psychology students who responded to measures of retributive and inclusive justice attitudes, <b>forgiveness</b> attitudes <b>and</b> dispositions, and values, we found support for our hypotheses that retributive justice goals are negatively related to forgiving attitudes and dispositions; inclusive justice goals are positively related to forgiveness; and benevolence and power values play the dominant role in predicting forgiveness. The results have implications for how the relation between justice <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> is conceptualised <b>and</b> applied. Peter Strelan, N. T. Feather and Ian McKe...|$|R

40|$|Forgiveness {{has been}} {{predicted}} by and correlated with aspects of personality, although few have analyzed these relationships by a <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> others distinction, or by components of forgiveness (benevolence, avoidance, revenge). This study tested 91 university students using the Big Five Personality Inventory, <b>and</b> assessed <b>forgiveness</b> through scenario based measures. The study addressed three questions in specific: (a) are there differences between <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> of others; (b) does personality predict forgiveness; and (c) {{are there any}} moderating variables (explanatory style or working memory capacity) in the relationships found. I found that differences existed within types of <b>forgiveness</b> (self <b>and</b> other); that neuroticism {{is the most significant}} personality predictor of forgiveness; and that explanatory style moderates the forgiveness by condition (self versus other) relationship. These results suggest that people on average are more willing to forgive themselves than others, that across types of <b>forgiveness</b> (self <b>and</b> other), individuals scoring higher in neuroticism are less likely to forgive in general, and that the effect of condition on forgiveness becomes less prominent in individuals with higher explanatory style scores...|$|R

40|$|This study proposes {{and tests}} {{a model that}} applies the concept of {{restorative}} justice to the enactment of revenge <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> in organizations. The model draws from theories of cognitive attribution and consistency, {{as well as more}} recent theories of revenge in organi-zations, to describe the process by which a personal offense triggers revenge <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> cognitions <b>and</b> behavior. Attributions of blame were predicted to directly influence the contemplation of revenge <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> strategies. In turn, these cognitions were hypothesized to be the immediate precursors of behavior. It was also predicted that the likableness of the offender would be positively associated with both revenge <b>and</b> <b>forgiveness</b> cognitions. Finally, blame attribution was expected to be influenced by offense severity. To test these predictions, a survey was administered to one hundred and eighty employees of a government agency.

40|$|Throughout {{the years}} {{research}} on forgiveness has expanded (Thompson et al., 2005). However {{it is only}} in recent years that forgiveness has been recognized as a concept with two components, <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> others (Ross, Hertenstein & Wrobel, 2007). The aim {{of this study was to}} see how <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> others differed, also taking into consideration variables such as situation and personality. One hundred participants completed a web-based questionnaire containing four forgiveness situations, the Heartland <b>Forgiveness</b> Scale <b>and</b> a personality test. The results from the forgiveness situations did not reveal any significant difference between <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> others. However, the ratings of the Heartland Forgiveness Scale revealed that it was harder to forgive others. Also, it was found that participants differed in their forgiveness depending on what situation it was.  In addition, individuals who scored low in the personality-type instability were less able to forgive others. It seems, therefore, that <b>forgiveness</b> of self <b>and</b> others do differ and also in the aspects of situation and personality. ...|$|R
