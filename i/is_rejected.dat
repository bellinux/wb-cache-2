5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory <b>is</b> <b>rejected</b> by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E

The King then sends the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her. Victoria agrees to make him her private secretary, and he appoints ladies-in-waiting for her from political families allied to him.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, <b>is</b> <b>rejected</b> because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E

A search is launched for a young actor to play Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but <b>is</b> <b>rejected</b> for being an inch too short, and Milhouse gets the part, albeit reluctantly, under pressure from his greedy parents.|$|E

5|$|Neorealism ("The {{world is}} made of {{ordinary}} objects.") Constructed by David Bohm and also associated with Louis de Broglie, this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical pilot wave which {{must be able to}} travel faster than light. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism <b>is</b> <b>rejected</b> by most of the physics establishment.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; {{there is a direct}} quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana <b>is</b> <b>rejected</b> by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem does not have any of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery {{with the idea of a}} dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>rejected,</b> in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E
