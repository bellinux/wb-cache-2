5000|$|The <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra planeri, {{also known}} as the European <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> and the western <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey)</b> is a small European lamprey species that {{exclusively}} inhabits freshwater environments. The species is related to, but distinct from, the North American western <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra richardsoni).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} diploma thesis was to prove the {{habitation}} of <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> near Dolní Dvořiště. Biotopes with habitat preferences of <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> were described. During the ichtological investigation of the catchment area of the Malše river in the years 2007 - 2008, <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> was successfully located on sites in Dolní Dvořiště and near Všeměřický quarry. The sites had the same character as trout streams. Length -frequency distribution of the <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> larvae was executed. The species assemblage of ichtofauna of the sites with <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> habitation was described. In the years 2008 - 2009 other possible biotopes were mapped in connection to the sites in Malše and Tichá where <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> had been located before...|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> {{is currently}} {{listed as a}} species of “least concern” in the United States by CN Red List. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> has also not been given any status regarding endangerment by the US Federal List or CITES. Currently there are no conservation plans in action specific to the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> nor laws or protected waterways aimed at conservation. No evidence of biological factors {{has been found that}} would contribute to a decline in the abundance or the range of the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey,</b> in fact, the biggest threat to the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> and closely related species is human induced alteration of suitable microhabitats. In order to preserve these specific types of microhabitats used by the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> during each phase of the life cycle, habitat preservation and rehabilitation of affected microhabitats are essential. Microhabitats used by the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> during all life stages must have a certain water temperature, substrate composition, and water quality in order for the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> to successfully inhabit and spawn in these areas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey's</b> {{life cycle}} {{consists of two}} main stages: larval and adult. During the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> inhabits a distinct micro habitat involving relatively slow moving water and a sandy substrate. The consistency of the substrate is vitally important to the Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> because during the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> burrows into the substrate using its oral disk as an anchor. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> secretes mucus from its body to form a tube leading {{to the entrance of}} the burrow and to provide support for the burrow. The formation of this larval burrow relies on the composition and size of the substrate available. The combination of both small and large particles and coarse and fine sand grains allow the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> to construct a suitable burrow that allows enough water to flow through the burrow to ensure proper respiration. The substrate in which larval southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> burrow must not contain too many fine silt and clay particles as this would inhibit respiration while too many particles of coarse sand would hinder proper burrow construction. The larval stage is complete after approximately three years. Following the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. Adult southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> are found in crevices and cracks between large rocks in deeper, faster moving water than the habitat occupied during the larval stage. After completing the metamorphosis to adults, southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> come together in groups to spawn and, once spawning is complete, the adults die. Spawning usually occurs between April and May and takes place in another distinct microhabitat consisting of shallow riffle areas with rocky substrate with a water temperature falling between 17°C to 21°C. Fecundity of the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> averages between 800 and 2500 oocytes. Human factors have been found to influence the available habitat for spawning southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys.</b> Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> have been recorded using shallow areas under bridges as spawning grounds possibly to help conceal spawning aggregations from visual predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> {{occurs in}} slow moving {{rivers and streams}} from Florida to southern Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas along the Gulf Coast west to Oklahoma and Texas. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> ranges {{as far north as}} Minnesota and Wisconsin. Specifically, southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> have been reported to occur in the Chattahoochee river system and the Conecuh river system in Alabama, the Sabine river system in Texas and Louisiana, the Illinois river system in Oklahoma, and the Neches river system in Texas. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> was thought to be restricted to the southern United States; however, Becker observed southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> in Wisconsin in 1983. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> has also been reported to occur as far north as the Spruce river and the Tamarac river in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Unpublished findings have also shown that the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> inhabits tributaries of Choctawhatchee Bay and the Ochlockonnee river system in Florida, the Chattahoochee river system in Georgia, and the Trinity and San Jacinto river systems in Texas.|$|R
50|$|The diet of the {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> changes as it undergoes metamorphosis during its life cycle from one phase to the next. The diet of larval southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> consists mainly of organic detritus. Studies that focused on closely related lamprey species (I. fossor) found that the stomach contents of larval lampreys contained 97.9% organic detritus, 2.12% algae, and 0.09% bacteria. After metamorphosis into the adult phase, southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> do not feed but rely on stored fat reserves accumulated during the larval stage for energy and nutrients. Studies {{have found that the}} digestive tract of {{the southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> actually shrinks and becomes functionally useless as larval lampreys enter the adult stage. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> encounters a wide range of predators in its natural habitat. The eggs of adult lampreys are preyed on by various species of fish and crayfish. Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> in the larval stage serve as prey {{for a wide range of}} fish and bird species. Adult forms of the Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> are preyed upon by larger fish species such as the Northern pike (E. lucius), perch species, the European chub (S. cephalus), and the mudpuppy (N. maculosus). The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> shares similar habitats and resources with many species of shiners (Notropis), the longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), Johnny darters (Etheostoma nigrum), and mottled sculpins (Cottus bairdi).|$|R
50|$|River {{lampreys}} {{belong to}} the same genus as <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> and are thought to be very closely related. Current thinking suggests that European <b>brook</b> and river <b>lampreys</b> are a paired species, which means the river lamprey represents the anadromous (sea going) form of the resident <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey.</b> However, this is an area that is still being actively researched.|$|R
50|$|Northern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> are jawless fishes, {{also known}} as cyclostomes. Northern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> are {{considered}} non-parasitic lamprey. They have poorly developed teeth and a round, disc-like, subterminal mouth, called an oral-disc, for suction. Northern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> have a single dorsal fin that continues along their entire length until it connects with the caudal fin. This dorsal fin can be notched as well. Their coloration is gray-brown dorsally with a light line down the back and an even lighter ventral side. The length of adult northern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> does not typically exceed 16 cm and the body is attenuate. While the ammocoetes look similar to the adult lampreys the ammocoetes have a hooded mouth instead of an oral-disc and no eyes.|$|R
40|$|The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> has an eel-shaped {{body with}} a deeply notched dorsal fin which {{separates}} it into two distinct fins. The mouth is disc-shaped and surrounded by teeth. Adults are dark and tan above and lighter below. During spawning, adults become blue-black in color (dnr. state. oh. us.). The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> reaches a length of 18 cm and the maximum reported age is 8 years (fishbase. org) Behavior The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> is a non-parasitic species that spawns in late winter or spring. The eggs hatch in 3 - 4 weeks and the larval stage lasts about 5 - 6 years. Larvae metamorphose in late summer. Adults over-winter, spawn, and then die. The brood is hidden in nests in gravely riffles and the eggs are not guarded (natureserve. org). Diet The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> is herbivorous in its immature stages and feeds on minute drifting microscopic organic material. In its adult stage, the least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> does not feed (natureserve. org). Threats and Protection Needs The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> is a Candidate Rare species in Pennsylvania. The species is restricted to the southern stretches of the Susquehanna watersheds and the Ohio watershed (naturalheritage. state. pa. us). Little available data is out on threat...|$|R
