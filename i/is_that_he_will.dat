6000|$|... "Give us your opinion, Father. Mr. Allinson {{seems to}} think he can make a few drastic reforms in his firm, and then leave such matters alone. My idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> find it harder than he expected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{expecting to}} find him quite an {{interesting}} study, when I know him better," [...] Francis pronounced. [...] "My only fear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> count me an unfriendly person and refuse {{to have anything to}} do with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{interview}} {{the captain of}} the Russian warship again to-morrow. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> tell us where she is--although I doubt it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, my son. God's anger still burns fiercely, and {{the people}} perish; yet it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> merciful, in the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be so, Sergeant Wilks; but his son's death {{certainly}} broke {{him down}} terribly, {{and it may}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> gladly receive his granddaughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "My belief <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{leave her}} behind him, {{or that they}} will settle somewhere {{in the wilds of}} America,--out in Mexico, or Massachusetts, or the Rocky Mountains. I do not think that he will have the courage to shew her in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is he? I {{thought him}} {{specially}} fond of Maurice's child, {{and that this}} was revulsion of feeling; but what I am afraid of <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> never believe in her or like her again, whatever she may be, and she is really fond of him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{she went}} on, more cheerfully, [...] "no one will venture {{to deny that}} Wenham is mad. He will be placed under restraint, of course, and the courts will make me an allowance. One thing is {{absolutely}} certain, and that <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not live a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{doctors have}} no right to speak in that way," [...] said Ruth, [...] "for how can they know God's pleasure? It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> recover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And here it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Saviour preached the Sermon on the Mount. Yes, He preached {{the words}} of peace upon this very spot. Oh! it cannot <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>will</b> desert us--it cannot be." ...|$|R
50|$|He sends for Vitige {{and tells}} him that his {{punishment}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> have to marry the girl who he does not think is nice to look at, Teodata, and presents her to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} young when he went West," [...] she said explanatorily; [...] "but I dare say I shall recall him. What I meant <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be very glad to know that I have been so happy here, and he will like all those who have made me so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The {{people have}} set their hearts on the thing, and Ujarak {{will try to}} escape. He will perhaps say that his torngak has {{told him to go}} hunting to-morrow. But our customs require him to keep his word. My fear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> sneak off in the night. He is a sly fox." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Acting {{upon your}} advice I did urge {{him to go}} to the bar. But he has a will of his own, and a mind {{altogether}} made up as to the line of life which he thinks will suit him best. What I fear now <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> spend more money upon experiments than he can afford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> succeed while so many keen {{eyes are}} close at hand. It is only {{reasonable}} to suppose all the crew are near about the captives, therefore how may one man prevail against them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, if he {{is guilty}} the chances <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> leave San Francisco as soon as possible," [...] {{said one of the}} detectives. [...] "The best we can do is to try to head him off." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'During {{the life}} of Captain Aldclyffe, with you as the foreman of works, and he himself as his own steward, {{everything}} worked well. But now {{it may be necessary}} to have a steward, whose management will encroach further upon things which have hitherto been left in your hands than did your late master's. What I mean <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> directly and in detail superintend all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The mine-owner, {{following}} his own inclinations, {{would take a}} little farm, grow potatoes, and live a beautiful life--perhaps write a little poetry. A slave to sense of duty, he is chained to the philanthropic work of gold-mining. If we hamper him and worry him the danger <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> get angry with us--possibly he will order his fiery chariot and return to where he came from." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She does. He is!" [...] cried Winnifred, deeply moved. [...] "Here on {{her knees}} she blesses him. And now," [...] she added, [...] "we must part. Seek not to follow me. One who has aided a poor girl in the hour of need will respect her wish when she tells him that, alone and buffeted by the world, her one prayer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> leave her." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{after the}} year was over, the Soul thought within himself, 'I have tempted my master with evil, and his love is {{stronger}} than I am. I will tempt him now with good, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> come with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} I hesitated, and then I saw I {{might as well}} speak out honestly. When a man sees before him a pair of blue eyes like those which were then fixed upon me, the chances <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> speak out honestly.|$|R
50|$|Doc Daneeka {{is forced}} to share a tent with Chief White Halfoat, whom he is scared of. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> also {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> catch pneumonia from Chief White Halfoat, who <b>is</b> obsessed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> soon die of pneumonia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not as yet," [...] the {{landlord}} replied. [...] "They {{say that all}} the northern and eastern ports are watched, and they make sure of catching him, if he presents himself there. The general opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will,</b> for a time, go into hiding with his friends, {{in the hills of}} Cumberland or Westmoreland, or perhaps on the Yorkshire moors; but they are sure to catch him sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{will the}} {{government}} never be so well administered, inquired one, that we private men shall hear nothing about it? [...] "The king answered: At all events, I require a prudent and able man, who {{is capable of}} managing the state affairs of my kingdom. The ex-minister said: The criterion, O Sire! of a wise and competent man <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not meddle with such like matters." [...] Alas that the ex-minister should have been so nearly right! ...|$|E
60|$|We both {{felt better}} for our talk, and when I wished him good-night at his door, {{it was the}} real Cyril Harjohn whose hand I gripped--the real Cyril, because the best that is in a man is his real self. If there be any future for man beyond this world, it is the good that is in him that will live. The other side of him is of the earth; it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> leave behind him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wire to me. Put 'Send a doctor;' {{that will}} {{do as well as}} {{anything}} else, and will sound well at the post-office. I'll see <b>that</b> <b>he</b> comes down by the next train. You'd best meet him at the station, for the chances <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> drunk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall do {{that right}} willingly, sir; {{and it will}} be a {{pleasure}} for my son to hear, from your lips, a full account of your journey hither, and something of your native land, in which it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> some day, compelled to take refuge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very probably; but {{remember}} this, it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> rave to some purpose, when such insolence will be but of little avail to you. Raving! Yes, I suppose {{that a man}} poor as I am must be mad indeed to set his heart upon anything that you may choose to fancy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't, my dear. My only fear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{come back}} wearing spectacles, for I {{should say that}} it would ruin any human eyes to have to wade through the reams of {{feminine}} handwriting you send to him. If he is the sensible fellow I give him credit for, he only reads the first three words, which are, I suppose, 'my darling Ronald' and the last four, which I also suppose are 'your ever loving Mary.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is welcome}} to do that," [...] Oswald said. [...] "My fear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> send {{down to the}} port, to inquire if any craft put out about the hour at which his men were attacked. But {{even if he does}} so, there is no great chance of our being overtaken. We are {{travelling}} fast, and in another hour it will be dark; and long before daybreak we shall reach Leith, having both wind and tide in our favour, all the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘The Lord deliver me {{from the}} wisdom of laymen!’ cried Romaine. ‘Put myself in the wrong at the {{beginning}} of a lawsuit? No, indeed! There was but one thing to do, and I did it, and burned my last cartridge in the doing of it. I stunned him. And it gave us three hours, by which we should make haste to profit; for if there is one thing sure, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be up to time again to-morrow in the morning.’ ...|$|E
