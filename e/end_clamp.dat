40|$|The {{shear failure}} of {{foundations}} and earth structures {{with the long}} length is the plane strain shear failure. The paper describes briefly the plane strain shear test carried out in our laboratory. Generally, the techniques of the plane strain shear test are torelably difficult and the apparatus is complex. We have made the simple apparatus of the plane strain shear test {{in the light of}} the apparatus developed by Dr. Duncan J. M. at University of California. The test specimen is the rectangular solid with 3. 5 cm in width, 7. 5 cm in length and 8. 0 cm in height. The <b>end</b> <b>clamp</b> is set in order to arrest the displacement of the direction of length. The shear strengths of three kinds of dry sand in plane strain shear test are compared with strengths measured in triaxial test at the same initial density and the pore water pressure produced during the test of saturated sand in plane strain shear test is measured. These experimental results were satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCreep-age forming (CAF) {{is one of}} the {{relatively}} new forming techniques that has been proven viable for the production of extra-large integral airframe structures. However, experimental studies on forming stiffened structures under creep-ageing conditions remain scarce. In this work, 200 mm× 48 mm integrally stiffened plates of aluminium alloy 2219 have been formed on an <b>end</b> <b>clamp</b> device that has a bending radius of 156 mm and creep-aged at 175 °C for 18 h. Three different stiffener designs, namely the beam stiffened, waffle and isogrid plates, are tested alongside the flat plates. Utilisation of PTFE pocket fillers and intermediate sheets to reinforce and protect stiffeners during forming operation is found effective as demonstrated by the defect-free formed parts with smooth curvature. Springback of the plates ranged from 12. 2 to 15. 7 % in the experimental studies for different stiffener designs. Using the CAF material constants determined for this alloy, corresponding finite element models have been developed and experimentally validated using the measured profiles of the creep-age formed plates. Up to 6. 3 % difference in springback is observed when forming workpieces with different pre-form age condition alone...|$|E
40|$|Steel {{bridges and}} {{structures}} often need strengthening {{due to increased}} live loads, or repair due to corrosion or fatigue cracking. This thesis explores the use of adhesively bonded prestressed carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) strips in retrofitting intact steel girders, through experimental and analytical investigations. The {{first part of the}} research program investigates the behaviour of CFRP-strengthened steel beams comprised of W Structural Sections (W) with cover plates welded to the tension flange. Six beams, 2000 mm long, were tested under cyclic loads {{to examine the effects of}} CFRP strip strengthening on the fatigue life. The CFRP strip prestressing process, type of CFRP strip, level of prestressing, and the location of the CFRP strips were the main parameters examined in this study. Debonding at the end of strip was a significant problem that can be controlled by applying a proper <b>end</b> <b>clamp.</b> The maximum increase in fatigue life observed in the experiments was 125 percent, for a specimen strengthened using high modulus CFRP strips bonded onto the cover plates with the highest level of prestressing. An analytical model and a finite element model were developed for analyzing the strengthened beams. A fracture mechanic analysis was performed to investigate the effects of prestressing on the crack growth rates at the critical weld toe. The models were verified using experimental results, and then used to perform parametric studies. It is shown that the effectiveness of reinforcement is greatest for beams with strips on the cover plate, higher CFRP elastic modulus, and higher prestressing level. In general, this study demonstrates that steel beams can indeed be successfully strengthened or repaired using prestressed CFRP materials...|$|E

These four quantities have to be determined using two equations, the balance of forces in the beam and the balance of moments in the beam.

40|$|Bending {{oscillations}} of piezoelectric bimorph beams {{are effective}} sound sources in gases or fluids and therefore of practical interest. On {{the basis of}} the piezoelectric constitutive relations and the elastodynamic equations the differential equation of flexural vibrations of thin rectangular piezoelectric heterogeneous bimorph beams consisting of a piezoelectric layer glued onto an elastic substrate is derived. The piezoelectric layer is polarized in thickness direction and can be excited to thickness vibrations by an electric ac voltage applied to electrodes covering the upper and lower surface of the layer. This causes an oscillating transverse contraction in the piezoelectric layer but not in the substrate and thus generates flexural vibrations of the beam. The differential equation is solved analytically for beams of finite length with both <b>ends</b> free, one <b>clamped</b> and one free end, and also for both <b>ends</b> <b>clamped.</b> Their vibration behavior in viscous fluids is considered.

40|$|Abstract. Three-point bending {{tests of}} {{nanowires}} with Contact {{atomic force microscopy}} reveal that the Young’s modulus of a nanowire is size-dependent.

In this study, an analytical solution has been derived for the elastic strain energy of a nanowire with both <b>ends</b> <b>clamped</b> and contacted by an AFM tip at its midpoint. Different from previous theoretical models, the present model can handle the case of large deflection, where the displacement of the nanowire is in the same order of the diameter.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the vibration in a beam with one fixed end. The set-up {{consisted of a}} beam with one <b>end</b> <b>clamped</b> and a rigid plate having the same thickness of the beam, located adjacent to the unfixed end of the beam. The gap between the beam and the plate varied from 4 to 128 μm depending {{on the length of}} the beam. From the system behaviour in the small signal regime it was concluded that the frequency ratio of the second and first allowed transverse vibrations is solely a function of the gap size. In the large signal regime energy flow to other vibration modes takes place due to nonlinear effects.

The SELT loading technique was chosen since it is both convenient and provides forcing function information of small uncertainty. These data will be useful for evaluating pertinent structural response prediction methods. A second objective was to obtain high-quality transient-strain data for a well-defined structural/material model subjected to impact by a rigid body of known mass, impact velocity, and geometry; large-deflection, elastic-plastic transient response conditions are of primary interest. The beam with both <b>ends</b> <b>clamped</b> and a steel sphere as the impacting body were chosen. The steel sphere was launched vertically by explosive propulsion to achieve various desired impact velocities. The sphere/beam impact tests resulted in producing {{a wide range of}} structural responses and permanent deformations, including rupture of the beam from excessive structural response in two cases. The transient and permanent strain data as well as the permanent deflection data obtained are of high quality and should be useful for checking and evaluating methods for predicting the responses of simple 2 -d structures to fragment (sphere) impact.

By introducing the unit pulse functions and Dirac functions, the clamped edge can be made equivalent to the simply supported one by adding the unknown horizontal reactions.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of III-N MEMS test structures, such as cantilevers, beams and stress-pointers, and the modelling of their deformation due to residual stress relief, is presented. GaN and AlGaN/GaN structures were fabricated, either with {{one end and}} both <b>ends</b> <b>clamped</b> to the Si substrate (asymmetrical and symmetrical mechanical boundary conditions, respectively). The residual stress in the III-N layer was measured by photoluminescence and X-ray diffraction, and the stress relief induced deformation was analysed by a finite element method model. The deformations of the MEMS structures were used to calculate both the residual strains and the Young’s modulus of the material. One-end-clamped structures suffer from large deformations due to the uneven stress relaxation. During micromachining, the relaxation induces large upward buckling, as measured for fabricated devices and fitted by the FEM model. Two-end-clamped structures were also studied using different topologies and under-etching lengths of the clamped region.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the {{research}} {{is to provide a}} simpler and more consistent equation for the analysis of the natural frequencies of a beam with respect to the widely used one introduced by Timoshenko in 1916. To this purpose, the free vibrations of a beam resting on Winkler or/and Pasternak elastic foundations are analyzed via original Timoshenko theory as well as two of its truncated versions, which have been proposed by Elishakoff in recent years to overcome the mathematical difficulties associated with the fourth-order time derivative of the deflection. Former equation takes into account for both shear deformability and rotary inertia, while latter one is based upon incorporation of the slope inertia effect. Detailed comparisons and derivations of the three models are given for six different sets of boundary conditions stemming by the various possible combinations of three of the most typical end constraints for a beam: simply supported <b>end,</b> <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> and free end. It appears that the two new theories are able to overcome the disadvantage of the original Timoshenko equation without predicting the unphysical second spectrum and to produce very good approximations for the most relevant values of natural frequencies. As a consequence, the inclusion of these simpler approaches is suggested in future works.
