5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq</b> who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main deployments, Southern Rhodesian servicemen served in other theatres of the war.

5|$|Muslim {{forces in}} this period {{comprised}} small bodies of professional troops, which were augmented by volunteers and conscripts in times of war. The largest of the Muslim states at the time, the Turkish Great Seljuk Sultanate, which ruled most of what is modern <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq</b> had about 10,000 full-term soldiers. The number of troops available to the Syrian states was much smaller. The core of the professional troops were the ghulam or mamluk, who were trained for war since childhood. The cost of raising and training a mamluk was about 30 dinars (by contrast, a good horse in Syria went for about 100 dinars).|$|E

5|$|The Eighth Army under Montgomery spent February at Medinine in {{south-eastern}} Tunisia. Expecting {{an imminent}} {{attack by the}} Axis, the Eighth Army mustered every anti-tank gun it could from Egypt and Libya. The 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) Anti-Tank Regiment, including the Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery under Major Savory, duly advanced west from Benghazi and reached the front on 5 March 1943. The Germans and Italians assaulted Medinine the next day, but failed to make much progress and abandoned their attack by the evening. The Rhodesian gunners, held in reserve, did not {{take part in the}} engagement but were attacked from the air. The Rhodesians of the KRRC, now under the 7th Motor Brigade, moved up from Libya during early March. No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, which had spent 1942 and the first months of 1943 in <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq,</b> returned to North Africa the same month, with the future Prime Minister Ian Smith in its ranks as a Hurricane pilot.|$|E
5|$|The future Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith {{served in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War, {{interrupting}} his studies at Rhodes University in South Africa to join up in 1941. Following a year's pilot instruction in Southern Rhodesia under the Empire Air Training Scheme, he was posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, then stationed in the Middle East, in late 1942. Smith received six weeks' operational training in the Levant, then entered active service as a pilot officer in <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iraq.</b> No. 237 Squadron, which had operated in the Western Desert from 1941 to early 1942, returned to that front in March 1943. Smith flew in the Western Desert until October that year, when a crash during a night takeoff resulted in serious injuries, including facial disfigurements and a broken jaw. Following reconstructive plastic surgery to his face, other operations and five months' convalescence, Smith rejoined No. 237 Squadron in Corsica in May 1944. While there, he attained his highest rank, flight lieutenant.|$|E
