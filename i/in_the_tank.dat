5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It {{can be difficult to}} control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy {{to such an extent}} that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded by the introduction of the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{is one of}} {{the holy}} places where the Hindus offer oblations to {{ancestors}} {{with the help of the}} priests. Devotees visit the temple to worship in front of the image of Badrinath in the sanctum and have a hold dip in Alaknanda River. The general belief is that a dip <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> purifies the soul.|$|E
50|$|The largest-scale pure {{fish farms}} use a system derived (admittedly much refined) from the New Alchemy Institute <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. Basically, large plastic fish tanks {{are placed in}} a greenhouse. A hydroponic bed is placed near, above or between them. When tilapia are raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks,</b> {{they are able to}} eat algae, which {{naturally}} grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> when <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> are properly fertilized.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to determine the}} capacity for {sup 137 }Cs uptake by mixed metal ferrocyanides present in Hanford Site waste tanks, and to assess the potential for aggregation of these {sup 137 }Cs-exchanged materials to form ``hot-spots`` <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> This research, performed at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) for Westinghouse Hanford Company, stems from concerns regarding possible localized radiolytic heating within <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> After ferrocyanide was added to 18 high-level waste <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950 s, some of <b>the</b> ferrocyanide <b>tanks</b> received considerable quantities of saltcake waste that was rich in {sup 137 }Cs. If radioactive cesium was exchanged and concentrated by the nickel ferrocyanide present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks,</b> <b>the</b> associated heating could cause tank temperatures to rise above the safety limits specified for <b>the</b> ferrocyanide-containing <b>tanks,</b> especially if <b>the</b> supernate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> is pumped out and the waste becomes drier...|$|R
50|$|Greenwater {{hatcheries}} are medium-sized hatcheries using large tanks {{with low}} animal densities. To feed the shrimp larvae, an algal bloom is induced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> <b>The</b> survival rate is about 40%.|$|R
5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E
5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to tell if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|While recuperating {{from his}} wound, Patton was {{promoted}} to colonel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tank</b> Corps of the U.S. National Army on October 17. He returned to duty on October 28 but saw no further action before hostilities ended with the armistice of November 11, 1918.

50|$|Boil off rate {{is governed}} by heat leakage and by the {{quantity}} of propellant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> With partially filled <b>tanks,</b> <b>the</b> percentage loss is higher. Heat leakage depends on surface area, while the original mass of propellant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> depends on volume. So by the cube-square law, <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>the</b> faster the liquids will boil off.Some propellant tank designs have achieved a liquid hydrogen boil off rate as low as approximately 0.13% per day (3.8% per month) while the much higher temperature cryogenic fluid of liquid oxygen would boil off much less, about 0.016% per day (0.49% per month).|$|R
5|$|Mannargudi {{has three}} {{prominent}} Hindu temples, namely, Jayamgondanatha temple, Rajathi Rajeswara temple and Raja Gopalaswamy temple. Rajagopalaswamy temple {{is the most}} prominent landmark in the town. During the Tamil months of Panguni (March–April), the most prominent festival of the temple, namely, Pangunith Thirivuzha, is celebrated. Theppothsavam, the float festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Aani (June–July) and Adipooram, the chariot festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Aadi (July-Aug) are other prominent festivals of the temple that attract visitors from nearby villages and towns to Mannargudi. The Nayak kings of the 15th century promoted music in the temples. Instruments like Mukhavina, Dande, Kombu, Chandravalaya, Bheri and Nagaswaram were commonly used in the temple service. Haridra Nadhi, the temple tank associated with the Rajagopalaswamy temple, {{is one of the}} largest temple tanks in the state. Hindu pilgrims take a holy dip <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> during festive occasions.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E

50|$|The {{technology}} would accurately forecast hourly demand for each grade of motor fuel at each service station, enabling it {{to determine when}} the first product would run out, the amounts of other products that would be left at that time, and when the optimal load chosen would fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> underground storage <b>tanks.</b> <b>The</b> period of time from the forecasted time of fitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> to <b>the</b> point of product run out was called the “delivery window”. The delivery window represented the delivery flexibility of when the load could arrive at the service station {{so that it would}} fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks,</b> and arrive prior to first product run out.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{antibiotics}} {{are widely}} used in shrimp hatcheries to control bacterial infections. Appearance of antibiotic resistant pathogens and restriction {{on the use of}} antibiotics have {{led to the development of}} alternatives to antibiotics in hatchery systems. In light of this, an attempt was undertaken to investigate the effects of probiotics on the larval rearing of Penaeus monodon, compared with control <b>tanks</b> (without probiotics). <b>The</b> results showed that several issues significantly improved with administering probiotics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>tanks</b> compared with <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> without probiotics. For example, the concentration of ammonia was estimated to be 1. 25 mg/L that was less than half of what was measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>tanks.</b> <b>The</b> size variation was observed more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>tanks</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>tanks.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> muscle gut ratio of PL 15 was about 85 to 92 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> probiotic treated <b>tank</b> and 70 to 80 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>tank</b> during <b>the</b> eight cycles of production. The fouling organisms were more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>tank</b> compared to <b>the</b> experimental <b>tanks.</b> <b>The</b> average length of PL 15 was maximum when reared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>tanks</b> compared to <b>the</b> control <b>tanks.</b> <b>The</b> final survival rate of PL 15 from the control and experimental tank was 35 and 52 %, respectively. The present investigation indicated that probiotics played an important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growth, survival and health status of P. monodon larvae...|$|R
5|$|Tanks were {{primarily}} {{used on the}} Western Front. The first offensive {{of the war in}} which tanks were used en masse was the battle of Cambrai in 1917; 476 tanks started the attack, and the German front collapsed. At midday the British had advanced five miles behind the German line. The battle of Amiens in 1918 saw the value of the tank being appreciated; 10 heavy and two light battalions of 414 tanks were included in the assault. 342 Mark Vs and 72 Whippets were backed up by a further 120 tanks designed to carry forward supplies for the armour and infantry. By {{the end of the first}} day of the attack, they had penetrated the German line by , 16,000 prisoners were taken. In September 1918, the British Army was the most mechanised army in the world.

5|$|Boam's February 23, 1988 rewrite {{utilized}} many of Connery's comic suggestions.

Spielberg—who was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award—had {{the idea of making}} Indiana a Boy Scout. Indiana's mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm while grasping for the Grail. Boam's revision on March 1 showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the end.|$|E
25|$|Once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> {{the wider}} cross {{sectional}} area of the tank reduces the downward superficial velocity of the mixture, allowing mineral-laden bubbles to disengage from the liquid and rise to the surface as they would in a conventional cell, where they form the froth.

30|$|Transfer {{of ammonia}} to tank B can be {{accomplished}} by various methods; however, the best option when using the present system will be to feed compressed and liquefied ammonia from <b>the</b> multistage compressor. <b>In</b> this method, because of <b>the</b> ammonia gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> filled <b>tank,</b> <b>the</b> ammonia concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> empty <b>tank</b> is brought to 100  %, and then, some part of vaporized ammonia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> filled <b>tank</b> is compressed by the compressor; thus, liquefied ammonia is sent by the compressor discharge line to <b>the</b> filled <b>tank.</b> Exergy analysis performed for this method reveals that exergy losses for the present system result from losses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ammonia <b>tank</b> and ammonia pumps.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental validation of RELAP 5 and TRACE 5 for licensing {{studies of the}} Atucha II-PHWR nuclear power plant. A scaled experimental facility, representing the boron injection system of Atucha II, was built. The system has a fundamental importance for loss of coolant accidents (LOCA) and anticipated transients without scram (ATWS). The experiment consists of the discharge of a <b>tank</b> that represents <b>the</b> boron <b>tank</b> filled with air or a mixture of air-water onto a discharge <b>tank</b> that represents <b>the</b> moderator <b>tank.</b> Both tanks are connected by a pipe which includes a valve and an orifice plate to model the pressure losses due to <b>the</b> fittings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real system. The pressure and water level measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> are compared with the RELAP 5 and TRACE 5 predictions. The codes predict <b>the</b> pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> accurately. However, both codes overpredict <b>the</b> heat transfer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boron <b>tank</b> air-water interface which produces a greater expansion of the air {{which leads to a}} small discrepancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boron <b>tank</b> level prediction...|$|R
25|$|Water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is {{slightly}} pre-heated by the boiler, which reduces {{the loss of}} pressure found when cold feedwater is injected into the boiler.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} {{supplying}} dried bioflocs biomass to Nile tilapia juveniles were investigated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present work. Fish were stocked in experimental rearing tanks for eight weeks. Selected variables of water quality, growth performance and effluent quality were evaluated. Fish were given {{different combinations of}} artificial diets and biofloc biomass, in wet (in natura) or dry form. As the supply of artificial diet decreased, the allowance of biofloc biomass increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same proportion. Biofloc biomass was produced in two 500 -L tanks that received daily applications of dry molasses to adjust the C: N ratio of the water to 15 : 1. The concentration of nitrite in water was only reduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> receiving wet bioflocs. The fish growth performance was poorer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> that received dried biofloc biomass than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> with wet biofloc biomass.
