50|$|Prior {{to contact}} with colonists, alcohol use and {{production}} was mainly {{concentrated in the}} southwestern United States. Some tribes produced weak beers, wine and other fermented beverages, but they had low alcohol concentrations (8%-14%) and were to be used only for ceremonial purposes. The distillation technique required to make stronger, potent forms of alcohol were unknown. It was well documented that Mexican Native Americans prepared over forty different alcoholic beverages {{from a variety of}} plant substances, such as <b>honey,</b> <b>palm</b> sap, wild plum, and pineapple. In the Southwestern U.S., the Papago, Piman, Apache and Maricopa all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called haren a pitahaya. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes. To the east, the Creek of Georgia and Cherokee of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and in the Northeast, {{there is some evidence that}} the Huron made a mild beer made from corn. In addition, despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Alaska were believed to have made alcoholic drinks from fermented berries.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{hearing a}} remark that Diggs once knocked out five fighters in one day, Fitz “drunkenly” {{says he knows}} of a fighter who could knock out any 10 in one day: <b>Honey</b> Roy <b>Palmer.</b> Gillon tries to take {{advantage}} of the situation and bets Fitz $100,000 that no one man can best ten Diggstown boxers in one day. Caine quickly volunteers to finance Fitz's bet and the con is on.|$|R
50|$|Caine {{discovers that}} Gillon’s treachery (and his bank account) goes deeper than Diggstown people know. As his manager, Gillon drugged Diggs during a fight so that Gillon could collect on the opponent’s long odds. Diggs {{suffered}} {{irreversible brain damage}} as a result. With help from his prison buddy Wolf's sister (Heather Graham), it is learned that Gillon has more than $1.5 million in assets. Caine tricks him into risking all of it. Now {{it is up to}} <b>Honey</b> Roy <b>Palmer</b> to defeat all 10 of Diggstown's men.|$|R
40|$|Non- Timber Forest Products play a {{vital role}} in {{livelihood}} of people in and around the forests. NTFPs comprise medicinal plants, dyes, mushrooms, fruits, resins, bark, roots and tubers, leaves, flowers, seeds. They are also known as Non-wood, minor, secondary, special or line forest products. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are wild plant and animal products harvested from forests, such as wild fruits, vegetables, nuts, edible roots, <b>honey,</b> <b>palm</b> and medicinal plants, poisons snails and bush meat. The type, number and nature of NTFPs vary from one geographical area to another based on the local geo-physical circumstances. NTFPs are highly variable in components, quantities and locations. NTFP harvesting is generally a seasonal activity, with only a few species existing most of the year. At global level, more than two billion people are dwelling in forest, depending on NTFPs for subsistence, income and livelihood security. NTFPs are well thought-out to be important for at the bottom of rural livelihoods, reducing rural poverty, biodiversity conservation, and facilitating rural economic growth. An estimated 80 per cent of the population of the developing world uses Non-Wood Forest Products (NWFP) to meet some of their health and nourishing needs. It is an important source of income for the poor in many developing countries. In addition, several opportunities for improved rural development are linked to NTFP. In India over 50 million people are dependent on NTFPs for their subsistence and cash income. This provides 50 per cent of household income for 20 to 30 per cent of rural population particularly for tribal. Potentially around 3000 species of forest products are found to be useful, but only 126 have developed marketability. Around 50 per cent of forest revenues and 70 per cent of forest based export income of the country comes from NTFPs. Thus it can be depicted that NTFPs form one of the mainstays of income and sustenance for many tribal communities. Forests are associated with socio-economic and cultural life of tribal’s in India...|$|E

25|$|The Aché {{economy was}} {{traditionally}} centered on hunting vertebrate game with bow and arrow, extracting wild <b>honey,</b> and exploiting <b>palm</b> starch and insect larvae. Numerous fruits were also exploited seasonally, but they constitute {{only a small}} fraction of the energy in the yearly diet. In the last half century before pacification, Aché groups occasionally raided their settled neighbors for manioc root (a starchy staple), domestic animals, and metal tools.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} Tondo engaged in agriculture.

50|$|Trading in {{the past}} was done by barter system but now the common currency, the Indonesian rupiah is being used. The Kanekes people would sell fruits, <b>honey</b> and sugar <b>palm</b> through the middlemen. They would also buy other necessities {{that they do not}} produce from the market. Markets that are located outside the Kanekes {{customary}} region that the Kanekes people themselves would go to are such as Kroya, Cibengkung and Ciboleger markets.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} Tondo engaged in agriculture, {{making a living}} through farming, rice {{planting}} and aquaculture (especially in lowland areas).

In addition, there were also great quantities of cotton and colored clothes, wax, <b>honey</b> and date <b>palms</b> produced by the natives. The Wangdom of Pangasinan often exported deer-skins to Japan and Okinawa. The Nation of Ma-i produced beeswax, cotton, true pearls, tortoise shell, medicinal betel nuts and yuta cloth in their trade with East Asia. By the early sixteenth century, the two largest polities of the Pasig River delta, Maynila and Tondo, established a shared monopoly on the trade of Chinese goods {{throughout the rest of}} the Philippine archipelago.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{greatest}} threats to endangered species is habitat loss. This {{is also the case}} with the Tana River mangabey. It is estimated that 50% of the original forest has been lost in the last 20 years. The Tana River area is losing its forests to agriculture. Felling of canopy trees for canoe construction, wild <b>honey</b> collection, and <b>palm</b> fronds are being used for thatching and mats. Subcanopy trees are being used for housing poles and the topping of Phoenix reclinata for palm wine collection severely impacts the resources used by the species. Tana River mangabeys are also hunted and trapped in response to local crop damage. This trapping may occur and appears to be occurring at low levels within the forests.|$|R

The Kingdom of Maynila a vassal-state of the Sultanate of Brunei also became an entrepot, but between Borneo and the Philippines.|$|R
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} four honey samples from different floral sources (Acacia, Coriander, Sider and Palm) were evaluated {{with three different}} assays; DPPH free radical scavenging assay, superoxide anion generated in xanthine–xanthine oxidase (XOD) system and low density lipoprotein (LDL) peroxidation assay. The dark <b>Palm</b> and Sider <b>honeys</b> had the highest antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay. But all the honey samples exhibited {{more or less the}} same highly significant antioxidant activity within the concentration of 1 mg honey/ 1 ml in XOD system and LDL peroxidation assays. The chemical composition of these samples was investigated by GC/MS and HPLC analysis, 11 compounds being new to honey. The GC/MS revealed the presence of 90 compounds, mainly aliphatic acids (37 compounds), which represent 54. 73, 8. 72, 22. 87 and 64. 10 % and phenolic acids (15 compound) 2. 3, 1. 02, 2. 07 and 11. 68 % for Acacia, Coriander, Sider and <b>Palm</b> <b>honeys.</b> In HPLC analysis, 19 flavonoids were identified.

40|$|The {{effects of}} using three {{different}} waxing materials (<b>palm</b> kernel, <b>honey</b> and chemical waxes) on some chemical properties, minerals and antinutrients compositions of banana fruits stored {{for a period}} of four weeks were studied. Banana fruits used for the study were obtained from a local farm at Aagba, in Boripe Local Government area of Osun State, Nigeria. The harvested fruits were grouped into four. Three of these were differently treated with the waxing materials using the cold or dipping wax method while the fourth group was not treated (control sample). The four samples were then stored under the same conditions of storage for four weeks. They were thereafter evaluated for their chemical properties, minerals and antinutrients compositions using the recommended standard methods. The results of chemical analysis are the pH range 6. 400. 03 - 6. 800. 03, Reducing sugar 14. 200. 04 - 17. 600. 05, Total soluble solids 12. 380. 03 - 14. 600. 04 and vitamin C 16. 700. 04 - 21. 400. 050. The mineral analysis results are potassium 285. 400. 5 - 301. 70. 6, Phosphorus 270. 100. 6 - 288. 300. 6 and Iron 1. 240. 05 - 1. 480. 05. The antinutrients composition results are tannin 0. 1360. 005 - 0. 1480. 004, Saponin 0. 7100. 005 - 0. 7530. 005 and Morphine alkaloid 1. 4270. 005 - 1. 4500. 006. <b>Palm</b> kernel, <b>honey</b> and chemical waxes mildly decrease the chemical properties, minerals and antinutrients compositions of the banana fruits treated by them and stored. Banana sample treated with honey wax preserved the fruits better than others in terms of antinutrients compositions. However, reduction of Morphine alkaloid in the banana fruits is better achieved using chemical wax rather than <b>honey</b> or <b>palm</b> kernel waxes...|$|R
40|$|The Chilean palm, Jubaea chilensis (Front Cover), one of {{the most}} emblematic tree species of the Chilean flora, has {{suffered}} a gradual reduction of its population numbers in the last 150 years, with the estimated 120, 000 palms that exist today being no more than 2. 5 % of the existing population found {{at the beginning of the}} 19 th Century. From an economic point of view, this plant has been {{one of the}} most prized species in the central zone of Chile due to its two valuable products – its sap, the basis of the traditional <b>palm</b> <b>honey</b> industry, and its seeds (mini-coconuts), which are also an important product for the food industry. Along with a history of extensive use, there has been a drastic reduction of the accompanying native vegetation due to anthropogenic activities, thus reducing the appropriate habitats for the natural regeneration of this species. Given its current ecological condition and the need to implement strategies that ensure its conservation, it is necessary to evaluate current knowledge of the palm. This article gives a general background of the species, i. e. biogeography, ecology and history of use, and general recommendations are provided to ensure its persistence in the central zone of Chile.
