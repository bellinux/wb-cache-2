25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard bushings. In this case one large renewable bushing {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility is to make a custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is located with <b>dowel</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E

50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses a <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of specifications, military, ISO, DIN, ASME that pins may be made to. And size can even vary by dowel pin material. Metric <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are often found in two size. In DIN 6325 {{standard}} the <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are slightly larger than the nominal value. For example a 3 mm dowel pin will range from 3.002 to 3.008. In the ISO 2338 standard the <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are slightly smaller - 3mm nominal range is 2.986 to 3.000. The terminology (e.g. [...] "oversized", [...] "standard") is not entirely consistent across suppliers.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Given that meticulous implant {{prosthodontic}} {{procedures are}} recommended {{to obtain the}} best possible intraoral fit, the die systems used for multi implant casts warrant further investigation. Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac precision die system, and Conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac precision die tray system, Pindex system, and conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional <b>Dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system however for Accu-trac precision die tray system, it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured.

5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint.

The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole.|$|R

30|$|The {{pairing of}} {{different}} isolates of X. polymorpha {{also created a}} significant number of zone lines. This result is somewhat surprising, as previous research indicated that isolates of X. polymorpha seldom manage to zone line wood internally, although it is completely capable of colonizing the wood [8, 11, 12]. There are several possible explanations for this effect. The addition of other fungi, whether those already inside the log, or simply the other isolate of X. polymorpha, may have stimulated antagonism and therefore also stimulated zone line production. It is also possible that the <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> inoculation forced internal zone line formation, as the fungus was not allowed to first colonize the external face before proceeding into the wood. Based upon the previous literature [3], this is the first instance in which X. polymorpha has produced {{a significant number of}} internal zone lines. As this fungus degrades wood at a much slower rate than T. versicolor or P. brumalis under controlled conditions [6, 13], its potential use in large-scale spalting will allow for similar zone line production to T. versicolor/S. cuboideum, without the potential for higher levels of white-rot decay.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{record of}} path of {{insertion}} on the dental cast {{is part of}} the dentist′s work authorization to the dental laboratory technician. The path of insertion record enables the dental technician to replace the cast on a surveyor in the same position that the dentist selected. Analysis of factors that influence the path of insertion should determine a path of insertion that will reduce the potential for dislodgement and promote stability of removable partial denture (RPD). Materials and Methods: The recording of the relation of a cast to a dental surveyor and the transfer of this relationship to the dental laboratory may be done by tripodization, by scoring the base of the cast, or by cementing a reference pin on the cast. Conclusion: Recording the established path of insertion can be difficult when the procedure uses a cemented pin and the casts are mounted in an articulator. This article describes a procedure for innovative <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> and sleeve device to record the path of insertion of RPDs, which serves the same purpose as the cemented pin but can be easily removed and replaced...|$|R

Current Connecting rods were used widely with <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> type or serration type. The fracture split method used for connecting rod is attracting attention as a mechanical method that can reduce production cost by decreasing the manufacturing processes. The Conventional micro alloyed steel {{can not be used}} for the fracture because of higher ductility. In this method powder metals and forged steel (C 70 S 6) are used.

50|$|Wooden pipes {{were used}} in London and {{elsewhere}} during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs, which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. They were often used in Montreal and Boston in the 1800s, and built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes, used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes, were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.|$|E
5000|$|Reamed {{holes are}} used to create holes of precise {{circularity}} and size, for example with tolerances of -0/+0.02 mm(.0008") This will allow the force fitting of locating <b>dowel</b> <b>pins,</b> which need not be otherwise retained in the body holding them. Other holes, reamed slightly larger in other parts, will fit these pins accurately, but not so tightly as to make disassembly difficult. This type of alignment is common in the joining of split crankcase halves such as are used in motorcycle motors and boxer type engines. After joining the halves, the assembled case may then be line bored (using what is in effect a large diameter reamer), and then disassembled for placement of bearings and other parts.

5000|$|When dowels are glued into blind holes, a {{very common}} case in dowel-based joinery, {{there must be a}} path for air and excess glue to escape when the dowel is pressed into place.

An old solution to this problem is to plane a flat {{on the side of the}} dowel; some sources suggest planing the flat on the rough stock before the final shaping of the round dowel. [...] Some dowel plates solve the problem by cutting a groove in the side of the dowel as it is forced through; this is done by a groove screw, a pointed screw intruding from the side into the dowel cutting opening.

The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate starter solenoid) - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two mounting bolts with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} wood value-added processes currently under development is spalting, where pigment is added to wood via fungal colonization. Previous studies have shown laboratory level spalting to be achievable and highly predictable. However, large-scale spalting for potential commercial applications introduces a substantial number of additional variables which impact the spalting process. To test the potential of commercial-scale spalting, Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Populus tremuloides logs were inoculated with multiple known spalting fungi utilizing both liquid spray cultures and live <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> cultures. Many of the fungi that successfully produce spalting in small, sterile cultures also produced significant amounts in large logs, with many spalting patterns identical to those found in small-scale testing. Pairings of Trametes versicolor/Scytalidium cuboideum and Xylaria polymorpha/Xylaria polymorpha (different isolates) produced significant amounts of zone lines. In addition, the method of inoculation impacted the amount of spalting: more zone lines were produced when fungi were introduced via plugs, while more stain was produced when liquid cultures were sprayed onto the logs. These results indicate that many of the standard spalting fungi are suitable for large-scale applications; however, the inoculation method appears to be a vital component for successful spalting under a restricted time schedule.|$|R
