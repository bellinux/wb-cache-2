30|$|Furthermore, {{based on}} our study, we {{identified}} several concerns that {{should be kept in}} mind while designing such systems. For instance, a hostile friend, who called/texted the target recently, may take advantage of this information to comprise the target’s account if the authentication session consists solely of call and SMS based questions. Therefore, asking multiple and different types of dynamic security questions is essential to enhance the strength and security of such system. Also, as different kinds of information on the smartphone involves varying levels of sensitivity (e.g., <b>contact</b> <b>names</b> vs. list of app installed), poorly designed dynamic security question can reveal a user’s privacy sensitive information over multiple iterations. For example, if phone call or SMS based questions are presented in multiple choice format, privacy sensitive information such as a user’s <b>contact</b> <b>names</b> can be revealed/exposed to others through that question. Thus, when designing dynamic security questions, each data type should be evaluated thoroughly to ensure privacy. Finally, in our study, while most users who exhibit high smartphone usage behavior for all data types, some users may exhibit low smartphone usage behavior, making it harder to generate certain question types.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of model, cover, copy, compare (MCCC), token system, and match to sample for teaching basic functional life skills with a middle age single student with disabilities. MCCC is a student-managed strategy that teaches discrete skills through errorless correction. Match to sample is another strategy that teaches how to identify and discriminate based on a visual representation of the identical information. The effectiveness of MCCC and match to sample was evaluated using a multiple baseline design. The results indicated that MCCC and match to sample was effective in teaching a single middle age school student with disabilities his name, phone number, home address, and emergency <b>contact</b> <b>name</b> and phone number. Maintenance of the basic functional life skills was also found; except for the emergency <b>contact</b> <b>name.</b> However, even if maintenance was not conducted on the final set, emergency phone number was maintained; this is attributed to the length of teaching sessions on the final set. The MCCC and match to sample interventions were both easy to implement and employ in the special education middle school classroom...|$|R
