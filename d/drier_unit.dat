40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, an {{experimental}} work was investigated on nanorefrigerant. Nano Al 2 O 3 -PAG oil {{was used as}} nano-refrigerant in R 134 a vapour compression refrigeration system. An experimental setup was designed and fabricated in the lab. The system performance was investigated using energy consumption test and freeze capacity test. The results indicate that Al 2 O 3 nano refrigerant works normally and safely in the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system performance was better than pure lubricant with R 134 a working fluid with 10. 32 % less energy used with 0. 2 %V of the concentration used. The results indicate that heat transfer coefficient increases with the usage of nano Al 2 O 3. Thus using Al 2 O 3 nanorefrigerant in refrigeration system {{is found to be}} feasible.

All test data were collated from the Bureau of Rural Road 6, the Department of Rural Roads, Thailand. The Ohio's and the modified Ohio's curves can predict satisfactorily the compaction curves of the fine-grained soils, and lateritic soils and crushed rocks {{consistent with the}} grade B of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) requirement. The CBR value of a specific soil {{is directly related to}} the relative <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight (the ratio of <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight to maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight, γd/γd,max). The field compaction result of a fine-grained soil at the optimum water content, OWC, shows that initially the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight increases rapidly with the number of roller passes and the relationship between <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and number of roller passes is represented by the logarithm function. Finally, the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight reaches a constant value, which is close to the laboratory maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight. Even with a large number of roller passes (compaction energy), the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight cannot be enhanced further because the soil state approaches the zero air void state. In practice, the excess roller pass is thus not economic. Based on the analysis of the test data, the field compaction procedure for road embankment and pavement constructions, which includes the material selection and the construction control, is suggested. It is useful in terms of both engineering and economic viewpoints...|$|R

Effects of adding proportionate quantities of {{two different types of}} shredded carpet waste fibers to clay soils (i. e., 1, 3, and 5 % by dry weight of the soil) were investigated and evaluated. The investigation was conducted on specimens prepared at their maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and optimum moisture content, as well on specimens prepared at variable conditions of <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content. A comparison was also made on specimens prepared at the same fiber content by changing <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight while moisture content was kept unchanged or by changing both <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content. The investigation revealed that inclusion of carpet waste fibers into clay soils prepared at the same <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight can significantly enhance the unconfined compression strength (UCS), reduce postpeak strength loss, and change the failure behavior from brittle to ductile. The results also showed that the relative benefit of fibers to increase the UCS of the clay soils is highly dependent on initial <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content of the soil.

A dynamic analysis, accounting for the increase in shear strength and stiffness due to matric suction in compacted soils, was used to predict DCPT results, which were then compared with DCP blow counts measured in the field.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{quality control}} presently {{relies on the}} determination of the in-place compacted <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight, which is then compared with the maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight obtained from a laboratory compaction test. INDOT requires that the in-place <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight for compacted soil be over 95 % of the laboratory maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight. In order to determine the in-place <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight, INDOT engineers generally use nuclear gauges, which are hazardous and also costly because of the required safety precautions. Thus, several alternative tests such as the Dynamic Cone Penetration Test (DCPT) and the Clegg Hammer Test (CHT) were introduced as testing tools for soil compaction quality control. However, no reliable correlations are available in the literature to employ these tests for soil compaction quality control. The main objectives of this research were to evaluate the use of the DCPT and the CHT results to develop criteria for soil compaction quality control. A number of DCPTs and CHTs was performed on Indiana road sites, in a test pit, and in the soil test chamber at Purdue University. Since soil compaction varies from place to place, a statistical approach was applied to account for the compaction variability {{in the development of the}} criteria for soil compaction quality control. Based on the DCP tests performed on several INDOT road sites, as well as in the test pit at Purdue University, and the requirement that the in-place <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight of the fill material be over 95 % of the laboratory maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight, minimum required DCP blow counts (NDCP) req were proposed for soils belonging to three groups of the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) soil classification system. For the DCPT, the minimum required blow count for 0 -to- 12 inch penetration, (NDCP) | 0 ~ 12 ” associated with an RC of 95 % for A- 3 soil varied from 7 to 10; it is a function of the coefficient of uniformity.

For silty clays, the minimum required blow counts, (NDCP) | 0 ~ 6 ” and (NDCP) | 6 ~ 12 ” were a function of the plasticity index and the soil percentage passing the # 40 sieve. Since the relationship of Clegg Impact Value (CIV) with relative compaction exhibited considerable variability, no criterion for CHT was proposed.

It is reported that 500, 000 tonnes of carpet waste fibre are plunged into landfills annually in the UK. In the United States of America, around 10 million tonnes of textile waste was generated in 2003. In geotechnical engineering, expansive clay soils are categorised as problematic soils due to their swelling behaviour upon increase in the moisture content. The problematic nature of such soils is intensified with the increase in the plasticity index. This paper presents results of a comprehensive investigation into utilisation of carpet waste fibres in order to improve the swelling characteristics of compacted cohesive soils. Therefore, two different clay soils with markedly different plasticity indices (i. e. 17. 0 and 31. 5 %) were treated with two different types of carpet waste fibre.

Soil specimens with different <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weights and moisture contents were prepared so as to the swelling behaviour of fibre reinforced compacted clays is completely attained under various scenarios.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 73 - 75). A total of 62 cohesiveness sands were tested to rographics. investigate the importance of the water content, grain size distribution, grading of the soil, particle shape, grain crushing during testing and laboratory compaction test method on the maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight during compaction. Three different laboratory compaction methods were used: 1) Standard Proctor', 2) Modified Proctor; and 3) Vibrating hammer. The effects of the grain size distribution, particle shape and laboratory compaction method were found to be the most important. The grain size distribution is represented by the coefficient of uniformity, whereas the particle shape is represented by the degree of roundness of the sand grains. The various laboratory compaction methods used in this study indicated the importance of vibration on the compaction of cohesiveness sands. The vibrating hammer compaction test method yielded consistently high values of the maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight over the complete range of tests.
