Success in <b>engagements</b> is more probable if the engaged firm has reputational concerns and higher capacity to implement changes.

50|$|IFYC’s Campus Partnerships {{department}} works {{directly with}} college {{faculty and staff}} to productively engage religious diversity on individual campuses. The organization offers three kinds of engagements: outreach <b>engagements,</b> deep <b>engagements,</b> and model campus <b>engagements.</b> Outreach <b>engagements,</b> which typically last one or two days, introduce campus staff to IFYC’s programs and methodology. With six-month to year-long deep <b>engagements,</b> IFYC staff work with campus staff to build a community “ecology” that supports interfaith cooperation by targeting one sector of campus life (e.g., the freshman class, the interfaith center, etc.). Through model campus <b>engagements,</b> schools work with IFYC for {{six months to a}} year to make their campus a model of interfaith cooperation.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the past and}} present of Canada-Botswana human rights <b>engagements,</b> offering an insight into their nature and significance. The article highlights that despite the absence of strong diplomatic ties between the two countries, there nonetheless have been significant human rights <b>engagements.</b> The <b>engagements,</b> though not entirely systematic or clearly defined in their focus, have certainly improved the human rights situation in Botswana. It is also noted that the sustainability of these <b>engagements</b> is questionable considering that the weak ties between the two countries have resulted in reduced Canadian funding to Botswana. In the end, the article emphasizes {{that there is a need}} to undertake extensive research on Canada-Botswana human rights <b>engagements.</b> This is so as to understand the nature and extent of the <b>engagements,</b> to measure their impact, and to use such research findings to inform future human rights <b>engagements...</b>|$|R

5|$|A typical McKinsey <b>engagement</b> {{can last}} {{between two and}} twelve months and {{involves}} three to six McKinsey consultants. An <b>engagement</b> is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E

40|$|Canada’s <b>engagements</b> with African {{states with}} regards to human rights began about five decades ago, and {{different}} countries in Africa have since benefited from such <b>engagements.</b> With Zambia specifically, such <b>engagements</b> have mainly centered along human rights issues. Recently, Canada has heavily invested in Zambia’s mining sector. This article explores Canada’s human rights <b>engagements</b> with Zambia. The article first reviews the economic performance of Zambia since its independence and the effect that this has had on the country. The article then looks at Canadian <b>engagements</b> with Zambia in terms of health, women’s rights, refugees’ rights and mining. It acknowledges that while Canada is {{actively involved in the}} advancement of human rights in Zambia, its <b>engagements</b> have not been as visible as those <b>engagements</b> undertaken by its sister Global North states/entities, such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, and the European Union. Nevertheless, the article acknowledges that the existence of this apparent gap {{may be due to the}} fact that there is not much visible literature detailing Canada’s aid relationship with Zambia. The article will thus assess the gaps in the literature in this regard and chart a future research agenda/path...|$|R

The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the <b>engagement,</b> with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E

40|$|This paper models {{management}} consultants' {{decisions about}} the order of client <b>engagements</b> when the consultant reduces clients' costs. The consultant can either immediately spread the innovation to all clients or sequentially spread the innovation to one client at a time. Licensing agreements, along with learning by doing, enhance the appeal of sequential <b>engagements</b> that delay the dissemination of innovation. However, concurrent <b>engagements,</b> or immediate dissemination, yield more clients who gain cost reductions for more periods. Whether the consultant finds that sequential or concurrent <b>engagements</b> optimal depends on her bargaining power and the magnitude of learning by doing. ...|$|R
