25|$|The {{research}} into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and {{it is recommended that}} use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If chlordiazepoxide is used during pregnancy the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include, abortion, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, <b>functional</b> <b>deficits,</b> carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Caution is also advised during breast feeding as chlordiazepoxide passes into breast milk.|$|E

40|$|Internet {{addiction}} disorder (IAD) is {{an impulse}} disorder {{or at least}} related to impulse control disorder. Deficits in executive functioning, including response monitoring, have been proposed as a hallmark feature of impulse control disorders. The error-related negativity (ERN) reflects individual’s ability to monitor behavior. Since IAD belongs to a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder, theoretically, it should present response monitoring <b>functional</b> <b>deficit</b> characteristics of some disorders, such as substance dependence, ADHD or alcohol abuse, testing with an Erikson flanker task. Up to now, no studies on response monitoring <b>functional</b> <b>deficit</b> in IAD were reported. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine whether IAD displays response monitoring <b>functional</b> <b>deficit</b> characteristics in a modified Erikson flanker task. 23 subjects were recruited as IAD group. 23 matched age, gender and education healthy persons were recruited as control group. All participants completed the modified Erikson flanker task while measured with event-related potentials (ERPs). IAD group made more total error rates than did controls (P < 0. 01); Reactive times for total error responses in IAD group were shorter than did controls (P < 0. 01). The mean ERN amplitudes of total error response conditions at frontal electrode sites and at central electrode sites of IAD group were reduced compared with control group (all P < 0. 01).

25|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the occurrence of hallucinations. When psychodynamic (Freudian) theories were popular in psychology, hallucinations were seen as a projection of unconscious wishes, thoughts, and wants. As biological {{theories have}} become orthodox, hallucinations are more often thought of (by psychologists at least) as being caused by <b>functional</b> <b>deficits</b> in the brain. With reference to mental illness, the function (or dysfunction) of the neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine {{are thought to be}} particularly important. The Freudian interpretation may have an aspect of truth, as the biological hypothesis explains the physical interactions in the brain, while the Freudian interpretation addresses the psychological complexes related to the content of the hallucination, such as hallucinating persecutory voices due to guilt. Psychological research has argued that hallucinations may result from biases in what are known as metacognitive abilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-operative}} {{assessment of}} patients has turned more patient-goal oriented. This {{means that the}} patients are asked to define their goals before surgery. In order to evaluate this the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was developed. This test {{is based on the}} World Health Organisation's framework of measuring health and disability: The International Classification of Function(ICF): This framework measures health and disability by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. <b>Functional</b> <b>deﬁcits</b> can be measured according to the level of loss of structure and function, the level of activity limitations, and the level of restriction in social participation. Reaching or gripping represents the integration of strength, sensation and range of motion, and therefore occur at the individual level rather than at the organ system level. For this reason, reaching and gripping are on the ICF level of activities. However, this level includes a broad range of activities, from basic activities (for example grasping and moving objects) to complex activities (such as dressing, grooming). It is useful to make a distinction between basic activities and complex activities.|$|E
25|$|Surgery may {{be carried}} out if {{conservative}} measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. <b>Functional</b> <b>deficits</b> of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E

25|$|The {{safety profile}} of {{clonazepam}} during pregnancy {{is less clear}} than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam may be a safer choice. The use of clonazepam during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the fetus. Caution is also required if clonazepam is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as clonazepam during pregnancy include: miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, <b>functional</b> <b>deficits,</b> floppy infant syndrome, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, restlessness, irritability, abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, tremors or jerking of the extremities, bradycardia, cyanosis, suckling difficulties, apnea, risk of aspiration of feeds, diarrhea and vomiting, and growth retardation. This syndrome can develop between 3 days to 3 weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which clonazepam is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If clonazepam is used during pregnancy or breast feeding, {{it is recommended that}} serum levels of clonazepam are monitored and that signs of central nervous system depression and apnea are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and avoidance of caffeine, can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.|$|E

2500|$|... the {{long-term}} effects of MDMA on human brain structure and function have not been fully determined. However, there is consistent evidence of structural and <b>functional</b> <b>deficits</b> in MDMA users with a high lifetime exposure. In contrast, {{there is no evidence of}} structural or functional changes in MDMA users with only a moderate (<50 doses used and <100 tablets consumed) lifetime exposure. MDMA use at high doses has been shown to produce brain lesions, a form of brain damage, in the serotonergic neural pathways of humans and animals. It is unclear if typical MDMA users may develop neurotoxic brain lesions. Long-term exposure to MDMA in humans has been shown to produce marked neurodegeneration in striatal, hippocampal, prefrontal, and occipital serotonergic axon terminals. Neurotoxic damage to serotonergic axon terminals has been shown to persist for more than two years. Elevations in brain temperature from MDMA use are positively correlated with MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. Adverse neuroplastic changes to brain microvasculature and white matter also occur in humans using low doses of MDMA. Reduced gray matter density in certain brain structures has also been noted in human MDMA users. Global reductions in gray matter volume, thinning of the parietal and orbitofrontal cortices, and decreased hippocampal activity have been observed in long term users. The effects established so far for recreational use of ecstasy lie in the range of moderate to large effects for SERT reduction.|$|E

Criteria for the inclusion in the study were forearm fractures of 3 / 4 forearm bone. Children with proximal forearm fractures (N= 45) were treated: conservative, manual reposition and immobilisation, primary operated within the first 24 hours n= 16, secundary within the first 12 days n= 11 after the fracture) and with distal forearm fractures (N= 39, conservative n= 14, primary operated n= 18, secundary operated n= 7). All patients with proximal and 31 patients with distal forearm fractures were treated with physiotherapy. We recorded immobilisation time, duration of physiotherapy and complete therapy. Functional improvement or deficite was assessed according «neutral- 0 -test«, degree of elbow, wrist movement and rotation of forearm. There were significant differences between primary and conservative treatment for proximal forearm fractures in duration of immobilisation (median 20 days, range 18 - 24, vs median 49 days, range 30 - 58, respectively, p< 0. 05), all therapy (median 28 days, range 22 - 35, median 74 days range 63 - 81, respectively, p< 0. 05).
