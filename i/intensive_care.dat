5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> beds were available {{in all of the}} hospitals surveyed, and these were only found in major hospitals.

40|$|<b>Intensive</b> and {{critical}} <b>care</b> nursing is a speciality {{in its own}} right and with its own nature within the nursing profession. This speciality poses its own demands for nursing competencies. <b>Intensive</b> {{and critical}} <b>care</b> nursing is focused on severely ill patients and their significant others. The patients are comprehensively cared for, constantly monitored and their vital functions are sustained artificially. The main goal is to win time to cure the cause of the patient’s situation or illness. The purpose of this empirical study was i) to describe and define competence and competence requirements in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing, ii) to develop a basic measurement scale for competence assessment in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing for graduating nursing students, and iii) to describe and evaluate graduating nursing students’ basic competence in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing by seeking the reference basis of self-evaluated basic competence in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing from ICU nurses. However, the main focus of this study was on the outcomes of nursing education in this nursing speciality. The study was carried out in different phases: basic exploration of competence (phase 1 and 2), instrumentation of competence (phase 3) and evaluation of competence (phase 4). Phase 1 (n= 130) evaluated graduating nursing students’ basic biological and physiological knowledge and skills for working in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> with Basic Knowledge Assessment Tool version 5 (BKAT- 5, Toth 2012). Phase 2 focused on defining competence in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing with the help of literature review (n= 45 empirical studies) as well as competence requirements in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing with the help of experts (n= 45 experts) in a Delphi study. In phase 3 the scale <b>Intensive</b> and Critical <b>Care</b> Nursing Competence Scale (ICCN-CS) was developed and tested twice (pilot test 1 : n= 18 students and n= 12 nurses; pilot test 2 : n= 56 students and n= 54 nurses). Finally, in phase 4, graduating nursing students’ competence was evaluated with ICCN-CS and BKAT version 7 (Toth 2012). In order to develop a valid assessment scale of competence for graduating nursing students and to evaluate and establish the competence of graduating nursing students, empirical data were retrieved at the same time from both graduating nursing students (n= 139) and ICU nurses (n= 431). Competence can be divided into clinical and general professional competence. It can be defined as a specific knowledge base, skill base, attitude and value base and experience base of nursing and the personal base of an <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nurse. Personal base was excluded in this self-evaluation based scale. The ICCN-CS- 1 consists of 144 items (6 sum variables). Finally, it became evident that the experience base of competence is not a suitable sum variable in holistic <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> competence scale for graduating nursing students because of their minor experience in this special nursing area. ICCN-CS- 1 is a reliable and tolerably valid scale for use among graduating nursing students and ICU nurses Among students, basic competence of <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing was self-rated as good by 69 %, as excellent by 25 % and as moderate by 6 %. However, graduating nursing students’ basic biological and physiological knowledge and skills for working in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> were poor. The students rated their clinical and professional competence as good, and their knowledge base and skill base as moderate. They gave slightly higher ratings for their knowledge base than skill base. Differences in basic competence emerged between graduating nursing students and ICU nurses. The students’ self-ratings of both their basic competence and clinical and professional competence were significantly lower than the nurses’ ratings. The students’ self-ratings of their knowledge and skill base were also statistically significantly lower than nurses’ ratings. However, both groups reported the same attitude and value base, which was excellent. The strongest factor explaining students’ conception of their competence was their experience of autonomy in nursing. Conclusions: Competence in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing is a multidimensional concept. Basic competence in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing can be measured with self-evaluation based scale but alongside should be used an objective evaluation method. Graduating nursing students’ basic competence in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing is good but their knowledge and skill base are moderate. Especially the biological and physiological knowledge base is poor. Therefore in future in <b>intensive</b> and critical <b>care</b> nursing education should be focused on both strengthening students’ biological and physiological knowledge base and on strengthening their overall skill base. Practical implications are presented for nursing education, practice and administration. In future, research should focus on education methods and contents, mentoring of clinical practice and orientation programmes as well as further development of the scale...|$|R
