However, continuous monitoring of non-adhering single cells is still hindered by the limited availability of systems for precise manipulation and retention of cells at a desired location. Flow cytometry {{is one of the}} most widely used techniques to characterize non-adhering cells, however, its inability to follow the response of single cells in time is a major drawback 1. Here we describe an application of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) based digital microfluidic (DMF) chip 2, as a platform for trapping of non-adhering cells in an array of microwells. Consequently, the single cell response to a drug incubation can be monitored with a spatio-temporal resolution in an automatic way. The scheme of DMF device for trapping single yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is illustrated in Fig. 1. The device consists of two parallel glass plates, namely the actuation plate and <b>grounding</b> <b>plate</b> (Fig. 1 a). An array consisting of 22000 microwells (5 µm wide and 3 µm deep) was fabricated in the Teflon layer of the <b>grounding</b> <b>plate</b> 3. The microwells have hydrophilic bottom and hydrophobic sidewalls (Fig. 1 a,inset). In order to trap yeast cells, the cell droplet was transported over the array for multiple times, referred to as seeding cycles (Fig. 1 a), resulting in entrapment of single cells in femtoliter droplets in the microwells. These spatially confined cells were then subjected to antifungal treatments (Fig. 1 b) and the viability of single cells using the viability dye Propidium Iodide (PI) was monitored with time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 1 c). The cell’s response upon treatment with various concentrations of amphotericin B (AmB), a cell membrane permeabilizing antifungal drug that also induces programmed cell death at certain doses 4, was studied over a period of 6 hours during which viability of the cells was monitored every 15 minutes. We found a dose-dependent increase of the number of PI-positive cells (dead cells) over time. The maximum number of dead cells for each AmB dose was reached after approx. 270 min of incubation (Fig. 2). Treating the cells with higher AmB doses (> 50 µM) did not result in 100 % PI-positive staining of cells. Only upon UV treatment, all cells stained PI-positive, indicating complete cell death of the culture. This result indicates that a subpopulation of the yeast culture treated with AmB is PI-negative, indicative for increased AmB tolerance or programmed cell death. Cells dying via programmed cell death or apoptosis are typically characterized by PI-negative staining as the cell membrane is still intact. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time, an EWOD based DMF device-enabling spatial isolation of single non-adhering yeast cells and their subsequent cytotoxicity read-out upon drug treatment. Our system allows efficient monitoring of cellular response over a period of time. Research focused on elucidating kinetics of cell responses to drug stimuli and screening for novel antifungals is addressed with this novel digital microfluidic platform. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{powerful}} and automated fluorescence imaging techniques, in depth characterization of bacteria has become feasible. Although phenotypic screening is possible with the existing techniques, retrieval of interesting bacteria from a larger population for their subsequent analysis is still challenging. Moreover, the handling of such small cells suffers from low throughput and high manual work. Hence, novel technologies are required for capturing, isolating and subsequently analyzing single cells in a high throughput context. Within the MeBioS Biosensor group, an innovative approach for conducting high throughput time-lapse studies on single non-adherent cells has been recently demonstrated, based on digital microfluidic platform (DMF). In the current work, we present an application of the adapted system, expanded with optical-tweezers 3, for capturing and releasing magnetic bead-coupled single bacterial cells from a microwell. The microfluidic chip consists of (i) a <b>grounding</b> <b>plate</b> containing an array of 62, 500 microwells (4 µm wide and 3 µm deep) and (ii) an actuation plate containing an array of electrodes. For obtaining suitable bacteria capturing efficiency, tosyl-activated superparamagnetic beads were conjugated with anti-Salmonella Typhimurium IgG 1 at different antibody concentrations. By performing automated actuations, the microwells were seeded with antibody-functionalized-superparamagnetic beads, followed by an on-chip incubation of the beads with Salmonella cells. The array was then washed five times to remove unbound bacteria. A bacteria capturing efficiency of 48 % was obtained for an antibody concentration of 0. 24 µg/µl. To test the specificity of bacteria capturing, control samples with no-antibody-conjugated superparamagnetic beads were tested, {{which resulted in a}} capturing efficiency of less than 0. 04 %. For retrieving bacteria bound magnetic beads, an IR optical-tweezers setup was built and the optimal buffer condition was determined for optically levitating the beads. As a proof of concept, bacteria bound to magnetic beads were optically retrieved from one microwell, transported and seeded in another empty microwell. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time, a DMF platform enabled spatial isolation and selective retrieval of single non-adhering cells bound to magnetic beads using optical tweezers. Research focused on screening and selection of single cells within a large population, and identification of their genetic makeup is addressed with this novel digital microfluidic platform. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{fungal infections}} (IFIs), such as candidemia and {{invasive}} aspergillosis, {{are a major}} threat to immunocompromised patients and patients with respiratory disorders. IFIs are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and are mainly caused by Candida spp. The latter are increasingly associated with medical device-related infections, as they can form biofilms on the surface of for instance catheters, orthopaedic implants and implantable electronic devices (such as cardiovascular pacemakers). C. albicans biofilm cells are resistant towards a broad range of antifungal drugs and current treatment options for fungal biofilm-related infections are limited. To date, only miconazole, caspofungin, anidulafungin and liposomal formulations of amphotericin B are effective against these biofilms. Moreover, treatment with these antifungal drugs can result in severe side effects, including hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Hence, {{there is a need for}} novel antifungal treatment options. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are of great interest in the search for novel therapeutics, as their multiple modes of action reduce the ability of microorganisms to develop resistance. Moreover, antifungal AMPs are characterized by fungicidal activity and induce rapid killing of a range of microorganisms. One particular family of such AMPs are plant defensins. Plant defensins are in general nontoxic to human cells, as they specifically target fungal membrane compounds, and were shown to induce production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in C. albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and/or other fungi. A first aim in this research project was to further elucidate the mechanisms of action of three antifungal plant defensins, i. e. HsAFP 1, RsAFP 2 and AtPDF 2. 3, using C. albicans and S. cerevisiae as models. Insight in the mechanisms of action of these defensins and elucidation of the tolerance mechanisms used by fungal pathogens to resist their action will improve our understanding on how to effectively kill these pathogens. In this work, the antibiofilm potential of HsAFP 1 and RsAFP 2 was investigated towards C. albicans biofilms. Both HsAFP 1 and RsAFP 2 can prevent formation of C. albicans biofilms, however, they cannot eradicate them. Further structure-activity relationship analysis of HsAFP 1 revealed the importance of the γ-core and adjacent regions in antibiofilm activity. This is the first report on plant defensins possessing antibiofilm activity. Next, the ion channel inhibitory activity of AtPDF 2. 3 was investigated, as in silico analysis revealed that the AtPDF 2. 3 amino acid sequence carries a partial toxin signature. The latter was previously assigned to scorpion toxins active on ion channels. Electrophysiological recordings indicated that this plant defensin blocks potassium channels in a similar way as scorpion toxins. In S. cerevisiae, AtPDF 2. 3 antifungal action triggers activation of a tolerance mechanism involving potassium transport and/or homeostasis. As such, a link was found between potassium channel inhibitory activity and antifungal activity involving potassium transport and/or homeostasis. The second aim of this project was to further unravel the mechanism of action of the conventional antifungal drug amphotericin B, and as such improve our understanding of amphotericin B-induced killing. Amphotericin B interacts with ergosterol in the fungal membrane, which ultimately leads to fungal cell death. However, information on amphotericin B-induced events leading to fungal cell death is very limited. Several reports already indicated the importance of analysing cellular heterogeneity with respect to dynamic cell responses towards various stimuli, which hinted us to also investigate amphotericin B-induced events with spatiotemporal resolution. To this end, a novel digital microfluidic (DMF) platform for single cell analysis of S. cerevisiae cells was developed and implemented. This device allows for monitoring cells with spatiotemporal resolution, which is not possible using bulk methods. In a first instance, a proof of concept for using the DMF platform to monitor membrane permeabilization in yeast cells during antifungal treatment with amphotericin B was designed. The device was validated by comparing results obtained on the DMF platform with those obtained in bulk by flow cytometry. Similar results were found for both experimental designs, and therefore, the DMF device was found suitable for single cell analysis of yeast cells during antifungal treatment. Further research focused on investigating the role of superoxide and nitric oxide radicals in amphotericin B’s fungicidal action. Superoxide radicals were found to be important in amphotericin B’s fungicidal action, whereas nitric oxide radicals seem to mediate a tolerance mechanism toward this agent. In addition, a detailed kinetic study revealed that inhibition of nitric oxide radical production increases and accelerates superoxide radical production, membrane permeabilization and loss of reproduction capacity in yeast. In summary, the results of this doctoral research contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of and the tolerance mechanisms to HsAFP 1, RsAFP 2, AtPDF 2. 3 and amphotericin B. For the first time, plant defensins were reported to have antibiofilm activity, thereby expanding the knowledge on plant defensin biological activities. Furthermore, this thesis describes plant defensins as potential novel antifungal lead molecule for further development into novel antifungal and/or antibiofilm drugs to combat fungal infections. In addition, it demonstrates the use of a novel DMF platform in the identification of compounds’ mechanisms of action and characterization of potential synergistic interactions.

40|$|An {{optical sensor}} system is {{described}} which is particularly {{well suited for}} medical point-of-care diagnostics. The system allows {{for all kinds of}} immunochemical assay formats and consists of a disposable sensor chip and an optical readout device. The chip is built up from a <b>ground</b> and cover <b>plate</b> with in- and outlet and, between, of an adhesive film with a capillary aperture of 50 mu m. The <b>ground</b> <b>plate</b> serves as a solid phase for the immobilization of biocomponents, In the readout device, an evanescent held is generated at the surface of the <b>ground</b> <b>plate</b> by total internal reflection of a laser beam. This field is used for the excitation of fluorophor markers. The generated fluorescence light is detected by a simple optical setup using a photomultiplier tube. Because of the evanescent field excitation, washing or separation steps can be avoided. With this system the pregnancy hormone chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) could be determined in human serum with a detection limit of 1 ng/mL, Recovery values were 86, 106, and 102 % for 5, 50, and 100 ng/mL hCG, respectively. The SD in repeated measurements (n = 10) was 5. 6 %, Furthermore, the feasibility of the system in competitive-type immunoassays was demonstrated for serum theophylline. A linear calibration curve of signal vs theophylline between 1 and 50 mg/L was obtained. Recovery values varied between 118 % (10 mg/L) and 81. 0 % (20 mg/L) ...|$|R

The trains had no mechanical connection to represent the occurring situation of virtual coupling. The experiments were conducted at a Reynolds number of 240, 000 at 4 m/s.

5000|$|To control volume, the performer's {{other hand}} {{acts as the}} <b>grounded</b> <b>plate</b> of another {{variable}} capacitor. As in the tone circuit, {{the distance between the}} performer's hand and the volume control antenna determines the capacitance and hence natural resonant frequency of an LC circuit inductively coupled to another fixed LC oscillator circuit operating at a slightly higher resonant frequency. When a hand approaches the antenna, the natural frequency of that circuit is lowered by the extra capacitance, which detunes the oscillator and lowers its resonant plate current.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{nonlinear}} elliptic problem ∆u = λf(x) (1 +u) 2 on a bounded domain Ω of R N with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This equation models a simple electrostatic Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) device {{consisting of a}} thin dielectric elastic membrane with boundary supported at 0 above a rigid <b>ground</b> <b>plate</b> located at − 1. When a voltage –represented here by λ – is applied, the membrane deflects towards the <b>ground</b> <b>plate</b> and a snap-through may occur when it exceeds a certain critical value λ ∗ (pull-in voltage). This creates a so-called “pull-in instability ” which greatly affects the design of many devices. The mathematical model lends to a nonlinear parabolic problem for the dynamic deflection of the elastic membrane which will be considered in a forthcoming paper [15]. Here, {{we focus on the}} stationary equation and on estimates for λ ∗ in terms of material properties of the membrane, which can be fabricated with a spatially varying dielectric permittivity profile f. Applying analytical and numerical techniques, we establish upper and lower bounds for λ ∗ in terms of the volume and shape of the domain, the dimension of the ambient space, as well as the permittivity profile. We analyze the first branch o...|$|R

50|$|As stated above, ESPs {{work best}} under normal {{resistivity}} conditions. Particles with normal resistivity do not rapidly lose their charge on {{arrival at the}} collection electrode. These particles slowly leak their charge to <b>grounded</b> <b>plates</b> and are retained on the collection plates by intermolecular adhesive and cohesive forces. This allows a particulate layer to be built up and then dislodged from the plates by rapping. Within the range of normal dust resistivity (between 107 and 2 x 1010 ohm-cm), fly ash is collected more easily than dust having either low or high resistivity.|$|R

Vertically suspended discharge electrode wires are located between the plates. As a gas stream, often discharged from an industrial process, flows through the precipitator, air particulates are ionized by the electrode wire. The ionized particles then are attracted to the positively <b>grounded</b> <b>plate,</b> creating a layer of caked on dust particles. Rappers are responsible for Transmitting vibrations to the electrodes causing deposited dust particles to break loose and fall into a hopper located below the precipitator.|$|R
