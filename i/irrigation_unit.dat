The study aimed to analyze the effect of service pressures in the distribution uniformity of drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>units</b> applying treated wastewater from cashew nut industry. The experiment was conducted in split-split plots scheme having the service pressures (70, 140, 210 and 280 kPa) on parcels, the emitters models (G 1, G 2 and G 3) on subplots and the evaluation periods (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160 h of operation of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>units)</b> on subsubplots.

Within the floodplain, there are distinct patterns of poverty and livelihood dynamics in areas associated with different approaches to land ownership and irrigation management. Over the last ten years, poverty has jumped to over 40 % in an area controlled by the National Irrigation Board (NIB), increased slowly in smallholder mixed farming areas, and remained relatively stable in areas supported by the Provincial <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Unit</b> (PIU). The National Irrigation Board approach has been dominated by government agencies, leaving farmers with almost no discretion over their land use decisions.

40|$|As {{the year}} 2050 approaches, the world {{population}} will reach 9 billion - {{so does the}} challenge of doubling crop yields. To meet this crop yields demand, the associated dramatic improving of water productivity (WP) must necessarily be accompanied by maximization of water use efficiency (WUE) (Ragab 2011, UNEP 2014). In this work, a recently developed software (IrriLab, [URL] moving in this direction is presented. IrriLab is a very simple toll allows to design microirrigation unit optimizing WUE, pressure energy and <b>irrigation</b> <b>unit</b> costs. Irrigation software available in commerce provide microirrigation system designs, by mainly looking at the maximum flow rate uniformity criteria. Thus, each emitter installed along the laterals operates with an operating pressure head occurring in between an established range of pressure head variability (Dh < Dhadm). However, the latter condition does not always corresponds to the cheapest and to the maximizing WUE solution; in fact, it is not assured if {{the entire range of}} the admitted pressure head is profited and used by the emitters. IrriLab allows this occurrence because, for the entire <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Unit</b> Area, IUA, each design solution assures that at least two emitters rigorously operates, one with the minimum admitted pressure head, and the other one with the maximum admitted (Dh = Dhadm), (Baiamonte et al., 2015; Baiamonte, 2016). The same extreme values of pressure head are those that in the common design criteria delimit the range of pressure head, but without assuring their achievement. Compared to the common design criteria, this condition i) for fixed laterals’ length and inside diameter, allows reducing the inlet required pressure head whereas, ii) for fixed pressure head at the inlet, provides an increasing in laterals and manifold lengths and in the associated IUA. Based on analytical solutions, IrriLab follows a very simple rectangular sketch, any way oriented in the space, and defined by two slope values, one for the laterals and one for the manifold. By considering the possible combinations of i) horizontal, downward or upward sloped laterals and manifold, ii) the manifold position in respect to the laterals and iii) the inlet position in respect to the manifold, which can be equal to 0...|$|E

40|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the socioeconomic impact of canal side plantation on the sustainable livelihood of local communities in the study area. Two types of data was collected for this research, namely primary and secondary data. The secondary data was collected from the archive of the Forests National Corporation (FNC) and relevant studies, while the primary data was collected through different methods; interviews with 91 respondents, semi-structural interviews with government officials from the FNC and <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Unit</b> of Gezira Scheme, and observation and experience of the researcher. Moreover, mensurational data was collected for the calculation of the volumes and stocking densities of trees in canal side plantation. Gezira Scheme was selected as study area for this research where the intervention of canal side plantation is practice at a large scale. Please purchase PDFcamp Printer on [URL] to remove this watermark. The main findings of the research are; although all age groups are participating in the canal side plantation, the majority of them are old people with little representation of the youth. This result confronts the sustainability of the intervention in the study area. The intervention of canal side plantation is autonomous (locally driven), the local people in one side started protecting their wild trees around the irrigational canal and the intervention adopted latter by other villages in the study area. The canal side plantations are managed by the local people under close supervision of the FNC which provides training and extension services. Village committee is the responsible body for the management of the plantations. Selection of the members of the village committee is base on general consensus or election of the members. Time of tree harvesting is base on ocular observation of the volume of the trees and the urgent needs of the community. The intervention of canal side plantation provides satisfactory financial returns which are exploited in rural development through maintenance and establishment of public services in the study area. Moreover, the local people perceive the social and environmental benefits gained from the adoption of canal side plantation like protection against dust storms, reduction of malaria and bilharzias incidences in the study area. Always there are conflicts regarding canal side plantation between the local people and the <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Unit</b> of Gezira Scheme from one side and between the local people and the FNC. All the conflicts are cause by the financial returns from the intervention. The local people suggested some proposals for the improvement of the activity. The main conclusions drawn from this study are; extension services can easily be delivered in the study area since the majority of the respondents are literate capable of following instructions and interpret any symbols. Since the intervention is autonomous, this indicates the creativity of the local people in dealing with their surrounding environment. The local people showed their potentiality in managing the canal side plantation satisfactorily and protecting them against offences and animals. Moreover, the FNC was able to sensitize and mobilize the local people to participate in the activity of canal side plantation and organize themselves into working group (village committee for managing the plantations. The main recommendations drawn from this study area; there is an urgent need for coordination between the FNC and the <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Unit</b> of Gezira Scheme and the local people in the study area for sake of sustaining the intervention of canal side plantation, and the importance of delivering extension massages systematically, instead of sporadic visits, in the different silvicultural treatments...|$|E

A new system for intracolonic cleansing has been developed, which includes a disposable catheter device that is inserted through the working channel of a standard colonoscope and an <b>irrigation</b> <b>unit</b> with predefined pressure and flow rate. The aim {{of the current study}} was to assess the safety and efficacy of this novel system for the improvement of bowel cleansing during colonoscopy. A total of 42 patients with suboptimal bowel preparation were systematically allocated, in a 1 : 1 ratio, to either the study group (JetPrep system, n= 21) or the control group (syringe irrigation, n = 21). The cleansing efficacy was evaluated using a segmental scoring scale to rate the bowel preparation level before and after irrigation. One patient from the study groupwas excluded from the efficacy analysis due to treatment with both techniques. The JetPrep system was significantly superior to syringe irrigation (P= 0. 0001). No adverse events were reported.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a large pistachio farm in Madera County, California, to assess the spatial variability in water status and irrigation needs by using high-resolution thermal imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial system. We determined the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) of two fields, 130 ha each, based on canopy temperature measurements of individual tree crowns, thus assessing the spatial variations in tree water status within each field. The CWSI of each potential management unit (sectors encompassing about 175 trees) was then calculated and related to the days since last irrigation (DSLI) in F 1 and F 2. The relationship between CWSI and DSLI was established to calculate the average CWSI corresponding to the whole area that was irrigated on the same day. This value was afterward compared with the actual CWSI value of each management unit as a proxy of the spatial variability in CWSI. This information was used to calculate the deviation of each <b>irrigation</b> <b>unit</b> from the fixed irrigation schedule for the whole fields. Our results show that it is feasible to use high-resolution thermal imagery for integrating the crop response in irrigation performance assessment and for providing recommendations at the farm scale.

In addition, applied water volume is used controlled operating the valve during a calculated time interval, and assuming constant flow rate. In general, a pressure regulating valve PRV is the commonly used pressure regulating device in a hydrant, which, also, executes the open and close function. A hydrant feeds several <b>irrigation</b> <b>units,</b> requiring a wide range in flow rate.

Ideal PRV performance would maintain a constant downstream pressure. However, the true performance depends on both upstream pressure and the discharged flow rate. The objective of this work is to asses the influence of the performance on the applied volume during the whole irrigation events in a year. The results of the study have been obtained introducing the flow rate into a PRV model. Variations on flow rate are simulated by taking into account the consequences of variations on climate conditions and also decisions in irrigation operation, such us duration and frequency application.

Plot scale field trials {{were set up}} on a railway embankment batter on the Laleham branch near Blackwater as part of HEFRAIL Project. The embankment at this site exhibited considerable tunnel (piping) erosion on the top access road and the batters {{as a result of}} the formation being strongly sodic and moderately saline. Hence the shoulder of the embankment had to be reconstructed. The erosion control strategies on the plots were centred on control (doing nothing after surface preparation), limited use of erosion control blankets and waste ballast as mulch on seeded plots. It has been demonstrated that with a cost effective irrigation system, 100 % grass cover establishment on railway batters is achievable within 12 weeks. 100 % grass cover reduces erosion by over 90 % compared with the bare scenario. The cost of the 25 different treatments imposed at this site varied $ 2. 621 m² and $ 4. 11 /m², including an irrigation cost of $ 1. 68 /m². The shoulder reconstruction cost of $ 3. 27 /m² is additional.

40|$|Existing {{technologies}} have been tailored to deliver cost-effective irrigation on a railway embankment and excavated steep slopes (referred to as batters) within a semiarid environment. Irrigation is {{to aid the}} establishment of 100 % grass coter {{within a few weeks}} to mitigate soil erosion problems. It is based on water sourced from a temporary excavated pond plus the use of a solar powered pump and a drip irrigation system. Railway batter erosion remediation is timed for the wet summer season when irrigation can be used to supplement natural rainfall. For a given irrigation demand and catchment area, critical (minimum) pond volume is estimated from regional charts developed for ungauged catchments [...] About 20 % of the critical volume is added to account for evaporation losses and dead storage. Also, seepage losses need to be considered if the soil is medium to coarse textured and if the pond is not lined with an impermeable material. Initial results are very encouraging with a cost estimate of ~ ~ $ 2. 7 4 o/fm b~att er aea treated (irrigated). <b>Irrigation</b> <b>unit</b> cost is expected to decrease with a larger scale irrigated batter area and the refinement of technologies and installation procedures.

The site of Werribee South, Victoria, Australia is a market garden production region on the outer fringes of Melbourne, between two major cities, Melbourne and Geelong.

40|$|While {{community-based}} {{natural resource}} management projects have acquired increasing {{importance in the}} last decade, the notion of ‘community’ that is implicit in them has been subject to critique {{on a number of}} grounds. It is this that forms the starting point for my dissertation. ^ This dissertation starts by discussing the diverse forms that ‘the community’ takes in three different water projects in the state of Maharashtra in western India. For instance, the community could be either an administrative unit or an ecological unit or an <b>irrigation</b> <b>unit,</b> and each of these has different equity and sustainability implications. The three cases also differ in the kind of internal characteristics they possess and how these contribute to decentralized sustainable development. Furthermore, while reified notions of the community serve a strategic purpose in one water project, in general, utopian notions of communities could lead to lack of acknowledgement of the interaction between the community and other institutions such as markets, with the result that an important arena of influencing equity is lost. ^ Secondly, a study of three kinds of equities within the three communities—equities in rule content, process of rule-making and outcomes, reveals that the redistributive potential of water is realized only to a limited extent. The different equities are inter-related and depend on a variety of factors such as ideological motivation of the actors, the kind of water source, the prior internal organization present, the legal validity of the institutional arrangements {{and the nature of the}} leadership. Equity in content is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for equity in outcome. But equity in rule-making is the most critical—it is needed for implementation, to ensure continued equity in content and outcome, and to provide flexibility to use unexpected opportunities for changes in equity. ^ Thirdly, I discuss the role that the state can play in further facilitating community-based sustainable development efforts. For instance, the state can use legislation for a clearer constitution of the unit of the community, as well as facilitate equity by influencing the decision-making rules that associations involved in water projects follow. ...|$|E
40|$|Two upper North Bosque River {{segments}} {{were designated}} as impaired in 1998 due to point source and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution of phosphorus (P) to these {{segments of the}} watershed. As a result, two Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) were applied which called for the reduction of annual loading and annual average soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations by about 50 %. Under Clean Water Act (Section 319 (h)), a new technologies demonstration project {{was funded by the}} USEPA Region 6 and administered by the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board (TSSWCB) for reducing water pollution associated with dairy animal production systems. As part of this demonstration, the efficacy of a prospective new technology (i. e. L 4 DB? microbial treatment system) was evaluated, which may aid dairy farmers in reducing P from lagoon effluent. In many cases, this effluent is applied to waste application fields (WAFs) as irrigation water; thus reducing P in the effluent can have a direct impact on NPS pollution in the watershed. Beginning in May 2006 a dairy?s anaerobic lagoon was treated with L 4 DB? microbes at an average application rate of 65 gallons (246 L) of microbial solution/month for a period of 12 months. Lagoon samples were collected monthly or bi-monthly from two different profiles: lagoon supernatant (LS, sampled from top of the liquid level to 2 ft (61 cm) depth) and lagoon profile (LP, sampled from the entire depth of the lagoon) using a sludge judge (a sampling tube with a check valve at the bottom to take lagoon sample at different depths). For each LP and LS, 30 samples (3 samples per location ? 10 locations) were collected during each sampling event. A set of 15 LP and 15 LS samples were mixed separately to get two composites of each for nutrients including P, solids, pH, conductivity and metals. In addition, 60 samples of lagoon effluent (hereafter IR) used to irrigate a nearby pasture were collected bi-monthly from a riser located just upstream from the big gun <b>irrigation</b> <b>unit.</b> Fifteen IR subsamples were grouped together to get four IR composite samples. The IR composite samples were also analyzed for the above mentioned physical and chemical constituents. L 4 DB? microbial treatment reduced average sludge depth by 24 % as compared to its pre-treatment level (however, this reduction was 16 %, when sludge measurement anomaly in August 2006 was excluded). The microbial treatment also reduced averaged total solids (TS) and total suspended solids (TSS) by 43 and 45 %, respectively, for the LP, and 60 and 71 %, respectively, for LS. Conversely, these values increased by 124 % for IR effluent over times. This microbial treatment system was effective in reducing average total phosphorus (TP) by 27 and 52 % for the LP and LS, respectively, but not effective in reducing TP concentration for IR effluent. Overall, no clear soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) reduction trends were observed for any sampling locations. Similar to the effect on TP, the L 4 DB? treatment was effective in reducing total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) from the LP (36 %) and LS (48 %), but not effective in reducing potassium (K) for LP and LS. No clear trend of reducing these nutrients from IR effluent was observed over time. This microbial treatment system was effective in reducing metals concentration as well. The average concentration reductions of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, and Mn for LP were over 50 %, while the reduction seen in Mg was only 22 %. Similarly, the concentration reductions observed in LS samples were over 60 % for the same suite of elements while Mg was reduced by about 42 %. No clear metal concentration reduction trends were observed for IR effluent. As a result, it can be inferred that most of these solids, nutrients, and metal reductions were likely due to microbial treatment, dilution of lagoon slurry by excessive rain and runoff as well as settling of dead and degraded bacterial mass accumulated at the bottom of lagoon. Additional measurements of lagoon sludge accumulation rate and constituents are warranted to assess possible increase in nutrients and solids due to accelerated solids settling and increased accumulation of microbial mass at the lagoon bottom...|$|E

Remote sensing-derived indicators could be suitable for mapping water stress over large areas, and recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} high resolution airborne thermal imagery enables the assessment of discontinuous canopies as pure tree crowns can be targeted, thus eliminating the background effects. Airborne campaigns were conducted over a drip-irrigated commercial orchard in Southwestern Spain composed of five different orchard tree crops. An unmanned aerial vehicle with a thermal camera onboard was flown three times during the day on 8 July 2010, at 9, 11 and 13 h (local time). Stem water potential was measured at the same time of the flights. In some <b>irrigation</b> <b>units,</b> <b>irrigation</b> was stopped prior to the measurement date to induce water deficits for comparative purposes. Several approaches for using the thermal data were proposed. Daily evolution of the differential between canopy and air temperature (T c - T a) was compared to tree water status. The slope of the evolution of T c - T a with time was well correlated with water status and is proposed as a novel indicator linked with the stomatal behavior. The Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) was calculated with the temperature data from the 13. 00 h flight using an empirical approach for defining the upper and lower limits of T c - T a. The assessment of variability in water status was also performed using differences in relative canopy temperatures. Ample variability was detected among and within <b>irrigation</b> <b>units,</b> demonstrating that the approach proposed was viable for precision irrigation management. The assessment led to the identification of water-stressed areas, and to the definition of threshold CWSI values and associated risks. Such thresholds may be used by growers for irrigation management based on crop developmental stages and economic considerations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} recover the flow rate of clogged drippers with {{different}} doses and permanence times of the product MaxBio. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design in split-split-plot scheme, where the plots corresponded to product doses (80, 160, 240 and 320 mg L- 1), subplots to the applied treatments (T 1 - without biological treatment, T 2 - 1 st application of the product, and T 3 - 2 nd application of the product) and in sub-subplots the types of emitters (Plastro Hydrodrip Super, Netafim Tiran and Netafim PCJ-CNJ), with three replicates. The four <b>irrigation</b> <b>units</b> operated with treated domestic wastewater for 400 h in order to clog the emitters. After applying the product MaxBio, the flow rate of the drippers and the relative flow rate reduction were determined to express the unclogging levels. There was significant effect of T 2 and T 3 on {{the recovery of the}} flow rate of the drippers, while for the reduction of relative flow rate, the doses of the product did not show statistical difference regarding the types of drippers...|$|R
50|$|On December 19, 1964, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Azotea Tunnel, the main water tunnel for the project, running from the Navajo River south to Azotea Creek in the Rio Chama watershed. Work started on the Oso and Little Oso tunnels in February 1966, and construction on the Blanco Tunnel began in March of the same year. In 1967, an enlargement of the outlets of existing El Vado Dam to accommodate increased flows from the diversion project was completed, and construction began on Heron Dam, which would impound the project's main storage reservoir. Azotea Tunnel was holed through and construction was finished on the project's three diversion dams in 1970. Heron Dam was completed the next year. Nambe Falls Dam, completed in 1976, was {{the last part of}} the project to be built. The dam was the only one built of a series of small independent <b>irrigation</b> <b>units</b> originally proposed under the project to serve Native American lands. In 1978, Reclamation announced the completion of the San Juan-Chama Project.|$|R

40|$|Linear {{programming}} (LP) {{has been}} widely used to solve company resource allocation problems. The technique’s ability to predict how companies will adjust to changes {{in a variety of}} exogenous factors is well known, and when used at company level, it enables us to avoid aggregation problems. The decision-maker’s objective in this type of research is to maximize profit estimated as gross margin. We apply the LP model to three farms in three different <b>irrigation</b> <b>units</b> that, we believe, provide a representative sample of Spanish irrigated agriculture. In focusing on the goals of this research we stress that water pricing as a single instrument for control of water use is not a valid means of significantly reducing agricultural water consumption. This is because consumption does not fall until prices reach such a level that farm income and agricultural employment are negatively affected. If water pricing is selected as a policy tool, among the consequences for agricultural sector will be that: farm income will decrease by around 40 % before water demand decreases significantly. The impact of this reduction on rural areas that are dependent on irrigated agriculture will be catastrophic. Secondly there will be a {{reduction in the number of}} crops available for farming, with the consequence of a smaller number of alternative...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of ICE, Water Management [© Thomas Telford] and can also be found at: [URL] schemes in southwest India are heterogeneous in crops, area of <b>irrigation</b> <b>units,</b> soils and climate. The areas planned for irrigation each year under different crops and the scheduled duration of irrigation to each farmer are estimated, however, based on assumed uniform characteristics (planned schedule). In practice the schedules are not followed and users mostly over-irrigate their fields (the actual schedule). In this paper a simulation–optimisation model is used to develop two alternative (proposed) schedules based on full irrigation and on optimised deficit irrigation within the framework of area-proportionate water distribution, taking heterogeneity into account. As a case study, the allocation and water delivery plans were obtained for one irrigation scheme for the actual, planned and proposed schedules and compared using the simulation–optimisation technique. This showed that the proposed schedule for deficit irrigation had the maximum monetary productivity (total net benefits) and area productivity (irrigated area) and that the equity of both proposed schedules was much higher than those for either the planned or actual schedules. The proposed schedules can be adopted {{within the framework of the}} existing system of water distribution, which shows that there is considerable scope for improvement in the performance of existing irrigation schemes without major capital investment...|$|R
