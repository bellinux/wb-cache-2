Using upper bound {{method of analysis}} the internal heat generation due to plastic deformation and frictional heat at various stages of the extrusion process for different <b>die</b> <b>opening</b> geometry are simulated. A C++ program simulates the deformation and frictional power at die land region which is converted to temperature change using finite difference program. At the <b>extrusion</b> <b>die</b> land region, temperature rises with increasing complexity of <b>die</b> <b>openings</b> geometry with I-shaped section, giving the highest temperature rise, followed by T-shaped section, rectangular, circular shaped <b>die</b> <b>openings</b> with square section <b>die</b> <b>opening,</b> giving the least temperature rise for any given <b>extrusion</b> parameter. The <b>die</b> land zone shows increasing temperature rise with increasing friction coefficient, while increasing friction coefficient has no overall effect on the dead metal zone temperature rise. The proper choice of die land is, therefore, imperative if excessive generation of heat at the emergent section is to be avoided to maintain good quality and metallurgical structure of the product...|$|R

In hot extrusion process, finite-element method (FEM), BP neural network and genetic algorithm were combined together to optimize <b>extrusion</b> <b>die</b> profile which yielded more uniform wear depth distribution on die profile.

40|$|To {{achieve the}} {{specified}} geometry for an extruded profile {{together with a}} minimal degree of internal stresses, flow balancing of the die is required.

40|$|Purpose: Building {{up on the}} {{fracture}} mechanics (Paris law for crack propagation) based fatigue life prediction model developed earlier by the authors, Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to evaluate sensitivity of die life related to important geometrical and material parameters. Stochastic nature of various fatigue-related die parameters is used to reflect their variability. Design/methodology/approach: Life of the die {{is one of the}} most important factors affecting productivity and profitability in hot extrusion of metals. It has been reported in earlier works by the authors that <b>extrusion</b> <b>dies</b> most often fail by fatigue fracture. Experimental studies have shown that cracks preexist in dies due to various factors including heat treatment, machining, and surface hardening. High levels of repeated mechanical and thermal loads result in crack propagation leading to ultimate fracture failure. Findings: Findings of the sensitivity analysis are that fracture life of an <b>extrusion</b> <b>die</b> is very sensitive to initial crack size, section thickness, profile outer diameter and billet length; moderately sensitive to Paris constant and extrusion ratio; and only slightly sensitive to fracture toughness and ram speed.

Various researchers have investigated the effect of profile complexity on extrusion pressure, product quality, die life, etc. However, the relationship between shape complexity and metal flow through the <b>extrusion</b> <b>die</b> has not been studied in detail. Cold extrusion experiments on some solid profiles and simulations using the finite element method (FEM) {{have been used in}} this work to investigate the effect of profile complexity on dead metal zone and metal flow.
