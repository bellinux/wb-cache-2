40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new electronic payment framework {{that is based}} on the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>payment</b> model currently used both of-line and via the Internet. The strength of the direct debit model is its fexibility in allowing customers to defer payments for goods and services until a later date. This fexibility also extends to merchants who can process consumer payments without any customer intervention thus making payment collections a faster and more effient business function. The current direct debit solutions used online are neither secure nor fexible and demand a "leap of faith" from customers who must trust merchants to behave honestly. Unlike its off-line counterparts that always use signed direct debit request (DDR) forms as legally binding contracts, online direct debit systems rarely require signatures (for example when using credit cards). As such, in most cases it is possible for merchants to change the terms of original debit agreements post-fact allowing them to arbitrarily charge customer accounts. Unsigned DDR agreements give merchants unprecedented power over customer accounts with little recourse for dispute. The aim of this thesis is to present a high-level architectural design and a first working prototype of a periodical payment application that addresses issues inherent in Internet direct debit payments. It takes a novel approach for securing electronic payments by using X. 509 restricted proxy certifcates over Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to provide authentication, authorisation and non-repudiation services. To assure success of this proposal only currently available, standards compliant and industry supported technologies were utilised with emphasis placed on Web Services and related technologies such as, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). The concept of electronic payments is hardly new and there is a signifcant amount of interest in improving its security model, most notably from Visa and MasterCard. Current applications, however, focus on single payment transactions ignoring the growing trend favouring periodical payments. The framework presented in this thesis attempts to fill a niche by delivering signifcant improvements to an essentially paper-based <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>payment</b> model that currently does not integrate well into a purely electronic environment...|$|E
40|$|SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) {{is a new}} step in {{the move}} towards {{financial}} integration in Europe. SEPA will harmonise the use of payment instruments (credit transfers, direct debits and card payments) throughout SEPA (the 27 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). All the economic actors {{will be able to}} make cross-border euro payments in the same way as domestic euro payments, with the same obligations and liabilities. The European Commission has created a harmonised legal framework for payment services and the European Payments Council (EPC), unifying the banking sector, directs the process under a self-regulating regime. The Eurosystem monitors progress and developments in its catalyst role. For each of the SEPA payment instruments, the EPC has developed standards : “Rulebooks” for the credit transfer and <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>payment</b> instruments and a more general framework for card payments. Ultimately, the same credit transfer and <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>payment</b> instruments will be available and accessible to all users. Any SEPA payment cards will be accepted at any terminal in SEPA. Infrastructures will have to be adapted to meet the new payment standards, and consolidation is likely. SEPA is being created in phases. The design phase is now finished and from January 2008 onwards banks will offer their customers the SEPA Credit Transfer in parallel with the existing national credit transfer. The SEPA Direct Debit will be launched in November 2009. By the end of 2010, the use of the national payment instruments should cease. For cards, banks will need up to the end of 2010 to streamline all standards. From 2011 onwards, only SEPA cards will be issued. In Belgium, the SEPA project is organised on two different levels : from a banking perspective and on a more general level with all stakeholders in the economy. A migration plan has been published and is regularly updated. Thanks to its long tradition of interbank cooperation, the Belgian banking sector is one of the leading banking communities in the migration to SEPA in Europe.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} implementation of a payment framework that is loosely based on the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>payment</b> model. We define such payments as one in which customers can authorise merchants to bill them repeatedly {{for the provision of}} some service without further interaction with the customers being required. This paper aims to present a first working prototype of our periodical payment model, and to discuss its performance. Our model uses a novel approach for implementing security by employing X. 509 restricted proxy certificates over Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to provide authentication, authorisation and non-repudiation services. Although the concept of electronic payments is hardly new and there is a significant amount of interest in improving its security model, most notably from Visa and MasterCard, periodical payments have been consistently overlooked by these industry heavyweights. As of now this concept remains unexplored and the current approaches for securing electronic transactions make it impossible to accommodate this transaction format. The work presented in this paper attempts to fill this niche by developing a new payment specification and a fully working prototype implementation addressing this issue. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we shall {{introduce}} a new electronic payment concept based on the popular <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>payment</b> model, entitled periodical payments. The direct debit model currently in use online is neither secure nor flexible, and requires {{a leap of faith}} by the customer who must trust the merchant to behave honestly. Electronic direct debit request (DDR) forms are not signed by both parties in a binding manner, which means that merchants can change the terms of DDR agreements post-fact. Unsigned DDR agreements give the merchant unprecedented power over customer accounts with little recourse for dispute. In this paper we shall demonstrate how the use of restricted proxy certificates with cryptographic signatures can be adopted to support a new periodical payment model. A payment policy language is presented that is tailored towards specifying rules that govern precisely how and when merchants can access and transfer funds from customer accounts into their own. Using this model will ensure that mutually signed policies are instantly enforceable on every transaction within a payment period. There is a fundamental difference between this proposal and other electronic payment schemes. Most such schemes attempt to replicate the features of physical cash such as anonymity, and therefore focus on single payment transactions that simulate cash changing hands. Since direct debit is a popular payment choice, our proposal provides significant improvement to this essentially paper-based payment model that currently does not integrate well in a purely electronic world...|$|E

50|$|A {{current account}} is {{the form of}} {{transactional}} account found in the United Kingdom and other countries with a UK banking heritage; a current account offers various flexible payment methods to allow customers to distribute money directly to others.

Current accounts may also allow borrowing via an overdraft facility.
