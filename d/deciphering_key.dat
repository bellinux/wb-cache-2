This restrict us to use symmetric key cryptographyinstead of public-key techniques for transmission of message amongst the nodes. In any symmetric keysystem, both the sender and receiver must possess the unique enciphering and <b>deciphering</b> <b>key</b> prior toexchange of message. This leads to key distribution in the sensors which in itself is a major challenge. Though there are several methods of distributing the keys, due to resource constraints, KeyPredistrubution (KPD) is preferred over other techniques. It requires predistribution of keys in nodesprior to deployment and establishing immediately once deployed. However there are certain weaknesses invarious existing KPD schemes. For instance, often it is not guaranteed that any given pair of nodescommunicate directly. This leads one to revert to multi-hop communication involving intermediate sensornodes resulting in increased cost of communication. In this work a key predistribution technique usingReed-Solomon codes is considered which is faced with the above weakness.

Such prevalence in the human population and the zoonotic potential naturally raise questions about the impact of these parasites on public health and has increased interest in this area. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shed new light on the pathogenic power of this parasite, suggesting that Blastocystis sp. infection is associated with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, may {{play a significant role in}} irritable bowel syndrome, and may be linked with cutaneous lesions (urticaria).

The amount of bacteria in the human gut outnumbers human cells {{by a factor of}} 10, but some finely tuned mechanisms allow these microorganisms to colonize and survive within the host in a mutual relationship. The human gut microbiota co-evolved with humans to achieve a symbiotic relationship leading to physiological homeostasis. The microbiota provides crucial functions that human cannot exert themselves while the human host provides a nutrient-rich environment. Chaotic {{in the early stages of}} life, the assembly of the human gut microbiota remains globally stable over time in healthy conditions and absence of perturbation. Following perturbation, such as antibiotic treatment, bacteria will recolonize the niches with a composition and diversity similar to the basal level since the ecosystem is highly resilient. Yet, recurrent perturbations lead to a decrease in resilience capacity of the gut microbiome. Shifts in the bacterial composition and diversity of the human gut microbiota have been associated with intestinal dysfunctions such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity.

However, the inducers and endogenous molecular determinants that govern the lineage commitment and differentiation of classical BAT remain obscure. We report here that {{in the absence of any}} forced gene expression, stimulation with bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP 6) induces brown fat differentiation from skeletal muscle precursor cells of murine and human origins.
