5|$|After {{losing the}} {{election}} to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories</b> and Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} Roman rule in Britain, {{the region}} now known as East Anglia was settled by a North Germanic group known as the Angles, {{although}} {{there is evidence of}} early settlement of the region by a minority of other peoples, for instance the Swabians, who settled in the area around the modern town of Swaffham. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories</b> of southern Britain conquered by the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. The ruling dynasty of East Anglia was the Wuffingas, named from Wuffa, an early king. The first king known to have ruled is Rædwald, whose reign spanned {{a quarter of a century}} from about 599.|$|E
5|$|During the march, Amangkurat {{tried to}} gain the loyalty of the lords <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories</b> he passed through. Many were {{previously}} loyal to Kajoran, who sided with Trunajaya, or were wavering between the two sides. The presence of the king and his forces, {{as well as the}} possibly booty to be gained in the campaign, motivated them to declare allegiance to Amangkurat and join his forces. At some point, the Javanese forces in the column reached 13,000.|$|E
5|$|In July 1861, Stevens {{secured the}} passage of an act to {{confiscate}} the property, including slaves, of certain rebels.

However, legislation did pass that abolished slavery in the District of Columbia and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories.</b> By March 1862, to Stevens's exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the Border states, with the masters compensated by the federal government.|$|E

5|$|In {{part due}} to the ongoing violent {{political}} confrontations in the Kansas, opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act remained strong in Illinois and throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories</b> and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of John C. Frémont and William Dayton. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador James Buchanan, who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories,</b> while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. In the 1856 elections, Buchanan defeated both his challengers, but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In the 10th century AD, Georgia for {{the first}} time emerged as an ethnic concept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories</b> where the Georgian {{language}} was used to perform Christian rituals. After the Mongol invasions of the region, the Kingdom of Georgia eventually was broken up into several kingdoms and principalities.

Beyond the called-for Islamic boycott of the company, the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries {{that are part of}} the League's membership.|$|E

5|$|The Diet of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, {{and of the}} Grand Duchy of Cracow was the {{regional}} assembly of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a crown land of the Austrian Empire, and later Austria-Hungary.

Initially, a sharp distinction existed between the Bulgars and their subjects, but the Slavicization of the Bulgars soon began.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{resulted in}} the creation of the Province of Manitoba (inclusive of Fort Garry) and a delay in establishing governance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Territories.</b> In 1870, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba formally entered the Canadian confederation. The two jurisdictions remained partially conjoined: under the Temporary Government Act, 1870. The Temporary North-West Council was appointed in 1872, mainly from members of the new Manitoba Legislative Assembly, with the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba serving as the leader of the territorial government. The Governor and Council were mandated to govern the Territories through the Manitoba Act and did so from outside of the Northwest Territories. Fort Garry served as the first seat of government for both jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, immigration, {{urbanisation}} and industrialisation {{transformed the}} territories, destroying the old frontier way of life. Three million immigrants arrived in Canada between 1910 and 1914, many of them from eastern Europe, and over half of them settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>territories.</b> The urban population grew significantly as new towns were established across the Prairies. Many of the immigrants were employed by the growing industries of the region, especially the large mining and manufacturing centres enabled by the Canadian Pacific Railway.
