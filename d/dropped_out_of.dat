40|$|The {{decision}} to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is a dangerous}} one for the student. The purpose of this quantitative {{study was to examine}} the relationship between student mathematics achievement as measured by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) Grade 4 Mathematics Test (G 4 MT), Grade 8 Mathematics Test (G 8 MT), and Integrated Algebra Mathematics Test (IAMT) and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school in a medium-size school district in the Lower Hudson Region of New York. Furthermore, the study examined to what extent the New York State mathematics tests served as predictors <b>of</b> students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school. The 680 research participants were students who first entered Grade 9 in the 2006 - 2007 school year. There was no statistically significant relationship between students’ mathematics achievement and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school. However, there was a statistically significant relationship between student taking the NYSED G 4 MT, G 8 MT, and IAMT and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school. Taking the NYSED G 8 MT and IAMT contributed significantly to the prediction <b>of</b> students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school. Students taking the NYSED G 4 MT and G 8 MT were almost 3 times more likely not to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school. Moreover, students taking the NYSED G 4 MT, G 8 MT, and IAMT were 10 times more likely not to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high school.

40|$|Though most {{students}} complete their educational journey, some choose to leave school early and <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> before graduation from high school. The {{focus of this}} study is to determine if the school organization and the people most engaged in the educational process of students influence some students to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school in both public and Catholic schools. Prior research has demonstrated that in the United States, Catholic schools consistently have fewer student dropouts than public schools. What is different within Catholic school walls than public schools and are students in Catholic school dissimilar to students in public schools that give Catholic school fewer dropouts? A U. S. Department of Education data set containing approximately 25, 000 students, their school administrators, and parents was used in this study. This data set surveyed each of these groups when the student was in eighth, tenth, and twelfth grades in both public and Catholic schools all across the United States. Applying logit regression to ascertain the odds <b>of</b> students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school, examined was the school administrators, parents, ^ and students. The results suggest that parental involvement is the foremost motivation as to why students <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school. Not that parents in Catholic schools are more engaged in their children 2 ̆ 7 s education, but parental involvement did matter as to why fewer students <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Catholic schools than public schools. A unified model containing all significant variables from each of the three subjects; students, parents, and school administrators, indicated that school classification no longer had an impact on students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school. What school, public or Catholic the student attended did not matter; the student who is likely to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school will probably <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school. ...|$|R
