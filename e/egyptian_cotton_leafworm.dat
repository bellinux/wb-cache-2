The purpose of the present study is biochemical characterization of digestive enzymes of this pest to gain a better understanding of the digestive physiology. The physiology and biochemistry of the insect digestive enzyme had an important role in the study of novel insecticidal strategies. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> alimentary canal consists of a short foregut, a long midgut and a short hindgut. Application of pH indicators showed that alimentary canal was alkaline. Our results showed that activities of gut α-amylase were different in three parts of the insect gut.

However, there were not significant differences in activity of the enzyme in the midgut and hindgut. The optimal pH α-amylase in foregut, midgut and hindgut were 10. 0. Zymogram analysis of different part of gut showed four bands in midgut, hind gut and two bands in foregut. Therefore, in midgut of S. littoralis, four isoenzymes were present.

The technical issues involved in these alterations are well within the realms of possibility.

40|$|Oxylipins play {{important}} roles in stress signaling in plants. The compound 12 -oxophytodienoic acid (cis-OPDA) is an early biosynthetic precursor of jasmonic acid (JA), the key phytohormone orchestrating the plant anti-herbivore defense. When consumed by feeding Lepidopteran larvae, plant-derived cis-OPDA suffers rapid isomerization to iso-OPDA in the midgut and is excreted in the frass. Unlike OPDA epimerization (yielding trans-OPDA), the formation of iso-OPDA is enzyme-dependent, and is catalyzed by an inducible glutathione transferase (GSTs) from the larval gut. Purified GST fractions from the gut of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis) and cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) both exhibited strong OPDA isomerization activity, most likely via transient formation of a glutathione-OPDA conjugate. Out of 16 cytosolic GST proteins cloned from the gut of cotton bollworm larvae and expressed in E. coli, only one catalyzed the OPDA isomerization. The biological function of the double bond shift might be seen in an inactivation of cis-OPDA, similar to the inactivation of prostaglandin A 1 to prostaglandin B 1 in mammalian tissue. The enzymatic isomerization is particularly widespread among generalist herbivores that {{have to cope with}} various amounts of cis-OPDA in their spectrum of host plants...|$|E

Sib-analysis methods were used to determine whether individuals varied genetically in their PO activity, and hence in one aspect of immune function. The heritability estimate of haemolymph PO activity was high (h 2 = 0. 690 ± 0. 069), and PO activity in the haemolymph was strongly correlated with PO activity in both the cuticle and midgut; the sites of entry for most parasites and pathogens.

40|$|Spodoptera species, {{representing}} widespread polyphagous insect pests, {{are resistant}} to Bacillus thuringiensis δ-endotoxins used thus far as insecticides in transgenic plants. Here we describe the chemical synthesis of a cryIC gene by a novel template directed ligation–PCR method. This simple and economical method to construct large synthetic genes can be used when routine resynthesis of genes is required. Chemically phosphorylated adjacent oligonucleotides of the gene to be synthesized are assembled and ligated on a single-stranded, partially homologous template derived from a wild-type gene (cryIC in our case) by a thermostable Pfu DNA ligase using repeated cycles of melting, annealing, and ligation.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{formula for}} insect rearing {{artificial}} diets without using {{any of their}} conventional gelling agents was provided in the present work, for the first time. Larvae of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were successfully mass-reared, for nine consecutive generations on an agar-free artificial diet. This suggested medium is based on yellow lentils, Lens culinaris and rice, Oryza sativa as the basic constituents. An accurately amounted ratio between these two highly nutritive constituents produces, when cooked, a firm gel with desirable physical properties for insect-rearing artificial media. Through 9 consecutive generations, the S. littoralis biological results of the developmental durations, pupation %, pupal weights, sex ratio, adult emergency, longevity, fecundity and egg fertility, were either comparable or superior to those recorded for both the reference natural diet, the castor bean leaves Ricinus communis L. and the previously reported results on agar-or alginate-based media for rearing the present insect On this diet, S. littoralis larvae have been reared for 9 generations with no noticeable decline in their yields of pupae or moths and fecundity or hatchability.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of potato plants expressing a barley cystatin on a {{potentially}} cystatin-susceptible natural enemy by predation on susceptible and non-susceptible preys feeding on the plant. We have focussed on the impact of the variant HvCPI- 1 C 68 → G, in which the only cysteine residue was changed by a glycine, on the growth and digestive physiology of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> (ECW), Spodoptera littoralis. Moreover, we have studied the prey-mediated effects of the barley cystatin at the third trophic level, using the predatory spined soldier bug (SSB), Podisus maculiventris, as a model. Feeding trials conducted with CPB larvae reared on transgenic potato plants expressing the C 68 → G variant resulted in significantly lower weight gains compared to those fed on non-transformed (NT) plants. On the contrary, larger weight gains were obtained when ECW larvae, that lack digestive cysteine proteases, were reared on transgenic potato expressing the cystatin, as compared to larvae fed on NT plants. No negative effects on survival and growth were observed when SSB nymphs were exposed to HvCPI- 1 C 68 → G by predation on either CPB or ECW larvae reared on transgenic potato plants expressing the barley cystatin, despite the fact that the inhibitor suppressed in vitro gut proteolysis of the predatory bug.

40|$|Abstract Background Defensins are a {{well known}} family of {{cationic}} antibacterial peptides (AMPs) isolated from fungi, plants, insects, mussels, birds, and various mammals. They are predominantly active against gram (+) bacteria, {{and a few}} of them are also active against gram (-) bacteria and fungi. All insect defensins belonging to the invertebrate class have a consensus motif, C-X 5 - 16 -C-X 3 -C-X 9 - 10 -C-X 4 - 7 -CX 1 -C. Only seven AMPs have already been found in different lepidopteran species. No report was published on the isolation of defensin from the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis. Results An anionic defensin, termed Spli Def, was isolated from the haemolymph of the cotton leafworm, S. littoralis, after bacterial challenge using differential display technique. Based on sequence analyses of the data, specific primers for full length and mature peptide of defensin were designed and successfully amplified 471 and 150 bp amplicons. The integration of the results revealed that the 471 bp-PCR product has one open reading frame (orf) of 303 bp long, including both start codon (AUG) and stop codon (UGA). The deduced peptide consists of a 23 -residues signal peptide, a 27 -residues propeptide and a 50 -residues mature peptide with the conserved six-cysteine motif of insect defensins. Both haemolymph and expressed protein exhibited antibacterial activities comparable to positive control. The RT-qPCR indicated that it was more than 41 -folds up-regulated at 48 h p. i.

40|$|Odors are {{essential}} in mediating insect reproductive behavior. Environmental odors help insects locate suitable feeding or egg-laying sites and avoid suboptimal hosts or dangerous habitats. Sex pheromones, {{on the other}} hand, are responsible for mate finding and elicit courtship and mating. Although pheromones elicit stereotypical behaviors on their own, they are embedded in a background of environmental odors in nature. Using the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis, and the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, I studied the effect of blending environmentally relevant odors with pheromones on insect behavior. For the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> we first developed an attractive cotton volatile blend. We next used this blend to determine the physiological effect of DMNT, a strong behavioral antagonist, on the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> olfactory system. I then blended the individual volatiles and volatile blends with an incomplete and complete pheromone. The combination of cotton volatiles and the complete pheromone elicits attraction. Deviations from this optimum, either by changing the pheromone composition or the cotton volatile blend strongly reduces male S. littoralis attraction. I then used the fruit fly to study the effect of food (vinegar) and habitat (yeast) volatiles on fly attraction towards pheromones. Starvation affects attraction towards a blend of vinegar and a male produced pheromone in a sexually dimorphic way. We next describe a novel female fruit fly pheromone and the odorant receptor involved in its perception. Finally, we show that vinegar and yeast volatiles interact in a different manner with male and female produced pheromones, suggesting that although vinegar is a good feeding cue, even {{in the presence of}} pheromones, it is not an appropriate mate finding cue. My findings suggest that pheromones and host volatiles function as a single unit that mediates insect behavior, rather than as individual components. As such the olfactory cues that mediate mate finding in insects are under both natural and sexual selection simultaneously, which has strong implications for insect speciation and evolution...|$|R

Electron microscopy observations revealed the presence of icosahedral particles with 22 nm in diameter for the viral capside related to the Densovirus (DNV), and 29 nm for the second one as a Picornavirus (PV). For the DNV four capsid proteins of 91, 63, 53 and 47 KDa have been separated, and were undifferentiated {{from that of the}} unique published Densovirus isolate from Egypt, the #Mythimna loreyi$ DNV (MIDNV). PV capsids contain three major structural proteins of 30, 32 and 33 KDa resembling the Drosophila C virus (DCV), a very well known Picornavirus of insect. The DNV genome consists of a single stranded DNA molecule of size 5. 95 Kb. It was characterized using 12 restriction endonucleases. The DNA restriction profiles were identical with these of MIDNV. The PV contain a single stranded RNA genome of size 9. 4 Kb as the different reported isolates of DCV. Using rabbit antisera, immunological comparison revealed a complete homology between the DNV and IDNV, as well as, the PV isolated from #S. littoralis$ shows a complete serological identity with the DCV. These results suggest that we can register the DNV isolated from #S. littoralis$ as a strain of MIDNV and the small RNA virus as an Egyptian strain of DCV.

40|$|Abstract. 1. Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that the deposition of melanin pig-ment in the cuticle of larval Lepidoptera is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, {{few studies have examined}} intra-individual regional variation in the degree of melanism or the ontogenetic dynamics of this trait. Here, heritable and density-dependent effects on within-individual and stage-specific variation in melanism were examined in caterpillars of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval). 2. Using quantitative spectrometric methods, it is shown that cuticular melan-ism changes dramatically within larval stadia, showing the highest and lowest levels of melanism early (first day) and late (final day) in each larval stadium respectively. However, solitary-reared caterpillars were significantly paler than those reared gregariously at all stages of development and maintained greater levels of variation in melanism. This variation in melanism was repeatable and exhibited a significant heritable component (narrow sense heritability based on offspring–parent regressions: h 2 0. 18 – 0. 30). 3. The degree of melanism was correlated negatively with larval body weight in solitary caterpillars, but not gregarious ones. Melanism also varied spatially, with the lateral longitudinal band being consistently darker than the dorsal or dorso-lateral bands. Crowd-rearing increased melanism in all regions of larval cuticle, but the extent of crowding-induced melanism was more pronounced in the dorsal and dorso-lateral bands than in the lateral one. 4. These results indicate that although cuticular melanism is a highly dynamic trait, ontogenetic changes in relative cuticular melanism are both predictable and repeatable within individuals and genotypes. This has implications for our under-standing of the evolution of melanism and for applying artificial selection on the basis of colour. Key words.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays) emits {{a mixture}} of {{volatile}} compounds upon attack by the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis). These substances, primarily mono- and sesquiterpenes, are used by parasitic wasps to locate the lepidopteran larvae, which are their natural hosts. This interaction among plant, lepidopteran larvae, and hymenopteran parasitoids benefits the plant and has been termed indirect defense. The committed step in the biosynthesis of the different skeletal types of mono- and sesquiterpenes is catalyzed by terpene synthases, a class of enzymes that forms a large variety of mono- and sesquiterpene products from prenyl diphosphate precursors. We isolated a terpene synthase gene, terpene synthase 1 (tps 1), from maize that exhibits only a low degree of sequence identity to previously identified terpene synthases. Upon expression in a bacterial system, the encoded enzyme produced the acyclic sesquiterpenes, (E) -β-farnesene, (E,E) -farnesol, and (3 R) -(E) -nerolidol, the last an intermediate {{in the formation of}} (3 E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene.

However, exogenous SA reduced the amount of JA that <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm induced in both npr 1 mutant and wild-type plants. Thus, this generalist herbivore engages two different induced defense pathways that interact to mediate resistance in Arabidopsis. ?? Springer-Verlag 2001...|$|R
