40|$|Maximizing {{performance}} {{when using}} real-world samples and small volume, high sensitivity columns which degrade the native chromatographic separation is a challenge. Loss in column performance {{is due to}} precolumn dispersion and volume overload. In this work a series of methods based on novel instrumentation and sound theory is presented to improve a chromatographic result for such samples in both isocratic and gradient <b>elution</b> <b>modes.</b> An approach called temperature-assisted solute focusing (TASF) was developed to improve sample focusing or preconcentration. TASF is designed to address precolumn dispersion in capillary scale LC. Volume overload is a common form of precolumn dispersion and degrades LC performance. TASF works by relying on the temperature dependence of solute retention and high power thermoelectric or Peltier elements (TECs) to actively heat/cool a short segment of the column near its inlet during sample loading. Cooling {{the head of the}} column transiently increases retention for solutes during injection, improving focusing and solving the volume overload problem. Following focusing rapid heating decreases retention releasing the compressed injection band to the downstream portion of the column. The TASF approach was assessed using a series of three instruments with well characterized solutes developing it into a robust platform capable of routine, unattended use. Three models for solvent-based on-column focusing in isocratic elution were experimentally investigated. Solvent-based on-column focusing is a well-known method to increase concentration sensitivity and combat precolumn dispersion by injecting samples made in weak elution solvents. Additionally, solvent-based focusing occurs naturally as a consequence of increased solute retention in the sample solvent and a step gradient generated by the difference between sample and mobile phase composition. Finally, a simple graphical method for rapid chromatographic optimization was developed. This plot was designed specifically to assist practitioners to determine experimental conditions to achieve a desired column efficiency or peak capacity in a defined time in both isocratic and gradient <b>elution</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

The overall study was directed toward the generation of efficient separations {{in order to obtain}} pure atropisomers that will serve as ligands for building homochiral metal organic frameworks. Four coated columns-namely, Lux Cellulose- 1, Lux Cellulose- 2, Lux Cellulose- 4, and Lux Amylose- 2 -and two immobilized columns-namely, Chiralpak IC and IA-were used under normal, polar organic, and reversed-phase <b>elution</b> <b>modes.</b> Moreover, Chiralcel OJ was considered under normal-phase and polar organic conditions. The effect of the chiral selector and mobile phase composition on the enantioseparation, the enantiomer elution order and the beneficial effect of nonstandard solvents were studied.

The best results in HPLC were obtained with the 20 -mm Discovery RP Amide C 16 stationary phase in isocratic mode using MeOH as organic modifier. To improve analysis time, the UHPLC approach was then evaluated. Consequently, a generic method was developed with a 30 -mm Acquity BEH Shield RP 18 column in gradient mode using MeOH as organic modifier, allowing a fourfold gain of time compared to the HPLC method, for the highly lipophilic compounds tested.

For desorbing SMZ from the immunoaffinity column, different <b>elution</b> <b>modes</b> were evaluated, with 40 % MeOH- 0. 1 mol L- 1 HOAc- 0. 5 mol L- 1 NaCl being the most efficient combination. Using the IAC column for processing SMZ spiked urine samples resulted in high recoveries, ranging from 92 to 100 %. Because of the high cross-reactivity with the major metabolites of SMZ present in urine of treated animals, the antibodies show excellent properties for use in both IAC and ELISA. For the isolation and concentration of the parent drug and its major metabolites, the urine could be applied directly to the IAC column, without the time-consuming step of deconjugation. Moreover, the use of IAC prior to ELISA for the analysis of incurred urine samples showed good efficiency for the elimination of matrix interferences. Owing to the urine-tissue relationship, the urine concentrations can be used to predict the presence of the parent drug in tissues and so possible violations of the maximum residue limit (MRL) can be controlled...|$|R

If pharmaceutical-grade purities are required, chromatographic purification using ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography is commonly carried out. However, separation selectivity for structurally closely related impurities is often insufficient, especially at high sample loads. In this study, a “mixed-mode” reversed-phase/weak anion exchanger stationary phase has been investi- gated {{as an alternative}} tool for chromatographic separation of synthetic oligonucleotides with minor sequence variations. The employed mixed-mode phase shows great flexibility in method develop- ment. It has been run in various gradient <b>elution</b> <b>modes,</b> viz. one, two or three parameter (mixed) gradients (altering buffer pH, buffer concentration, and organic modifier) to find optimal elution con- ditions and gain further insight into retention mechanisms. Compared to ion-pair reversed-phase and mere anion-exchange separation, enhanced selectivities were observed with the mixed-mode phase for 20 – 23 nucleotide (nt) long oligonucleotides with similar sequences. Oligonucleotides differing by 1, 2 or 3 nucleotides in length could be readily resolved and separation factors for single nucleotide replacements declined in the order Cytosine (C) /Guanine (G) > Adenine (A) /Guanine ∼ Guanine/Thymine (T) > Adenine/Cytosine ∼ Cytosine/Thymine > Adenine/Thymine. Selectivities were larger when the mod- ification was at the 3 terminal-end, declined when {{it was in the}} middle of the sequence and was smallest ̊ when it was located at the 5 terminus. Due to the lower surface area of the 200 A pore size mixed- ̊ mode stationary phase compared to the corresponding 100 A material, lower retention times with equal selectivities under milder elution conditions were achievable.

It is important toachieve proper separation among the two PGIs and celecoxib, because of similarchemical structure of two PGIs and celecoxib. In order to obtain a short analysistime, various analytical columns like Kromasil C 18 150  mm × 4.6  mm, 3.5  μm (Altmann Analytik, Munich, Germany), Hypersil BDS C 8 150  mm× 4.6  mm, 3.5  μm (Altmann Analytik), Symmetry C 18 150  mm× 4.6  mm, 3.5  μm (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), and Zorbax Rx C 8150  mm × 4.6  mm, 3.5  μm (Agilent Technologies, Inc., SantaClara, CA, USA) were evaluated. The tested columns were checked under the sameconditions; with the Kromasil C 18 and Zorbax Rx C 8 columns, the peaks of impuritieswere overlapped with celecoxib peak. The resolution between celecoxib and impuritieswere poor with Hypersil BDS C 8 column. On Symmetry C 18 column (150  mm × 4.6  mm, 3.5  μm), the separation and responses for both the impuritiesand celecoxib were found good. On this column, the analytes were well retained andseparated {{from each other and}} from the drug substance. This separation is achieveddue to polar group technology that ‘shields’ the silica residual silanolsurface from highly basic analytes; this reduced silanol activity for the symmetrycolumn significantly improved the peak shape and resolution. Different compositionsof mobile phases using 10  mM ammonium acetate and 5.0  mM ammonium acetatewith acetonitrile were tested; finally, good separation and response were observed ata ratio of 5.0  mM ammonium acetate-acetonitrile (30 : 70, v/v).Both isocratic and gradient <b>elution</b> <b>modes</b> were evaluated.

The production of insulin requires many chromatographic steps. A key downstream polishing step, the reversed phase chromatography, RPC, removes the structurally similar impurities before size exclusion chromatography and crystallization. The design and optimization of RPC for insulin purification process has been challenging in the preparative scale. The lack of systematic approach in protein purification results in empirical, time consuming, and expensive screening of various loading and operating conditions. ^ The goal of this work is to develop strategies for designing new insulin purification processes with high purity, high yield, and high productivity. A model-based approach combining experiments, theoretical analysis, and mathematical modeling is used to achieve the research goal. This work is composed of two parts: model development and process design. The modified reversed phase modulator isotherm and the general rate model were tested to describe lispro insulin and its impurities. To estimate the intrinsic model parameters, this study developed a systematic and efficient method that only requires small pulse linear gradient elution runs with two gradient slopes and frontal experiments with three organic fractions. With the same set of intrinsic parameters, the model predicted closely with the experimental data over a wide range of loading and operating conditions: loading volume up to 4 column volumes, acetonitrile fraction from 0. 19 to 0. 43, linear velocity up to 6 cm/min, and in various <b>elution</b> <b>modes</b> such as frontal, linear gradient, isocratic, and stepwise elution. ^ The second part of this study applied the verified model and parameters to elucidate the competitive adsorption and the competing mass transfer mechanisms in lispro insulin purification.

First, the crude G. biloba L. extracts were prepared using a Soxhlet extractor operated under an optimal extraction condition (using 160 mL of 70 % ethanol aqueous solution for 3 h per 10 g dry leaves). The extraction yield was 25 - 30 % and the purity was 2. 5 - 3. 0 wt. % for flavonoid glycosides and 0. 5 - 1. 0 wt. % for terpene lactones. Before the column operation, the extracts were dissolved in 10 % ethanol and used as the feed solution, {{which led to a}} 1. 5 - 2. 0 fold concentration and a 10 - 20 % loss for both active ingredients. Then, the column was operated under four steps, i. e., adsorption, washing, elution, and regeneration, in sequence. The results show that using the eluent with a high ethanol concentration (greater than or equal to 70 %) in the isocratic <b>elution</b> <b>mode</b> gave good column performance. Both flavonoid glycosides and terpene lactones were nearly completely eluted, their purities all met the standardized contents of G. biloba L. extracts (24 wt. % for flavonoid glycosides and 6 wt. % for terpene lactones), and their yields were nearly 100 %. Finally, for a simulated two-step <b>elution</b> <b>mode</b> (first step: 30 % and second step: 70 % ethanol), the product purity can be further improved, but {{at the expense of the}} product yield...|$|E

High-speed {{counter-current}} chromatography(HSCCC) {{was successfully}} used for isolation and purification of Ginkgo flavonoids from the Ginkgo biloba L. leaf extract (GBE) with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water at an optimized volume ratio of 4 : 6 : 5 : 5 (v/v/v/v). The lower phase {{was used as}} the mobile phase in the head to tail <b>elution</b> <b>mode.</b> The preparative HSCCC separation was performed on 200 mg of GBE yielding pure Quercetin(22 mg), Kaempferol(15 mg) and Isorhamnetin(4 mg) at purities of 96. 6 %, 92. 3 % and 93. 6 %, respectively, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{focuses on}} three main topics: 1) 	Design and {{evaluation}} of new stable bidentate urea-type stationary phases for HPLC and UHPLC. New totally synthetic bidentate urea-type phases were envisioned for HPLC and UHPLC, characterized by a high stability, a wide application range and an excellent suitability for LC-MS. Four conceptually new stationary phases {{have been developed for}} the separation {{of a wide variety of}} polar compounds by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) through a facile one-pot two-step procedure with the aim of obtaining high hydrolytic stability in a variety of elution conditions. A full chemical characterization of the new materials has been obtained through solid-state NMR (both 29 Si and 13 C CPMAS) spectroscopy. A major application field of the bidentate urea-type stationary phase with free amino groups USP-HILIC-NH 2 -sil was sugars analysis, usually hampered by anomer peak splitting and instability of the stationary phases under conditions normally employed to suppress it. Complex mixtures of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides were successfully resolved under mild chromatographic conditions, which also allowed an easy interface with mass spectrometry. The potential of such materials was shown in the separation of other highly polar compounds, including polyols, hydroxybenzoic acids, nucleobases, and vitamins. A parallel project was developed using a very similar synthetic scheme where enantiopure diamines were treated with (3 -isocyanatopropyl) triethoxysilane to yield reactive ureido selectors that were eventually attached to unmodified silica particles through a stable, bidentate tether. The two steps were part of an easy and time-saving one-pot procedure, as was the case for the HILIC phases. These new monomeric brush-type chiral stationary phases, hereafter called “Crab-like” CSPs, are characterized by an excellent stability and enantioselectivity, a high permeability and efficiency, as well as an extended compatibility with all solvents and no memory effect, which allowed us to operate under normal phase, reversed phase and polar organic mode conditions. Comparative studies were performed with commmercial polymeric brush-type CSPs bearing the same chiral selector (1, 2 -diaminocyclohexane and 1, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 2 -ethylenediamine) in order to evaluate the resolution and performance skills of the new “Crab-like” CSPs in different <b>elution</b> <b>modes.</b> 2) 	Extending the use of “Inverted Chirality Columns Approach (ICCA) ” for enantiomeric excess determination in absence of reference samples: application to a water-soluble camptothecin derivative. The aim of the present study was to extend the use of the “Inverted Chirality Columns Approach (ICCA) ” previously developed for the identification and quantitation of the trace enantiomer in highly enriched samples of the camptothecin (CPT) family of drugs to a novel water-soluble CPT derivative, namely namitecan (ST 1968), currently undergoing phase I clinical trials as anticancer agent. Namitecan, identified from a series of hydrophilic 7 -oxyiminomethyl derivatives, contains a free terminal amino group, which traditionally hampers the analysis under normal-phase HPLC conditions. Nevertheless, commercially available Pirkle-type chiral stationary phases (CSPs) available in both the enantiomeric forms (i. e., having the same bound selector with opposite configuration) mainly operate under normal-phase HPLC conditions. For this reason, namitecan was pre-columnN-derivatized with isocyanates A–D and their sulfur analogues E–H to reduce its polarity by converting the amino group into a fragment compatible with the chiral recognition mechanism (i. e., ureido and thioureido groups). Once the optimal columns system and derivatizing agents were selected, an original enantioselective HPLC–MS/MS technique was developed on the Whelk-O 1 CSPs. 3) 	Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the epimerization processes in Artemisinin-derived antimalarial drugs by Dynamic High Performance Liquid Chromatography (D-HPLC). Stereodynamic investigations have been performed on two active artemisinin derivatives having labile stereogenic centres, namely dihydroartemisinin (DHA), and an in vivo degradation product of DHA containing an endoperoxide, an aldehyde and a ketonic moiety, namely MKA (monoketoaldehyde). We were able to obtain MKA through pyrolysis or basic degradation of DHA and have fully characterized its structure through a variety o analytical techinques. The stereodynamic studies performed have focused on a stereolabile hemiacetalic function present in both molecules. Linear Solvation Energy Relationships (LSER) analysis was used to study the thermodynamics of the epimerization process in DHA and MKA. Computational studies have provided further data on the differential stability and acidity of the two epimeric forms of MKA, while a kinetic investigation is introduced...|$|R
40|$|Gold {{nanorods}} (GNRs) are {{of particular}} interest for biomedical applications due to their unique size-dependent longitudinal surface plasmon resonance band in the visible to near-infrared. Purified GNRs are essential {{for the advancement of}} technologies based on these materials. Used in concert, asymmetric-flow field flow fractionation (A 4 F) and single particle inductively coupled mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) provide unique advantages for fractionating and analyzing the typically complex mixtures produced by common synthetic procedures. A 4 F fractions collected at specific elution times were analyzed off-line by spICP-MS. The individual particle masses were obtained by conversion of the ICP-MS pulse intensity for each detected particle event, using a defined calibration procedure. Size distributions were then derived by transforming particle mass to length assuming a fixed diameter. The resulting particle lengths correlated closely with ex situ transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to our previously reported observations on the fractionation of low-aspect ratio (AR) GNRs (AR < 4), under optimal A 4 F separation conditions the results for high-AR GNRs of fixed diameter (≈ 20 nm) suggest normal, rather than steric, <b>mode</b> <b>elution</b> (i. e., shorter rods with lower AR generally elute first). The relatively narrow populations in late eluting fractions suggest the method can be used to collect and analyze specific length fractions; it is feasible that A 4 F could be appropriately modified for industrial scale purification of GNRs...|$|R
40|$|Stevia rebaudiana leaves {{known as}} sweet leaf and it contain with non-caloric {{sweeteners}} (steviol-glycosides) whose consumption could exert beneficial effects on human health. In Malaysia, the applicable of steviol-glycosides was very limited. The sweetness of steviol-glycosides was about 300 {{times more than}} sugar produce from sugar cane. Nowadays, sugarcane has critical value due to its high consumptions in community. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine stevioside and rebaudioside A in Stevia Rebaudiana leaves qualitatively by using soxhlet extraction method analyzed via preparative HPLC. A series of standard solution for both stevioside and rebaudioside A were analyzed. Samples were sequentially extracted using methanol as the solvent and the column had been used in this study was Waters XBridge C 18 column (150 mm x 4. 6 mm I. D., 5 µm). The mobile phase for C 18 column performed in isocratic <b>mode</b> <b>elution</b> consisting of acetonitrile:water (80 : 20,v/v). Stevioside were the most abundant steviol-glycosides (Rt = 4. 23 min) found in stevia rebaudiana leaves samples followed by rebaudioside A (Rt = 4. 28 min). The objective of analysis was achieved and this leads to the suggestion of using the Capcell Pak C 18 – MGII Column (250 mm x 4. 60 mm ID, 5 µm) as the replacement to the C 18 column that was used in this study. Also, it is a good practice if the sample was extracted using solid phase extraction method compare to the conventional practice using sohxlet extraction method...|$|R
