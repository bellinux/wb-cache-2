The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E

The Dancing Man, as well as Rye's energetic live performances, caught the interest of local New Jersey label Troubleman Unlimited Records, who offered to press a 7" [...] for the band. The record, entitled Teen-age Dance Session featured three songs and garnered the band further attention in the independent music scene. The 7" [...] was released at a time when many bands playing similar style of <b>emotionally</b> <b>charge</b> hardcore were being dubbed emo by fans. This classification would dog Rye Coalition for a good portion of their career, much to their dismay (as the never considered themselves a part of the so-called genre).|$|R

Our particular example is EU tobacco control and the lengthy effort to gain approval for a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising. The long delay occurred as national approaches to public health diverged, which then provided opportunities for private cigarette companies to block passage of the advertising ban in the Council of Ministers...|$|R

Harper Barnes, longtime editor and cultural critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, praised the film as a [...] "remarkable, intellectually daunting and mind-stirring documentary that deals with philosophical and psychological questions, but always in a Felliniesque way. It tells a story, one that is visually rich and <b>emotionally</b> compelling and <b>charged</b> with one of the great director's favorite concepts - expectation, the sense that something always new and marvelous will come along". Barnes placed it on his Top Ten list of the best films of 2003.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 46) This thesis {{examines the}} effect of mass media on dreams. Since dream content is influenced by memories or experiences which arouse or involve in a personal way, mass media presentations should influence those dreams. Three studies were conducted to compare the effects of viewing a highly <b>charged,</b> <b>emotionally</b> arousing film and viewing a neutral, pleasant film. All of these studies used natural communication situations, instead of sleep laboratories as in previous studies in dream research. Study# 1 attempted to obtain dream reports by phoning subjects the morning after viewing a film. This study was unsuccessful due to faulty methodology. Study# 2 obtained dream reports from subjects waiting to see two films at a local theater. Study# 3 obtained dream reports from diaries kept by college students who were randomly exposed to either of two films or no film. Dreams were analyzed and statistical significance was determined using a chi-square analysis of two-way contingency tables. The results showed more dream recall, longer dreams and more aggressive dream content after viewing a highly <b>charged,</b> <b>emotionally</b> involving film than after viewing a neutral, pleasant film. These results were also apparent before the subjects viewed the films, which were attributed to an anticipation factor. More significant influences were found on dream recall, dream length and aggressive content of dreams than on any incorporation of film material into dream reports. Thus, films were found to influence the quality and tone of dreams more often than being used as material for dream content. The conclusions from these studies indicate {{that there is an}} influence from media presentation on dreams...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{homeland}} usually {{appears as a}} concept quite <b>charged</b> <b>emotionally.</b> There are two different perceptions of “homeland”: the one that identifies the homeland as a concrete state and its borders and the other that faces the homeland {{as a product of}} the common language, land and culture. In this paper we attempt to investigate the significance of “homeland” in students’ answers of Greek universities. They answered in graduated Likerts’ scale which was created for the proposes of the research. The homeland, for the students, constitutes the coincidence of nation and state and also refers in territoriality and is connected with native land. The question that rises refers to the future of “homeland” as a community of peoples, who have inspired by common ideals, in nowadays, when borders are abolished and the border lines are revoked or undermined...|$|R
40|$|This book {{is highly}} topical {{considering}} the recent resurgence of violence by the PKK, the incursions into Northern Iraq by the Turkish army {{and security forces}} and Turkey’s EU accession negotiations. Turkey has become an increasingly important player in Middle Eastern geopolitics. More than two decades of serious conflict in Turkey are {{proving to be a}} barrier to improved relations between Turkey and the EU. This book is the first study to address fully the legal and political dimensions of the conflict, and their impact on mechanisms for conflict resolution in the region, offering a scholarly exploration of a debate that is often politically and <b>emotionally</b> highly <b>charged.</b> Kerim Yildiz and Susan Breau look at the practical application of the law of armed conflicts to the ongoing situation in Turkey and Northern Iraq. The application of the law in this region also means addressing larger questions in international law, global politics and conflict resolution. Examples include belligerency in international law, whether the ‘war on terror’ has resulted in changes to the law of armed conflict and terrorism and conflict resolution. The Kurdish Conflict explores the practical possibilities of conflict resolution in the region, examining the political dynamics of the region, and suggesting where lessons can be drawn from other peace processes, such as in Northern Ireland. This book will be of great value to policy-makers, regional experts, and others interested in international humanitarian law and conflict resolution...|$|R

Other diverse influences included Australian country musician, Chad Morgan, American C songs such as 'A Dear John Letter' and Sun Records era rockabilly artists including early Narvel Felts, {{as well as the}} newly emerging and more contemporary British American and Australian independent bands of the time.|$|E
25|$|Téchiné {{is noted}} for his elegant and <b>emotionally</b> <b>charged</b> films that often {{delve into the}} {{complexities}} of human condition and emotions. An intimist flavor pervades his work. One of the trademarks of his filmography is the lyrical examination of human relations in a sensitive but unsentimental way. Influenced by Roland Barthes, Bertolt Brecht, Ingmar Bergman, William Faulkner and the cinematic French New Wave, the originality of Téchiné's films lies in his subtle exploration of sexuality and national identity, as he challenges expectations in his depictions of gay relations, the North African dimensions of contemporary French culture, and the center-periphery relationship between Paris and his native Southwest. Shy and ascetic-looking, Téchiné does not opine on political issues and rarely appears on television. Fear of flying prevents him from attending most film openings or festivals more than a train ride from his Paris apartment overlooking the Luxembourg Garden.|$|E
25|$|The actor {{followed}} The Godfather with Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris opposite Maria Schneider, but Brando's highly noted performance {{threatened to}} be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual {{content of the}} film. Brando portrays a recent American widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci {{with the problem of}} keeping them out of the picture frame. The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant and Paul's angry, <b>emotionally</b> <b>charged</b> final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife. The controversial movie was a hit, however, and Brando made the list of Top Ten Box Office Stars for the last time. The voting membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences again nominated Brando for Best Actor, his seventh nomination. Although Brando won the 1973 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the actor did not appear at the ceremony or send a representative to pick up the award if he won.|$|E
50|$|A primary {{motivation}} within traditional Chinese {{philosophy is}} to preserve social harmony. It looks unfavorably upon anyone who attempts to disrupt this placidity. The election process {{that takes place in}} modern liberal democracy directly opposes this ideal. During election campaigns, the issues most frequently discussed {{are the ones that are}} highly <b>charged</b> <b>emotionally</b> and politically. In contemporary U.S. elections, controversial issues like abortion, gay marriage, military engagement in the Middle East and universal health care are at the forefront of campaigns. Chinese Confucians consider these controversial issues to be cleavages within the fabric of social harmony. Western politicians rely on utilizing these social cleavages to garner support from voters. In Chinese culture it would be an impropriety for a politician to exploit these social cleavages to achieve the personal goal of getting elected. Consequently, many of the more traditionalist Chinese people consider the election process of the West and western-influenced democracies to be quite arguably inappropriate as per Chinese culture.|$|R

Three design solutions were generated on the basis of architectural concerns and developed in the context of evaluation criteria.

Results indicate that existing preferences among decision makers may not be consistent with their public decisions and could be clarified given a more rigorous framework.

The result is a space installation counting two videos. First of them representing archive as a whole and second one is the series of the recordings of past actions...|$|R

It comes {{as a surprise to}} many that half the population of this region is Muslim, majority belonging to the Twelver Shi‘i sect and live in Kargil district. This article will discuss the importance of being Ladakhi for Kargili Shias through an ethnographic account of a journey I shared with a group of cultural activists from Leh to Kargil. A view of the landscape, natural and cultural, through their eyes provided a different, more eclectic portrayal of the region that ran counter to several historical depictions in the accounts of colonial explorers and travellers. I argue that the invocation and projection of Kargil’s Ladakhiness by these cultural activists has an element of artifice built into it. Yet this packaging of regional ‘culture’ signals an emergent cultural consciousness that spills beyond the politics of identity to an <b>emotionally</b> and intellectually <b>charged</b> process of self-definition that is underway. Riddled with debates as to what constitutes ‘regional culture’, the journey also lends insight into some aspects of contemporary cultural politics within Kargil...|$|R
