Located initially close to the Romanian quarter at 70 Hester Street, and later situated at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> with the move to Rivington Street, the synagogue was the preferred house of worship for the quarter's inhabitants.|$|E

They have done many prestigious things in their careers and no doubt will do many more. But it is clear they know they will never have more fun than doing this.|$|E

25|$|Inter {{struggled}} {{in their first}} two matches of the new season. The team lost the Supercoppa to Lazio 2–1 and drew 1–1 with newly promoted Bari at the San Siro. Mourinho's team improved dramatically after that, however, as he built a formidable midfield with Sneijder at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and the likes of new signing Thiago Motta and veterans Javier Zanetti and Dejan Stanković. Inter went on score more than 30 goals {{before the end of}} November, thrashing derby rivals Milan 4–0, with new signings Diego Milito and Motta both scoring, and hammering Genoa 5–0, the largest margin of victory in the Serie A that season. Mourinho was sent off in the December Derby d'Italia away fixture after he sarcastically applauded the referee for what he felt was a dubious free-kick given to Juventus and Inter went on to lose 2–1, courtesy of a Claudio Marchisio winner in the second half.|$|E

Which of course, for these two guys, is the entire theme of the show for them. So I think we've done that really well". Actor John Noble added, [...] "Tolerance. Acceptance. I loved 'Johari Window'. I thought it was one of my favourite stories".|$|E

I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E

Prior to appearing in Glee, Morris was a back-up dancer for Beyoncé Knowles.

Morris had a recurring role throughout the first season, and was promoted to a series regular for season two.

500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Tom and Travis are my friends. I'm sure Tom felt the tension and asked me as an offering. I was glad to have done it, and I was glad that he asked." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics of {{the concept}} argue that its vagueness {{undermines}} its effectiveness, {{that it has become}} little more than a vehicle for activists wishing to promote certain causes, and that it does not help the research community understand what security means or help decision makers to formulate good policies. Alternatively, other scholars have argued that the concept of human security should be broadened to encompass military security: 'In other words, if this thing called ‘human security’ has the concept of ‘the human’ embedded at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> then let us address the question of the human condition directly. Thus understood, human security would no longer be the vague amorphous add-on to harder edged areas of security such as military security or state security.' ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{called an}} {{election}} in 1925, in which the Conservatives won the most seats, but not {{a majority in the}} House of Commons. King held onto power {{with the support of the}} Progressives. A corruption scandal discovered late in his first term involved misdeeds around the expansion of the Beauharnois Canal in Quebec; this led to extensive inquiries and eventually a Royal Commission, which exposed the Beauharnois Scandal. The resulting press coverage damaged King's party in the election. Early in his second term, another corruption scandal, this time in the Department of Customs, was revealed, which led to more support for the Conservatives and Progressives, and the possibility that King would be forced to resign, if he lost sufficient support in the Commons. King had no personal connection to this scandal, although one of his own appointees was at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Opposition leader Meighen unleashed his fierce invective towards King, stating he was hanging onto power [...] "like a lobster with lockjaw".` ...|$|E
