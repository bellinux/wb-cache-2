5|$|Armenia's {{participation}} in a Chess Olympiad hosted in Azerbaijan was raised as a concern at the 83rd FIDE Congress in Istanbul in 2012 during discussions about Baku's nomination to host the Olympiad in 2016, with the Armenian representative protesting since Armenian chess players would find <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> difficult to play in Baku.|$|E
5|$|I find <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you}} write songs, you don't really think about performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

5|$|For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's {{decision}} not to mount an immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act {{could have been the}} unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the root of the quarrel between Cnut and Malcolm lies in Cnut's pilgrimage to Rome, and the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, where Cnut and Rudolph III, King of Burgundy had the place of honour. If Malcolm were present, and the repeated mentions of his piety in the annals make <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> possible that he made a pilgrimage to Rome, as did Mac Bethad mac Findláich ("Macbeth") in later times, then the coronation would have allowed Malcolm to publicly snub Cnut's claims to overlordship.|$|E
5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language {{with a high}} degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E

5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), makes <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> {{clear that}} infants {{become attached to}} carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E

25|$|Cooking in Rajasthan, an arid region, {{has been}} {{strongly}} {{shaped by the}} availability of ingredients. Because water is at a premium, food is generally cooked in milk or ghee, making <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> rich.

25|$|The giant rat (Canariomys bravoi): Fossils mostly {{dating from}} the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Its skull reached up to 7 centimeters long, so it could have reached {{the size of a}} rabbit, which would make <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> large {{compared}} to European species of rats. Tenerife Giant Rat fossils usually occur in caves and volcanic tubes associated with Gallotia goliath.|$|E
25|$|Since {{his reign}} was brief, {{and he may}} never {{have been more than}} co-regent, the {{evidence}} for Smenkhkare is not plentiful, but nor is <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> as insubstantial as it is sometimes made out to be.

25|$|From January 1968 until July 1968 Iommi was guitarist in Mythology, with Ward {{joining a}} month later in mid-February. In May 1968 police raided the group's {{practice}} flat and found cannabis resin, which resulted in fines for the band members. Most significantly, the incident made <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> difficult for the band to secure future bookings as most club owners avoided bands they viewed as drug users. Mythology subsequently split up after a gig in Silloth on 13 July 1968.|$|E
25|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) {{the fact that}} Wonder Woman {{had fallen in love}} with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop any suggestion that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made <b>it</b> <b>quite</b> clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E
