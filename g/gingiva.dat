5|$|The <b>gingiva</b> {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached <b>gingiva</b> is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the <b>gingiva</b> {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|The <b>gingiva</b> ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the <b>gingiva</b> which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} and has {{according to some}} reports been common in relatively recent times. As with lead, bismuth poisoning can result {{in the formation of}} a black deposit on the <b>gingiva,</b> known as a bismuth line. Poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol; however, evidence for benefit is unclear.|$|E
40|$|Background. Adverse {{effects of}} dental cast alloys {{on the health}} of {{patients}} are the problem in clinical practice. The aim of this paper was to describe the case of a patient with discolorated <b>gingivae</b> in the presence of fixed dental restorations and used diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Case report. A 30 -year old patient, presented with the complaints about unsatisfactory esthetic of his fixed dental restorations. He complained about the greyish discoloration of <b>gingivae,</b> inappropriate color of the crowns, and a larger space between the central incisors. Both discolorated and normal <b>gingivae</b> around the fixed dental restorations were taken by excision and the samples of <b>gingivae</b> were examined histopathologically, and by using the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry test (AAS). Histopathological examination of the discolorated <b>gingivae</b> showed the presence of non-specific inflammation with a foreign body. AAS revealed the presence of various metals in the samples and the higher metal contents in the samples of discolorated <b>gingivae</b> as compared with the samples of normal <b>gingivae.</b> New metal-ceramic crowns were made for the patient. Conclusion. A main cause of greyish discoloration of <b>gingivae</b> was presence of a metal in gingival tissue. After the excision of discolorated <b>gingivae</b> old metalceramic crowns should be replaced with new crowns...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Periodontitis is {{associated}} with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) in both serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). Although the liver is {{the primary source of}} CRP, extra-hepatic production of CRP has been reported. This study aimed to determine whether CRP in GCF is produced locally in the <b>gingivae.</b> Materials and Methods: <b>Gingivae</b> and GCF were collected from non-periodontitis and periodontitis sites. Presence of CRP in <b>gingivae</b> was assessed by immunohistochemistry. CRP in GCF was measured using ELISA. Gene expression for CRP in <b>gingivae</b> was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: CRP was found in both the <b>gingivae</b> and GCF. No <b>gingivae</b> had detectable amounts of CRP mRNA. Not all patients with periodontitis had detectable levels of CRP in the GCF. Some non-periodontitis patients had detectable levels of CRP in the GCF. Conclusion: CRP in the GCF appears to be of systemic origin, and therefore may be indicative of systemic inflammation from either a periodontal infection or inflammatory disease elsewhere. The correlation between levels of CRP in GCF and serum requires validation in future studies. Emma Megson, Tracy Fitzsimmons, Kencana Dharmapatni and P. Mark Bartol...|$|R
5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (<b>gingiva)</b> envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or <b>gingiva</b> due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} <b>gingiva</b> and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E
5|$|Plaque is a biofilm {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the <b>gingiva,</b> forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E

5|$|Soft tissue reflection: An {{incision}} is {{made over}} the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached <b>gingiva</b> roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each {{referred to as a}} flap are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E
5|$|When {{tissue is}} {{deficient}} or mutilated {{by the loss}} of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the <b>gingiva</b> is surgically moved around the healing abutments. The down-side of a two-stage technique is the need for additional surgery and compromise of circulation to the tissue due to repeated surgeries. The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump <b>gingiva</b> {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
40|$|Smoking {{patients}} show {{reduction of}} inflammatory clinical signs {{that might be}} associated with local vasoconstriction and an increased gingival epithelial thickness. The purpose of this work was to evaluate {{the thickness of the}} marginal gingival oral epithelium in smokers and non-smokers, with clinically healthy <b>gingivae</b> or with gingivitis. Twenty biopsies were obtained from four different groups. Group I: non-smokers with clinically healthy <b>gingivae</b> (n = 5). Group II: non-smokers with gingivitis (n = 5). Group III: smokers with clinically healthy <b>gingivae</b> (n = 5). Group IV: smokers with gingivitis (n = 5). These biopsies were histologically processed, serially sectioned at 5 mm, stained with H. E., and examined by image analysis software (KS 400), which was used to perform the morphometric evaluation and the quantification of the major epithelial thickness, the epithelial base thickness and the external and internal epithelial perimeters. Differences between the four groups were analyzed using ANOVA test and Tukey's test. The criteria for statistical significance were accepted at the probability level p < 0. 05. A greater epithelial thickness was observed in smokers independent of the gingival health situation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gingivae</b> {{represent}} a unique soft tissue {{that serves as}} a biological barrier to cover the oral cavity side of the maxilla and mandible. Recently, the <b>gingivae</b> were identified as containing mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs). However, it is unknown whether the GMSCs are derived from cranial neural crest cells (CNCC) or the mesoderm. In this study, we show that around 90 % of GMSCs are derived from CNCC and 10 % from the mesoderm. In comparison with mesoderm MSCs (M-GMSCs), CNCC-derived GMSCs (N-GMSCs) show an elevated capacity to differentiate into neural cells and chondrocytes and induce activated T-cell apoptosis in vitro.

5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached <b>gingiva,</b> the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|When an {{adequate}} band of attached tissue is absent, {{it can be}} recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods {{that can be used}} to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), <b>gingiva</b> from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E
5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The <b>gingiva</b> covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E
25|$|These types often coexist in {{the same}} individual. Oral lichen planus tends to present bilaterally as mostly white lesions on the inner cheek, {{although}} any mucosal site in the mouth may be involved.

5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous {{ulceration}} (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the <b>gingiva</b> (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the <b>gingiva</b> on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the <b>gingiva.</b> When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
