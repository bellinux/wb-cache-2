2500|$|Here, {{the captain}} {{received}} a letter from Lord Leathers, the head of the British Ministry of War Transport, bidding the master a personal welcome and [...] "...your safe arrival in the Clyde with the first cargo of oil carried in a United States tanker." [...] However, the euphoria that such a message brought to the crew soon turned into resentment and anger. A telegram was received the same day by the head office of Texaco, from the War Shipping Administration, announcing simply that Ohio was being requisitioned [...] "pursuant to the law". The immediate reaction was a cabled message from Mr. T.E. Buchanan, General Manager of Texaco's Marine Department to the firm's London agent, that on no account was Ohio to leave her <b>discharging</b> <b>port</b> of Bowling-on-the-Clyde. A period of indecision, meetings and debates between the highest American authorities and their British counterparts soon ensued. The master was told that further orders would arrive soon afterwards. The decision was finally taken two weeks later, when a launch sped out to the ship anchored in the Clyde and Texaco's London agent, accompanied by an official of the British Ministry of War Shipping came over the side. They met the Captain, who was informed that the ship was to be confiscated and handed over to a British crew. The American crew and the captain were exasperated by the seemingly outrageous order, but had no other option but to give in, and started to pack their kit whilst British seamen began to take the ship over.|$|E

Thus, this study, utilizing STAR CCM+, one of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) programs, analyzed the impact of air circulation and temperature distribution. Methods: After we visited numerous mushroom farms, we measured the temperature at the <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> of heaters, fan capacity, and {{the locations of the}} air circulators in the farms. According to the data, most mushroom growers installed the heaters near the entrance and <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> of the heaters at the third growing bed on the same height as the heaters in the entrance. The temperature at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of heater was 26 °C, and the fan capacity was 4, 500 m 3 /hr. The air circulator was placed {{in the center of the}} mushroom farm 50 cm above the ground, and its capacity of inlet port was 1, 100 m 3 /hr and <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> 1, 600 m 3 /hr. The mushroom farm was insulated. Results: According to the analysis of the temperature distribution in the vertical plane of the entrance side, no air circulation causes the high temperature zone of 296 ~ 299 K at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of the heater to take up 34 % of area while the operation of air circulators causes it to occupy only 9 %. This means that not using air circulators leads to a concentration of high temperature at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> near the entrance. In addition, with the results of the analysis of the temperature distribution in the vertical planes of the center, no air circulation causes the temperature zone of 295 ~ 298 K at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of the heater to take up 48 % of area while the operation of air circulators causes it to occupy 80 %.

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in many industries. It is considered that scroll compressors {{have the advantage of}} high efficiency, lower noise and vibration levels. There are various losses in a scroll compressor that need to be studied to achieve better efficiency, of which the most significant is the flow losses, especially the losses at discharge. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can be a useful tool in understanding the flow field and help reduce the flow losses through design optimizations. There are few numerical studies on the flow inside the scroll compressor. The reason is that defining the mesh and its movement in the scroll rotor can be demanding. The flow field of a scroll compressor is unsteady and 3 -dimensional, consisting of gas pockets with changing geometry and volume. More often than not, check valves are used at the discharge to prevent reverse flow, which complicates the setup of the numerical simulation. The present work demonstrates a newly developed rotor template tool for scroll compressors/ expanders. This scroll template generates high-quality structure mesh from the outlines of stationary and orbiting rotors, which are input from the user. The mesh movement is also automatically calculated to account for every position of the orbiting rotor, maintaining good grid quality and smooth movement through the whole revolution. The tool greatly simplifies the setup of the CFD simulation and can significantly reduce turn-around time. Moreover, the check valve is simulated with the flip valve template tool. Here, the bending deformation of the flexible reed valve plate is replaced by a rigid body rotation. With judicious choices of torsional elastic constant and preload torque, the valve opening {{at the center of the}} <b>discharging</b> <b>port</b> can be setup to mimic that of a flexible flap. The rotor and valve components are then combined, to provide a complete solution for scroll compressor/ expander flow simulations...|$|E

40|$|A new {{disposal}} unit, {{designated as}} Saltstone Disposal Unit 6 (SDU 6), is being designed for support of site accelerated closure goals and salt waste projections {{identified in the}} new Liquid Waste System Plan. The unit is a cylindrical disposal cell of 375 ft in diameter and 43 ft in height, {{and it has a}} minimum 30 million gallons of capacity. SRNL was requested to evaluate the impact of an increased grout placement height on the flow patterns radially spread on the floor and to determine whether grout quality is impacted by the height. The primary goals of the work are to develop the baseline Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and to perform the evaluations for the flow patterns of grout material in SDU 6 as a function of elevation of grout <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> and grout rheology. Two transient grout models have been developed by taking a three-dimensional multiphase CFD approach to estimate the domain size of the grout materials radially spread on the facility floor and to perform the sensitivity analysis with respect to the baseline design and operating conditions such as elevation height of the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> and fresh grout properties. For the CFD modeling calculations, air-grout Volume of Fluid (VOF) method combined with Bingham plastic and time-dependent grout models were used for examining the impact of fluid spread performance for the initial baseline configurations and to evaluate the impact of grout pouring height on grout quality. The grout quality was estimated in terms of the air volume fraction for the grout layer formed on the SDU 6 floor, resulting in the change of grout density. The study results should be considered as preliminary scoping analyses since benchmarking analysis is not included in this task scope. Transient analyses with the Bingham plastic model were performed with the FLUENTTM code on the high performance parallel computing platform in SRNL. The analysis coupled with a transient grout aging model was performed by using ANSYS-CFX code in the parallel computing platform in Mercer University. Recommended operational guidance was developed assuming that local shear rates and flow patterns related to radial spread along the SDU floor {{can be used as a}} measure of grout performance and spatial dispersion affected by the grout height and viscosity. The 5 ft height baseline results show that when the 150 gpm grout flow with a 5 Pa yield stress and a 60 cp viscosity is poured down through a 3 inch <b>discharge</b> <b>port,</b> the grout is spread radially up to about 64 ft distance from the pouring center after 2 hours&#x 27; pouring time. The air volume fraction of the grout layer is about 29 % at 5 minutes&#x 27; transient time, and it is reduced by about 9 % in 2 hours&#x 27; pouring time, resulting in the grout density consisting of about 80 % grout and 20 % air volume fractions. The sensitivity results show that when the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> is located at a higher position, a larger amount of air is trapped inside the layer formed below the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> at the early transient time of less than 30 minutes because of the higher impinging momentum of the grout flow on the floor, resulting in the formation of less smooth layer. The results clearly indicate that the radial spread for the 43 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> is about 10 % faster than that of the 5 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> for the early transient period of 5 minutes. However, for the pouring time longer than half an hour, the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> height does not affect the radial distance spread on the disposal floor. When grout quality is related to grout volume fraction, the grout volume fraction for the 43 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> has lower volume fraction than the 5 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> for the transient period of the first 5 minutes. However, for the pouring time longer than half an hour, the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> height does not affect the grout volume fraction for the layer accumulated on the disposal floor. A modified Bingham plastic model coupled with time-dependent viscosity behavior was developed for conducting the initial scoping calculations to assess the impact of fluid residence time on radial spreading and basic flow patterns. The results for the transient viscosity model show that when grout material becomes more viscous, the thickness of the grout layer accumulated on the floor becomes higher, but the radial distance spread on the horizontal floor becomes smaller. The early transient results for the grout density with about 32 % air volume fractions are in reasonable agreement with those of the idealized Bingham plastic model. It is recommended that the current models developed here be benchmarked against the experimental results for critical applications of the modeling results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Even in {{the absence}} of {{self-acting}} valves, flow through the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of a twin screw compressor is oscillatory in nature. This unsteady but periodic flow variation at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> excites the pressure pulsation, which is the main source of noise and vibration. In this paper, a mathematic model based on the one-dimensional unsteady gas flow equations is established to describe the discharge pressure pulsation, which considers the effects of friction and heat transfer between the gas and the pipe. The boundary conditions of the discharge pressure pulsation model are given in detail. The two-step Lax–Wendroff scheme is applied to solve the one-dimensional unsteady gas flow equations. In order to verify the theoretical analysis, the discharge pressure pulsations under various working conditions are measured and compared. It is shown that the model established in this paper is a useful tool to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of the pressure pulsation in discharge pipe. It is found that the most important factor that affects the discharge pressure pulsation is the pressure difference between the pressure upstream of the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> in the compression chamber and the pressure in the discharge line someway downstream. The minimum fluctuation occurs when the discharge pressure is equal to the pressure corresponding to the built-in volume ratio. For a constant discharge pressure, the pressure pulsation amplitude increases with the rotational speed...|$|R

This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC.
