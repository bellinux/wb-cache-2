40|$|OBJECTIVE: Progress {{towards the}} Millennium Development Goals for {{maternal}} health has been slow, and accelerated progress in scaling up professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> is needed. This paper describes poor-rich inequalities {{in the use}} of maternity care and seeks to understand these inequalities through comparisons with other types of health care. METHODS: Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 45 developing countries were used to describe poor-rich inequalities by wealth quintiles in maternity care (professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> and antenatal care), full childhood immunization coverage and medical treatment for diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). FINDINGS: Poor-rich inequalities in maternity care in general, and professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> in particular, are much greater than those in immunization coverage or treatment for childhood illnesses. Public-sector inequalities make up {{a major part of the}} poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery attendance. Even <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> provided by nurses and midwives favours the rich in most countries. Although poor-rich inequalities within both rural and urban areas are large, most births without professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> occur among the rural poor. CONCLUSION: Poor-rich inequalities in professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> are much larger than those in the other forms of care. Reducing poor-rich inequalities in professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> is essential to achieving the MDGs for maternal health. The greatest improvements in professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> can be made by increasing coverage among the rural poor. Problems with availability, accessibility and affordability, as well as the nature of the services and demand factors, appear to contribute to the larger poor-rich inequalities in <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> A concerted effort of equity-oriented policy and research is needed to address the huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity car...|$|E

40|$|Clinical pathway is {{a concept}} that from a {{managerial}} point of view promotes variance reduction in the <b>delivery</b> of health <b>care</b> and, therefore, is able to reduce costs. To achieve this, health care providers must improve efficiency in the use of resources while completing <b>delivery</b> of <b>care</b> in time with expected achievements in quality. Implementation of the clinical pathways for a specific disease requires a clear identification of tasks that compose the <b>care</b> <b>delivery</b> process by a multi-professional team including physicians, nurses, various therapists and/or health technologist and so on. From this perspective, implementing clinical pathways for a disease can be, therefore, conceptualized as an integrated project with many tasks.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} maternal pregnancy intention and professional antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> utilization. Our data were derived from the 2011 nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey.

We used multilevel logistic regression models to assess the relationship between pregnancy intention and use of professional antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care,</b> with adjustment for potential confounding variables. Approximately 13 % and 16 % of children were reported by their mothers as unwanted and mistimed at the time of conception, respectively. Among the women, 55 % received at least one professional antenatal care service; 21 % received four or more professional antenatal services, while 32 % were attended by professionals during deliveries. Mothers of children whose pregnancies had been unwanted had a greater risk for not seeking professional antenatal and professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> than those whose pregnancies had been wanted [1 ≥ ANC from professionals: AOR: 0. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 93; 4 ≥ ANC from professionals: AOR: 0. 56; 95 % CI: 0. 37 - 0. 84; and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> from professionals: AOR: 0. 70; 95 % CI: 0. 50 - 0. 97].

Another concern is, whether being poor {{and at the same}} time migrant leads to a double disadvantage in the utilization of maternal health services? This study aims to examine the trends and factors that affect safe <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> utilization among the migrants and the poor in urban India. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using data from the National Family Health Survey, 1992 – 93 and 2005 – 06, this study grouped the household wealth and migration status into four distinct categories poor-migrant, poor-non migrant, non poor-migrant, non poor-non migrant. Both chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed to examine the influence of household wealth and migration status on safe <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> utilization among women who had experienced a birth in the four years preceding the survey. Results suggest a decline in safe <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> among poor-migrant women during 1992 – 2006. The present study identifies two distinct groups in terms of safe <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> utilization in urban India – one for poor-migrant and one for non poor-non migrants. While poor-migrant women were most vulnerable, non poor-non migrant women were the highest users of safe <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> Conclusion: This study reiterates the inequality that underlies the utilization of maternal healthcare services not only by the urban poor but also by poor-migrant women, who deserve special attention.

Studies {{suggest that the}} participation of men in antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> is associated with better health care seeking behaviour, yet many reproductive health programs do not facilitate their involvement. This qualitative study conducted in rural Western Kenya, explored men's perceptions of antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> services and identified factors that facilitated or constrained their involvement. Eight focus group discussions were conducted with 68 married men between 20 - 65 years of age in May 2011. Participants were of the Luo ethnic group residing in Asembo, western Kenya. The area has a high HIV-prevalence and polygamy is common. A topic guide was used to guide the discussions and a thematic framework approach for data analysis. Overall, men were positive in their views of antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care,</b> as decision makers they often encouraged, some even 'forced', their wives to attend for antenatal or <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> Many reasons why it was beneficial to accompany their wives were provided, yet few did this in practice unless there was a clinical complication. The three main barriers relating to cultural norms identified were: 1) pregnancy support was considered a female role; and the male role that of provider; 2) negative health care worker attitudes towards men's participation, and 3) couple unfriendly antenatal and delivery unit infrastructure. Although men reported to facilitate their wives' utilisation of antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> services, this does not translate to practice as adherence to antenatal-care schedules and facility based delivery is generally poor. Equally, reasons proffered why they should accompany their wives are not carried through into practice, with barriers outweighing facilitators.

However, {{it is unclear whether}} financial reforms or health insurance can reduce delays and/or barriers or if there are still other important obstacles for preventing pregnant women accessing <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> This study aimed to assess the effect of health insurance and other factors on <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> utilization and the perception of delays and barriers to <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> among women living in Songkhla province, Thailand. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2007 to December 2008. Women who delivered at hospital or home in the areas of participating hospitals in four districts were interviewed at 24 - or 48 -hours postpartum. The impact of health insurance and other factors on outcomes of interest was assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Results Of 2, 847 women, 2, 822 delivered at a hospital and 25 at home, of which 80 % and 40 % had health insurance for <b>delivery</b> <b>care,</b> respectively. Muslims, low educated women, those who thought they could not use health insurance for <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> and those less willing to seek care at their delivery place were more likely to give birth at home. Perception of delays to seeking care, reaching a hospital and receiving care was reduced in women insured by civil servant medical benefit. Women insured by universal coverage and social security perceived a lower delay in reaching a hospital but a higher delay in receiving care. Low education, unwillingness to seek care, out-of-pocket payment, worry about cost of <b>delivery</b> <b>care,</b> transportation difficulties, low perception of receiving good care or a perception of being treated badly were also associated with delays and barriers to health care. Almost all (93 %) agreed that health insurance could reduce financial barriers for accessing services. However, having health insurance influenced them to seek care, reach a hospital, and receive care quickly in 50 %, 32 %, and 23 % of the women, respectively.
