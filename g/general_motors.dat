The company was founded in 1856 as a saddlery manufacturer in South Australia. In 1908 it moved into the automotive field, becoming {{a subsidiary of the}} United States-based <b>General</b> <b>Motors</b> (GM) in 1931 named General Motors-Holden's Ltd.

40|$|Learning to ride {{a bicycle}} is an {{important}} milestone in a child's life. Unfortunately, young traffic casualties remain overrepresented in traffic reports, with single-bicycle crashes as principal cause in children. This correlational, cross-sectional study focuses on the association between cycling skills and two intrinsic characteristics: <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> competence and body mass index (BMI). Therefore, <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> competence, BMI and practical cycling competence were measured in 9 -year-old children (n = 40). Significant correlations were found between cycling skills and <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> competence (r = 0. 434, p <= 0. 01), and between cycling skills and BMI (r = - 0. 400, p <= 0. 05). A multiple regression analysis revealed that children's <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> quotient and BMI together predicted 19 % of cycling skill score. These findings indicate that <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> competence and bicycle skills are not independent of each other stressing the importance of young children's characteristics when actively participating in traffic. In addition, BMI might be negatively associated {{with the development of}} cycling skills in children...|$|R

40|$|As <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> {{programming}} {{had previously}} {{been found to be}} related to consistency of hand preference (Keane, 1999), the present study attempted to elucidate what <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> programming involves by reinvestigating responses to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory in order {{to see if there was}} some consensus with regards to the items that tended to differentiate the consistent handers from the inconsistent handers. It was found that the opening a box item did differentiate the consistent handers from the inconsistent handers. Control of this type of bimanual task seems to be specifically related to the <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> programmer, and not hand preference as such...|$|R

Both degree of hand preference and familial sinistrality (FS) were taken into account.

The pattern of interference suggests that those with a consistent hand preference (right or left) have <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> programming in the left hemisphere. Those with an inconsistent strong hand preference probably have some degree of <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> programming in both hemispheres. No effect for FS was found for the lateralization of verbal processing or <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> programming...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} offline memory consolidation with regard to <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> skill learning and implicit sequence-specific learning. We trained young adults on a serial reaction time task with a retention interval of either 24 hours (Experiment 1) or 1 week (Experiment 2) between two sessions. We manipulated sequence complexity (deterministic vs. probabilistic) and motor responses (unimanual or vs. bimanual). We found no evidence of offline memory consolidation for sequencespecific learning with either interval (in the sense of no deterioration over the interval but no further improvement either). However, we did find evidence of offline enhancement of <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> skill learning with both intervals, independent of kind of sequence or kind of response. These results suggest that <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> skill learning, but not sequence-specific learning, appears to be enhanced during offline intervals in implicit sequence learning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new {{structure}} of hybrid cam-linkage mechanical press.

Then power and torque distribution of servo <b>motor</b> and <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> of the hybrid cam-linkage mechanical press is studied in ADAMS based on the simulation results. At last, torque of <b>general</b> <b>motor</b> and servo motor in practical work is analyzed by taking cold extrusion press as an example...|$|R

5|$|By 1923, HMBB were {{producing}} 12,000units per year. During this time, HMBB was {{the first}} company to assemble bodies for Ford Motor Company of Australia until its Geelong plant was completed. From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new Woodville plant. These bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as Chevrolet and Dodge. In 1926 <b>General</b> <b>Motors</b> (Australia) was established with assembly plants at Newstead, Queensland; Marrickville, New South Wales; City Road, Melbourne; Birkenhead, South Australia; and Cottesloe, Western Australia using bodies produced by Holden Motor Body Builders and imported complete knock down (CKD) chassis. In 1930 alone, the still independent Woodville plant built bodies for Austin, Chrysler, DeSoto, Morris, Hillman, Humber, Hupmobile and Willys-Overland as well GM cars. The last of this line of business was the assembly of Hillman Minx sedans in 1948. The Great Depression led to a substantial downturn in production by Holden, from 34,000units annually in 1930 to just 1,651units one year later. In 1931 <b>General</b> <b>Motors</b> purchased Holden Motor Body Builders and merged it with <b>General</b> <b>Motors</b> (Australia) Pty Ltd to form General Motors-Holden's Ltd (GM-H). Throughout the 1920s Holden also supplied tramcars to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board, of which several examples have been preserved in both Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
