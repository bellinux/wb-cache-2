It is now generally agreed among geologists that the Earth was at first a mass of molten matter; and that it is still fluid and incandescent at the distance of a few miles beneath its surface. Originally, then, it was homogeneous in consistence, and, in virtue of the circulation that takes place in <b>heated</b> <b>fluids,</b> must have been comparatively homogeneous in temperature; and it must have been surrounded by an atmosphere consisting partly of the elements of air and water, and partly of those various other elements which assume a gaseous form at high temperatures. That slow cooling by radiation which is still going on at an inappreciable rate, and which, though originally far more rapid than now, necessarily required an immense time to produce any decided change, must ultimately have resulted in the solidification of the portion most able to part with its heat--namely, the surface. In the thin crust thus formed we have the first marked differentiation. A still further cooling, a consequent thickening of this crust, and an accompanying deposition of all solidifiable elements contained in the atmosphere, must finally have been followed by the condensation of the water previously existing as vapour. A second marked differentiation must thus have arisen: and as the condensation must have taken place on the coolest parts of the surface--namely, about the poles--there must thus have resulted the first geographical distinction of parts. To these illustrations of growing heterogeneity, which, though deduced from the known laws of matter, may be regarded as more or less hypothetical, Geology adds an extensive series that have been inductively established. Its investigations show that the Earth has been continually becoming more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of the strata which form its crust; further, that it has been becoming more heterogeneous in respect of the composition of these strata, the latter of which, being made from the detritus of the older ones, are many of them rendered highly complex by the mixture of materials they contain; and that this heterogeneity has been vastly increased by the action of the Earth's still molten nucleus upon its envelope, whence have resulted not only a great variety of igneous rocks, but the tilting up of sedimentary strata at all angles, the formation of faults and metallic veins, the production of endless dislocations and irregularities. Yet again, geologists teach us that the Earth's surface has been growing more varied in elevation--that the most ancient mountain systems are the smallest, and the Andes and Himalayas the most modern; while in all probability there have been corresponding changes in the bed of the ocean. As a consequence of these ceaseless differentiations, we now find that no considerable portion of the Earth's exposed surface is like any other portion, either in contour, in geologic structure, or in chemical composition; and that in most parts it changes from mile to mile in all these characteristics.|$|E

Yet again, geologists teach us that the Earth's surface has been growing more varied in elevation--that the most ancient mountain systems are the smallest, and the Andes and Himalayas the most modern; while in all probability there have been corresponding changes in the bed of the ocean. As a consequence of these ceaseless differentiations, we now find that no considerable portion of the Earth's exposed surface is like any other portion, either in contour, in geologic structure, or in chemical composition; and that in most parts it changes from mile to mile in all these characters. Moreover, there has been simultaneously going on a differentiation of climates. As fast as the Earth cooled and its crust solidified, there arose appreciable differences in temperature between those parts of its surface more exposed to the sun and those less exposed. As the cooling progressed, these differences became more pronounced; until there finally resulted those marked contrasts between regions of perpetual ice and snow, regions where winter and summer alternately reign for periods varying according to the latitude, and regions where summer follows summer with scarcely an appreciable variation. At the same time the many and varied elevations and subsidences of portions of the Earth's crust, bringing about the present irregular distribution of land and sea, have entailed modifications of climate beyond those dependent on latitude; while a yet further series of such modifications have been produced by increasing differences of elevation in the land, which have in sundry places brought arctic, temperate, and tropical climates to within a few miles of one another. And the general outcome of these changes is, that not only has every extensive region its own meteorologic conditions, but that every locality in each region differs more or less from others in those conditions; as in its structure, its contour, its soil. Thus, between our existing Earth, the phenomena of whose crust neither geographers, geologists, mineralogists, nor meteorologists have yet enumerated, and the molten globe out of which it was evolved, the contrast in heterogeneity is extreme.|$|E

However, not all seawater that circulates through the oceanic crust is heated to high temperatures. "Diffuse flow" is a catchall term to describe low-temperature (< 0. 2 ° to ~ 100 °C) fluids that slowly discharge through sulfide mounds, fractured lava flows, and assemblages of bacterial mats and macrofauna.

40|$|The {{problem of}} heat {{transfer}} in pipe flow {{has been extensively}} investigated in the past. Many different models have been proposed and adopted to predict the velocity profile, the eddy diffusivity, the temperature distributions, the friction factor and the heat transfer coefficient (Kays et al., 2004; Schlichting & Gersten, 2000). However, the majority of such studies give {{a description of the}} problem for non-internally <b>heated</b> <b>fluids.</b> Models regarding fluids with internal heat generation have been developed more than 50 years ago (Kinney & Sparrow, 1966; Poppendiek, 1954; Siegel & Sparrow, 1959), giving in most cases a partial treatment of the problem in terms of boundary conditions and heat source distribution, and relying on a turbulent flow treatment that does not seem fully satisfactory in the light of more recent investigations (Churchill, 1997; 2002; Kays, 1994; Zagarola & Smits, 1997). Internally <b>heated</b> <b>fluids</b> are of great interest in the current development of Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) (LeBlanc, 2010), included as one of the six innovative nuclear reactors selected by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV, 2002) for a more sustainable version of nuclear power. MSRs are circulating fuel reactors (Nicolino et al., 2008), which employ a non-classical (fluid-type) fuel constituted by a molten halide (fluoride or chloride) salt mixture playing the distinctive role of both heat source and coolant. By adopting classical correlations for the Nusselt number (e. g., Dittus-Boelter), the heat transfer coefficient of the MSR fuel can be overestimated by a non-negligible amount (Di Marcello et al., 2008). In the case of thermal-neutron-spectrum (graphite-moderated) MSRs (LeBlanc, 2010), this has significant consequences on the core temperature predictions and on the reactor dynamic behaviour (Luzzi et al., 2011). Such influence of the heat source within the fluid cannot be neglected, and thus required proper investigation. The present chapter deals with this critical issue, first summarizing the main modelling efforts carried out by the authors (Di Marcello et al., 2010; Luzzi et al., 2010) to investigate the thermo-hydrodynamics of internally <b>heated</b> <b>fluids,</b> and then focusing on the heat transfer coefficient prediction that is relevant for analysing the molten salt behaviour encountered in MSRs. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 provides {{a brief description of the}} Molten Salt Reactors, focusing on their distinctive features, in terms of both sustainability (i. e., reduced radioactive waste generation, effective use of natural resources) and safety, with respect to the traditional configuration of nuclear reactors. Section 3 deals with the study of molten salt heat transfer characteristics, which represent a key issue in the current development of MSRs. In particular, a "generalized approach" to evaluate the steady-state temperature distribution in a representative power channel of the reactor core is presented. This approach incorporates recent formulations of turbulent flow and convection (Churchill, 1997; 2002), and is built in order to carefully take into account the molten salt mixture specificities, the reactor core power conditions and the heat transfer in the graphite core structure. In Section 4, a preliminary correlation for the Nusselt number prediction is advanced in the case of simultaneous uniform wall heat flux and internal heat generation, on the basis of the results achieved by means of the presented generalized approach. In Section 5, the main conclusions of the present study are summarized...|$|E

If significant, he passage of these <b>heated</b> <b>fluids</b> through the sediment pile will leave a thermal signature which can be measured at the present-day using palaeotemperature determinants such as vitrinite reflectance and apatite fission track analysis (AFTATM). The interpretation f palaeotemperature-depth profiles, particularly the slope of a palaeotemperature-depth profile, i. e. the palaeogeothermal gradient, allows fluid-induced temperature profiles to be distinguished from those due to simple conduction of basal heat flow. Steady-state systems, typified by large-scale ateral fluid flow in foreland basins or where low-temperature hydrothermal circulation systems occur associated with intrusions and thick volcanic piles, are characterized by dog-length geothermal gradients, with high-interval gradients near the surface, above the shallowest aquifer, and lower interval gradients beneath an aquifer.

Fine-grained soils, in particular clays, pose a serious problem for conduction of heat due to very high thermal resistivity.

The potential of coal ash (i. e., in the form of either fly ash or lagoon ash) as a suitable backfill material, when mixed with cement, sand, and aggregates, has been explored by several researchers and is well established. However, with increasing amounts of lagoon ash being disposed of at thermal power plants, it is important to study its effectiveness as a fluidizing agent and its use in designing a proper fluidized thermal bed (FTB). Based on laboratory tests on different soils, generalized equations for estimating soil thermal resistivity have been developed in the recent past.

40|$|Vibrations {{acting on}} a fluid with density {{gradient}} induced by temperature variations can cause relative flows. High-frequency vibration leads to the appearance of time-averaged (mean) flows (or streaming flows), which can essentially affect heat and mass transfer processes. This phenomenon is most pronounced {{in the absence of}} other external forces (in particular, static gravity). In this work, an extensive experimental and computational study of thermal vibrational convection in a reduced-gravity environment of a parabolic flight is performed. The transient evolution of the temperature field in a cubic cell subjected to translational vibration is investigated by optical digital interferometry. The mean flow structures previously reported in numerical studies are confirmed. The transition from four-vortex flow to a pattern with a large diagonal vortex and two small vortices is observed in the transient state. The experiments reveal a significant enhancement of heat transfer by vibrational mean flows with increasing the vibrational strength. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulation with real microgravity profile and two-dimensional numerical modelling based on averaging approach provide a very good agreement with the experimental results. The influence of residual gravity on heat transfer and bifurcation scenario is first investigated numerically and correlated with the experimental data.

Authigenic K-feldspars show microtextural similarities to patch perthites; that is subgrains separated by dislocation-rich boundary networks that potentially act as fast diffusion pathways for radiogenic argon. The two generations of authigenic K-feldspar in the Fucoid Bed sandstones can be distinguished by different microtextural zones, bulk mineral compositions, fluid-inclusion populations, and inferred temperatures and chemistries of parent fluids. Ar–Ar age data obtained using high-resolution ultraviolet laser ablation, show that the first cementing generation is Ordovician and the second cementing generation is Silurian. Modelling of Ar diffusion using subgrain size as the effective diffusion dimension and a simplified tectono–thermal thrust model assuming transient heating of the Fucoid Beds is inconsistent with observed data. Removal of heat from the thrust zone through rapid flushing of <b>heated</b> <b>fluids</b> rather than transient heating can be invoked to explain the observed Ar–Ar ages for both generations of cement. Alternatively, Ar-diffusion modelling using overgrowth thickness as the effective diffusion dimension instead of subgrain size also yields models that are consistent with both the Fucoid Bed palaeothermal maxima and determined Ar–Ar age ages for the two generations of K-feldspar cement.

And it presents two methods to prevent <b>heat</b> transfer <b>fluids</b> from oxidation by arranging directly cooling coils or pulsating heat pipes in the expansion tank; it also provides the schematic diagram of those methods as well as comparatively analyzes their advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|Low thermal {{conductivity}} {{is a primary}} limitation {{in the development of}} energy-efficient <b>heat</b> transfer <b>fluids</b> that are required in many industrial applications. In this paper we propose that an innovative new class of <b>heat</b> transfer <b>fluids</b> can be engineered by suspending metallic nanoparticles in conventional <b>heat</b> transfer <b>fluids.</b> The resulting {open_quotes}nanofluids{close_quotes} are expected to exhibit high thermal conductivities compared to those of currently used <b>heat</b> transfer <b>fluids,</b> and they represent the best hope for enhancement of heat transfer. The results of a theoretical study of the {{thermal conductivity}} of nanofluids with copper nanophase materials are presented, the potential benefits of the fluids are estimated, and it is shown that {{one of the benefits of}} nanofluids will be dramatic reductions in heat exchanger pumping power...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for trapping solar energy for <b>heating</b> a <b>fluid</b> {{that could be}} subsequently used in turbines and similar devices. The apparatus includes an elongated vertical light pipe having an open end through which the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from the sun passes to strike a tubular absorber. The light pipe has a coated interior surface of a low absorptivity and a high reflectivity at the visible wavelengths and a high absorptivity/emissivity ratio at infrared wavelengths. The tubular absorber has a coating on the surface for absorbing visible wavelengths to <b>heat</b> the <b>fluid</b> passing through. Infrared wave lengths are radiated from the tubular absorber back into the light pipe for <b>heating</b> <b>fluid</b> passing through a tubular coil wound around it...|$|R
