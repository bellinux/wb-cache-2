5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would {{find it hard to}} maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, it was hard for the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E
5|$|The Australian squadrons {{played a}} limited {{role in the}} allied advance from Amiens on 8 August 1918, with No. 3 Squadron engaged in {{reconnaissance}} and contact patrols to help identify the locations of forward troops. They also undertook extensive aerial photography to aid in remapping and the locating of German artillery positions. During this period Nos. 2 and 4 Squadrons were in the Ypres–Arras area and were involved in patrols and raids on the railways {{in the vicinity of}} Lille. With the Germans in retreat during September 1918, the squadrons felt considerable pressure <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> up. Regardless, No. 4 Squadron took part in, perhaps its most spectacular action, in the very last weeks of the war. On 29 October, 15 Australian Sopwith Snipes encountered more than 60 German Fokkers, in an action which became one of the largest air battles of the war. The Australians gained the upper hand and 10 Fokkers were shot down for the loss of one Snipe, and the damage of several others.|$|E

25|$|The {{final day}} of the meeting was {{highlighted}} by Martina Ratej's first round Slovenian record throw to win the women's javelin contest, upsetting the defending champion and favourite Mariya Abakumova. Markus Münch provided his second personal best in as many years at the Winter Throwing event, but on this occasion his best was enough to take the gold in the men's discus. Following gold at the 2010 World Indoors, Nadzeya Astapchuk dominated the women's shot put: six of her throws that day were enough to win, although an injury hampered her performance and she was far from her best form. The men's hammer was a close contest with the experienced Nicola Vizzoni <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> the young Belarusian Yury Shayunou at bay. Sandra Perković was one of the stand-out performers in the under-23s competition: having set a Croatian national record in the discus in the weeks prior to the competition, she won the women's gold with a throw of 61.93m – which would have been enough for a silver medal in the senior ranks.|$|E

500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I {{had a field day}} every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Quake's mindset {{when the}} episode picks up, actress Chloe Bennet said, [...] "She's not doing well. She's {{had a rough}} couple of years. She's taking some time and I think it's kind of her way of {{protecting}} the people that she cares about. Everyone she's gotten close to, something bad has happened to them. It's her weird, selfish way of protecting them". This, the character's assertion in the episode to Ghost Rider that she [...] "deserves to die". Concerning the character Fitz keeping the android Aida a secret from his girlfriend Simmons, actor Iain De Caestecker said, [...] "They're trying to maintain a healthy relationship while being secret undercover spies that have secret assignments ... it's with the best intentions, keeping stuff from her, I suppose.

500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

2500|$|IUT {{introduces}} {{and works}} with deformations of multiplication, by deconstructing and reconstructing arithmetic objects. Deconstruction allows one to “forget” [...] the addition, <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> multiplication. One keeps certain information about symmetries of the objects, these symmetries form a group (the absolute Galois group and the arithmetic fundamental group). IUT addresses such fundamental aspects in mathematics as to which extent the multiplication and addition on numbers cannot be separated from one another. IUT studies deformations of multiplication. It measures the results of such deformations and produces bounds of how much the original object can be deformed. The gist is that it cannot be deformed too much. This leads to solutions of several famous problems including the abc conjecture. IUT uses various reconstruction algorithms of anabelian geometry.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2013, Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige {{confirmed that}} the film rights to Daredevil and his associated characters reverted to Marvel from 20th Century Fox in October 2012, allowing those characters to be used within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As explained by head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb in 2015, Marvel Studios had [...] "first dibs" [...] on the character once the rights had reverted. Drew Goddard pitched a new Daredevil film to Marvel, but Marvel was not looking to create an R-rated film, and Goddard did not want a [...] "watered down version" [...] of the character, as he also explained in 2015: [...] "I went into Marvel and talked to them about making it as a movie {{a couple of years}} ago, long after the Affleck movie. But what we all sort of realised is that, this movie doesn't want to cost $200 million. The thing about Matt Murdock is, he's not saving the world. He's <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> his corner clean. So it would feel wrong to have spaceships crashing {{in the middle of the}} city. But because of that, Marvel on the movie side is not in the business of making $25 million movies.

[...] Thus far they have succeeded in seeing Grade II listing applied by English Heritage to six buildings on the estate including St. Mark's Church. [...] The conservation of the estate has been spearheaded by the Twentieth Century Society; claiming that the overall layout and planning of the estate is key to its uniqueness and that <b>just</b> <b>keeping</b> six buildings and surrounding them with new houses does not suffice. [...] Despite the Twentieth Century Society campaigning for the entire estate to be made a conservation area and English Heritage recommending 21 buildings be listed, the Department for Culture would {{only go so far}} as to list six of the buildings. [...] Under listing guidelines for twentieth-century buildings, only buildings with few moderations should be listed; in the case of Excalibur, most buildings have modified windows and doors. [...] A prominent local resident favouring conservation stated: [...] "The Excalibur Prefab Estate is the largest of its kind now left in Europe. Europe values its war time history, we on the estate think it’s time we did too." [...] Emily Gee of English Heritage said of the estate: [...] "The historical resonance of the estate is considerable. The design of the buildings, with their subtle modern influences, and the community-focused planning of the estate testifies to the thoughtfulness of post-Blitz reconstruction." ...|$|E
