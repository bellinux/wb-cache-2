40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{circumstances}} in which the MFB will support the removal of canvas hose from existing <b>hydrant</b> <b>installations.</b> It is to be noted that a Building Surveyor is the person having the authority to approve the deletion of hose from existing hydrants. The process involves the issuing of a building permit by the (relevant) building surveyor to carry out demolition work. 2. Scope This guideline is intended to cover only existing <b>hydrant</b> <b>installations</b> designed and installed under previous regulations, which required the hydrants to be equipped with canvas hose. Current Building Regulations and relevant Australian Standards do not contain any reference to the equipping of hydrants. A Practice Note (No. 31) - “Deletion Of Hose From Existing Fire Hydrants” issued by the Building Commission should be referenced in conjunction with this Guideline. 3. Body In line with the Australian Standard (AS 2419. 1), the MFB regards hydrants as a facility primarily for their use. Accordingly, when hydrants are used, the MFB will provide their own equipment. However, there may be some instances where equipped hydrants may be required, eg as a decision associated with a Regulation 309 Report and Consent (under the Building Regulations 2006) or a dangerous goods report (compiled under relevant Dangerous Goods legislation).

This is {{due to a lack of}} existing fire <b>hydrants</b> available for <b>installation</b> that already meet the EPA's rule. Supporters also argued that communities would be stuck with millions of dollars' worth of non-compliant fire hydrants they could not use if the EPA's rule took effect. Adding additional urgency to the situation, winter is when more hydrants are replaced due to damage from freezing or being hit by cars driving on slippery roads.|$|R
