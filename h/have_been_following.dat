5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then {{make decisions based on}} what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. The windows {{are believed to have}} been purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Rome, Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, the Abbot of Abingdon and the king's goldsmith, as his {{successor to the}} bishopric of London, claiming that Pope Leo IX had forbidden the consecration. Almost certainly the grounds were simony, the purchase of ecclesiastical office, as Leo had recently issued proclamations against the practice. In refusing to consecrate Spearhafoc, Robert may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> his own interests against the wishes of both the king and Godwin, as {{he had his own}} candidate, a Norman, in mind. In the end Robert's favoured candidate, William the Norman, was consecrated instead of Spearhafoc. Robert also discovered that some lands belonging to Canterbury had fallen into Godwin's hands, but his efforts to recover them through the shire courts were unsuccessful. Canterbury had lost control of some revenues from the shire of Kent to Godwin during Eadsige's tenure as archbishop, which Robert unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim. These disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between Robert and Godwin, which had begun with Robert's election. Robert's election had disrupted Godwin's patronage powers in Canterbury, and now Robert's efforts to recover lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury challenged the earl's economic rights. Events came to a head at a council held at Gloucester in September 1051, when Robert accused Earl Godwin of plotting to kill King Edward. Godwin and his family were exiled; afterwards Robert claimed the office of sheriff of Kent, probably on the strength of Eadsige, his predecessor as Archbishop, having held the office.|$|E

25|$|McKenna {{stated that}} due to the {{desertification}} of the African continent at that time, human forerunners were forced from the increasingly shrinking tropical canopy in search of new food sources. He believed they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> large herds of wild cattle whose dung harbored the insects that, he proposed, were undoubtedly part of their new diet, and would have spotted and started eating Psilocybe cubensis, a dung-loving mushroom often found growing out of cowpats.|$|E
25|$|The {{brown rat}} is nocturnal {{and is a}} good swimmer, both {{on the surface and}} underwater, and has been {{observed}} climbing slim round metal poles several feet in order to reach garden bird feeders. Brown rats dig well, and often excavate extensive burrow systems. A 2007 study found brown rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only found in humans and some primates, but further analysis suggested they may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> simple operant conditioning principles.|$|E

25|$|There are {{generally}} two components of metacognition: knowledge about cognition, and regulation of cognition. Writings on metacognition {{can be traced}} back {{at least as far as}} De Anima and the Parva Naturalia of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to sapient species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience. There is evidence that rhesus monkeys and apes can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty, while attempts to demonstrate metacognition in birds have been inconclusive. A 2007 study provided some evidence for metacognition in rats, but further analysis suggested that they may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E

[...] Adams said that strong plots such as Pam's realization about her relationship with Jim were rushed, and that other plots, like Dwight's, were made to [...] " [...] out the clock". M.

500|$|Dinesh Raheja from Rediff {{stated that}} Kapadia's {{involvement}} in art films happened {{at a time}} when she [...] "exhausted her appetite for playing the pretty prop in hero-oriented films", arguing that they [...] "honed Dimple's talent for lending fine striations to complex emotions." [...] According to Raheja, Kapadia's casting in Dil Chahta Hai and Leela, in which she played [...] "an older woman who is the object of a younger man's affection" [...] served as [...] "a kind of tribute to her eternal beauty." [...] M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune commented, [...] "All those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> Dimple Kapadia's career from Bobby, Lekin and Rudaali will assert that she is more talented than glamorous." [...] Ranjan Das Gupta calls her [...] "an instinctive actress, spontaneous and intelligent" [...] but he notes that her beauty is [...] "her asset as well as limitation". Kapadia describes herself as [...] "a competent actress yet to deliver her best".|$|E
500|$|Majora's Mask {{takes place}} {{a few months}} after [...] and begins with Link searching for his {{departed}} fairy, Navi. While riding through a forest in Hyrule on his horse Epona, Link is ambushed by the masked Skull Kid and his fairy accomplices Tatl and Tael, who steal both Epona and his musical instrument, the Ocarina of Time. Link follows them down a dark cave, where he confronts the Skull Kid, who curses him by turning him into a Deku Scrub. Tatl stops Link from going after the Skull Kid as the latter escapes with Tael through a door, but is then separated from them when the door closes behind them. Realizing she needs Link's help to find them, Tatl insists that they work together. Link follows the Skull Kid through the cave into the inside of the Clock Tower in the land of Termina. There, he meets the Happy Mask Salesman, who seemed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> him. The salesman offers to help Link heal his curse, in exchange for which he must retrieve both the Ocarina of Time and the Majora's Mask from the Skull Kid. The Skull Kid, having stolen the Majora's Mask from the salesman, became possessed by its overwhelming power and transformed into an uncontrollable fiend who inflicts certain misfortune on others, the worst of which is an impending apocalypse: the moon is now set to collide with the world in approximately three days time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term [...] "military brat" [...] is unknown.

[...] There have been American military brats dating back 200 years to the birth of the United States. Military spouses and their children <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> armies for thousands of years, perhaps for as long as there has been organized warfare. [...] The term [...] "Little Traveller", used to describe the travelling child of a soldier (following his or her father's army from place to place), also appears in literature as early as 1811.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{following}} {{the publication of}} his article, Trevor-Roper began to retreat from these charges. At the time of his article, Kersten had just been nominated by the Dutch government for the Nobel Peace Prize for thwarting a Nazi plan to deport the entire Dutch population, based primarily on Kersten's own claims to this effect. A later investigation by Dutch historian Louis de Jong concluded that no such plan had existed, however, and that Kersten's documents were partly fabricated. [...] Following these revelations and others, Trevor-Roper told journalist Barbara Amiel in 1995 that he was no longer certain about the allegations, and that Bernadotte may merely <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> his orders to rescue Danish and Norwegian prisoners. [...] A number of other historians have also questioned Kersten's account, concluding that the accusations were based on a forgery or a distortion devised by Kersten.|$|E
