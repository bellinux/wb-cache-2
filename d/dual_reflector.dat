5000|$|M2 is the {{hyperbolic}} sub-reflector of the <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> Cassegrain system {{and has a}} diameter of 3.28 metres. It is made from a carbon fibre shell covered in {{a thin layer of}} aluminium foil. The requirement on the surface flatness is tighter than for the primary due to the scaling of the main beam size and comes in at 53 microns RMS. It has two nominal movement phase firstly a fine motion to correct for defocusing as a small defocus at the secondary is magnified 21 times at the Cassegrain focus and which can result in large coupling losses especially at high frequencies. Secondly a large axial displacement is also possible (1 metre) which allows the holographic receptor to be placed in the focus of the parabolic reflector.|$|E
50|$|The ARIESXXI radio {{telescope}} is an alt-azimuthal design with a rotating head above an azimuthal bearing or turning head. It has full 360-degree movement in azimuth and horizon to horizon coverage in elevation (180 degrees total or slightly less?). As previously mentioned the telescope is Nasmyth-Cassegrain model {{that consists of}} a parabolic primary reflector and a hyperbolic secondary reflector that brings the dual system to a focus some 11 metres below, within {{the structure of the}} telescope housing, via a beam-guide. The optical configuration of the tertiary Nasmyth system is such that the focus is always maintained in the same place as the flat Nasmyth mirrors track the movement of the principle axis of the <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> to ensure a constant illumination of the receivers. This allows the receiver antennas to remain fixed in position and greatly simplifies the opto-mechanical design of the receiver suite.|$|E

40|$|A <b>dual</b> {{paraboloid}} <b>reflector</b> system conserves {{the source}} brightness by producing a real {{image of the}} arc on the target space. Traditional elliptical and parabolic reflector tends to degrade {{the brightness of the}} arc due to the angular dependence of the magnification such that the image at the target space is the superposition of multiple images of the arc with varying degree of magnifications. In this paper, we present steps for optimizing a projection illumination system consisting of the <b>dual</b> paraboloid <b>reflectors.</b> The effects of various parameters including reflector sizes, scattering and angular extents were evaluated using ray-tracing model.

5000|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>reflector</b> shaping: The {{presence}} of a second reflecting surface in the signal path allows additional opportunities for tailoring the radiation pattern for maximum performance. For example, the gain of ordinary parabolic antennas is reduced because the radiation of the feed antenna falls off toward the outer parts of the dish, resulting in lower [...] "illumination" [...] of those parts. In [...] "dual reflector shaping" [...] {{the shape of the}} secondary reflector is altered to direct more signal power to outer areas of the dish, resulting in more uniform illumination of the primary, to maximize the gain. However, this results in a secondary that is no longer precisely hyperbolic (though it is still very close), so the constant phase property is lost. This phase error, however, can be compensated for by slightly tweaking the shape of the primary mirror. The result is a higher gain, or gain/spillover ratio, at the cost of surfaces that are trickier to fabricate and test. [...] Other dish illumination patterns can also be synthesized, such as patterns with high taper at the dish edge for ultra-low spillover sidelobes, and patterns with a central [...] "hole" [...] to reduce feed shadowing.|$|E
40|$|A bifocal <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna {{is similar}} to and has better scan {{capability}} than classical cassegrain reflector antenna. The method used in determining the reflector surfaces is a modification of a design method for the dielectric bifocal lens. The three dimensional <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> is obtained by first designing an exact (in geometrical optics sense) two-point corrected two dimensional reflector and then rotating it around its axis of symmetry. A point by point technique is used in computing the reflector surfaces. Computed radiation characteristics of the <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> are {{compared with those of}} a cassegrain reflector. The results confirm that the bifocal antenna has superior performance...|$|E
40|$|Reflector antennas {{are widely}} used in {{communication}} satellite systems because they provide high gain at low cost. Offset-fed single paraboloids and <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> offset Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas with multiple focal region feeds provide a simple, blockage-free means of forming multiple, shaped, and isolated beams with low sidelobes. Such antennas are applicable to communications satellite frequency reuse systems and earth stations requiring access to several satellites. While the single offset paraboloid {{has been the most}} extensively used configuration for the satellite multiple-beam antenna, the trend toward large apertures requiring minimum scanned beam degradation over the field of view 18 degrees for full earth coverage from geostationary orbit may lead to impractically long focal length and large feed arrays. <b>Dual</b> <b>reflector</b> antennas offer packaging advantages and more degrees of design freedom to improve beam scanning and cross-polarization properties. The Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas are the most commonly used <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> antennas. A computer program for calculating the secondary pattern and directivity of a generalized <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna system was developed and implemented at LeRC. The theoretical foundation for this program is based on the use of physical optics methodology for describing the induced currents on the sub-reflector and main reflector. The resulting induced currents on the main reflector are integrated to obtain the antenna far-zone electric fields. The computer program is verified with other physical optics programs and with measured antenna patterns. The comparison shows good agreement in far-field sidelobe reproduction and directivity...|$|E
40|$|Both {{geometrical}} optics (GO) /aperture-field and physical-optics (PO) methods are used {{extensively in the}} diffraction analysis of offset parabolic and <b>dual</b> <b>reflectors.</b> An analytical/numerical comparative study is performed to demonstrate {{the limitations of the}} GO/aperture-field method for accurately predicting the sidelobe and null positions and levels. In particular, it is shown that for offset parabolic reflectors and for feeds located at the focal point, the predicted far-field patterns (amplitude) by the GO/aperture-field method will always be symmetric even in the offset plane. This, of course, is inaccurate for the general case and it is shown that the physical-optics method can result in asymmetric patterns for cases in which the feed is located at the focal point. Representative numerical data are presented and a comparison is made with available measured data...|$|R

The {{surface of the}} shaped subreflector is expressed using {{a new set of}} equations employing differential geometry. The proposed equations require {{only a small number of}} parameters to accurately describe practical shaped subreflector surfaces. A geometrical optics (GO) based method is used to synthesize the shaped main reflector surface corresponding to the shaped subreflector. Using the proposed method, a shaped Cassegrain <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> system is designed. The field scattered from the subreflector is calculated using uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD).

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the offset {{geometry}} for <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> antennas is attractive for satellite communications where low side lobes are necessary to achieve good isolation between adjacent main lobes operating over the same frequency band. A description is presented of a new, numerically rigorous technique for synthesizing dual offset reflectors. The objective of the synthesis procedure is to transform a given primary feed pattern into a desired aperture distribution through two reflections in an offset <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> system. It is found that a given specification for the aperture distribution does not always lead to a smooth solution for the two surfaces. In this event, the so-called energy condition on the specified amplitude distribution is relaxed, and an approximate solution which satisfies the energy condition only within a certain numerical tolerance is derived...|$|E

40|$|A dual offset Gregorian system leaky-wave antenna {{realized}} in PCB {{technology has been}} presented. An antenna prototype has been manufactured and tested.

A pins-made feed, that uses EBG concepts, PCB extension of the one presented in [4] has been used to efficiently feed the <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> system. However it has not been discussed here for the sake of brevity. Good performance of the antenna has been observed. The planar <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> system could be used in future planar imaging system applications, to achieve antennas with independent beams in the azimuth and elevation planes, resorting to frequency reuse and multiple focal plane feeds. The scanning of the pointing angle with the frequency is observed. In particular since the final user of these antenna is a radar system whose beam is scanned {{as a function of the}} frequency, the frequency squint that was observed in Fig. 3 should not be considered a disadvantage...|$|E

40|$|Some of the {{features}} of single and <b>dual</b> parabolic-cylinder <b>reflector</b> antenna systems are discussed in terms of wave conversions, field divergence, and wavefronts in Fresnel and Fraunhofer regions. Beam-squinting, by mechanical displacement and electrical phase gradient methods, is introduced together with the combination of these methods. In the case of dual parabolic cylinders there is also a discussion of surface-truncation, parametric representation of surface intersections, main-aperture blockage by the subsystem, and beam squinting. A few diffraction patterns are presented to illustrate the type of data available via a formulation equivalent to the complex-vector Kirchhoff-Kottler formulation. Main and cross-polarization components of the solution are available as they are inherently part of the field solution in the Cartesian coordinate system. A means of displaying main and cross-polarization components for arbitrary beam-scanning in space is outlined.

40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation is {{committed}} to reducing vehicle-deer collision incidents on the Indiana Interstate I- 80 / 90 {{as well as on}} the other roads. Very few of the studies to reduce vehicle-deer collisions incorporated any sound and complete statistical design. Some states (California, Colorado, Maine, Ontario-Canada, Washington State and Wyoming) have found that the use of wildlife reflectors did not reduce vehicle-deer collisions. However, some other states (British Columbia-Canada, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington State and Wisconsin) found that the use of wildlife reflectors did reduce vehicle-deer collisions. The main objective of this experimental study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Reflectors in reducing vehicledeer collisions. The experimental design uses one-mile long road sections for each combination of reflector colors (red and blue/green), reflector spacing (30 m and 45 m), reflector design (single and <b>dual</b> <b>reflectors),</b> and median (one with and one without reflectors). In this design there are sixteen treatment combinations. A complete set of treatment combinations is called a replicate and the design had two replicates. Two one-mile control sections were placed at each end of each replicate. Data for the peak months of April, May, October and November was used in the data analyses. Poisson Regression models were used to analyze the data. No statistically significant differences among reflectors combinations or between reflectors and controls were found. When comparing all combined reflector sites with all combined control sites, the Poisson Regression Analyses indicate that the difference between the Poisson Mean (μ) of the all reflectors sections and all the control sections is statistically significant. The use of reflectors provides an expected reduction in deer-vehicle collisions of 19 % with 95 % confidence limits of 5 % to 30 %. Maximum reduction is associated with 100 ft spacing regardless of the reflector color, median with or without reflectors, single or double reflectors. The cost effectiveness of this reduction will be behind any decision to use reflectors to reduce vehicle-deer collisions...|$|R

It {{consists of a}} rectangular horn antenna array as receiving/transmitting unit and a <b>dual</b> offset <b>reflector</b> setup to match the radiated field(s) to {{the pattern of the}} receiving antenna(s). To verify both design and adjustment of the quasi-optical circuit, electric field scans have been performed in selected planes and volumes of the setup. To measure the spatial electric field distribution, a vector field measurement system has been developed which operates in the frequency range between 148 GHz and 152 GHz. Excellent agreement between calculated and measured results for a horn antenna array approve the predicted results calculated under the physical optics approximation. Measured power dividing/combining efficiency of the passive structure of 63 % for an inter-element spacing of 10 $ lambda$ indicates that the power combining principle is a suitable method up to submillimeter wavelengths...|$|R

40|$|A 20 GHz {{downlink}} {{satellite antenna}} design is described. The aperture simultaneously radiates 18 fixed, 0. 3 deg width pencil beams directed at 18 cities distributed over CONUS for Trunking Service. All beams {{use the same}} trunk frequency allocation for 18 reuses of the band. The same aperture also radiates six additional 0. 3 deg spot beams for Customer Premises Service (CPS) for TDMA beam hopping operation to small terminals anywhere in CONUS. Each CPS beam scans one sector of CONUS and all six beams are frequency reused in a CPS band. Offset <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> optics are used with a feed array and multiport beam forming network (BFN). For so many frequency reuses, sidelobes per beam must be 30 to 40 dB down over CONUS. Novel <b>dual</b> <b>reflector</b> optics were devised with shaped surfaces providing low aberrations for all beam positions over CONUS (+ or - 12 BW by + or - 5 BW). Scan loss under 1 dB is calculated with nearly constant sidelobes. For each beam position, a 7 -element cluster of feeds is activated in the feed array with coefficients adjusted by the BFN to maintain low sidelobes and thus high beam isolation for frequency reuse...|$|E

Concerning the synthesis of <b>dual</b> shaped <b>reflectors,</b> it has been shown for circular symmetric reflectors that an exact GO solution can be found to the problem of transforming, by two reflections, any feed pattern into any aperture distribution. This problem involves solving two simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The same approach for offset geometry leads to two simultaneous nonlinear partial differential equations. It is shown that these equations could also be integrated numerically, except that in general these equations are not total and therefore, in general, {{they do not have a}} 'smooth' solution. It is further shown that the offset partial differentials often very nearly form a total differential in many cases of practical importance...|$|R
