5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> which {{the most powerful}} executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of direct democracy. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E

40|$|A {{consolidate}} democracy supposes {{a capable}} state, and both require strong nation and active civil society. Several <b>democracies</b> <b>in</b> Latin America fail to attain such requirements {{because they did}} not complete their capitalist revolutions, and the economic surplus continues to depend on the direct control of the state. This fact shows that the quality of democracies varies from country to country, and predicts that the possible <b>democracies</b> <b>in</b> the poorer countries will be necessarily limited <b>democracies.</b> <b>In</b> so far as democracy became a justification for foreign pressure and foreign intervention, {{it is a mistake to}} include in the concept of democracy more than its minimum, procedural, requirements. On the other hand, in order to improve democracy it is necessary to enhance state capacity not only to assure the rule of law, but also to promote economic and social development. ...|$|R

5|$|Described as the {{definitive}} deathblow to <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, {{and contributed to}} long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of civil war followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a genocide of the Maya peoples.|$|E
