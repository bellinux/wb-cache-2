He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> seldom happened.|$|E
500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E
500|$|Eight years {{previous}} to the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two {{had just}} completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairytales out of a love of [...] "mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds." [...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them... <b>For</b> <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– going at it that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope". Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof aided {{in the development of the}} series as a consultant, but had no official credit for the pilot.|$|E

500|$|During Kariya's second season, he {{was chosen}} {{to play for the}} Western Conference in the 1996 All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative. At the time of his selection, in January 1996, he was ranked 14th in League scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games. He later {{replaced}} the injured Pavel Bure of the Vancouver Canucks on the West's starting lineup. Kariya scored a goal and an assist for the Western Conference in a 5–4 loss to the Eastern Conference. Less than a month after the All-Star Game, the Mighty Ducks acquired Finnish winger Teemu Selänne in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets. Despite Kariya's efforts, the Ducks were low-scoring as a team; the deal was designed to give Kariya offensive support. Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, [...] "Paul had {{a lot of pressure on}} him...He singlehandedly won some games <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> year...Now that we have Teemu, there's no way everybody can just key on Paul." [...] Selänne was immediately placed on Kariya's line; centred by Rucchin, the two wingers formed one of the League's most high-scoring duos for several seasons. In the last month of the 1995–96 campaign, Kariya achieved the 100-point single-season mark with a goal and three assists in a 5–3 win against the San Jose Sharks on April 7, 1996. A week later, he became the 14th-youngest NHL player to register 50 goals in one season, scoring twice in the final game of the campaign, a 5–2 win over Winnipeg. With seven goals and seven assists over the final seven games of the season, Kariya was named NHL Player of the Month for April. He finished the season with 50 goals and 58 assists for 108 points, tying him with Selänne for seventh overall in NHL scoring. His three overtime goals set a team record. With 20 penalty minutes over 82 games, Kariya won the Lady Byng Trophy as the League's most gentlemanly player and was also named to the season-ending NHL First All-Star Team. Following the addition of Selänne, the Mighty Ducks pushed for a playoff spot, winning 12 of their final 15 games, but finished the season ninth place in the West (the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs); they had an equal 78 points to the eighth-ranked Jets, but finished a spot below them by virtue of having fewer wins.|$|E

She is very exacting and a professional who seeks perfection in everything she does, and this was no exception. The oversized and wraparound designs are sexy and very feminine, like our clothes.

2500|$|On February 7, 1996, the Mighty Ducks made a {{blockbuster}} {{deal with the}} Winnipeg Jets, sending Chad Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky and a third-round draft pick to the Jets in exchange for Marc Chouinard, a fourth-round draft pick and, most notably, star right winger Teemu Selanne. [...] Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, [...] "Paul [...] {{had a lot of}} pressure on him... He singlehandedly won some games <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> year... Now that we have Teemu, there's no way everybody can just key on Paul." [...] These three players formed one of the most potent lines of their time.

2500|$|Healthy in Paranoid Times was {{met with}} mixed reviews. It was loved and hated by many critics who either called it the band's best work to date or their weakest. It was also called [...] "their most sonically mature album to date." [...] and their best album since Clumsy by Circle 6 Magazine. At the time, the band praised their own efforts on the album. Duncan Coutts said in an interview, [...] "I {{think this is the}} closest we've ever come to {{achieving}} what we heard in our heads and got on (record). <b>For</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> is the most complete record, start to finish.

2500|$|... 1995–96 {{would mark}} {{a big change}} for the team, {{especially}} for second-year superstar Paul Kariya. During the season, he was chosen {{to play for the}} Western Conference in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative. At the time of his selection, (January 1996), Kariya was ranked 14th in league scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games, although the Ducks were overall a low-scoring team. Then a midseason blockbuster deal with the Winnipeg Jets improved the franchise. The Ducks sent Chad Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky and a third round pick to the Jets in return for Marc Chouinard, a fourth round draft pick and right winger Teemu Selanne. Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, [...] "Paul [...] had {{a lot of pressure on}} him... He singlehandedly won some games <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> year...

2500|$|The band's first {{performance}} in 2005 {{was at the}} Live 8 concert, Barrie, Ontario on July 2 where the song [...] "Where Are You" [...] was premiered in its final form. For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> new record {{is one of those}} things where there are a lot of little guitar parts happening all over the place and little textures -- and we want to hear that stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto. The band entered a hiatus period after this while Maida worked on his solo album, The Hunter's Lullaby. They wouldn't play live again until mid-2008.|$|E

2500|$|By contrast, many {{recent studies}} of the Greek word pistis have {{concluded}} that its primary and most common meaning was faithfulness, meaning firm commitment in an interpersonal relationship. As such, the word could be almost synonymous with [...] "obedience" [...] when {{the people in the}} relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to [...] "lack of human effort", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need [...] "faithfully" [...] to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying {{that we need to have}} [...] "faith" [...] that he will do everything <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> <b>This</b> is also argued to explain why James was adamant that [...] "faith without works is dead" [...] and that [...] "a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone" [...] (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to [...] believe places one on the same level as the demons (see James 2). The [...] "new" [...] perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended [...] "faith" [...] to mean a full submission to God.|$|E
