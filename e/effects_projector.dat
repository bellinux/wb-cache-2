5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic <b>effect.</b> <b>Projectors</b> were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|R

Unlike traditional restoration algorithms that operate on a blurred image to recover the original, {{the nature of our}} problem requires that the correction be applied to the original image before blurring.

40|$|Abstract The screen-door <b>effect</b> or <b>projector</b> pixelation is {{a visual}} {{artifact}} produced by many digital projectors. In this paper, {{we present a}} real-time projector depixelation framework for displaying high resolution videos. To attenuate pixelation, we use the common defocusing approach of setting the projection a little out-of-focus. Using a camera-projector pair, our system efficiently measures the spatially-varying defocus kernel and stores it as a texture on the graphics hardware. We explore two novel techniques {{to compensate for the}} defocusing blur in real-time. First, we develop a steepest descent algorithm on the GPU for estimating the optimally deblurred video frames based on the measured defocus kernel. Second, we present a novel optical flow algorithm that uses an illumination ratio map (IRM) to model illumination transformations between consecutive frames. We store both the IRM and optical flow as textures. To process a frame at runtime, we use the textures to warp the optimized previous frame into an initialization for the iterative GPU optimization. We show that our GPU optimization achieves one magnitude acceleration using this warping. Experiments on various video clips show that our framework can realize real-time video playback with significantly reduced pixelation and defocus while preserving fine details and temporal coherence...|$|R

Can {{you tell the}} number of projectors making up the display? Abstract — Multi-projector displays show significant spatial variation in 3 D color gamut due to variation in the chromaticity gamuts across the <b>projectors,</b> vignetting <b>effect</b> of each <b>projector</b> and also overlap across adjacent projectors. In this paper we present a new constrained gamut morphing algorithm that removes all these variations and results in true color seamlessness across tiled multiprojector displays. Our color morphing algorithm adjusts the intensities of light from each pixel of each projector precisely to achieve a smooth morphing from one projector’s gamut to the other’s through the overlap region. This morphing is achieved by imposing precise constraints on the perceptual difference between the gamuts of two adjacent pixels. In addition, our gamut morphing assures a C 1 continuity yielding visually pleasing appearance across the entire display. We demonstrate our method successfully on a planar and a curved display using both low and high-end projectors. Our approach is completely scalable, efficient and automatic. We also demonstrate the real-time performance of our image correction algorithm on GPUs for interactive applications. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first work that presents a scalable method with strong foundations on perception and realizes, for the first time, a truly seamless display where the number of projectors cannot be deciphered.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{stochastic}} continuity equation (SCE) on R^d under low regularity assumptions on the coefficients. This is the equations for the mass associated to an SDE on R^d. In the first chapter Wiener pathwise uniqueness (i. e. uniqueness for solutions adapted to Brownian filtration) is proved for the SCE,. We use Wiener chaos to reduce Wiener uniqueness for the SCE to uniqueness for the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The method consists of projecting the equation on the Wiener chaos spaces and using the shift <b>effect</b> of the <b>projectors</b> in order to discard the Ito integral. The second chapter {{deals with the}} SCE for flows, following Le Jan- Raimond’s approach. Here we need that the FPE admits a particular semigroup as solution, which is guaranteed by the theory of Dirichlet forms under mild assumptions on the coefficients. Wiener chaos gives Wiener uniqueness (as before) and also existence. Another method of existence is based on filtering a weak solution X of the associated SDE with respect to a certain cylindrical Brownian motion W. In the third chapter, we consider the case of a rough drift. Here a phenomenon of regularization by noise can be observed: the results in the first chapter give immediately Wiener uniqueness for the SCE, while uniqueness does not hold in the deterministic case without additional hypotheses on the drift. We cite an example of this phenomenon. We prove also that, in many cases, strong uniqueness (i. e. Uniqueness with respect to every filtration, not only Brownian filtration) holds for the SCE. This is not surprising since a strong uniqueness result (due to Krylov- Röckner) holds for the SDE. First, extending Ambrosio’s approach, we associate to every measure-valued solution of the SCE a superposition solution N. Then, starting from N, we build a weak solution of the SDE. This correspondence and Krylov-Röckner’s result imply strong uniqueness for the SCE. The last chapter is about a particular class of generalized flows, the isotropic Brownian flows (IBFs). An IBF is a family of Brownian motions, indexed by their starting points in Rd, which are invariant in law for translation and rotation; it can be found as (possibly generalized) solution S of an SCE with isotropic infinitesimal covariance function K. Here we consider K’s driven by two parameters α and η, related respectively to the correlation of the two-point motion and to the compressibility of the flow. Studying the distance between the motions of two points (which is a 1 -dimensional diffusion), we find that coalescence and/or splitting occur, depending of the values of α, η and d. This analysis makes rigorous the results for a simple model of turbulence and shows that this situation cannot be described classically, thus motivating the theory of generalized flows. Finally two appendices recall preliminaries and technical results...|$|R
