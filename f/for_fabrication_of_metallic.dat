Green biological method of synthesizing nanoparticles has materialized as alternative to overcome the curb of conventional methods such as synthesized by several physical and chemical methods including chemical reduction of ions in aqueous solution with or without stabilizing agent and reduction in inverse micelles or thermal decomposition in organic solvents. Employing plants towards synthesis of nanoparticles has advantageous over non biological methods as with the presence of broad variability of bio-molecules in plants can act as capping and reducing agents and thus increases the rate of reduction and stabilization of nanoparticles.

30|$|Nanomaterial-delivered {{fabrication}} [1 - 7] is {{a critical}} step toward realization of molecular architecture/electronics and nano-bio material engineering. Among conventional technologies, it corresponds to the additive nanofabrication method, representing a bottom up approach for nanostructures and nanodevices, which deposits materials onto a substrate. Such additive methods can be classified into two categories: beam-based writing [8, 9] and pen-type lithography [10, 11]. The direct laser writing is a typical beam-based lithography method and {{has the advantage of}} a fast prototyping speed, but it cannot be used to deposit beam-inactive materials. The electron-beam-based and the focused-ion-beam-based lithography allow high-resolution fabrication of various nanomaterials but the required high particle energy and long writing time limit their applications to nanodevice fabrication. On the other hand, the pen-type nanofabrication method such as the dip-pen nanolithography exhibits the advantages of higher throughput and lower energy consumption than the beam-based methods along with previous contributions of nano-dispensing [12 - 15] and scanning probe lithography methods [16 - 18]. However, it also suffers from both lack of continuous writing capability and limited ink selectivity. Recently, the meniscus-confined electrodeposition of electrolytes has been developed <b>for</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> <b>metallic</b> structures, but its application is restricted to the conducting substrate because it employs the electric field-induced delivery [19].|$|E
30|$|To {{overcome}} this problem, an electrodeposition technique without a mold was proposed [9, 10]. Using this electrodeposition method, {{the time and}} cost required <b>for</b> the <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> <b>metallic</b> microstructures can be significantly reduced. Moreover, electrodeposition methods allow the formation of various shapes of the metal alloy structure by controlling simple variables such as the stirring rate, temperature, and applied current density [11, 12].|$|R

30|$|The {{essential}} of nanotechnology is {{to synthesize}} dispersed nanoparticles for potential applications in optics, biomedical sciences, drug delivery, catalysis and electronics. In the past, number of {{methods such as}} chemical [1, 2, 3, 4], photochemical [5, 6, 7, 8] and thermal [9, 10] {{have been developed to}} synthesize metallic nanoparticles. Recently an efficient method <b>for</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> <b>metallic</b> nanoparticles from metallomicelles is reported [11]. Among these methods, photochemical method has gained considerable attention due to its convenience, but it employs toxic chemicals as reducing and stabilizing agent [12]. To avoid the utilization of highly toxic chemicals, the use of microorganisms and plant parts for nanoparticles synthesis has been explored [13]. Previous reports mention the use of microorganisms such as Alternaria alternate [14], and Amylomyces rouxii [15] for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Recently, several plants extracts such as Annona squamosa [16], Arbutus unedo [17], Cassia angustifolia [18] and many others [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] have been used to synthesize silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs). However, these natural sources, which have active ingredients, produce nanoparticles at slower rate. To overcome this, photo-assisted biosynthesis of Ag and AuNPs using many plants has been qualitatively investigated [28]. The sunlight irradiation technique has been formerly reported for the synthesis of nanoparticles using few plant materials such as Allium sativum [29], Andrachnea chordifolia [30], Piper betle [31], Bacillus amyloliquefaciens [32] and Achyranthus aspera [33]. Apart from plant materials, dendrimers and starch are also used as reducing/stabilizing agents in the sunlight-induced synthesis of nanoparticles [34, 35]. The nanoparticles produced by bio route have good stability due to the presence of capping agents like alkaloids, flavonoids and polyphenols, which are the major constituents present in the natural sources.|$|E
40|$|Thanks to {{exemplary}} {{experiments on}} fuel atomising using injection nozzles, fabricated in this project, we could {{prove that the}} techniques of UV depth lithography with a high aspect ratio and the micromolding are suitable <b>for</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> <b>metallic</b> microstructures. So far a cost efficient and large scale oriented application is restricted to single layer microstructures of approx. 50 #mu#m in thickness. Concerning microstructures thicker than 50 #mu#m different photoresists are available. However resist properties and processing procedures need to be improved for an successful industrial application. For multilayer microstructures {{it makes sense to}} develop new photoresists whose properties are specially tailored for these applications. Electrodepostion techniques have been improved decisively in the source of the project. Still it does not meet the requirements of an industrial application. The further development should be possible utilizing the equipment, designed and manufactured within this project. The curtain coating technique is an important addition to spin coating. That way it is possible to coat surfaces of any shape within photoresist. The used UV exposure equipment is generally suited for the application. In order to reach the demanded projection accuracy it was necessary to investigate the contact exposure. This results in a high mask contamination. The development of optics for proximity exposure would lead to a substantial cost reduction. There is a considerable need for action concerning the development of a production-suited technique for wet chemical developing of thick photoresists that is qualified for high volume manufacturing. The measurement- and analysis procedures developed by the project partners show sufficient measurement accuracy for lateral and vertical dimensions. With appropriate automation the equipment can be easily integrated into a production line. (orig.)

40|$|Some of the {{challenges}} in evaluating the stress-strain response of nanomaterials involve the fabrication of flaw-free samples that will reliably give mechanical test data reflecting the bulk material properties independent of geometric effects of sample size or embedded flaws. Magnetron sputtering at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies provides <b>for</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> <b>metallic</b> multilayers such that (i) the growth-induced residual stresses and flaws/porosity are minimized, (ii) the individual layer thicknesses are well-controlled in the nanometer range, and (iii) the overall sample thickness is sufficient to make self-supported foils. This precise control over length scales allows for systematic investigation {{of the effects of}} increasing the amount of interfacial content on material behavior. Figure 1 is a cross-sectional transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of a sample with 5 -nm layer thickness, although layers of alternating Cu and Nb can be easily varied in thickness to investigate length scales (and accompanying deformation mechanisms) from hundreds of nanometers to ~ 1 nm in samples with identical chemical composition. The laminar nature of the composites is evident from the micrograph, with the (111) planes of fcc-Cu and (110) planes of bcc-Nb forming the interface between the two phases, as shown in the diffraction pattern embedded selected area. Once deposited, nanolayered composites can be deformed utilizing a variety of methods, including rolling 2, tension 3, indentation 4, or as in this case, micropillar compression. Focused ion beam (FIB) machining has opened opportunities for fabrication of micropillar samples, where a Ga+ ion beam is used to remove material to shape a sample to high precision. 5, 6 The inset scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micro-graph in Figure 2 shows such a pillar with nominal dimensions of a diameter of 4 µm and a height of 8 µm.

40|$|In this study, a novel {{manufacturing}} process is proposed {{as an alternative}} method <b>for</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> double <b>metallic</b> bipolar plates from initially flat thin sheets. The proposed process combined hydroforming of thin sheet metal blanks to create micro-channel arrays with in-die mechanical bonding to create double bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation to result in thin, lightweight, and flexible bipolar plates where flow fields are formed {{on both sides and}} internal cooling channels are formed in the middle, eliminating further welding, assembly and sealing operations otherwise required with the existing methods. For a successful development of the proposed process, different scientific and research issues are investigated and discussed in this study. First, to characterize the material behavior of thin sheet metals at micro-scale, hydraulic bulge tests are performed to investigate the so-called “size effects” (i. e., grain, specimen, and feature size) on the material behavior. Based on the bulge test results, new material models are developed to include the size effect parameters. Second, to understand the deformation mechanics of thin sheet metals in micro-feature fabrication under complex loading conditions, hydroforming of different micro-channel sizes using thin sheets is performed. Effects of channel design and process condition on the overall channel formability are discussed. With the use of FEA and appropriate material models, a parametric study is conducted to establish design guidelines for process and tooling design. Third, a mechanical bonding process, specifically, pressure welding of thin sheet metals, is investigated to gain a full understanding of the process limitation and characterization. The understanding from the welding tests suggests different process windows for successful bonding of thin sheets. Finally, predictive process models of the hybrid process are developed using a finite element (FE) tool for rapid evaluation the process producibility. Based on the simulation results, a set of experimental tooling is developed and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid process <b>for</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> fuel cell bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} AFM {{nanolithography}} techniques for surface modification. Some techniques rely on mechanical (contact) {{interactions between the}} probe and the sample [6 – 9]. Various hard or soft materials can be directly removed by the typical mechanical [9, 10] or thermomechanical [11] scratching technique. In this field, soft polymer materials are widely used as masking or resisting materials in the <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> many devices, and polymer films have been also used to create patterns in their surfaces by an AFM tip with a radius of about 10 nm [12, 13]. Sohn and Willett [14] described a novel technique for plowing patterns in masks or resistance material on an arbitrary substrate, in which material can then be deposited <b>for</b> the <b>fabrication</b> <b>of</b> <b>metallic</b> nanostructures. Cappella and Sturm presented a dynamic plowing nanolithography method (DPL) [15 – 17]. In their method, surface modification occurred through plastic deformation of the material surface after being plowed by a vibrating tip. They also compared DPL with indentation by means of force displacement curves; {{results showed that the}} border walls surrounding the lithographed structures using DPL method were much bigger than those created through indentation. Another branch of AFM nanolithography involves the flow of electrical current between the probe (or tip) and the sample. In this field, local oxidation of silicon surfaces is used as a very promising lithographic method by which to create a modified surface at a nanometer scale. Garcia et al. [6] studied the effects and results for the reproducibility, voltage dependence, and kinetics for when oxidation occurred by using dynamic force microscopy modes. In another study involving electrical current and oxidation, Perez-Murano et al. [7] adopted a local oxidation method to grow silicon oxide mounds with nanometer scale on the Si(100) surfaces exposed to air by utilizing an AFM tip in tapping mode. While Gan et al. [8] proposed automatic patterning with AFM through local anodic oxidation, with numerous oxide structures being successfully created to demonstrate the ability of this low cost and accurate system.|$|R
