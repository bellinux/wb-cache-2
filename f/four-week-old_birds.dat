40|$|Abstract Vaccination of {{chickens}} has become routine practice in Asian {{countries in which}} H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is endemically present. This mainly applies to layer and breeder flocks, but broilers are usually left unvaccinated. Here we investigate whether vaccination is able to reduce HPAI H 5 N 1 virus transmission among broiler chickens. Four sets of experiments were carried out, each consisting of 22 replicate trials containing a pair of birds. Experiments 1 - 3 were carried out with <b>four-week-old</b> <b>birds</b> that were unvaccinated, and vaccinated at day 1 or at day 10 of age. Experiment 4 was carried out with unvaccinated day-old broiler chicks. One chicken in each trial was inoculated with H 5 N 1 HPAI virus. One chicken in each trial was inoculated with virus. The course of the infection chain was monitored by serological analysis, and by virus isolation performed on tracheal and cloacal swabs. The analyses {{were based on a}} stochastic SEIR model using a Bayesian inferential framework. When inoculation was carried out at the 28 th day of life, transmission was efficient in unvaccinated birds, and in birds vaccinated at first or tenth day of life. In these experiments estimates of the latent period (~ 1. 0 day), infectious period (~ 3. 3 days), and transmission rate parameter (~ 1. 4 per day) were similar, as were estimates of the reproduction number (~ 4) and generation interval (~ 1. 4 day). Transmission was significantly less efficient in unvaccinated chickens when inoculation was carried out {{on the first day of}} life. These results show that vaccination of broiler chickens does not reduce transmission, and suggest that this may be due to the interference of maternal immunity. </p...|$|E
