40|$|We {{have used}} a cascade {{bioassay}} system and <b>isolated</b> arterial <b>ring</b> preparations to investigate the contribution of Ca 2 + release from endothelial intracellular stores to nitric oxide (NO) production evoked by increases in shear stress and by acetylcholine in rabbit aorta. Experiments were performed before and following incubation with either the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitors cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 10 [*]μM) and thapsigargin (TSG, 1 [*]μM) or ryanodine (30, 100 [*]μM) which binds to a specific endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-release channel. In cascade bioassay all three agents induced relaxations of the recipient ring (CPA, 24. 4 ± 3. 8 %; TSG, 51. 5 ± 10. 6 %; ryanodine, 17. 4 ± 1. 6 %) which were significantly attenuated by preincubation of the donor with 100 [*]μM NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). However, in <b>isolated</b> <b>rings,</b> only CPA and TSG induced L-NAME-sensitive relaxations (CPA 52. 7 ± 6. 5 %; TSG 61. 3 ± 7 %). Addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the donor perfusate evoked relaxations of the recipient ring in cascade bioassay (13. 3 ± 1. 4 %, n= 22). Prior administration of SOD attenuated relaxations to TSG (23. 2 ± 3. 8 %, n= 4) and ryanodine (1. 7 ± 0. 8 %, n= 4), and pre-incubation with TSG and ryanodine blunted SOD-induced responses (4 ± 1. 5 %, n= 4 and 8. 9 ± 1. 1 %, n= 4, respectively). By contrast, no interaction was observed between the relaxations evoked by SOD and CPA. In <b>isolated</b> <b>rings,</b> SOD exerted no direct relaxant action and did not modulate relaxations to CPA, TSG or ryanodine. In cascade bioassay studies time-averaged shear stress was manipulated with dextran (1 – 4 % w/v, 80000 MW) to increase perfusate viscosity. NO-dependent relaxation of the recipient ring induced by increased perfusate viscosity was significantly attenuated by CPA (P< 0. 01; n= 6) and TSG (P< 0. 05; n= 7), but not by ryanodine (n= 6). Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (0. 1 – 30 [*]μM) in cascade bioassay and in <b>isolated</b> aortic <b>ring</b> preparations were markedly attenuated by pretreatment with CPA and TSG, but were unaffected by ryanodine. Ryanodine and CPA caused only a small attenuation of endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside (0. 001 – 10 [*]μM), whereas TSG had no effect. We conclude that release of Ca 2 + from CPA- and TSG-sensitive endothelial stores is necessary for NO release evoked by acute flow changes and agonists in rabbit abdominal aorta. Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release via the ryanodine-sensitive release channel plays no direct role in these responses.

Objectives: To study possible action mechanisms implicated in the response induced by the ethanolic extract and the acetylated flavonoid fraction obtained from C. prunifolia in <b>isolated</b> aortic <b>rings.</b> Methodology: After verifying the hypotensive effect of the etanolic extract in anaesthetized rats, the response induced by the extract and the acetylated flavonoid fraction (1   μ g/ml- 100 mg/ml) in <b>isolated</b> aortic <b>rings</b> from Wistar rats contracted with KCl (80 mM) or phenylephrine (1   μ M) was studied.

The response induced in rings contracted with CaCl 2 in Krebs solution without Ca 2 + also was analised. Results: The ethanolic extract elicited a dose-response (5 - 75 mg/kg. iv.) decrease in the blood pressure levels without affecting heart rate in anaesthetized rats.
