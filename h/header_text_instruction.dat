Many techniques presented as a solution in reading comprehension they are Case Study technique and Analytical Team technique. The problem formulation in this research are; (1) Is there any significant difference between using Case Study and Analytical Team toward students’ reading comprehension in descriptive <b>text</b> <b>instruction</b> for the tenth grade students of SMAN 1 Kotagajah (2) Which one is more effective between using Case Study and Analytical Team toward students’ reading comprehension in descriptive <b>text</b> <b>instruction</b> for the tenth grade students of SMAN 1 Kotagajah. The objectives of this research are (1) To know whether there is significant difference between using Case Study and Analytical Team toward students’ reading comprehension in descriptive <b>text</b> <b>instruction</b> for the tenth grade students of SMAN 1 Kotagajah. (2) To find out {{which one is more}} effective between using Case Study and Analytical Team toward students’ reading comprehension in descriptive <b>text</b> <b>instruction</b> for the tenth grade students of SMAN 1 Kotagajah. In this research, the researcher uses an experimental design. The kind of design is True Experimental Control Group Pre-test and Post test. Experimental group is taught Case Study and control group taught Analytical Team technique. The population in this research is 694 students. The sample in this research is class X which consists of 2 classes 44 students and each class consist of 22 students are as experimental class and 22 as control class. The writer use cluster stratified random sampling to takes sample. From the accounting of students score on post test, is was gained that at the significant level of 0, 01, the tratio is higher than ttable, that is 2, 77 for tratio and 2, 70 for ttable. The conclusion are; (1) There is significant difference between using Case Study and Analytical Team toward students’ reading comprehension in descriptive <b>text</b> <b>instruction</b> for the tenth grade students of SMAN 1 Kotagajah. (2) Case Study is more effective than Analytical Team toward students’ reading comprehension in descriptive <b>text</b> <b>instruction</b> for the tenth grade students of SMAN 1 Kotagajah.

40|$|We propose an {{unsupervised}} learning algorithm for automatically inferring the mappings between English nouns and corresponding video objects. Given {{a sequence of}} natural language instructions and an unaligned video recording, we simultaneously align each instruction to its corresponding video segment, and also align nouns in each instruction to their corresponding objects in video. While existing grounded language acquisition algorithms rely on pre-aligned supervised data (each sentence paired with corresponding image frame or video segment), our algorithm aims to automatically infer the alignment from the temporal structure of the video and parallel <b>text</b> <b>instructions.</b> We propose two generative models that {{are closely related to}} the HMM and IBM 1 word alignment models used in statistical machine translation.

40|$|Information {{that enables}} an urban {{pedestrian}} {{to get from}} A to B can come in many forms though maps are generally preferred. However, given the cognitive load associated with map reading, {{and the desire to}} make discrete use of mobile technologies, there is increasing interest in systems that deliver wayfinding information solely by means of georeferenced spoken utterances that essentially leave the user "technology free. " As a critical prior step, this paper examines the optimal delivery of such georeferenced <b>text</b> based <b>instructions</b> in anticipation of their spoken utterance. We identify the factors governing the content, location of instruction and frequency of delivery of <b>text</b> <b>instructions</b> such that a pedestrian can confidently follow a prescribed route, without reference to a map. We report on street level experiments in which pedestrians followed a sequence of <b>text</b> <b>instructions</b> delivered at key points along a set of routes. In examining instructions that are easy to follow, we compare landmark based instructions with street name based instructions. Results show that a landmark based approach is preferred because it is easier to assimilate (not because it is faster). Analysis also revealed that some degree of redundancy in the instructions is required in order to bring "comfort" to the user's progress. There still remains the challenge of modeling the saliency of landmarks, knowing what is the most efficient set of instructions, and how to vary the frequency of instruction according to the complexity of the route. The paper concludes by identifying a set of design heuristics useful in the design of <b>text</b> based <b>instructions</b> for wayfinding...|$|R
