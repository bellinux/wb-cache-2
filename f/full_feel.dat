5000|$|While {{freeform}} {{stations are}} still {{around in the}} 2000s, such as New Jersey's WFMU, {{and for a while}} 95.7 the Ride in Charlotte, North Carolina, recalled the format's original sound, there may be no real examples of the specific progressive rock radio format in existence today on the FM dial. The closest thing to a progressive rock station may be the Deep Tracks channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, which plays some of the music originally heard on progressive rock radio, but without pronounced disc jockey personalities or the <b>full</b> <b>feel</b> of the original format. [...] "Stuck in the Psychedelic Era," [...] a syndicated program heard on some non-commercial stations, recreates the format, but rarely includes any recordings made after 1970. Some of the spirit of progressive rock radio (albeit in a more mellow, [...] "adult" [...] form) can also be found in the adult album alternative format.|$|E

Because of same factor, such as: the limitied of job vacation, low income, low education and the village societys minded. It’s caused they try to <b>full</b> <b>feel</b> their necessary by walking as they can as specially for farmer labour family. In labour community the economy is very low. It’s makes they find the a nather job to staying life. The I’am {{of this study is}} to know the expedients that is done by farmer labour and to know the troubles that is faced by farmer labour family to in staying their life. In this final project is done at Desa Rembang Kepuh Kecamatan Ngadiluwih Kabupaten Kediri. The object of this study are the farmer labour that have certain caracteristic and it’s taken as subject also. In taking sample subject the wraiter yoused purposife sampling technique. The wraiter us tree in collecting data, they are observation in, interview, documentation. To analyze the dta the wraiter us qualitatif discriptif technique. The result of this study is concluded that the expedient that is done by farmer labour family to in staying their life find the job side. They also use the harvest. The trouble that the farmer labour faced is then out come bigger than income. Because they are from the big family. Biside they have low education and the don’t think the future and they don’t push up to change life. And the feel very hard for scool cost for their children...|$|E

40|$|The haptic sensations {{one feels}} when {{interacting}} with physical objects create {{a rich and}} varied impression of the objects, allowing one to gather information about texture, shape, compressibility, and other physical characteristics. The human sense of touch excels at sensing and interpreting these haptic cues, even when the object is felt through an intermediary tool instead of directly with a bare finger. Dragging, pressing, and tapping a tool on the object allow you to sense the object 2 ̆ 7 s roughness, slipperiness, and hardness as a combination of vibrations and forces. Unfortunately, the richness of these interaction cues is missing from many virtual environments, leading to a less satisfying and less immersive experience than one encounters in the physical world. However, we can create the perceptual illusion of touching a real object by displaying the appropriate haptic signals during virtual interactions. ^ This thesis presents methods for creating haptic models of textured surfaces from acceleration, force, and speed data recorded during physical interactions. The models are then used to synthesize haptic signals that are displayed to the user during rendering through vibrotactile and/or kinesthetic feedback. The haptic signals, which are {{a function of the}} interaction conditions and motions used during rendering, must respond realistically to the user 2 ̆ 7 s motions in the virtual environment. We conducted human subject studies to test how well our virtual surfaces capture the psychophysical dimensions humans perceive when exploring textured surfaces with a tool. ^ Three haptic rendering systems were created for displaying virtual surfaces using these surface models. An initial system displayed virtual versions of textured surfaces on a tablet computer using models of the texture vibrations induced when dragging a tool across the real surfaces. An evaluation of the system showed that displaying the texture vibrations accurately captured the surface 2 ̆ 7 s roughness, but additional modeling and rendering considerations were needed to capture the <b>full</b> <b>feel</b> of the surface. Using these results, a second system was created for rendering a more complete three-dimensional version of the haptic surfaces including surface friction and event-based tapping transients in addition to the texture vibrations. An evaluation of this system showed that we have created the most realistic haptic surfaces to date. The force-feedback haptic device used in this system, however, was not without its limitations, including low surface stiffness and undesired inertia and friction. We developed an ungrounded haptic augmented reality system to overcome these limitations. This system allowed us to change the perceived texture and friction of a physical three-dimensional object using the previously-developed haptic surface models. ...|$|E

These flavorless foods must be consumed in a [...] "flavorless window," [...] at least one hour after and one hour before consuming flavors. Consumption of 100-500 flavorless calories per day lowers the set point, and therefore, lowers weight.|$|R

5000|$|On March 13 2001 Eric Clapton {{released}} {{his version of}} the song on his studio album Reptile, which was produced by Clapton and Simon Climie. He covered the song in a more pop rock and Blues rock style. AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann compared the Clapton cover with his 1977 version of another Cale tune, [...] "Cocaine", noting fans will enjoy the 2001 cover as much as the 1977 hit single release. Critics from the German music website Planet Guitar called Clapton's cover a [...] "raw Blues rock tune with a lot of Clapton guitar riffs and licks". Journalist Simon Warner of PopMatters liked [...] "the rolling Southern boogie of J.J. Cale's 'Travelin' Light', leavened somewhat by the vocal backing of the Impressions". Billboard magazines Christa L. Titus noted: [...] "Clapton adheres to the standard that imitation is the highest form of flattery by holding close to Cale's composition, though Clapton's vocal delivery is smoother and deeper; the music also has a better flow and a <b>fuller</b> <b>feel</b> to it, thanks to a Hammond organ humming along in the background. Since the lyric is sparse, the music does the talking, and Slowhand lets it have its say with some extensive, bluesy guitar soloing at both the bridge and the outro". Clapton's cover version was also included on the compilation albums Pilgrim/Reptile in 2008 and The Platinum Collection: Reptile/Me & Mr. Johnson/MTV Unplugged in 2010. Clapton also performed the song live during his Reptile World Tour in 2001, filling the live performances with a [...] "lumberingly, heavy top" [...] as The Guardian critic Adam Sweeting reviewed.|$|R
