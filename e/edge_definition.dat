The detection of modules in real networks constitutes a crucial step towards {{a description of}} the network building blocks and their evolutionary dynamics. The performance of modularity detection algorithms is commonly quantified using simulated networks data. However, a comparison of the modularity algorithms utility for real biological data is scarce. Here we investigate the utility of network modularity algorithms for the classification of ecological plant communities. Plant community classification by the traditional approaches requires prior knowledge about the characteristic and differential species, which are derived from a manual inspection of vegetation tables. Using the raw species abundance data we constructed six different networks that vary in their <b>edge</b> <b>definitions.</b> Four network modularity algorithms were examined for their ability to detect the traditionally recognized plant communities. The use of more restrictive <b>edge</b> <b>definitions</b> significantly increased the accuracy of community detection, that is, the correspondence between network-based and traditional community classification. Random-walk based modularity methods yielded slightly better results than approaches based on the modularity function. For the whole network, the average agreement between the manual classification and the network-based modules is 76 % with varying congruence levels for different communities ranging between 11 % and 100 %. The network-based approach recovered the known ecological gradient from riverside – sand and gravel bank vegetation – to dryer habitats like semidry grassland on dykes. Our results show that networks modularity algorithms offer new avenues of pursuit for the computational analysis of species communities...|$|R

Because of the comparative insensitivity of the material, sunlight or another strong source of UV light is normally used to minimize the required exposure time. To make a full-color print, three negatives photographed through red, green and blue filters are printed on dichromate-sensitized sheets of pigmented gelatin (traditionally called [...] "carbon tissue" [...] regardless of the pigment incorporated) containing, respectively, cyan, magenta and yellow pigments. They are developed in warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin, leaving a colored relief image that is thickest where it received the strongest exposure. The three images are then transferred, one at a time, onto a final support such as a heavy sheet of smooth gelatin-sized paper. Usually, the yellow image is transferred first, then the magenta image is applied on top of it, great care being taken to superimpose it in exact register, and then the cyan image is similarly applied.

Methods Automated light sensor array {{was used to measure}} the penumbra zone of the edge in the standard X-ray equipment, while trained and naïve human observers were asked to mark the light field edge according to their own determination. Different interpretations of the contrast were then calculated and compared. Results In contrast to automated measurements of <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> and detection, measurements by human observers showed large inter-observer variation independent of their training with X-ray equipment. Different contrast calculations considering the different edge definitions gave very different contrast values. Conclusion As the main conclusion, we propose a more exact <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> of the X-ray light field, corresponding well to the average human observer’s edge determination. The new <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> method with automated systems would reduce human variability in edge determination.

40|$|The {{quality of}} a printed image is {{strongly}} influenced by the physical and the chemical interactions between the ink and the paper. Print quality can be evaluated either by objective measurements using instruments or by visual assessment studies involving panel of observers judging the final print. In this article, the print quality on commercial papers {{as well as on}} non-commercial papers with different amounts of salt for surface fixation has been studied. Perceived detail reproduction depends not only on sharp <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> but also on the level of color saturation (Chroma). Color saturation and <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> originate from two different ink and paper interaction processes. Color saturation is heavily dependent on ink penetration while <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> correlates to ink spreading. In order to gain understanding of the performance of surface treatment by salt, large efforts have been put on splitting up of the increase in color saturation (Chroma) and improved <b>edge</b> <b>definition.</b> The printouts have been made with a desktop printer using pigmented inks. Cross section images have been taken with a light microscope to analyze the ink penetration depth. SEM analysis has been made to analyze the aggregation of the pigments on the surface. The print quality measurements have been both objective measurements such as print density and subjective image evaluation using a test panel of observers in a perceptual study. The perceptual study focused on detail reproduction, and efforts were made to separate the influence of the print density from the <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> on the detail reproduction. The result from this study shows that an increased level of salt as surface fixation improves the detail reproduction due to aggregation of the pigments on the surface and that the ink penetration depth can be reduced by adding salt as surface fixation resulting in a higher print density.

40|$|Confining {{an answer}} to the {{question}} whether and how the coherent operation of network elements is determined by the the network structure is the topic of our work. We map the structure of signal flow in directed networks by analysing the degree of edge convergence and the overlap between the in- and output sets of an <b>edge.</b> <b>Definitions</b> of convergence degree and overlap are based on the shortest paths, thus they encapsulate global network properties. Using the defining notions of convergence degree and overlapping set we clarify the mean-ing of network causality and demonstrate the crucial role of chordless circles. In real-world networks the flow representation distinguishes nodes according to their signal transmitting, processing and control properties. The analysis of real-world networks in terms of flow rep-resentation was in accordance with the known functional properties of the network nodes. It is shown that nodes with different signal processing, transmitting and control properties are randomly connected at the global scale, while local connectivity patterns depart from randomness. Grouping network nodes according to their signal flow properties was unrelated to the network’s community structure. We present evidence that signal flow properties of small-world-like, real-world networks can not be reconstructed by algorithms used to gen-erate small-world networks. Convergence degree values were calculated for regular oriented trees, and its probability density function for networks grown with the preferential attachment mechanism. For Erdős-Rényi graphs we calculated both the probability density function of convergence degrees and of overlaps. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} arose {{out of a}} desire to test the {{assumption}} that in order to obtain direct stencils with good <b>edge</b> <b>definition,</b> one either had to use fine screens or. If using a relatively coarse screen, apply multiple coatings of emulsion to the screen before making the stencil. Neither alternative seemed satisfactory, since the first did not allow optimal use of the scope of screens available, and the second entailed an expenditure of time and supplies that could possibly be shown to be unnecessary. It was therefore determined to carry on an experiment that would show whether direct stencils with good <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> can be obtained on relatively coarse screens with only one, or at most two applications of emulsion. The experiment thus envisioned also provided an opportunity to observe the influence on two other factors on stencil <b>edge</b> <b>definition,</b> besides those of mesh count and emulsion thickness: namely, screen thread diameter and coater blade thick ness. What finally evolved was a three-factor, three-levelled factorial experiment, in which the variables under study were* screen mesh count, thread diameter and emulsion thick ness. The fourth factor came into play when the experiment was run once for emulsions applied with a thick-bladed coater, and once for those applied with a thin-bladed coater. The specific question under study was: in the direct stencil system, is there a difference in the quality of <b>edge</b> <b>definition</b> obtainable with variations in screen mesh count, screen thread diameter, coater blade thickness and the number of emulsion coatings applied? Eighteen screens were stretched expressly for the experiment, representing three different mesh counts and three different thread diameters for each mesh count. Each screen was prepared {{in such a way as}} to receive three stencils of varying thickness per screen. All stencils were exposed to a test target designed to allow for the observation of diagonal and parallel stencil edges (i. e., diagonal or parallel with relation to screen thread direction). After the stencils were made, they were visually inspected, and the data obtained thereby was subjected to an analysis of variance. The results obtained showed that of the four factors studied, mesh count was the only one that made a clear difference in the quality of stencil <b>edge</b> <b>definition.</b> What the experiment did not conclusively show was whether or not coater blade thickness had any influence on that quality.
