40|$|Email spam {{has reached}} {{alarming}} proportions because it costs virtually nothing to send email; {{even a small}} number of people responding to a spam message is adequate incentive for a spammer to send as many messages as possible. Since spammers need to send messages at high rates to as many recipients as they can, quotas on email senders could throttle spam. We argue for separating the allocation of quotas, a relatively rare activity, from the enforcement of quotas, a frequent activity that must scale to the billions of messages sent daily. This paper tackles the quota enforcement problem, where the goal is to ensure that no sender can grossly violate its quota. The challenge is to design an enforcement scheme that is scalable, is robust against malicious attackers or participants, and preserves the privacy of communication, in a large, distributed, and untrusted environment. We discuss the design of such a system, Spam-Iam, based on a managed distributed hash table (DHT) interface, showing that it can be used in conjunction with <b>electronic</b> <b>stamps</b> (for quota allocation) to ensure that any non-negligible reuse of stamps will be detected. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the commercial envelope manufacturing industry and the postal service go hand in hand, and both link to the printing industry and the mechanized envelope processing industry producing equipments such as franking and addressing machines. They are all four symbiotic: technological developments affecting one obviously ricochet through the others: addressing machines print addresses, postage stamps are a print product, franking machines imprint a frank on an envelope. If fewer envelopes are required; fewer stamps are required; fewer franking machines are required and fewer addressing machines are required. For example, the advent and adoption of information-based indicia (IBI) (commonly referred to as digitally-encoded <b>electronic</b> <b>stamps</b> or digital indicia) by the US Postal Service in 1998 caused widespread consternation in the franking machine industry, as their equipments were effectively rendered obsolescent and resulted {{in a flurry of}} lawsuits involving Pitney Bowes among others. The advent of e-mail in the late 1990s appeared to offer a substantial threat to the postal service. By 2008 letter-post service operators were reporting significantly smaller volumes of letter-post, specifically stamped envelopes, which they attributed mainly to replacement by e-mail. Although a corresponding reduction in the volume of envelopes required would have been expected, no such decrease was reported as widely as the reduction in letter-post volumes.|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{strains of}} sheet metals and their limitations while forming {{can be obtained}} by using a strain measurement system. A strain measurement may employ one of two different approaches: namely the total least square optimization method or the multiple regression analysis (MRA) method. With both methods plastic strains of deformed parts are calculated based on the non-deformed reference configuration designated by a circle and the deformed configuration, which is a curve-fitting ellipse. In the MRA method, the mathematical formula is simpler reducing the required computations than that of the total least square optimization method. While the formula has a greater margin of error, this margin proves less than significant in the practical application of the method’s results. Information from the results of a strain measurement system can be used to determine the sheet metal’s formability and strain path allowing engineers to determine at which point, the sheet metal will crack. They can then change the thickness and the material of the sheet metal, or modify its shape accordingly to maximize the metal’s efficiency. Strain measurement systems possess practical advantages in their actual application; they improve the quality of sheet metal being produced by minimizing defects in sheet metal during production.

40|$|Digital {{steganography}} {{is gaining}} wide acceptance {{in the world}} of <b>electronic</b> copyright <b>stamping.</b> Digital media that are easy to steal, such as graphics, photos and audio files, are being tagged with both visible and invisible copyright stamp known as a digital watermark. However, these same methodologies are also used to hide communications between actors in criminal or covert activities. An inherent difficulty in developing steganography attacks is overcoming the variety of methods for hiding a message and the multitude of choices of available media. The steganalyst cannot create an attack until the hidden content method appears. When a message is visually transmitted in a non-textual format (i. e., in an image) it is referred to as a semagram. Semagrams are a subset of steganography and are relatively easy to create. However, detecting a hidden message in an image-based semagram is more difficult than detecting digital modifications to an image 2 ̆ 7 s structure. The trend in steganography is a decrease in detectable digital traces, and a move toward semagrams. This research outlines the creation of a novel, computer-based application, designed to detect the likely presence of a Morse Code based semagram message in an image. This application capitalizes on the adaptability and learning capabilities of various artificial neural network (NN) architectures, most notably hierarchical architectures. Four NN architectures [feed-forward Back-Propagation NN (BPNN), Self organizing Map (SOM), Neural Abstraction Pyramid (NAP), and a Hybrid Custom Network (HCN) ] were tested for applicability to this domain with the best performing one being the HCN. Each NN was given a baseline set of training images (quantity based on NN architecture) then test images were presented, (each test set having 3, 337 images). There were 36 levels of testing. Each subsequent test set representing an increase in complexity over the previous one. In the end, the HCN proved to be the NN of choice from among the four tested. The final HCN implementation was the only network able to successfully perform against all 36 levels. Additionally, the HCN, while only being trained on the base Morse Code images, successfully detected images in the 9 test sets of Morse Code isomorphs...|$|R
