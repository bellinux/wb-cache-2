2500|$|Lough Leane is {{approximately}} [...] {{in size and}} {{is by far the}} largest of the three lakes. It is also the largest body of fresh water in the region. It is also the lake richest in nutrients. It has become eutrophic as a result of phosphates from agricultural and <b>domestic</b> <b>pollution</b> entering Lough Leane Reedbed, an important habitat on the edge of Lough Leane. This nutrient enrichment has caused several algal blooms in recent years. The blooms have not yet had a severe effect on the lake's ecosystem. To prevent further pollution causing a permanent change in the lake's ecosystem, a review of land use in the catchment area is being carried out. Water quality in the lake appears to have improved since phosphates were removed from sewage in 1985. As of August 2007, several large hotels and businesses have stated their intention to stop using phosphate detergents, in an effort to preserve the quality of the lake water.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the integral indicator for developmental stability, the fluctuating asymmetry (FA), in the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus populations that inhabit biotopes of different types (running rivers and still, dam lakes), when exposed to different types of anthropogenic <b>pollution</b> (<b>domestic</b> sewage <b>pollution</b> and heavy metal pollution) in south Bulgaria. A total of 920 P. ridibundus individuals were used for FA analyses over three years (2009 - 2011). Fluctuating asymmetry was defined by 10 morphological traits, using the index frequency of asymmetric manifestation of an individual (FAMI). In closed water basins, regardless of the nature of toxicants, the FA values in P. ridibundus populations were statistically lower than those in river populations. The FA values were constantly the highest under conditions of sustained anthropogenic pollution, with high concentrations of toxicants in rivers with <b>domestic</b> sewage <b>pollution</b> and heavy-metal pollution. The results provide better opportunities to use FA in P. ridibundus populations for bioindication and biomonitoring, and for parallel and independent analyses of the physicochemical assessment of the environmental condition...|$|R

40|$|Constraint {{of using}} bio-{{indicator}} (coliform bacteria) {{as an indicator}} of <b>domestic</b> (sewage) <b>pollution</b> in the environment with high environmental stress encourages the discovering of other alternate indicators. Coprostanol has been proposed as a chemical indicator of <b>domestic</b> waste <b>pollution,</b> but most research on were conducted in the temperate (high latitude) region. The persistence of coprostanol in tropical region, especially in Indonesia, is still very poor. It is very important to understand the persistence of coprostanol in the nature, as one of the requirements to propose coprostanol as an alternate indicator of <b>domestic</b> waste <b>pollution.</b> In order to better understand the natural biodegradation of coprostanol, experimental system on three environmental conditions (river, river mouth, and coastal waters) was conducted. In April 2004, samples of water and surface bottom sediments were collected from each environmental condition in duplicate. Before the samples were put into aerated and non-aerated aquaria, about 35 - 40 g of surface bottom sediments were taken to analyze the initial concentration (C 0) of coprostanol. The sediments were subsequently sampled from each aquarium within a certain interval day to analyze the concentration of coprostanol (C 10, C 20, and C 40). The results showed that aeration plays not an important role in natural biodegradation of coprostanol. In average, the highest rate of coprostanol biodegradation is 0. 438 µg/g day- 1 in non aerated coastal water environment, where as the lowest was found in the non aerated river mouth environment (0. 021 µg/g day- 1). Since coprostanol was degraded very slowly, and could be detected in the sediments of three environmental conditions, coprostanol has an excellent potency to be used as an alternate indicator of domestic wastes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} a production pollution tax on environmental capital flight and national product in a two-country static general equilibrium model with two-way foreign investment. It is assumed that the capital input in both countries is a composite good of domestic and imported capital. And pollution is assumed to originate in the production process. The productivity of capital in each country is negatively (or positively) related to the worldwide aggregate emissions. The analysis shows that when a <b>domestic</b> <b>pollution</b> tax is levied, domestic capital outflows increase and foreign capital inflows decrease for sufficiently high elasticities of substitution between labor (immobile input) and capital (mobile input) in both countries. Moreover, with negative transnational externalities, increases of a <b>domestic</b> <b>pollution</b> tax reduce domestic production and increase foreign production. The difficulty of substitution between immobile and mobile inputs hinders the optimal allocation of worldwide capital and national product. In this paper, the optimal pollution tax is based on global welfare maximization, not on global income maximization, taking into consideration the impact of income change on individual welfare. Therefore, an optimal pollution tax in the developing country should be lower for a given rate of pollution.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} is worsening in the Asia-Pacific region along with continued strong economic growth, {{and could be}} aggravated by further economic integration. ● Air pollution standards and regulations have gradually strengthened in the region, {{but in many cases}} are still weaker than the WHO guidelines. ● Economic integration has not prevented stronger standards, but policymakers’ fears about costs and trade competitiveness may have slowed the strengthening of stronger policies. ● Fears about competitiveness are not well founded since there is little evidence of a “race to the bottom ” while there is evidence that stronger air pollution standards can promote exports to countries with higher standards. ● A co-benefit approach and better cost-benefit analysis can show that stronger air pollution regulations are economically beneficial, for example by reducing health costs and reducing crop damage from air pollution. ● Some countries, particularly developing ones, may lack capacity to establish or implement stronger air pollution policies and related measures such as monitoring. ● This chapter therefore recommends <b>domestic</b> air <b>pollution</b> policies be strengthened and harmonised particularly in the ASEAN Community, and concrete measures should be taken to develop effective implementation capacity. ● Expanded regional integration in Asia (further facilitation of trade and investment) should be conditioned on stronger <b>domestic</b> air <b>pollution</b> standards and regulations, stronger enforcement and implementation, and development of implementation capacity. ● Stronger international cooperation will therefore be key.
