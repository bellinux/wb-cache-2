5000|$|Players {{can earn}} money by buying <b>goods</b> in <b>one</b> <b>star</b> system and {{transporting}} them to another {{to sell at}} a profit. Money can also be earned by destroying pirate ships and collecting bounty. Players can become pirates themselves, attacking merchantmen and other ships. Although no bounty is awarded for destroying non-pirate ships, when a ship is destroyed, some of its cargo can survive the explosion. If the player's ship {{is equipped with a}} scoop, this cargo can be salvaged for later resale. It is also possible, with the right equipment, to mine asteroids for ores and other materials. Players can also select to carry paying passengers or special cargos to specified destinations. Money earned or otherwise acquired can be spent on fuel for the wormhole engines (known as [...] "Witchdrives"), ship maintenance and new equipment. The player can also seek to trade in his or her ship for other models with different characteristics and capabilities.|$|R
25|$|In the 1996 off-season, the Stars {{continued}} to revamp their roster, adding defensemen Darryl Sydor from the Los Angeles Kings followed by Sergei Zubov from the Pittsburgh Penguins for Kevin Hatcher. Zubov {{would serve as}} the Stars' top defenseman and powerplay quarterback until leaving the NHL in 2009. On the ice, Ken Hitchcock's first season {{proved to be a}} <b>good</b> <b>one.</b> The <b>Stars</b> bested their 1994 totals, posting 48 wins and reaching the 100-point mark {{for the first time in}} franchise history. The Stars won the Central Division, their first division title since 1983–84 (when they were still the Minnesota North Stars) and were seeded second in the playoffs. Despite the regular season success, the youthful Stars were upset in the first round by the Edmonton Oilers in seven games. Defenseman Grant Ledyard tripped in overtime of Game 7, allowing Todd Marchant to score the game- and series-winning goal on a breakaway against goaltender Andy Moog.|$|R
5000|$|The album has {{consistently}} been praised by critics. Reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, Kurt Loder wrote [...] "Avalon {{takes a long}} time to kick in, but it finally does, and its a <b>good</b> <b>one.</b> Bryan Ferry <b>stars</b> as a remarkably expressive keyboard player and singer whose familiar mannerisms are subsumed in a rich, benevolent self-assurance. And reed man Andy Mackay shines in a series of cameos (his oboe meditation on Ferrys [...] "Tara" [...] is particularly lovely). Ten years after its debut, Roxy Music has mellowed: the occasional stark piano chords in [...] "While My Heart Is Still Beating," [...] for example, recall the stately mood of [...] "A Song for Europe," [...] but the sound is softer, dreamier and less determinedly dramatic now. Ferrys songwriting, however, has seldom seemed stronger." ...|$|R
