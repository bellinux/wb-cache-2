40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} experiments to determine whether chimeras between a retrovirus and portions of Ty 3 are active in vivo. A chimera between Ty 3 and a Neor-marked Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was constructed. The C-terminal domain of M-MuLV integrase (IN) was replaced with the C-terminal domain of Ty 3 IN. The chimeric retroviruses were expressed from an amphotrophic <b>envelope</b> <b>packaging</b> cell line. The virus generated was used to infect the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT 1080, and cells in which integration had occurred were selected by G 418 resistance. Three independently integrated viruses were rescued. In each case, the C-terminal Ty 3 IN sequences were maintained and short direct repeats of the genomic DNA flanked the integration site. Sequence analysis of the genomic DNA flanking the insertion did not identify a tRNA gene; therefore, these integration events did not have Ty 3 position specificity. This study showed that IN sequences from the yeast retrovirus-like element Ty 3 can substitute for M-MuLV IN sequences in the C-terminal domain and contribute to IN function in vivo. It {{is also one of}} the first in vivo demonstrations of activity of a retrovirus encoding an integrase chimera. Studies of chimeras between IN species with distinctive integration patterns should complement previous work by expanding our understanding of the roles of nonconserved domains...|$|R

5000|$|Reoviridae is {{a family}} of viruses. They have a wide host range, {{including}} vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi. They are unique in that they lack lipid <b>envelopes</b> and <b>package</b> their genomes of discrete double-stranded segments of RNA within multi-layered capsids.
