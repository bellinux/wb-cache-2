5|$|The former Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero {{is often}} mocked in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country</b> for his facial {{resemblance}} to Mr. Bean, {{and a computer}} hacker broke into Spain's official website for its presidency of the European Union, inserting the character {{on the front page}} of the website. Satirists have also compared Zapatero to Mr. Bean when discussing government policies that are deemed to have been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} growing {{concern that the}} calls by Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia for the {{neutralization}} of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country,</b> and his attempts to convene an international conference on the matter, would increase such sentiment in Vietnam, something that was oft-repeated in the American media. Minh publicly opposed Sihanouk's ideas and similar plans mooted by French President Charles de Gaulle, but discussion of the concepts continued to grow.|$|E

2500|$|American {{politician}} Dick Black, {{contrary to}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country's</b> official stance on Syria, {{sent a letter}} to Bashar al-Assad praising his conduct in the war, saying that the Syrian army deserved credit for a [...] "heroic rescue of Christians", defending Jews in Syria, and [...] "exhibit extraordinary gallantry in the war against terrorists".|$|R

Set in a high fantasy universe, Heroes of Mana follows a young soldier, Roget, as he journeys to defend several nations from the ruthless aggression of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country</b> {{in a series of}} battles.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{maintained}} {{the reputation of}} an outsider during his lifetime, both in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country</b> and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were listed by the Ministry of Culture amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life {{and that of his}} wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal Danish Library, sponsored by the Danish government, completed the Carl Nielsen Edition, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.|$|E
5|$|These events {{coincided with}} the {{accession}} of Nero to the imperial throne in Rome, and the young emperor decided to react vigorously. The war, which was the only major foreign campaign of his reign, began with rapid success for the Roman forces, led by the able general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. They overcame the forces loyal to Tiridates, installed their own candidate, Tigranes VI, on the Armenian throne, and left the country. The Romans were aided {{by the fact that}} the Parthian king Vologases was embroiled in the suppression of a series of revolts in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country.</b> As soon as these had been dealt with, however, the Parthians turned their attention to Armenia, and after a couple of years of inconclusive campaigning, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Rhandeia.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Thomas Brown ( [...] - [...] ) {{was born}} in Kirkleatham, in present-day Redcar and Cleveland, in the {{north-east}} region of England. He was a hero of the Battle of Dettingen (27 June 1743), in Bavaria during the War of the Austrian Succession; {{the last time that}} a British monarch, in this case King George II, personally led <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country's</b> troops into battle.|$|R
60|$|This play {{illustrates}} the wonderfully philosophic impartiality of Shakespeare’s politics. <b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>country’s</b> history furnished him with no matter {{but what was}} too recent to be devoted to patriotism. Besides, {{he knew that the}} instruction of ancient history would seem more dispassionate. In Coriolanus and Julius Cæsar, you see Shakespeare’s good-natured laugh at mobs. Compare this with Sir Thomas Brown’s aristocracy of spirit.|$|R
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country.</b> Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

50|$|Other {{justifications}} for foreign involvement included Iraq's history {{of human rights}} abuses under Saddam. Iraq was also known to possess biological weapons and chemical weapons, which Saddam had used against Iranian troops during the Iran-Iraq War and against <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country's</b> Kurdish population in the Al-Anfal campaign.

25|$|The film Romper Stomper (1992) shows a {{white power}} skinhead named Hando (played by Russell Crowe) expressing {{distress}} {{about the idea}} of being a coolie in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country.</b> Also, the gang he directs makes frequent attacks at gangs of working class Vietnamese Australians.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of Portuguese rule in Mozambique in 1974–75, {{it was no longer}} viable for the Smith regime to sustain white minority rule indefinitely. By this time, even South Africa's Vorster had come to this view. While Vorster was unwilling to make concessions to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country's</b> blacks, he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1. In 1978, there were 270,000 Rhodesians of European descent and more than six million Africans.|$|R
50|$|Lu {{was born}} in Taipei.

25|$|In 2007, China {{denied the}} {{application}} for visa from an Indian Administrative Service officer in Arunachal Pradesh.

50|$|Co-operation and {{understanding}} cannot come about {{so long as}} the element of violence or threat of violence exists, for violence has no counterpart in freedom, and liberty ends where violence begins. The progressive retreat of democracy in the world today is mainly due to the worship by nations of the cult of physical force. The deterioration in this direction has been such that the much-vaunted democracies are nowadays hardly distinguishable from totalitarian states. He made a direct stab at <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country's</b> (deteriorating political situation with insurgencies and armed conflicts).|$|R
5000|$|A {{week after}} he left, Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu proclaimed {{his vision of}} a {{strategic}} alliance between Egypt and Turkey which he described as an [...] "Axis of Democracy". However, some voiced concerns that the Egyptian revolution was not fulfilled and that Erdogan was seeking <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>country's</b> strategic interests. It was feared that by forming an alliance with the SCAF interim government in Egypt during the country’s transition to democracy, Erdogan may have tipped the balance in favor of those that stand between the Egyptians and their freedom.|$|R
