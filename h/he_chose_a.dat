A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent agents to assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> geology class on Valentine's Day to open fire.

5|$|During April 1887, J.I. Berry {{established}} {{a site for}} a town after <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> well-watered section along {{the way of the}} Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E

5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. <b>He</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
5|$|Dalyngrigge's licence from Richard II {{permitted}} him to refortify his existing manor house, {{but instead}} <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> fresh site {{to build a}} castle on. Construction was completed in one phase, {{and most of the}} castle is in the same architectural style. Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French. Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds. Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for {{the first years of the}} castle's construction. It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor. It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 was {{the first}} King's Highway in Lambton County when it was assumed in 1927 between Highway3 at Morpeth and Highway7 at Reece's Corners. This {{original}} section of highway changed from a mudhole to a plank road circa 1860. When James Miller Williams, a Hamilton businessman, set out one day from during a drought to dig a well, <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> spot downhill from an existing oil seep {{in the village of}} Black Creek. Instead of encountering water, Williams hit a shallow oil deposit. As a result of the ensuing oil-boom, which would begin the petroleum industry in North America, Williams laid out the village and changed its name to Oil Springs. Two competing plank road companies were formed, the Black Creek Plank Road Company (of which Williams was a principal investor) and the Sarnia to Florence Plank Road Company, both of which aimed their roads through Oil Springs. Although both roads were constructed, the former company was more prosperous in its endeavours; in 1886, {{a significant portion of the}} Sarnia to Florence Plank Road was closed up and turned over to local property owners. The Black Creek Plank Road Company meanwhile had transformed the muddy quagmire of a path into a well-maintained road. By 1863, three miles of road south of Wyoming had been paved, and the remainder south to Oil Springs planked (the Sarnia Road followed two years later). However, as the oil boom faded, so too did improvement to the road.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} toolkit for the Motorola CPU {{included a}} compiler for the C programming language, {{which the two}} programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language. Cerny and Flanagan's decision to program Marble Madness in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in assembly language. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of 30Hz instead of the normal 60Hz frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a trackball system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> motorized trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari's design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball's design had an inherent flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and {{the use of a}} regular trackball was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow RAM-based sprites to be animated by the CPU, but the available hardware was a less-advanced system using ROM-based, static sprites.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Italy, however, Germany did not {{strive to}} achieve full autarky, {{even though in}} May of 1933, Hitler’s regime had {{defaulted}} unilaterally on Germany’s foreign debt along with a decree for sweeping capital controls that {{made it difficult to}} engage in foreign trade. Hitler was {{aware of the fact that}} Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full autarky was therefore impossible. Thus <b>he</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> different approach. The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.|$|E
