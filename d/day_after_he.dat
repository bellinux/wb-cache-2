5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens {{at a very high}} pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E
5|$|Attorney Hy Mayerson was {{an early}} pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with {{environmental}} attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, {{one of the first}} civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> was first contacted by the doctor. The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|She was {{acutely aware}} of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E

Whalley made three further senior appearances for Chester, all as a substitute, before leaving the club in the summer of 2005.|$|E

His first start came on 18 August 2012 in Morecambe's 3–0 win away to Exeter City on 18 August 2012. Having scored six goals in 27 appearances, {{he returned to}} Crawley on 2 January 2013 as Morecambe were not in a financial position to extend his loan. On 4 January 2013, Brodie joined Conference Premier team Grimsby Town on loan {{until the end of}} 2012–13. He made his debut the following day, starting Grimsby's 1–1 home draw with Hereford United, before scoring his first goal in a 4–2 win at home to Alfreton Town on 2 February 2013.

5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very {{reluctant}} to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E
