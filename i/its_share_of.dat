5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back {{from the front of the}} locomotive to above a large nose, as on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party {{increased}} <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> {{the vote}} to 30.06%. The Alliance got a majority of votes cast, but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament. With the opposition divided mainly by the Sweden Democrats, Reinfeldt could remain in government, but with a greater need to seek consensus on matters of substance with the opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 1871, the DR {{opened its}} own tracks between Gloucester Road and High Street Kensington. These tracks, the Cromwell Curve, were opened without Parliamentary {{authority}} in an unsuccessful {{attempt by the}} DR to improve <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the revenues between High Street Kensington and South Kensington stations which were divided {{on the basis of}} mileage of track owned by the two companies.|$|E

5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E
5|$|Gerlachovský štít shares its geology {{and ecology}} {{with the rest}} of the High Tatras, but {{provides}} a worthwhile environment for biologists as the highest ground anywhere in Europe north of the parallel linking approximately Munich, Salzburg, and Vienna. With the travel restrictions imposed by the Eastern Bloc, the mountain was particularly treasured as the loftiest point available to climb to by Czechs, East Germans, Hungarians, Poles, and Slovaks. It continues to attract <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> visitors although the local authorities have been continually adding new restrictions on access.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the city}} council decided that a branch was to be built during {{construction}} at Nørrebro, to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj. The {{first part of this}} line was intended to be constructed {{at the same time as}} the City Circle Line, to avoid a multitude-higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later. This did not involve a final decision, only an option for future construction. The Herlev/Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped as the City of Copenhagen withdrew <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the cost of the Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget, and the state refused to continue the project. Any branch to the Herlev / Brønshøj region would now require a shutdown of the City Circle Line for an extended period of time.|$|E

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} election campaign, {{the party was}} deeply divided and unable to organise an effective political strategy. It changed leaders five times {{in less than two}} months, and in the 2002 general election decreased <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the vote to 10.2%, almost two-thirds less than its previous share. Most of its voters sided with the ÖVP, which became the largest party in Austria with 43% of the vote. Nevertheless, the coalition government of the ÖVP and FPÖ was revived after the election; however, there was increasing criticism within the FPÖ against the party's mission of winning elections at any cost.|$|E
5|$|Liman {{approached}} {{a wide range}} of actors for the role of Bourne, including Brad Pitt, who turned it down to star in Spy Game, as well as Russell Crowe, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, before he eventually cast Damon. Liman found that Damon understood and appreciated that, though The Bourne Identity would have <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> action, the focus was primarily on character and plot. Damon, who had never played such a physically demanding role, insisted on performing many of the stunts himself. With stunt choreographer Nick Powell, he underwent three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, boxing, and eskrima. He eventually performed a significant number of the film's stunts himself, including hand-to-hand combat and climbing the safe house walls near the film's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{also had}} <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> {{incidents}} {{that did not}} result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 Westland {{was taken}} over by GKN, and when GKN sold off <b>its</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> Westland to form Agusta-Westland, it {{retained}} the East Cowes works, where it continues aircraft component design and production.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{the city}} sold <b>its</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> the money-losing operation. The {{railroad}} changed hands rapidly since then. It operated diesel excursion runs from Belfast to Waldo and diesel-and steam-powered trains from Unity to Burnham Junction.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the release}} of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, {{critical}} acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. The series has also had <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. , the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.|$|E
5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a party with {{a high number of}} votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less than <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} seen <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> struggles, {{both on and}} off the ice. The team has had two changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and making it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Robert Bosch GmbH {{announced}} that it will exit from the solar business. SolarWorld took over production in Arnstadt and continued to employ about 800 workers.The parent company also sold <b>its</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> Aleo Solar.|$|R

5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the {{telescope}}'s construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel {{at the time the}} telescope was constructed. The original grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.|$|E
5|$|Club captain Noel Spencer was {{released}} by the Mariners, then signed {{to participate in the}} Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and São Paulo of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side to draw from the roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a property development joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.|$|E
5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which had been one of the major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw <b>its</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> foreign exports collapse in the sixteenth century. Aberdeen's share of trade remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share of trade through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E
50|$|On April 5, 2006, Alcatel {{announced}} that it would swap <b>its</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> Alcatel Alenia Space and Telespazio for €673 million and a 12.1% stake in Thales, a key player in the French defense industry. This increased Alcatel's stake in Thales to 20.8%.|$|R
