5|$|The {{utility of}} Feynman {{diagrams}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> types of physical phenomena {{that are part}} of the general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the weak nuclear force.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{principle}} in {{fighting in the}} Qur'an <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> communities {{should be treated as}} one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defense, to aid other Muslims and after a violation in the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist. The principle of forgiveness is reiterated in between the assertions of the right to self-defense.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to prevent}} worker born larvae <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> workers or the queen may attempt to sting or push the ovipositing, egg laying, workers off of the cells. It is {{important}} to note that workers almost never acted aggressively towards the queen or tried to prevent her from laying eggs. This results in nearly all eggs that mature being queen produced. Even after the original queen in a colony dies and the new queens leave, workers may lay eggs but these eggs usually starve, rarely reaching maturity.|$|E

25|$|ESA had {{originally}} cost-capped the ExoMars projects at €1 billion, (USD 1.3 billion) but {{the withdrawal of}} the U.S. space agency (NASA) and the consequent reorganisation of the ventures will probably add several hundred million euros to the sum so far raised. So on March 2012, member states instructed the agency's executive to look at how this shortfall could be made up. One possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> science activities within ESA may have to step back to make ExoMars a priority. On September 2012 it was announced that new ESA members, Poland and Romania will be contributing up to €70 million to the ExoMars mission. ESA has not ruled out a possible partial return of NASA to the 2018 portion of ExoMars, albeit in a relatively minor role.|$|E
25|$|Christophe {{was still}} in Grenoble {{at the start of}} stage eleven, when tour {{organiser}} Henri Desgrange gave him a yellow jersey, so that he could easily be recognized. The colour was inspired by the colour of the organizing newspaper l'Auto, although another explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> colours were not available in the post-war shortage. Christophe was not happy with his yellow jersey, and other cyclists called him a canary. At that point in the race, it was likely that Christophe would stay the leader {{until the end of the}} Tour de France, because he remained in that yellow jersey after the Pyrénées and the Alps. In the penultimate stage, Firmin Lambot, who was in second position, more than 28 minutes behind, attacked. Christophe, still leading the race, chased him, but broke his fork close to Valenciennes. The rules were such that cyclists could get no help at all, so Christophe repaired his bicycle himself. This same thing had already cost him the victory in 1913, and would happen to him for a third time in 1922. It took him over two and a half hours, and he had lost the lead to Lambot. In the last stage, Christophe had a record number of punctures, and also lost his second place to Jean Alavoine.|$|E
500|$|In early March 1830, {{partly out of}} fear of a milk {{sickness}} outbreak {{along the}} Ohio River, several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a non-slaveholding state, and settled in Macon County, [...] west of Decatur. Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to leave Indiana, and one possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, might not have attained the stability and steady income that Thomas Lincoln had. After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education, and occasionally lent him money. In 1831, as Thomas {{and other members of the}} family prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own. Traveling down the Sangamon River, he ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that spring, Denton Offutt, a New Salem merchant, hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—Lincoln returned to New Salem, where he remained for the next six years.|$|E

2500|$|As regards indulgences for the living, Tetzel always taught pure doctrine. The {{assertion}} {{that he put}} forward indulgences as being not only a remission of the temporal punishment of sin, but as a remission of its guilt, is as unfounded as <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> accusation against him, that he sold the forgiveness of sin for money, without even any mention of contrition and confession, or that, for payment, he absolved from sins which might be committed in the future. His teaching was, in fact, very definite, and quite {{in harmony with the}} theology of the Church, as it was then and as it is now, i.e., that indulgences [...] "apply only to the temporal punishment due to sins which have been already repented of and confessed"....|$|E
2500|$|I have to {{say that}} there are moments when I wonder — moments when its two senior networks, first set up as a partnership, {{schedule}} simultaneously programmes of identical character, thereby contradicting the very reason that the BBC was given a second network. Then there are times when both BBC One and BBC Two, intoxicated by the sudden popularity of a programme genre, allow that genre to proliferate and run rampant through the schedules. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> kinds of programmes are not placed, simply because of a lack of space. Do we really require so many gardening programmes, make-over programmes or celebrity chefs? Is it not a scandal in this day and age, that there seems to be no place for continuing series of programmes about science or serious music or thoughtful in-depth interviews with people other than politicians? ...|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand's {{reason for}} having Anzac Day as its {{national}} commemoration day is different to Australia. In 1921 the poppies were {{ordered by the}} RSA for Armistice Day but arrived too late on the ship Westmorland. The RSA was stuck {{with the cost of}} 350,000 of these French made poppies and to get its money returned quickly it chose the next commemoration date available to sell them [...] Dardanelles Day, 25 April 1922. This date then stuck in the psyche of New Zealanders ever since. So Anzac Day in New Zealand was used by accident and not as a direct association to Anzac, Australia or Gallipoli. New Zealand did copy Australia in having dawn services 16 years later, despite New Zealand not landing at dawn at Gallipoli. Attempts have been made to revert to Armistice Day, commencing with the [...] "Tomb for the Unknown Warrior" [...] parade in 2004. But New Zealanders have resisted, unaware of its history. The reason for some wanting to revert <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> bigger battles and losses have since been ignored. Gallipoli accounted for 8% of New Zealand's war losses and 60% of those were not the result of direct combat.|$|E

2500|$|Biologists, {{alongside}} {{scholars of}} the history and philosophy of biology, have continued to debate the need for, and possible nature of, a replacement synthesis. For example, in 2017 Philippe Huneman and Denis M. Walsh stated in their book Challenging the Modern Synthesis that numerous theorists had {{pointed out that the}} disciplines of [...] developmental theory, morphology, and ecology had been omitted. They note that all such arguments amount to a continuing desire to replace the modern synthesis with one that unites [...] "all biological fields of research related to evolution, adaptation, and diversity in a single theoretical frame." [...] They observe further that there are two groups of challenges to the way the modern synthesis viewed inheritance. The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> modes such as epigenetic inheritance, phenotypic plasticity, and the maternal effect allow new characteristics to arise and be passed on, and for the genes {{to catch up with the}} new adaptations later. The second is that all such mechanisms are part, not of an inheritance system, but a developmental system: the fundamental unit is not a discrete selfishly competing gene, but a collaborating system that works at all levels from genes and cells to organisms and cultures to guide evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{relatively}} late addition {{of color and}} other anti-counterfeiting features to U.S. currency, critics hold {{that it is still}} a straightforward matter to counterfeit these bills. They point out that the ability to reproduce color images is well within the capabilities of modern color printers, most of which are affordable to many consumers. These critics suggest that the Federal Reserve should incorporate holographic features, as are used in most other major currencies, such as the pound sterling, Canadian dollar and euro banknotes, which are more difficult and expensive to forge. Another robust technology, the polymer banknote, has been developed for the Australian dollar and adopted for the New Zealand dollar, Romanian leu, Papua New Guinea kina, Canadian dollar, and other circulating, as well as commemorative, banknotes of a number of other countries. [...] Polymer banknotes are a deterrent to the counterfeiter, as they are much more difficult and time consuming to reproduce. They are said to be more secure, cleaner and more durable than paper notes. One major issue with implementing these or any new counterfeiting countermeasures, however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> (<b>other</b> than under Executive Order 6102) the United States has never demonetized or required a mandatory exchange of existing currency. Consequently, would-be counterfeiters can easily circumvent any new security features simply by counterfeiting older designs.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, a company's {{articles}} will vest {{a general}} power of {{management in the}} board of directors, with full power of directors to delegate tasks to other employees, subject to an instruction right reserved for the general meeting acting with a three quarter majority. This basic pattern can theoretically be varied {{in any number of}} ways, and so long as it does not contravene the Act, courts will enforce that balance of power. In Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame, a shareholder sued the board for not following a resolution, carried with an ordinary majority of votes, to sell off the company's assets. The Court of Appeal refused the claim, since the articles stipulated that a three quarter majority was needed to issue specific instructions to the board. Shareholders always have the option of gaining the votes to change the constitution or threaten directors with removal, but they may not sidestep the separation of powers found in the company constitution. Though older cases raise an element of uncertainty, the majority opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>other</b> provisions of a company's constitution generate personal rights that may be enforced by company members individually. Of the most important is a member's right to vote at meetings. Votes need not necessarily attach to shares, as preferential shares [...] (e.g., [...] those with extra dividend rights) are frequently non-voting. However, ordinary shares invariably do have votes and in Pender v Lushington Lord Jessel MR stated votes were so sacrosanct as to be enforceable like a [...] "right of property". Otherwise, the articles may be enforced by any member privy to the contract. Companies are excluded from the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, so people who are conferred benefits under a constitution, but are not themselves members, are not necessarily able to sue for compliance. Partly for certainty and to achieve objectives the Act would prohibit, shareholders in small closely held companies frequently supplement the constitution by entering a shareholders' agreement. By contract shareholders can regulate any of their rights outside the company, yet their rights within the company remain a separate matter.|$|E
