50|$|Fragmentation {{of habitat}} {{is the number}} one threat to biodiversity. Currently this Regional Park is an {{isolated}} fragment of habitat amidst the urban matrix. Linking up parks and reserves with <b>habitat</b> <b>corridors</b> is an effective way to help animals move into the area and stop the local extinction of species. It is hoped that as the habitat quality of the Park improves (and <b>habitat</b> <b>corridors</b> increase within urban Sydney), more animal species will be found here. Future planning and management of the Park will focus on ensuring long term maintenance and enhancement (where appropriate) of the Park’s biodiversity. It is critical to undertake co-operative vegetation management with adjoining property managers (local council, private landowners, City rail, Sydney Water) and to establish connections to the wider web of natural environments, especially canopy connections.|$|R
50|$|In Southern California, 15 underpasses and {{drainage}} culverts were observed {{to see how}} many animals used them as corridors. They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, mule deer, small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals. Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity also played a role in how much use they got. From this experiment, much was learned about what would constitute a successful <b>habitat</b> <b>corridor</b> (Dole et al. 2003).|$|E
50|$|A <b>habitat</b> <b>corridor</b> {{could be}} {{considered}} as a possible solution in an area where destruction of a natural area has greatly affected its native species. Development such as roads, buildings, and farms can interrupt plants and animals in the region being destroyed. Furthermore, natural disasters such as wildfires and floods can leave animals with no choice but to evacuate. If the habitat is not connected to a safer one, it will ultimately lead to death. A remaining portion of natural habitat is called a remnant, and such portions need to be connected, because when migration decreases, extinction increases (Fleury 1997).|$|E

Trials of long-stem planting in the riparian verge of species such as Eucalyptus viminalis, {{in conjunction}} with 17,000 Poa labillardierei are underway. Areas along the riparian corridor that have been less intensively grazed host a greater abundance and variety of shrubs from the grassy box woodlands community. Increasing the abundance of shrubs is an important component of creating a more complex vegetation structure that will support a wider variety and abundance of bird species.|$|E

50|$|An active {{partnership}} of restoration and conservation in the North Creek Forest serves to prevent net losses of wetlands, net changes in function, and positive gains in biodiversity and habitat quality. This partnership {{has been in}} place since 2011 and now includes 5 sites of approximately 1/4 acre each along the edges of the forest. Restoration efforts to the forest have been led by the Friends of North Creek Forest in partnership with the University of Washington's Restoration Ecology Network, offering students the chance for real world application of restoration methods and practices.

50|$|The North Creek Forest {{is located}} in Bothell, Washington and {{surrounds}} {{a section of the}} 12.6 mi North Creek and encompasses 64 acres of mature second growth mixed coniferous/hardwood forest with 7 streams and 9 wetlands.

The North Creek Forest {{is one of the last}} remaining mature coniferous forests in the Bothell area. The forest here filters and cools water in streams, wetlands and countless small springs and seeps, along an entire mile of watershed. The cooling of this water is crucial for 5 species of anadromous fish that spawn in North Creek including chum, coho, sockeye, chinook and steelhead. Many other ecosystem services are provided by this forest including carbon sequestration, reduction of surface runoff and cooling of ambient temperatures in surrounding neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} effects of {{fragment}} size, vegetation structure and presence of habitat corridors on the reproductive success of the Des Murs ’ Wiretail (Sylviorthorhynchus desmursii Des Murs, Furnariidae), a small (10 g) understorey bird, endemic to South American forests. In a rural landscape of Chiloé Island, southern Chile (42 °S; 70 °W), we determined the mating and nesting success of wiretails in 28 territories distributed in seven small (1 – 20 ha) and two large (> 300 ha) forest fragments during the 1997 – 1998 breeding season. Wiretails inhabited dense bamboo thickets in the understorey of forest patches, dense shrublands covering old fields, and dense early successional forest vegetation. Wiretails avoided open pastures. Reproductive success depended solely on the probability of finding mates, and the main factor affecting mating success was the presence of corridors. Mated individuals occupied 72 % of the territories in forest patches 300 ha) fragments, but only 20 % of territories in isolated fragments surrounded by pastures. Because of {{the rapid expansion of}} pastures in southern Chile, the conservation of wiretails and other understorey birds will depend on the maintenance of travel corridors with dense understorey vegetation between forest fragments.
