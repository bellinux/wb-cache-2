[...] Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915.

[...] In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was [...] "woefully weak on interference." [...] Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. [...] His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as [...] "Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line." ...|$|E

[...] Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: [...] "Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty's life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers – she couldn't face life alone at home". Little has observed that Betty [...] "has a finely tuned {{sense of right and}} wrong and has never been afraid to stand up for her beliefs", citing Betty's shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the NSPCC to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|The only {{uranium metal}} {{available}} commercially {{was produced by}} the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process. Uranium oxide was reacted with potassium fluoride in large vats {{on the roof of}} Westinghouse's plant in Bloomfield, New Jersey. This produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. But Edward Creutz, the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce. The hydride or [...] "hydramet" [...] process, developed by Alexander used calcium hydride as the reducing agent for the conversion of uranium ore to metal. [...] By this means the Metal Hydrides plant in Beverly, Massachusetts, managed to produce a <b>few</b> <b>pounds</b> of uranium metal. Unfortunately, the calcium hydride contained unacceptable amounts of boron, a neutron poison, making the metal unsuitable for use in a reactor. Some months would pass before Clement J. Rodden from the National Bureau of Standards and Union Carbide figured out a means to produce sufficiently pure calcium hydride.|$|E

2500|$|Composting toilets use {{bacteria}} to decompose human feces into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens {{as well as}} most of the mass of the waste.

[...] In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a <b>few</b> <b>pounds</b> of compost every six months.

Two hundred men escorted the coffin from his Ashfield mansion to a train which transported the funeral party to Rookwood Cemetery.

She signed a record contract with Decca, and her sales were soon 30,000 discs a week. She {{was by far the}} biggest selling pianist of her time.

2500|$|New South Wales had won 10 Sheffield Shields on the trot - {{though they}} would be ousted by Victoria {{by the end of}} the season - and had a team that was {{stronger}} than most Test sides; captain Richie Benaud, vice-captain Neil Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Grahame Thomas, Norm O'Neill, Brian Booth, Alan Davidson, Ray Flockton, Johnny Martin and Frank Misson. Ted Dexter won the toss and batted of course, but the MCC innings hinged on Geoff Pullar's 132. Even that was lucky as the Lancashire opener edged the ball to Simpson in the first over who dropped it, just to show that even the best slip fielders are not infallible. Pullar continued to struggle and give other chances, but he put this behind him and stuck to his work, which was just as well as only Dexter (42) and Cowdrey (50) stayed to help him out. 180/2 sank to 303/9 thanks to Benaud (3/61) and Martin (4/122), but tailend [...] "George" [...] thumped 30 to bring the total up to 348 a few minutes before stumps. Thomas survived one ball from Fred Trueman, successfully appealed for light and they all trooped back to the pavilion. On the second day Dexter resorted to his negative tactics of bowling on the leg stump with an on-side field, which was meant to restrict strokeplay. In this he failed as New South Wales rattled up 408/5 in the day, causing Benaud the remark that he had better change his way of thinking. Grahame Thomas was quickly bowled by Trueman (1/45), who then left the field with fibrositis and the MCC bowling attack lost all its bite. Simpson made 110 – his fourth hundred in four matches – and added 234 for the second wicket with Norm O'Neill, who had lost a <b>few</b> <b>pounds</b> and overcame his bad form to make 143 like a man on a mission. Booth (41), Harvey (63), Davidson (55), Flockton (62 not out) and Benaud (40 not out) kept the scoreboard moving at a fair rate and Benaud declared during the lunch break on the third day having made 124 runs in that morning to bring the total to 532/6. Davidson (1/11) removed David Sheppard for 7 and then it was all the spinners. Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18-10-18-7 and Martin (2/32) picked up the wickets of Dexter and Cowdrey as the tourists crumbled to 104 all out to lose by an innings and 80 runs. It was New South Wales first innings victory over the MCC, and by definition their greatest victory over the English tourists.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the second day, 10 December 1878, leaving Byrne in charge of the hostages, the other three started out to work. First they cut the telegraph wires, chopping the posts down to make sure, and were careful to destroy more wire than an ordinary repairer would carry with him. Three or four railway men endeavoured to interfere, but they too joined the other hostages in Younghusband's storeroom. Carrying a cheque drawn by McCauley on the National Bank for a <b>few</b> <b>pounds,</b> the three bushrangers, all heavily armed, went to the bank. (Kenneally relates that Hart who approached from the back ran into the bank's housemaid, Maggie Shaw, with whom he had been at school in Wangaratta.) In the meantime Byrne had unlawfully kidnapped a telegraph-line repairer, who had begun to make trouble. The others reached the bank after closing time, travelling in the hawker's cart. Kelly knocked at the door and forced the clerk to open and cash the cheque he had. They held up the unwise clerk and his manager, a Mr Scott. The robbers took £700 in notes, gold, and silver. Ned Kelly insisted to the manager that there was more money there, and eventually forced him to open the safe, from which the outlaws got £1,500 in paper, £300 in gold, about £300 worth of gold dust and nearly £100 worth of silver. The reported total amount stolen was 68 £10 notes, 67 £5 notes, 418 £1 notes, £500 in sovereigns, about £90 in silver; and a 30oz ingot of gold. The outlaws were polite and considerate to Scott's wife. Scott himself invited the outlaws to drink whisky with him, which they did. The whole party went to Younghusband's where the rest of the hostages were. The evening seems to have passed quite pleasantly. McCauley remarked to Kelly that the police might come along, which would mean a fight. Kelly replied, [...] "I wish they would, for there is plenty of cover here." [...] In the evening, tea was prepared, and at half-past 8, the outlaws warned the hostages not to move for three hours, informing them that they were going. Just before they left, Kelly noticed that a Mr. McDougall was wearing a watch, and asked for it. McDougall replied that it was a gift from his dead mother. Kelly declared that he wouldn't take it under any consideration, and very soon afterwards the four of the outlaws left. What is unusual is that these stirring events happened without the people in the town knowing of anything. The hostages left the station after five hours.|$|E
