5|$|Neptunium-237 is {{the most}} mobile {{actinide}} in the deep geological repository environment. This makes it and its predecessors such as americium-241 candidates of interest for destruction by nuclear transmutation. Due to its long half-life, neptunium will become the major contributor of the total radiotoxicity in 10,000 years. As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the {{contamination of the environment}} if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.|$|E

The name of Nguzunguzu, a duo which includes Asma Maroof, M.I.A.'s tour DJ, is also prominently displayed, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> involvement the duo had in the project.|$|E
5|$|The broad-billed parrot or raven parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) {{is a large}} extinct parrot in {{the family}} Psittaculidae. It was endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> other species it is most closely related to, {{but it has been}} {{classified}} {{as a member of the}} tribe Psittaculini, along with other Mascarene parrots. It had similarities with the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus), and may have been closely related.|$|E

5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the exact nature of Tréhot's {{relationship}} with Renoir while she was modeling; she is said to have given birth to a baby boy named Pierre on 14 December 1868, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> became of him and he may have died as an infant. On 21 July 1870, Tréhot gave birth to a baby girl named Jeanne (d. 1934) who was given to a wet nurse to raise as her own. Renoir continued to secretly support Jeanne financially until he died (and after his death with the help of Ambroise Vollard), but never publicly or legally acknowledged that she was his daughter during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|George Frideric Handel {{was born}} on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> initial musical {{education}} he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, {{by the age of}} ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was {{in the service of the}} Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.|$|E
5|$|If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> {{counts as}} science, {{how the process}} of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values {{can play a role}} ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> interest {{he might have had}} promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae A is not {{a typical}} LBV. It is more {{luminous}} than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, {{and it has been}} estimated that the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be typical for an LBV in eruption.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} to the island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the traditional view is that most were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, as a subject class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any combination of these) formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended from the mountains under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population of the countryside was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E

5|$|Matilda and Henry {{remained}} childless, {{but neither}} party {{was considered to}} be infertile and contemporary chroniclers blamed their situation on the Emperor and his sins against the Church. In early 1122, the couple travelled down the Rhine together as Henry continued to suppress the ongoing political unrest, but by now he was suffering from cancer. His condition worsened and he died on 23 May 1125 in Utrecht, leaving Matilda in the protection of their nephew Frederick, the heir to his estates. Before his death, he left the imperial insignia in the control of Matilda, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> instructions he gave her {{about the future of the}} Empire, which faced another leadership election. Archbishop Adalbert subsequently convinced Matilda that she should give him the insignia, and the Archbishop led the electoral process which appointed Lothair of Supplinburg, a former enemy of Henry, as the new King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about Blois' episcopate comes from his acta, or records; 86 of them survive. There is an early 14th-century {{reference}} to Blois' matricula, which can mean register, list, or list of students, but given the distance in time from when it was recorded to Blois' episcopate, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> exactly was meant by this. Nor has any such document survived. Blois' acta show him to have been an active and diligent administrator, especially concerned with the establishment of vicarages and with parish care. He also spent time mediating disputes, including one in 1204 over a church at Eynesbury that was disputed between Saer de Quincy, the canons of Newnham Priory and monks of St Neot's Priory. Most of his clerks and household members appear to have been non-relatives, with only another William de Blois, appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham by the bishop before becoming Bishop of Worcester in 1218, being a relative.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{conflict}} {{flared up}} {{once again in}} 1306, when Robert the Bruce killed his rival John Comyn and declared himself the King of the Scots. Edward I mobilised a fresh army, but decided that this time his son would be formally {{in charge of the}} expedition. Prince Edward was made the Duke of Aquitaine and then, along with many other young men, he was knighted in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey called the Feast of the Swans. Amid a huge feast in the neighbouring hall, reminiscent of Arthurian legends and crusading events, the assembly took a collective oath to defeat Bruce. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> role Prince Edward's forces played in the campaign that summer, which, under the orders of Edward I, saw a punitive, brutal retaliation against Bruce's faction in Scotland. Edward returned to England in September, where diplomatic negotiations to finalise a date for his wedding to Isabella continued.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 2006 season, Russo {{announced}} that he would be bringing his company public, a move that required that he divest himself of his sometimes unprofitable motorsports interests. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> would happen to the team until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> announced on November 28 that PKV Racing co-owner Dan Pettit had purchased the team from Russo.|$|R

Some critics said a question in the poll on apartheid was complex and problematically formulated.|$|R
50|$|Although {{architect}} James Hoban included {{space for}} the East Room in his 1792 plans for the White House, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> purpose the room should fulfill.

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} to be able to maintain a garrison when required and was well furnished. The ground floor and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. The ground floor may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and sleeping accommodation. The walls of the ground floor have chasing and sockets cut into them. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking alcohol. On {{the morning of the}} match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E

5|$|In 1065 Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and {{the rebels}} chose Morcar, {{the younger brother}} of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, as earl in place of Tostig. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, {{supported}} the rebels and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders, {{along with his wife}} Judith, who was the daughter of Count Baldwin IV of Flanders. Edward was ailing, and he died on 5 January 1066. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> exactly happened at Edward's deathbed. One story, deriving from the Vita Edwardi, a biography of Edward, claims that Edward was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and Robert FitzWimarc, and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute the fact that Harold was named as the next king, but they declare that Harold's oath and Edward's earlier promise of the throne could not be changed on Edward's deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz and his {{men were}} {{questioned}} by a French captain and accused of being spies and saboteurs. They {{were taken to the}} prison at Châlons the next day where they were separated. Strachwitz, as an officer, was placed in solitary confinement. Early in the morning they were all lined up for the firing squad, but a French captain arrived just in time to stop the execution. Strachwitz {{and his men}} were then tried before a French military court on 14 October 1914. The court sentenced them all to five years of forced labour on the prison island of Cayenne. At the same time they were deprived of rank, thus losing the status of prisoners of war. Strachwitz was then taken to the prisons at Lyon and Montpellier, and then to the Île de Ré, from where the prison ship would depart for Cayenne. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> circumstances prevented his departure, but he was imprisoned at Riom and Avignon instead. At Avignon prison he was physically and mentally tortured by both the guards and the other prisoners. This included being chained naked to a wall, deprivation of food and severe beatings. After one year at Avignon he was given a German uniform and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Fort Barraux.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was still chaotic when King HenryIII became king after his father's death in 1216. Although Bolsover fell to Ferrers' forces in 1217 after a siege, {{there is no}} indication that Peveril was assaulted, and it is likely that Brian de Lisle negotiated his surrender. Ferrers only had possession of the lordship until King HenryIII came of age. When the time came he was reluctant to hand over the property, and after an initial deadlock the Crown took control in 1223. Although contemporary Pipe Roll records of expenditure at Peveril survive, they do not specify how the money was spent. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>what</b> constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work; however, Richard Eales, who wrote the 2006 English Heritage guidebook, suggests that there were two periods of building, when sums spent were larger than usual: £54 in 1204–1207 and £67 in 1210–1212. The medieval historian Sidney Painter estimated that in about 1200 there were only seven magnates in England whose annual income exceeded £400 and a knight could easily live on £10 to £20 per year.|$|E
