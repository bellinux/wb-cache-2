25|$|On 6 May 2011, Craig Whyte bought David Murray's {{shares for}} £1. On 13 February 2012. Whyte filed legal papers at the Court of Session giving notice of their {{intention}} to appoint administrators. The next day, The Rangers Football Club plc – which was subsequently renamed RFC 2012 plc – entered administration over non-payment of £9million in PAYE and VAT taxes to HM Revenue and Customs. In April the administrators estimated that the club's total debts could top £134m which was largely dependent {{on the outcome of}} a First Tier Tax Tribunal concerning a disputed tax bill in relation to an <b>Employee</b> <b>Benefit</b> <b>Trust</b> ("EBT") scheme employed by the club since 2001. However, on 20 November 2012, the Tribunal ruled in favour of Rangers. If that decision is upheld the tax bill could be significantly reduced from an estimated £74m to under £2m. An Upper Tribunal upheld the decision in 2014. HMRC then appealed to the Court of Session, which ruled in November 2015 that Rangers should have paid tax and national insurance on the EBT payments.|$|E

5000|$|Since selling Rangers, the {{financial}} management during David Murray's reign at Rangers {{has come under}} even more criticism due to the club's entry into administration in February 2012. Murray sold Rangers to, Craig Whyte, has maintained a stance of blaming the previous regime led by Murray for the club's problems, particularly {{in relation to a}} potential heavy tax bill brought about by the use of <b>Employee</b> <b>Benefit</b> <b>Trusts.</b> Murray, however, has played down his role in the club's financial meltdown and also denied allegations of [...] "cheating", in relation to Rangers' use of EBTs, taking place during his time as owner.|$|R

50|$|Further to {{this the}} SPL instigated an {{investigation}} into Rangers transfer dealings between 2001 and 2011, after allegations of dual contracts between Rangers Football Club PLC (the company that formerly owned Rangers) and its staff. The investigation was conducted by a commission headed by Lord Nimmo Smith and concluded in February 2013. The Commission's findings concluded that Rangers Football Club PLC did not fully disclose to the football authorities all payments that it made to players and staff, however, this non-disclosure did not effect the playing staff's eligibility. Therefore, instead of a potential penalty that included the stripping of titles won by the first team, the punishment was only a fine of £250,000 for Rangers Football Club PLC. Alongside the SPL investigation, HMRC's first tier tax tribunal's came to a conclusion during the season. On 20 November, the First-tier Tax Tribunal ruled that the Rangers Football Club PLC had not contravened tax law with its use of <b>Employee</b> <b>Benefit</b> <b>Trusts,</b> however HMRC subsequently launched an appeal against the first-tier verdict in March 2013.|$|R

50|$|The legal {{implications}} of the previous company that owned the club's liquidation featured prevalent in the news in July and November.

Meanwhile, Rangers former chairman Craig Whyte was banned from being a company director for 15 years in September and a warrant was issued for his arrest a month later, he appeared in court facing charges under the Companies Act but was released on bail. Four men have appeared in court charged with fraudulent activity following a probe into the sale of Rangers in 2011. David Grier, Paul Clark and David Whitehouse (both administrators working for Duff & Phelps), and Gary Withey (a solicitor for Collyer Bristow) made no plea or declaration at Glasgow Sheriff Court and were granted bail.

5000|$|Fireworks night 2015 {{arrived a}} day early in Govan as 4 November {{proved to be}} a {{contentious}} day in the history of Rangers. The club's PLC owner, Rangers International Football Club, announced a loss of £7.5m for the year ending June 2015. This meant the company was required to find approximately £2.5m in order to cover expenses {{for the rest of the}} season. Moreover, the outcome of HMRC's appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal regarding the previous owner and its use of EBT's. The Court of Session ruled that the use of <b>Employee</b> <b>Benefit</b> <b>Trusts</b> broke tax rules therefore the payments were eligible for tax deductions, although an appeal to the Supreme Court was sought less than a month later and granted in March 2016. This judgement caused debate in Scottish football as many people erroneously believed the decision made by the Nimmo Smith commission not to strip Rangers of titles was based on the outcome of the tax case. Coincidentally, the Commission's ruling was taken to an arbitration tribunal by the clubs owners with RIFC PLC disputing its liability for the £250,000 fine plus £150,000 in additional costs, imposed on the company that previous owned the club. The SPFL subsequently imposed this on the new owners of the club as part of the terms of the five way agreement. However, an independent SFA tribunal ruled that RIFC PLC was liable for the fine in March 2016. Further legal matters occurred a week later, although not directly involving Rangers, as Mike Ashley lodged a challenge to the SFA's decision to pass King as a fit and proper person by seeking a Judicial review, however, the litigation was abandoned in April 2016 after his legal team received information about King's finances which the SFA used in their fit and proper deliberations. Ashley had also raised court proceedings against Dave King, accusing him of breaching a court injunction regarding the commercial agreements between Rangers and Sports Direct, however, the Royal Courts of Justice dismissed the motion for him to be jailed, moreover, a further accusation that King committed contempt of court was cleared. In the end, the court action against King was discontinued by Sports Direct as the company halted litigation claiming a breach of confidentiality in relation to a commercial deal, in which the Judge called [...] "ridiculous".|$|R
