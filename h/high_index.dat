The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a <b>high</b> <b>index</b> of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|E

At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption.

Non-vanishing of this <b>higher</b> <b>index</b> class is an obstruction for the two metrics {{to be in the}} same connected component of the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature.

The <b>higher</b> <b>index</b> theorem is a far-reaching {{generalization of}} the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for elliptic operators on a compact manifold. It was first proved by A. Connes and H.

In this paper, the authors prove an algebraic generalization of the <b>higher</b> <b>index</b> theorem to symplectic manifolds.

25|$|Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, {{abdominal}} cramps, and constipation {{are common}} side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells.

Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment.

[...] When radio waves travelling through the waveguide hit the opening, this impedance-step reflects a significant fraction of the wave energy back down the guide toward the source, so {{that not all of}} the power is radiated. [...] This is similar to the reflection at an open-ended transmission line or a boundary between optical mediums with a low and <b>high</b> <b>index</b> of refraction, like at a glass surface. [...] The reflected waves cause standing waves in the waveguide, increasing the [...] SWR, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter. [...] In addition, the small aperture of the waveguide (less than one wavelength) causes significant diffraction of the waves issuing from it, resulting in a wide radiation pattern without much directivity.|$|E
