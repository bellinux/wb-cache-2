2500|$|Trade secret {{misappropriation}} {{is different}} from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The United States also has federal law {{in the form of}} the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (...) , which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{constructive}} trusts {{relate to}} the transfer of property. Those trusts over homes are known as trusts of common intention, and relate exclusively to family homes. In Lloyds Bank v Rosset, the House of Lords set out {{the circumstances in which}} a trust of common intention can arise. Firstly, where the parties demonstrate that there was an agreement formed before the acquisition of the property. Secondly, where the parties contribute to the purchase price or mortgage payments and therefore practically demonstrate a common intention to claim an equitable interest; this second form is similar to one form of resulting trust Common intention trusts grant a claimant an <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> to the home, calculated as a proportion of the total value that corresponds to their financial contributions. The second occasion on which a constructive trust may arise over property is where a piece of property is sold or transferred. The contract transfers the equitable interest from the original owner to the other party, which takes place through a constructive trust. This originated with Chinn v Collins, where it was decided that the creation of such a contract automatically passes the equitable interest to the buyer, [...] assuming the contract can be completed. Until it is completed, that property is held on constructive trust by the seller {{for the benefit of the}} buyer. This applies to both personal and real property, with additional rules for the transfer of real property (land). Section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 provides that the contract must be in writing, which is not a requirement for the transfer of personal property.|$|E

It was in consequence of my knowledge of the general tenor of the researches in which Mr. Darwin had been so long engaged; because I had the most complete confidence in his perseverance, his knowledge, and, above all things, his high-minded love of truth; and, moreover, because I found that the better I became acquainted with the opinions of the best naturalists regarding the vexed question of species, the less fixed they seemed to be, and the more inclined they were to the hypothesis of gradual modification, that I ventured to speak as strongly as I have done in the final paragraphs of my discourse.|$|E

6000|$|... (M86) If Englishmen and Scots had {{not found}} the theme so uninviting, {{if they had}} given a {{fraction}} of the attention to the tenure and history of Irish land, that was bestowed, say, upon the Seisachtheia of Solon at Athens, or the Sempronian law in ancient Rome, this chapter in our annals would not have been written. As it was, parliament had made laws for landlord and tenant in Ireland without well understanding what is either an Irish landlord or an Irish tenant. England has been able to rule India, Mill said, because the business of ruling devolved upon men who passed their lives in India, and made Indian interests their regular occupation. India has on the whole been governed with a pretty full perception of its differences from England. Ireland on the contrary, suffering a worse misfortune than absentee landlords, was governed by an absentee parliament. In England, property means the rights of the rent-receiver who has equipped the land and prepared it for the capital and the skill of the tenant. In Ireland, {{in the minds of the}} vast majority of the population, for reasons just as good, property includes rights of the cultivator, whose labour has drained the land, and reclaimed it, and fenced it, and made farm-roads, and put a dwelling and farm buildings on it, and given to it all the working value that it possesses. We need suppose no criminality on either side. The origin of the difference was perfectly natural. In Ireland the holdings were small and multitudinous; no landlord who was not a millionaire, could have prepared and equipped holdings numbered by hundreds or thousands; and if he could, the hundreds and thousands of tenants had not a straw of capital. This peculiarity in social circumstances made it certain, therefore, that if the moral foundation of modern ideas of property is that he who sows shall reap, the idea of property would grow up in the mind of the cultivator, whenever the outer climate permitted the growth in his mind of any ideas of moral or <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> at all.|$|E
50|$|An <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> is a {{legal right}} {{guaranteed}} by equity {{as opposed to a}} legal right which derives authority from a legal source. An example of an <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> could be seen in Land law, where mention is made of a beneficial interest i.e. vested interests in an estate which are protected by equity. In essence, a contributor to the purchase of a property, has an <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> to that property albeit not being the registered proprietor.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{a lender}} obtains a {{security}} interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset {{like a house}} to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults and the lender tries to repossess the property, courts of equity can grant the borrower the <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> of redemption if the borrower repays the debt. While this <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> exists, it is a cloud on title and the lender cannot {{be sure that they}} can repossess the property. Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to foreclose (in plain English, immediately terminate) the <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> of redemption and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple. Other lien holders can also foreclose the owner's right of redemption for other debts, such as for overdue taxes, unpaid contractors' bills or overdue homeowners' association dues or assessments.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, the High Court in ABC v Lenah Game Meats (See also [...] "Patrick Stevedores Operations No. 2 Pty Ltd & Ors v Maritime Union of Australia & Ors" [...] ) {{stated that}} the purpose of the {{interlocutory}} injunction is to preserve identifiable legal or <b>equitable</b> <b>rights.</b> The basic proposition remains that where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in a Judicature system court, it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or <b>equitable</b> <b>rights</b> which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature. In another Australian High Court decision, Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148, Mason CJ outlined another requirement for establishing an interlocutory injunction. He suggested that the plaintiff had to show that 'irreparable injury' would be suffered, for which common law damages would not be adequate compensation, unless an injunction was granted. The main difficulty associated with granting an interlocutory injunction is that the court must consider whether the likelihood of a legal action being established is sufficiently strong for the injunction to be granted.|$|R

50|$|Mortgage {{possession}} involves {{legal proceedings}} {{in which a}} mortgagee, or other lienholder, usually a lender, obtains a court order for possession of a property, prior to exercising the mortgagor's <b>equitable</b> <b>right</b> of redemption.

50|$|Because {{the right}} of {{redemption}} is an <b>equitable</b> <b>right,</b> foreclosure is an action in equity.

Second, whenever a parthy B has a right against a right of another A, B's right is prima facie binding on anyone who acquires a right that derives from A's right.

Secondly, because the legal title to the mortgaged property is not actually vested in the secured party, it means that a necessary additional step is imposed in relation to the exercise of remedies such as foreclosure.|$|E
