5|$|Norwich <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{game against}} Chelsea {{with a goal}} from Anthony Pilkington but conceded two late goals to finish 1–3 to the visitors. This was {{followed}} up with a 4–1 away defeat by Arsenal. The home fixture against Cardiff City finished in controversy during when Leroy Fer put {{the ball in the}} back of the net when passing the ball back to goalkeeper David Marshall. This resulted in a melee in which both Norwich and Cardiff were fined £20,000 by the FA for failing to control their players. The game was also notable with Norwich having 31 shots at goal despite the game finishing as a draw.|$|E
5|$|Control {{went back}} and forth at the {{beginning}} of the match between Hulk Hogan and Earthquake. When Earthquake rolled out of the ring, both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against Earthquake and Dino Bravo. Bravo and Earthquake powerslammed Hogan while the referee was distracted, which allowed Earthquake to lock Hogan in a Boston crab hold. After being powerslammed outside of the ring by Earthquake, Hogan tried to lift his opponent but was unsuccessful. Earthquake powerslammed Hogan and performed two Earthquake splashes but was unable to get the pinfall. Hogan recovered and bodyslammed Earthquake. He performed a legdrop on Earthquake before Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart interfered. Hogan threw him out of the ring and then bodyslammed Earthquake onto a table at ringside. Hogan <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring and won the match via countout. Earthquake attacked Hogan after the match, but the Big Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting Earthquake with a chair.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes into}} the second half, Juventus {{equalised}}: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba {{went down in the}} area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lead when Lionel Messi shot {{from the edge of the}} area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E

5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> motorcade, {{once again in the}} third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

After the National City merger in 2008, the U.S. Bancorp products were converted fully to PNC Bank products.|$|E

50|$|Palazzi was the {{starting}} {{center for the}} Giants from 1946 to 1948 and ended his playing career with the Boston Yanks in 1949. After that, Chicago Bears owner George Halas, who tried to get Palazzi to play for him, <b>got</b> him <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> league as an official in 1951.|$|R

25|$|Yet {{another car}} drove past and Bryant shot at it, hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand. The driver, Simon Williams, {{was struck by}} fragments. The driver of another {{approaching}} vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to {{the house where the}} Martins, his first victims, lay dead.|$|E
25|$|During {{the ride}} the car passed several service {{stations}} {{but the man}} did not stop. For about 90 minutes he drove back and forth around the backroads near Tracy. When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject. When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> car and drove off. Johns hitched a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E
25|$|Scotland started well in Bridgend with Wade Liddell {{giving the}} Bravehearts the lead after just 8 minutes. This try was {{converted}} by Gareth Morton. But things got bad as Wales pulled a try back through Richard Johnson, and then Danny Brough was sinbinned for dissent on 26 minutes. In {{the next ten}} minutes a Wales team minus Iestyn Harris, who failed a fitness test prior to the match, capitalised on Scotland's shortfall and scored two tries to create a 14–6 lead going into half-time. However, after the break the Scots immediately <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match, Danny Brough singlehandedly scoring a try after 70 seconds of the interval, and Jamie Benn a little later leeching on to a grubber kick. Mick Nanyn missed both conversions and so the scores were tied. On the 67th minute Scotland went in front, Nanyn converting his own try. And to seal a 21–14 victory Danny Brough scored a drop-goal. He would later get Man of the Match award.|$|E
50|$|Cissé <b>got</b> himself <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{first team}} picture, but his {{relationship}} with Bruce continued to go sour, and after Christmas he only played three more games that season.

5000|$|By this time, some artists, {{including}} Spiegelman, {{felt that}} the underground comix scene had become less creative {{than it had been}} in the past. According to Spiegelman, [...] "What had seemed like a revolution simply deflated into a lifestyle. Underground comics were stereotyped as dealing only with Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills. They <b>got</b> stuffed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> closet, along with bong pipes and love beads, as Things Started To Get Uglier." ...|$|R
25|$|Three minutes later, Cristiano Ronaldo {{played a}} short corner to Ryan Giggs, who evaded {{challenges}} from two Europe XI players before playing the ball across the goal area, where Wes Brown {{was on hand}} to poke it home. After a couple more chances for the home side, the Europe XI <b>got</b> themselves <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game midway through the first half, via Florent Malouda's low, long-range strike, which passed {{just out of reach}} of Tomasz Kuszczak's outstretched hand.|$|R
25|$|While {{this was}} happening, Hart took {{advantage}} of a momentary lapse in concentration by Austin, who had just finished attacking Diesel, and threw him over the top rope {{on the far side}} of the ring. As Austin got to his feet, he quickly realized that none of the officials had seen his feet touch the floor as they were too busy with breaking the brawl up on the opposite side of the ring. Austin then <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring and continued in the match as if he had not been eliminated, and almost as soon as he did so he pushed both Undertaker and Vader, who were locked in a battle of their own to try to stay in the match, over the top. By this time, Mankind and Funk had been separated and the officials could focus again on the match, just in time to see Hart eliminate Diesel. Just after he did, though, Austin returned the favor from before and dumped Hart out of the ring. As a result, since as far as the officials were concerned Austin was still a legal participant in the match, he was declared the winner of the Royal Rumble.|$|E
25|$|Lyon {{opened up}} their Ligue 1 season in a {{positive}} fashion, defeating Toulouse 3–0 with a brace from Karim Benzema and a rare goal from Jean Makoun. Following a 0–0 draw away to Lorient, which dropped them to third in the league standings, Lyon rebounded with back-to-back wins over Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne respectively. Following that, Lyon picked up their third-straight victory with a 3–2 win over Nice. The match was, however, marred with controversy—after trailing 0–2, Lyon <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match with two spectacular free-kicks from Juninho. With the match in injury time and looking to end in a draw, referee Jean-Charles Cailleux {{and one of his}} assistant referees ruled a handball infraction had been committed by Nice defender Vincent Hognon in the box, giving Lyon a penalty which was converted by Benzema. Looking at the replay, it could have easily been determined that the handball infraction had been without malice and that the penalty should have not been given. However, Lyon escaped with a victory, which moved them into first place. They followed this win up with back to back one goal wins over newly promoted side Le Havre and Nancy giving them five-straight league victories.|$|E
25|$|Halas's {{replacement}} was Jim Dooley. In Dooley's {{first season}} {{at the helm of}} the team, the Bears finished with a 7–7 record. The low point of the season, though, was not the mediocre performance but a career threatening knee injury to Gale Sayers, from which he never fully recovered. The decade though was highlighted with the 1969 season. After Sayers's injury, back-up running back Brian Piccolo did not believe he deserved the job because of the injury. Instead of running away with his opportunity as most athletes would, Piccolo, who was a popular figure in the Chicago area and roomed with Sayers for a few years on road trips, during the entire off-season pushed Sayers to get his knee back into football playing shape. Sayers <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lineup, and Piccolo was back on the bench when the season started. Sayers rushed for 1,000 yards and earned the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. This was the ultimate display of friendship between Piccolo and Sayers, who were friends despite race differences within society during the 1960s. The Bears finished the season, even with Sayers's performance, with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. The Bears' hopes worsened due to the fact that they have the No. 2 pick, while the Steelers have the first overall pick (with the Bears defeating them), allowing Pittsburgh to draft future Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw.|$|E
50|$|The Volunteers {{started the}} season with five {{straight}} victories before facing off against #2 Alabama, which they lost 42-21. A win over TCU was followed by losses to Georgia and Ole Miss that dropped {{them out of the}} rankings. Victories over Kentucky and Vanderbilt to end <b>the</b> season <b>got</b> them <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> polls as they limped to a fourth place finish in the Southeastern Conference, though they were invited to a bowl game for the seventh straight year.|$|R
50|$|Three minutes later, Cristiano Ronaldo {{played a}} short corner to Ryan Giggs, who evaded {{challenges}} from two Europe XI players before playing the ball across the goal area, where Wes Brown {{was on hand}} to poke it home.

50|$|Two days later, on April 16, the Red Wings evened up {{the series}} at 1-1 behind a strong game from Henrik Zetterberg who {{recorded}} a hat trick to propel Detroit to a 7-4 win. The Coyotes struck first off a tip-in from Keith Yandle but <b>the</b> Wings <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> it. <b>The</b> second period was an eventful one, with the teams combining for five {{goals in a}} span of 3:58. However, Detroit added four goals in the third period, including the eventual game winner by Zetterberg, to take home the win.|$|R
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth {{straight}} game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13–3 at Coors Field. In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup {{at the same time}} (Tony Gwynn, Jr., Jerry Hairston, Jr., Iván DeJesús, Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6–2 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3–2. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Elián Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4–3 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee {{in the top of the}} eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2–1 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6-5. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8–3 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a cross-country flight to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It was all they needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw stuck out a season high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston, Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8–3 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8–2 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.|$|E
500|$|On 22 October, Benfica hosted Estrela da Amadora. The {{visitors}} scored first though Dário, but Benfica equalized in {{the first}} half and scored two more goals in the second, winning the match 3–1. Santos was highly critical of the referee Carlos Xistra, who issued 18 yellow cards and three red cards, one of them to Miccoli, who would therefore miss the next match, a visit to Porto. Five days later, Benfica played Porto {{in the first}} Clássico of the season. In a high-tension match, Benfica conceded two goals {{in the first half}} but equalized in the second half, drawing the game in the 82th minute. However, in injury time, Bruno Moraes scored, bringing the score to 3–2 to Porto. Santos said the result was unfair, adding, [...] "After he <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game and managed to level it, 'that' happened in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|On 17 September, Benfica {{received}} Nacional at home. With Simão {{making his}} league debut, Benfica scored the only {{goal of the}} match when Simão assisted Luisão in the 29th minute. On the following Friday, Benfica played Paços de Ferreira on the road. Katsouranis scored the first goal for Benfica but Paços equalized in the 92th minute. In Santos' analysis, Benfica controlled the match, but after [...] "an inexplicable ejection from Léo, the home team <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game." [...] Four days later, Benfica received Manchester United for the second matchday of the group stage. A single goal from Louis Saha in the 61st minute won United the match and {{the lead in the}} group standings. It was Benfica's 12th loss in 20 matches against English teams in Europe and the fifth loss in six matches against United. Santos said Benfica played [...] "60 minutes of great quality," [...] but was disappointed with loss and expressed a desire to improve the situation.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, 2001, Henderson hijacked {{a car at}} gunpoint, kidnapped {{the driver}} for a brief amount of time, robbed a {{convenience}} store for petty cash ($360 in total), and threatened the store clerk with the gun. This night was fueled by drug use. Henderson said {{that his wife had}} just died and it was an emotionally turbulent time for him, which is why he <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> drugs. <b>The</b> crimes he committed that evening landed him in prison, and since he was a repeat offender, Henderson was given life without parole.|$|R
50|$|Carolina {{would take}} the lead in the third quarter with quarterback Jake Delhomme {{completing}} a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeff King and running back Jonathan Stewart getting a 26-yard touchdown, yet the Buccaneers immediately <b>got</b> themselves <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game as rookie wide receiver Sammie Stroughter returned the kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay tied the game with safety Tanard Jackson's 26-yard interception return for a touchdown. However, the Panthers delivered the final blow with Williams' 1-yard touchdown run.|$|R

500|$|Three {{days after}} Leiria, Benfica {{received}} PSG {{for the second}} leg. Benfica scored their first goal in the 12th minute and another before half-time. However, the Parisians <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game with a goal from Pauleta. Throughout the second half, Benfica threatened Mickaël Landreau's goalposts, finally scoring near the 90th minute when Simão converted a penalty resulting from a foul on Léo. Simão told the media, [...] "We knew we were stronger and had {{to take advantage of}} their mistakes. That is what he did." [...] In the quarter-finals, Benfica were due to play Spanish side Espanyol, first in Barcelona and then in Lisbon. Domestically, Benfica played Estrela da Amadora on 19 March. Because Sporting had beat Porto in the match between them, Benfica could close up their distance {{from the top of the}} table to one point if they won. At the Estádio da Reboleira, Benfica defeated Estrela 1–0 with a goal from Petit in the 81st minute. The win left Benfica with 51 points, one fewer than Porto. The Clássico was the next match; Santos lowered [...] fans' expectations by saying the league race was open for all of the Big Three and that there were still eight match-days to go before the season's end.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his career as an entertainer, Jones' other first love was horses. Training as a jockey in his teens, Jones later said, [...] "I made one huge mistake. When the Monkees finished in 1969–70, I should have got away from Hollywood and <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> racing game. Instead I waited another 10 years. Everyone makes mistakes in life and for me that was the biggest." [...] He held an amateur rider's licence and rode in his first race at Newbury in Berkshire, England for trainer Toby Balding.|$|E
2500|$|The next match saw Randy Orton {{defend the}} WWE Championship against John Cena. The match started slow, {{with the men}} trading dominance. After a {{submission}} attempt by Cena, Orton feigned an injury outside the ring and ordered the referee Mike Chioda to count him out. When Cena came to check Orton's [...] "injury", Orton delivered an RKO to Cena outside the ring. Orton {{got back in the}} ring and the referee started to count Cena out. Cena <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring on a nine-count, but Orton purposely slapped the referee in the face and got himself disqualified. In result, Orton lost the match but retained the title. After the match, Cena delivered an FU to Orton, and applied the STFU.|$|E
50|$|Houlihan is {{a highly}} skilled player and has been {{extremely}} versatile, able to play a variety of positions. Early in 2002, while continuing to play as a forward, an electrifying three goals in a quarter <b>got</b> Carlton <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Round 8 match against Hawthorn. Toward the end of 2002, Houlihan began to play-off the half-back line, where his skill and run were used to set up forward thrusts. He {{played an important role}} off half back in the Round 21 victory against the Bulldogs, with 23 possessions and set up the winning goal.|$|R
50|$|In particular, {{the team}} {{struggled}} offensively in Kessel's absence. Having nearly finished first in scoring the previous season, the Bruins lingered {{near the bottom}} of the league in goal production. However, they were able to stay competitive due to their exceptional defense and strong goaltending tandem. While defending Vezina Trophy winner Tim Thomas was recovering from an early injury, rookie netminder Tuukka Rask emerged as a potential Calder Memorial Trophy candidate. A four-game winning streak in November set the Bruins back on course, and a 5-1-0 home record in December <b>got</b> them <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> divisional race by Christmas.|$|R
50|$|McGuigan {{returned}} from America in 1983, and <b>got</b> straight <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tyrone fold, {{and in the}} Ulster Final of 1984, he put in his career-defining performance. Against local rivals Armagh, McGuigan scored eleven of Tyrone's points from open play - five on each foot, and one fisted over. This {{is considered one of}} the greatest individual performances in the modern G.A.A. era. It was voted as one of the Top 20 GAA Moments of the previous forty years (i.e. since the dawn of televised matches).This tally helped McGuigan top the scorer's list in the Ulster Championship with a total of 0-19.|$|R
