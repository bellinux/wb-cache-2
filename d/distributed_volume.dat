5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{drawbacks}} to {{the application}} of many early models was the inability {{to take account of}} congested travel time on the road network in determining the probability of making a trip between two locations. Although Wohl noted as early as 1963 research into the feedback mechanism or the “interdependencies among assigned or <b>distributed</b> <b>volume,</b> travel time (or travel ‘resistance’) and route or system capacity”, this work has yet to be widely adopted with rigorous tests of convergence, or with a so-called “equilibrium” or “combined” solution (Boyce et al. 1994). Haney (1972) suggests internal assumptions about travel time used to develop demand should be consistent with the output travel times of the route assignment of that demand. While small methodological inconsistencies are necessarily a problem for estimating base year conditions, forecasting becomes even more tenuous without an understanding of the feedback between supply and demand. Initially heuristic methods were developed by Irwin and Von Cube (as quoted in Florian et al. (1975) [...] ) and others, and later formal mathematical programming techniques were established by Evans (1976).|$|E

Despite {{the fact that the}} data structure is integrated into the volume, the graphics card’s hardware can still be used for trilinear interpolation of density values without producing incorrect results.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an efficient parallel algorithm for volume rendering of large-scale datasets. Our algorithm focuses on an optimization technique, namely early ray termination (ERT), {{which aims to}} reduce the amount of computation by avoiding enumeration of invisible voxels in the visualizing volume. The novelty of the algorithm is that it incorporates this technique into a <b>distributed</b> <b>volume</b> rendering system with global reduction of the computational amount. The algorithm also is capable of statically balancing the processor workloads. The experimental results show that our algorithm with global ERT further achieves the maximum reduction of 33 % compared to an earlier algorithm with local ERT. As a result, our load-balanced algorithm reduces the execution time to at least 66 %, not only for dense objects but also for transparent objects. ...|$|E

50|$|The IBM XIV Storage System is a {{disk storage}} server. The {{system is a}} {{collection}} of modules, each of which is an independent computer with its own memory, interconnections, disk drives, and other subcomponents, laid out in a grid and connected together in parallel using either InfiniBand (third generation systems) or Ethernet (second generation systems) connections. Each module has an x86 CPU and runs a software platform consisting largely of a modified Linux kernel and other open source software. Traditional storage systems <b>distribute</b> a <b>volume</b> across a subset of disk drives in a clustered fashion. The XIV storage system <b>distributes</b> <b>volumes</b> across all modules in 1 MiB chunks (partitions) so that all of the modules' resources are used evenly. For robustness, each logical partition is stored in at least two copies on separate modules, so that if a part of a disk drive, an entire disk drive, or an entire module fails, the data is still available. One can increase the system storage capacity by adding additional modules. When one adds a module, the system automatically redistributes previously stored data to make optimal use of its I/O capacity. Depending on the model and disk type chosen when the machine is ordered, one system can be configured for storage capacity from 27 TB to 324 TB.|$|R

This research proposes a system of diaphragms {{as an alternative to the}} use of fans for <b>distributing</b> <b>volumes</b> of air. The driving concepts for this project are the three types of evolutionary adaptation: flexibility, acclimation, and learning. Of particular interest is how these biological concepts relate to architectural design. Parametric modelling was used throughout the project to study a family of folding geometry. This allowed for the iterative development of a complex part that is capable of being manufactured from a single sheet of material. Preliminary calculations point to this system being several times more energy efficient than a fan at moving a given volume of air per Watt of electricity. This research is significant as it puts forth a potentially energy efficient and highly integrated alternative to fans, while also illustrating a way of relating biological concepts of adaptation to architectural design. ...|$|R
