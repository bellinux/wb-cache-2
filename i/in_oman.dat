5|$|The cyclone was {{considered}} the worst disaster <b>in</b> <b>Oman</b> during the 20th century, and remains the deadliest cyclone as of 2010. Overall, the cyclone caused 105deaths, and over 5,000injuries, and left about 20,000people homeless. The death toll is disputed, as another report indicated 110deaths <b>in</b> <b>Oman.</b> After the storm, neighboring Saudi Arabia sent assistance to Oman, as did other nations in the Persian Gulf. The cyclone struck before the nation created a coordinated disaster network in 1988; as a result, the relief work was spread among various agencies.|$|E

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones like Gonu {{are extremely}} rare over the Arabian Sea, and most storms {{in this area}} tend to be small and dissipate quickly.

Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610mm (24inches), which caused flooding and heavy damage. In Iran, the cyclone caused 28deaths and $ in damage (2007USD).|$|E

5|$|The {{game is a}} side-scrolling shoot 'em up and {{revolves}} around the protagonist, Lieutenant Dale Hawkins, recovering caches of hidden Stinger missiles from Arab terrorists <b>in</b> <b>Oman.</b> The game features {{a total of five}} levels with varying locations and begins with allocating five lives to the player. The main objective of the game is to locate and place time bombs on boxes containing Stinger missiles, in which the player is required to escape before the time runs out. The enemies featured in the game are Arab terrorists; the player must neutralise them by shooting them with their selected weapon, which is a handgun by default. Other weapons available in the game include machine guns, rocket launchers, and a flamethrower, which are only accessible through finding hidden crates.|$|E
5|$|This basin’s {{season has}} a double peak: one in April and May, before {{the onset of}} the monsoon, and another in October and November, just after. This double peak occurs because {{powerful}} vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones. High shear explains why no cyclones can form in the Red Sea, which possesses the necessary depth, vorticity and surface temperatures year-round. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage <b>in</b> <b>Oman</b> on the peninsula in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Gonu set several {{intensity}} records. When {{it became}} a very severe cyclonic storm on June 3, Gonu became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea. Later, it became the only super cyclonic storm, which is a tropical cyclone with 3-minute sustained winds of at least 220km/h (140mph), in the region. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph). Based on their estimate, Gonu was tied with the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone for the strongest tropical cyclone in the entire northern Indian Ocean, and had the highest windspeed of any cyclone in this basin. On June 6, Gonu made landfall in extreme eastern Oman with winds of 150km/h (90mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike the Arabian Peninsula. With a damage total of $4.2billion (2007USD) and 50deaths, Gonu became the worst natural disaster on record <b>in</b> <b>Oman.</b> Additionally, the storm was only the second cyclonic storm on record to strike Iran, the other doing so on June 4, 1898.|$|E
