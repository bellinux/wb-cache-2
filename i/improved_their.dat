5|$|During the Mesozoic, the prototypical mammal {{was a small}} nocturnal {{insectivore}} {{something like}} a tree shrew. Due to their nocturnal habits, most mammals lost their color vision, and greatly <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> sense of hearing. All mammals of today are shaped by this origin. Primates later re-evolved color-vision.|$|E
5|$|A {{slackening}} {{of social}} customs occurred on all social levels; extramarital relationships and illegitimate children were common. Because poverty {{was on the}} rise—especially in the lower classes—many women were forced to find lodgings quickly, for example in convents, o. This explained the abundance of the clergy in a small city like Quito; often men were ordained not because of a vocation but because it solved their economic problems and <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> community standing.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} cooled in {{the final}} qualifying session, {{over a third of}} the field <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> fastest laps, but Jani's pole position time was unchallenged. Audi No. 7 led the session with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three of their cars during the session, closing to within a second of the closest LMP1 competitor. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed to within a second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, a second and a half ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. The No. 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the session which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E

Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck {{on either side of}} the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> leverage. However, they were positioned {{on either side of the}} centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema had to rely on its sails for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Marquis Maze had 106 yards {{receiving}} on five catches and McCarron set a {{new career}} high with 284 yards passing. For his defensive performance, Hightower was named both the Lott IMPACT Player of the Week and the SEC Defensive Player of the Week. The victory was Alabama's fifth consecutive over Tennessee and <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> all-time record against the Volunteers to 48–38–7 (49–37–8 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1991–92 season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and {{replaced}} by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself.

In the next year, the Rockets <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> record by 13 games, getting the Midwest Division title, and winning their first playoff series in 6 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics in a closely contested Game 7 overtime loss.|$|E

5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} that weekend's games {{improved}} {{the clarity of the}} ACC Championship Game picture, but did not decide it. Maryland <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> ACC record to 4–2and took the uncontested lead of the Atlantic Division. Florida State lost to Boston College that same day, which meant four teams were still able to secure the division title: Boston College, Florida State, Maryland, and Wake Forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} Maryland's sixth {{consecutive}} against ranked opponents, which {{set a new}} school record.

Maryland also <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> home record to 6–0for the season.

5|$|There were {{calls for}} Diefenbaker's retirement, {{especially}} from the Bay Street {{wing of the party}} as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts to remove him without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> position slightly {{at the expense of the}} smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|Though only {{numbering}} about 3,000 {{soldiers and}} 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners {{in the former}} Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign.

5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> skill.|$|E

However, the Hornets also announced that they {{were in the process of}} negotiating with Oklahoma City to play the 2007–08 season at the Ford Center as a contingency plan.

5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing north {{in the direction of}} Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E
5|$|Before {{resorting to}} killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets {{had tried to}} poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot {{on his way to}} work (this proved {{impossible}} as the Afghans had <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri's return from Moscow. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.|$|E

The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> works and deepened their trenches.
