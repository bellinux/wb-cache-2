40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} phase field {{simulation of}} ferroelectric films is used that incorporates Landau-Devonshire energy, gradient energy and depolarization electrical energy. A new intermediate <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>condition</b> is firstly presented {{to study the}} effects on domain structures of ferroelectric films. Two-dimensional simulations of domain structures are carried out under the open circuit (OC), short circuit (SC) and intermediate (IM) <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>conditions.</b> The simulation results show that there are multi-vortices domains and 180 ° multi-stripes domains under OC and SC <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>condition,</b> respectively. And there is a transition from multi-vortices domains to 180 ° multi-stripes domains under the IM <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>condition</b> due to competition between the elastic energy and depolarization electrical energy in the films. The present IM <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>condition</b> can completely characterize different degrees of compensation for surface charges by the electrodes and further describe {{the effect on the}} depolarization electrical energy.

6000|$|The {{subject of}} thunderbolts {{is a very}} {{fascinating}} one, and {{all the more so}} because there are no such things in existence at all as thunderbolts of any sort. Like the snakes of Iceland, their whole history might, from the positive point of view at least, be summed up in the simple statement of their utter nonentity. But does that do away in the least, I should like to know, with their intrinsic interest and importance? Not a bit of it. It only adds to the mystery and charm of the whole subject. Does anyone feel as keenly interested in any real living cobra or anaconda as in the non-existent great sea-serpent? Are ghosts and vampires less attractive objects of popular study than cats and donkeys? Can the present King of Abyssinia, interviewed by our own correspondent, equal the romantic charm of Prester John, or the butcher in the next street rival the personality of Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne, Baronet? No, the real fact is this: if there were thunderbolts, the question of their nature and action would be a wholly dull, scientific, and priggish one; it is their unreality alone that invests them with all the mysterious weirdness of pure fiction. Lightning, now, is a common thing that one reads about wearily in the books on electricity, a mere ordinary matter of positive and negative, density and potential, to be measured in ohms (whatever they may be), and partially imitated with Leyden jars and red sealing-wax apparatus. Why, did not Benjamin Franklin, a fat old gentleman in ill-fitting small clothes, bring it down from the clouds with a simple door-key, somewhere near Philadelphia? and does not Mr. Robert Scott (of the Meteorological Office) calmly predict its probable occurrence within the next twenty-four hours in his daily report, as published regularly in the morning papers? This is lightning, mere vulgar lightning, a simple result of <b>electrical</b> <b>conditions</b> in the upper atmosphere, inconveniently connected with algebraical formulas in x, y, z, with horrid symbols interspersed in Greek letters.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> on second-harmonic generation (SHG) of ultrasonic guided wave propagation in a piezoelectric plate are analyzed. Based on the modal expansion analysis for waveguide excitation, an accurate description for the SHG effect of primary ultrasonic guided wave propagation in a piezoelectric plate {{has been presented}} within a second-order perturbation approximation. The formal solution of the double frequency guided waves, constituting the field of second harmonic, has been developed. The analytical results clearly reveal that the SHG effect of primary guided wave propagation {{is closely related to}} the electric boundary conditions of the piezoelectric plate. It is found that under different <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> there is an evident difference in the SHG effect of ultrasonic guided waves, and that the SHG effect is highly sensitive to the <b>electrical</b> boundary <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>condition</b> {{monitoring}} (CM) normally {{involves the}} collection of high-frequency, instantaneous data for feature extraction. This paper presents a novel development of an <b>electrical</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring system for wind turbines. The system is developed based upon a control and data acquisition system, for which hardware modules can be configured for {{a particular set of}} signals, thus tailoring the system to a specific range of monitoring tasks. A wavelet-based singularity detection method is proposed, which automatically calculates the Lipschitz exponent, a measure to describe the local transient activities in the measurement signal. The relationship between the Lipschitz exponent and the type and severity of faults occurring on the grid and in the power electronics is explored. The proposed algorithms are tested and validated using simulation data from computer simulations of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine with a grid connection. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) embedded in the system has been utilised, allowing the signal processing tasks to be undertaken in real-time for monitoring purposes. The paper demonstrates that a fault signal of small magnitude generated at the early stage of a fault carries the same Lipschitz exponent as the signal of large magnitude generated at the late stage of the fault, thereby providing an early warning before the fault develops into a detrimental one...|$|R
