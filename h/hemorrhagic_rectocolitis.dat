40|$|National audienceWith {{more than}} 10 years of {{experience}} in rheumatology and thousands of patients treated, the infectious and oncological risks of TNF-alpha blocking agents are well. known. The efficacy of biotherapies in rheumatismal diseases has been largely demonstrated. The recent review of publications and communications shows that biotherapies benefit the comorbidities associated with inflammatory rheumatisms (uveitis, Crohn disease, <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>rectocolitis,</b> stroke, myocardial infarction). The can even reduce the excess mortality of chronic rheumatoid inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Entamoeba histolytica (Schaudinn, 1903), a {{protozoan}} with worldwide distribution, {{estimated to}} infect about 500 million people worldwide and registering higher rates in tropical countries, is {{also present in}} Romania. It {{has been difficult to}} distinguish, until recently, from the morphologically identical, but no pathological Entamoeba dispar. A number of 148 persons diagnosed with <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>rectocolitis</b> were hospitalized at Fundeni Clinical Institute in the Gastroenterology Department between May 2007 and September 2008. Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba coli, Blastocystis hominis, E. histolytica protozoan species, and Clostridium difficile as unique etiologies, as well as the association of Giardia lamblia and Clostridium difficile, respectively Entamoeba coli and Clostridium difficile were detected in 139 patients. All patients were tested by ELISA (IgM detection) for the presence of E. histolytica, 3 % of them being positive. Two of the positive patients belonged to high risk groups (male homosexuals and traveling in warmer areas endemic for E. histolytica), while one was infected locally. Taking into consideration the global warming registered also in Romania, especially during the winter time, it could be plausible that over-wintering mortality of E. histolytica cysts may decrease, hence leading to an increase in the future incidence of this infection in our country...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: We {{aimed to}} assess the {{feasibility}} and outcomes of complex ureteropelvic junc-tion obstruction cases submitted to robotic-assisted lapa-roscopic pyeloplasty. Methods: The records of 131 consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty were reviewed. Of this initial population of cases, 17 were considered complex, consisting of either atypical anatomy (horseshoe kidneys in 3 patients) or previous ureteropel-vic junction obstruction management (14 patients). The patients were divided into 2 groups: primary pyeloplasty (group 1) and complex cases (group 2). Results: The mean operative time was 117. 3 33. 5 min-utes in group 1 and 153. 5 31. 1 minutes in group 2 (P. 002). The median hospital stay was 5. 19 1. 66 days in group 1 and 5. 90 2. 33 days in group 2 (P. 326). The surgical findings included 53 crossing vessels in group 1 and 5 in group 2. One patient in group 1 required con-version to open surgery because of technical difficulties. One patient in group 2, {{with a history of}} <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>rectocolitis,</b> presented with peritonitis postoperatively due to a small colonic injury. A secondary procedure was performed after the patient had an uneventful recovery. At 3 months, significant improvement (clinical and radio-logic) was present in 93 % of cases in group 1 and 88. 2 % in group 2. At 1 year, all patients in group 2 showed satis-factory results. At a late follow-up visit, 1 patient in group 1 presented with a recurrent obstruction. Conclusions: Robotic pyeloplasty appear to be feasible and effective, showing a consistent success rate even in complex situations. Particular care should be observed during the colon dissection in patients with previous co-lonic pathology...|$|E
