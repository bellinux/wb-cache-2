5|$|After the {{graduation}} of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At {{the conclusion of}} spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Lane, {{running as}} a Democrat, {{was elected to the}} {{combined}} position of City and County Attorney, defeating California's sitting Attorney General, W. F. Fitzgerald, by 832votes in a year that otherwise saw most offices across the state <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republicans. He was re-elected in 1899 and 1901.|$|E

5|$|According {{to one of}} {{the many}} Greek legends about the Constantinople's <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend {{explained}} the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E
5|$|After dawn, Les accidentally wakes Maxwell, but {{sees that}} Kath is absent. The train brakes, waking everyone, and Hugo and the corpse <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. Maxwell guesses that Kath has stopped the train as Jorg stands, {{dropping}} his trousers. Maxwell next guesses that Kath has jumped {{in front of}} the train, and Les repeatedly hits him with a pillow as Jorg defecates into Kath's shoebox, which is held by Hugo. Shona sees that the train has hit a deer, and Kath re-enters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates tried to {{forestall}} the capital's <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Komnenoi by sending for Melissenos and {{asking him to}} enter the city and assume imperial authority. His envoys, however, were obstructed by George Palaiologos and never reached Melissenos. Constantinople fell to the Komnenian forces, and on 8 April 1081, Melissenos too entered the imperial capital. True to his word, Alexios I raised him to Caesar and gave him authority over Thessalonica, as well as allotting the city's revenues to his income. At the same time, however, Alexios raised his brother Isaac Komnenos to the newly created dignity of sebastokrator, which he placed above that of Caesar, bypassing Melissenos.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 million signing bonus, which caused Hammonds to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to his left and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E

5|$|In 1190, 150 local Jews {{were killed}} in a pogrom in the castle keep, most of them {{committed}} suicide in order not to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hands of the mob. Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone {{in the middle of the}} 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations.|$|E
5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E

Territory-holding adult grey jays experienced low mortality rates (15.1 and 18.2% for males and females, respectively). The oldest known grey jay recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, {{recurrent}} civil wars, {{attacks from}} Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and the devastation caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened {{the collapse of}} the Byzantine state, which would culminate in its final <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Turks in 1453. Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure the security and hence the independence of Constantinople itself from the interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts produced only short-term results.|$|E

Meegar's angst then apparently causes the elevator to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar.
