40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. E. E. thesis. August 2014. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Chris Kim. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 44 pages. The spin transfer torque based magnetic {{random access memory}} (STT-MRAM) is a promising candidate as a potential SRAM replacement with impressive characteristics like non-volatility, zero leakage power, scalability, density and CMOS process compatibility, however it suffers from very high write current density. With ongoing scaling in MTJ, storage element of STT-MRAM, its very thin dielectric is subjected to very high stress raising reliability concerns amongst designers. The reliability of STT-MRAM is worsened as only worst case - highest voltage stress is considered for reliability estimation though multi-voltage domain is used for read and writes operation forcing designers to use slower clocks and lower voltages to meet lifetime criteria. In this work, we present a methodology which estimates reliability of MTJ based on <b>device's</b> Time <b>Dependent</b> <b>Device</b> Breakdown (TDDB) measurements considering circuit design parameters and architectural access patterns as design inputs. This methodology enables designers to estimate time <b>dependent</b> <b>device</b> failure probability and performance tradeoffs for generic and application specific designs. The effective Weibull distribution is predicted considering the stress due to multiple voltage's contributing stresses. A L 2 cache reliability analysis is presented using Gem 5 simulator to generate access patterns. The developed model is easily upgradable with technology scaling and can be extended to any device with its measured TDDB data...|$|R

5000|$|The {{choice of}} {{reference}} electrode (liquid gate) or back-gate voltage determines the carrier concentration {{within the field}} effect transistor, and therefore its region of operation, therefore {{the response of the}} device can be optimised by tuning the gate voltage. If the transistor is operated in the subthreshold region then an exponential increase in current is expected for a unit change in surface potential. The response is often reported as the change in current on analyte binding divided by the initial current (...) , and this value is always maximal in the subthreshold region of operation due to this exponential amplification. For most devices, optimum signal-to-noise, defined as change in current divided by the baseline noise, (...) is also obtained when operating in the subthreshold region, however as the noise sources vary between devices, this is <b>device</b> <b>dependent.</b>|$|E
