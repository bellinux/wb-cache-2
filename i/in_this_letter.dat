5|$|Despite the {{drawings}} described <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> as showing drafts {{of the two}} new patterns, together with any royal response to the complaint which may have accompanied them, having been lost, (possibly in the 1834 Burning of Parliament), other evidence exists, at least on paper, of a Scottish variant whereby the Scottish cross appears uppermost. Whilst, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, this design is considered by most vexillologists to have been unofficial, {{there is reason to believe}} that such flags were employed during the 17th century for use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of The Present State of the Universe by John Beaumont, Junior, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.|$|E
5|$|The French column surrenderd on {{the promise}} that the {{officers}} would not be stripped, but they all remained as prisoners of war and surrendered their weapons and money to the Catalans. Juigné, with 136 other wounded soldiers and a German captain, remained in Olot to receive medical treatment, but he died shortly after. French losses amounted to 251 or 260 men killed–32 of them officers– and 826 prisoners, as opposed to 7 men killed and 5 wounded on the miquelets side. The figures are well known, as the French intendant of Girona, René Desgrigny, {{wrote a letter to}} Olot's aldermen asking for the number and rank of the prisoners to exchange them when possible. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>letter,</b> Desgrigny noted that Monsieur Juigné was lucky to be dead, as the defeat would probably have cost him dearly. The 690 unscathed French prisoners were brought first to Vic and later to Barcelona, where they arrived on 15 March. Their entrance was seen by a large crowd and the Spanish Viceroy, the Marquis of Gastañaga.|$|E

25|$|Though {{he was in}} England at {{the time}} of the Anti-Federalist Papers, Thomas Paine, whose {{pamphlet}} Common Sense served as motivation for independence from British rule during the American Revolution, also opposed the unitary executive. While this position was already evidenced from his role as Clerk to the Pennsylvania Assembly during the writing of Pennsylvania’s 1776 Constitution, he clearly stated it in a letter to George Washington in 1796. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>letter,</b> Paine argued for a plural executive on the grounds that a unitary executive would become head of a party and that a republic should not debase itself by obeying an individual.|$|E

The Taíno offensive frustrated the monarchy, who ordered Cerón and Díaz to rebuild a destroyed settlement at Añasco, from which they would carry out the mining of gold and resources from the Otoao. Ponce de León continued the offensive and its slaving effort, branding the captured ones in the forehead on behalf of the Crown before selling them.|$|E

In response to this letter, Bishop's lawyers offered to change her plea to guilty in exchange for the prosecution not seeking the death penalty. On receiving this offer, chief prosecutor Robert Broussard contacted and learned from the nine survivors that none of them wanted the death sentence for Bishop. On the basis of these opinions, Broussard decided not to seek the death penalty. Bishop changed her plea to guilty.|$|E
