40|$|Many field {{experiments}} {{require the}} collection of forage yields in addition to grain yield (small grains). ln smal! plot research, mechanized grain harvest is common. However, forage harvest is often accomplished by hand which is time consuming and labor intensive. Sample heterogeneity increases when forage harvest is obtained by hand. The objectives {{of this study were}} to construct a mechanized forage harvester that would simplify the harvesting process while providing a homogenous sample and to determine forage yield reduction associated with using the harvester compared to hand clipping at the soil surface. A John Deere GT 262 self propelled rotary mower was modified to be used for small plot wheat <b>forage</b> <b>harvesting.</b> <b>Field</b> trials were established at two locations to determine the yield reduction associated with using the forage harvester versus hand clipping at the soil surface. Significant differences in yield were found at both locations. The mean dry matter yield averaged over two years and two Iocations obtained using the harvester was 63. 1 % of that obtained by hand clipping at the soil surface during growth stages Feekes 6 and Feekes 10. Total N in wheat forage collected was significantly different using the harvester versus hand clipping. This is partially explained by decreased N in the lower stems at later stages of reproductive growth. The design of the harvester makes it possible to harvest several plots in {{a short amount of time}} while also allowing a larger area to be harvested which increases experimental accuracy and sample homogeneity. When the efficiency of the forage harvester (0. 631) is used as a correction factor, the difference between the estimated and actual amounts of forage present is S 4 o/" of the total forage present (Feekes 6 through Feekes 10) ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Large round {{bale silage}} (LRBS), {{fermented}} hay, baled at 45 - 65 % moisture content {{might be a}} better product than air-dried hay for farmers and ranchers in Southcentral Alaska. Variable weather and sometimes unfavorable conditions for drying hay to the required 18 % moisture content makes high quality hay production unpredictable. Our study was designed to determine what practices might produce the highest nutritional quality LRBS. Treatments included using black and white plastic bale wrap, two different baler compaction levels, and application of a buffered propionic acid preservative. The study used four different <b>forage</b> <b>fields</b> over a two year period. Three <b>fields</b> were <b>harvested</b> on each cutting date. We measured dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, acid detergent insoluble nitrogen, crude protein, and digestible energy. Fermentation analysis measured levels of lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids, ammonia and pH on LRBS. The denser bales, bales wrapped in black plastic, and those treated with preservative produced highest quality forage. Dense bales had lower DM, lower pH, and also had the highest lactic acid. Ammonia levels declined when moisture content decreased...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years North American {{grassland}} bird populations have declined {{more than any}} other bird guild. This trend is especially evident in Vermont, where species experiencing precipitous declines include the Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). These declines are linked to habitat loss due to reforestation and suburbanization as well as the intensification of grassland management. Modern grassland management includes earlier first-haying dates (late-May) and shorter intervals between haying events (35 days). These management practices have severe repercussions for songbird populations because 1) early-haying results in complete nest failure (99 % Savannah Sparrow and 100 % Bobolink nests), 2) the interval {{between the first and second}} haying is too short for birds to renest, and 3) intensively managed fields comprise a significant portion of the total available habitat (as much as 40 %). In 2002 - 2006, I examined how hayfield and pasture management affected grassland songbird ecological and evolutionary behavior in the agricultural landscape of the Champlain Valley, Vermont and New York. I studied songbirds in four grassland management types: early-hayed <b>fields</b> <b>harvested</b> in late-May or early-June and again in mid-July; middle-hayed <b>fields</b> <b>harvested</b> in late-June or early-July; late-hayed <b>fields</b> <b>harvested</b> after 1 August; rotationally-grazed pastures, a matrix of small paddocks where cows are moved after the grass in a paddock is eaten to a low point. I addressed the following objectives: 1. Determined the annual productivity, survival, and recruitment of Bobolinks and Savannah Sparrows in the four treatment types. 2. Identified the effects of early-haying on the social and genetic mating systems of Savannah Sparrows. 3. Conducted a population viability analysis for Bobolinks and Savannah Sparrows nesting in the Champlain Valley, assessing sensitivities of life-history parameters and identifying effective management alternatives. This study provides information on how agricultural management affects the ecology, evolution, and viability of grassland birds. It will help inform landowners, managers, and law-makers about management practices and habitat requirements needed to sustain populations...|$|R
