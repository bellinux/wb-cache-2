Fifteen diets formulated with 3 levels of protein (13, 14 and 15 %) and 5 levels of methionine (0. 25, 0. 28, 0. 31, 0. 34 and 0. 37 %) and fed to 420 birds in a 3 × 5 factorial arrangement. Each diet was randomly fed to 4 replicates of 7 birds each and fed for 3 periods of 4 weeks (50 - 62 wks of age) each. <b>Egg</b> number <b>and</b> mortality was recorded daily, whereas feed consumption determined {{at the end of}} each period. The increased in dietary protein significantly increased egg production from 54 to 59. 4 %. Egg weight, <b>egg</b> mass <b>and</b> feed intake increased by 1. 7 g, 3. 4 g, and 2. 8 g, respectively during the whole experimental period.

40|$|The {{cervical}} mucus penetration tests aid research {{and determine the}} clinical importance of positive sperm anti-body tests.

This study compares sperm migration in cervical mucus with that in artificial media including hyaluronate solution, <b>egg</b> white <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> Tyrode solu-tion. Results were quantified by measuring the migration distance (the maximum distance of capillary migration from a semen reservoir by spermatozoa after 1 h) and the sperm concentration at half the migration distance. The mean of both measures for cervical mucus and hyaluronate solution were equivalent [4. 4 ± 1. 1 (SD) versus 4. 3 ± 1. 0 cm and 118 ± 51 versus 111 ± 4 4 x 1 0 3 / m l], and higher than in <b>egg</b> white <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> Tyrode solution. Antisperm antibodies impaired sperm penetration in cervical mucus and hyaluronate solution {{in a similar manner}} (r = 0. 92). These results suggest that hyaluronate solution sufficiently resembles human cervical mucus in terms of penetrability that it may be used as a substitute for mucus in capillary tube tests of sperm function.

The birds were allocated in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments, six replicates and four animals per experimental unit. The experimental diets were formulated with corn and soybean meal and the treatments consisted of five levels of sodium (0. 12, 0. 17, 0. 22, 0. 27 and 0. 32 %) derived from common salt. The following parameters were evaluated: feed intake (g), egg production (%), egg weight (g), egg mass (g), feed conversion (kg) per kilogram of <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> per dozen <b>eggs,</b> specific gravity (g/cm 3), shell thickness (mm), egg components including <b>egg</b> yolk (g <b>and</b> %), <b>albumin</b> (g <b>and</b> %) and shell (g and %), viability (%), and variation in body weight (g) of the birds. There was no effect (P> 0. 05) of sodium levels on egg yolk weight (g) or albumin percentage.

The criteria measured were: percentage production, egg weight, egg output, feed conversion ratio, shell thickness, shell weight, shell calcium <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> height. Daily <b>egg</b> production <b>and</b> biweekly <b>egg</b> weight, shell thickness, shell weight <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> height were recorded. Shell c 1 acium was measured {{at the end of the}} experiment's period. The results indicate that, 150 ppm vitamin C significantly (P < 0. 05) increased <b>egg</b> weight <b>and</b> shell calcium. <b>Albumin</b> height was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased at 300 ppm vitamin C supplementation. Cage density had no effects on shell weight, thickness <b>and</b> calcium, <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> height. <b>Egg</b> weight, <b>egg</b> production <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> output were reduced significantly (P < 0. 05) due to increased cage density. Feed conversion ratio was also increased significantly (P < 0. 05) as cage density was increased. Interactions between vitamin C and cage density on shell <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> weight were significant (P < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Macromolecular {{assemblies}} {{of proteins}} and hydrocolloids in low-fat dairy products {{contribute to the}} structure and texture of these foods. Immunolocalization techniques were used to identify B-lactoglobulin, casein, bovine whey proteins, <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> in low-fat frozen desserts, reduced fat process cheese, and salad dressings. SimpJesse 18 I 00 protein particles were examined and characterized by these methods and compared to naturally occurring protein structures in the low-fat foods. Hydrocolloid identification in low-fat salad dressing was accomplished by complexing cellulase and hemicellulase with colloidal gold and applying the probe as a pre-embedding step, on sections of embedded specimens or on material dried on grids. This enzyme-gold method may be generally applied for identification of cellulose and hemicellulose in complex food systems. Immunolocalization techniques employed in this study should prove useful in probing the fundamental structure-texture relationship in foods...|$|R
