Newmeyer, in which Alfalfa (played by Carl Switzer), sings the song in a whiny, strained voice after a [...] "woodsman, spare that tree" [...] dialogue with Spanky (George McFarland). Film critic Leonard Maltin has called this [...] "the poem's all-time worst rendition". [...] In his album Caught in the Act, Victor Borge, when playing requests, responds {{to a member of}} the audience: [...] "Sorry I don't know that 'Doggie in the Window'. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> that comes pretty close to it" [...] and proceeds to play the Rasbach setting of [...] "Trees".|$|E

2500|$|Later, as {{it became}} clear that Peniston was leaping from the Overweight Pooch's album {{to the top of the}} charts, rumor had it the Pooch was stewing over Peniston's using Female Preacher as her springboard. Tonya Davis, {{pregnant}} at the time of recording her album, swore she harbored no jealousy towards Peniston. [...] "There's no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn't give her a voice," [...] the rapper insisted for Phoenix New Times in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. [...] "I feel like anything's possible and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> thing. If I wasn't at this spot, I still would be achieving to get to this spot." [...] Ironically enough, Sallard eventually threw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, [...] "You Win, I Win, We Lose", while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album Sugar Time scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the US Dance chart, including the No. 1 single [...] "Gotta Know (Your Name)") mentioned the Pooch's name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying [...] "thanks for letting me be a part of Female Preacher".|$|E
