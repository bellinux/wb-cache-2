The GAIA <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> service aims at demonstrating the applicability of the GAIA functional architecture for information brokerage in the area of <b>technical</b> <b>data,</b> with respect to the use of relevant standards. The GAIA <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> brokerage service addressed the requirements of designers in industry, who require information regarding the specifications of technical components, as part of the design task.

5000|$|Accordingly, it is {{important}} to understand your requirement and whether or not the acquisition or the deliverables fit into these categories because it drives acquisition planning and required clauses and provisions that must be inserted into the solicitation. It is normal for MULTIPLE contract clauses and provisions to be inserted into the contract solicitation for the acquisition of a SINGLE CATEGORY of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> (for example, DFARS 7013, Non-Commercial <b>Technical</b> <b>Data,</b> and 7017 clauses). However, it {{is important}} to note that if multiple categories of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> (or even FAR data) is to be acquired, multiple categories of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> clauses must be inserted and each contract line item number (CLIN) must be specifically drafted to cover each separate CATEGORY of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> (e.g., commercial AND separately non-commercial software) ...|$|R

Because a weapon system may remain in the defense inventory for decades following initial acquisition, <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> decisions made during acquisition can have far-reaching implications over its life cycle. In August 2004, GAO recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) consider requiring program offices to develop acquisition strategies that provide for future delivery of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> should the need arise to select an alternative source for logistics support or to offer the work out for competition. For this review, GAO (1) evaluated how sustainment plans for Army and Air Force weapon systems had been affected by <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> rights and (2) examined requirements for obtaining <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> rights under current DOD acquisition policies. ...|$|R

Phase 1 examines aviation industry procedures for developing maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data.</b> Phase 2 will document user problems with maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data.</b> Phase 3 will identify maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> development improvements by applying human factors principles. Five aircraft manufacturers were surveyed regarding company policy, communication, data tracking, user feedback, and error reduction efforts. The five industry participants represent both regional and large commercial transport manufacturers. Phase 1 survey results revealed three significant maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> issues: inconsistent development process guidelines, reactive rather than proactive response to user feedback, and inadequate assessment of errors involving usability as opposed to accuracy. Phase 1 results will later be compared to Phase 2 surveys of user problems with maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> to identify the impact of development procedures on the users perception of manual quality...|$|R
