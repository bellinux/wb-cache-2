50|$|In 1962, the Centre Electronique Horloger (CEH) was {{established}} in Neuchâtel to develop a Swiss-made quartz wristwatch, while simultaneously in Japan, Seiko was also working on an <b>electric</b> <b>watch</b> and developing quartz technology.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{batteries}} {{readily available}} to consumers range from tiny button cells used for <b>electric</b> <b>watches,</b> to the No. 6 cell used for signal circuits or other long duration applications. Secondary cells are made in very large sizes; very large batteries can power a submarine or stabilize an electrical grid and help level out peak loads.|$|R
5000|$|A {{weak point}} in early balance wheel <b>electric</b> <b>watches</b> was the switch {{contacts}} {{on the balance}} wheel, which turned the solenoid on briefly to provide the impulse to keep the wheel oscillating. These wore out and did not operate reliably. [...] Later designs used electromagnetic sensing, with a transistor in the circuit to turn the solenoid on.|$|R
50|$|He {{designed}} asymmetrical {{cases for}} the new Hamilton <b>electric</b> <b>watches</b> in the 1950s, including such notable models as the Ventura, Everest, and Pacer. He also designed watches for Tourneau, Benrus, Sheffield and Gucci. He designed boats for the Century Boat Company in the 1950s, notably {{one of their most}} successful and expensive models, the Coronado, as well as the Arabian model.|$|R
50|$|SSIH {{originated}} in 1930 with {{the merger of}} the Omega and Tissot companies. Swiss watch quality was high, but new technology, such as the Hamilton <b>Electric</b> <b>watch</b> introduced in 1957 and the Bulova Accutron tuning fork watch in 1961, presaged increasing technological competition.|$|E
5000|$|Moving coil system, contact controlled: {{refers to}} watches with a balance wheel with {{integrated}} coil, fixed magnets and mechanical contacts. [...] Examples {{of this technology}} are Hamilton 500 (first retail <b>electric</b> <b>watch</b> in 1957), Epperlein 100, Champion (Ruhla / UMF), Slava 114ChN and Timex M40.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, Hamilton {{introduced}} the world's first <b>electric</b> <b>watch,</b> the Hamilton Electric 500. It {{was available in}} a variety of non-traditional asymmetrical case styles including the Ventura that was designed by Richard Arbib. The watch was worn by Elvis Presley, who also featured it the movie Blue Hawaii.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{recycling}} of household batteries has {{attracted much attention}} mainly with respect to environmental aspects {{in addition to the}} savings. Small silver oxide primary cells used in <b>electric</b> <b>watches</b> become a waste after their life is over. Recycling procedures are needed to prevent any environmental impact from these wastes and to recover the value inherent in the scrap. Smelting and electrolytic methods are discussed for silver recovery from this battery waste.

5000|$|In 1962, Hamilton {{entered into}} a joint venture (60% owned by Hamilton) with the Japanese watchmaking firm Ricoh to produce <b>electric</b> <b>watches</b> meant {{primarily}} for the Japanese market. The electronic components were produced at Hamilton's Lancaster factory while production of the mechanical works and final assembly was undertaken in Japan. Although production levels of Hamilton-Ricoh watches was high (over 1000 per month), demand was low and consequently, the Hamilton-Ricoh partnership was unable {{to compete with the}} substantial market presence of Seiko. The partnership was dissolved in 1965, with the remaining Hamilton-Ricoh electronic movements (marked [...] "Ricoh 555E") re-cased as [...] "Vantage" [...] and sold in the U.S.|$|R

5000|$|In {{horology}} {{the term}} <b>electric</b> <b>watch</b> {{is used for}} the first generation electrically-powered wristwatches which were first publicly displayed by both Elgin National Watch Company and LIP on the 19th of March 1952 with working laboratory examples in Chicago and Paris. Hamilton {{would be the first to}} produce and retail an <b>electric</b> <b>watch</b> beginning in 1957, before the commercial introduction of the quartz wristwatch in 1969 by Seiko with the Astron. Their timekeeping element was either a traditional balance wheel or a tuning fork, driven electromagnetically by a solenoid powered by a battery. [...] The hands were driven mechanically through a wheel train. They were superseded by quartz watches, which had greater accuracy and durability due to their lower parts count. Recent automatic quartz watches, which combine mechanical technology with quartz timekeeping, are not included in this classification.|$|E
50|$|On 1 February 1959, Timex (at the time, still US Time Corporation) {{the firm}} Lacher & Co. AG, Pforzheim, Germany (the Laco brand) {{to acquire the}} <b>electric</b> <b>watch</b> {{technology}} developed by Laco. Timex also purchased the DUROWE (Deutsche Uhrenrohwerke) brand. On 1 September 1965, Timex sold Durowe to the Swiss movement manufacturer ETA SA.|$|E
25|$|Found in {{applications}} {{as diverse}} as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives, electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as from the power grid, inverters or generators. Small motors {{may be found in}} <b>electric</b> <b>watches.</b> General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of polypropylene in the 1950s and miniature batteries by Eveready {{allowed for the}} use of small plastic battery holders. These are still common in toys, decorations, and lighted or blinking items. In 1957, <b>electric</b> wrist <b>watches</b> gained popularity with the public.|$|R

Due to its specific geographic constraints and other factors, (and especially in order to encourage visitors to leave their vehicles outside the park boundaries) it is hoped that <b>electric</b> 'game <b>watching</b> vehicles' (<b>electric</b> public transport) for visitors can be introduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{discharge}} characteristic {{and performance}} of the Li/Ag 2 WO 4 and Li/Ag 2 MoO 4 couples in LiAsF 6 -v-butyrolactone are reported in terms of dis-charge mechanism, polarization, and cathode efficiency. In both cases the dis-charge process seems to be characterized by two distinct plateaus. Attention has been mainly focused on the first plateau of the two systems and by means of x-ray and coulometric analyses it has been possible to relate to these pla-teaus the electrochemical processes consisting {{of the formation of}} silver and l i thium tungstate, and silver and l ithium molybdate, respectively. Lithium organic solvent batteries are of considerable technological interest since, due to their high specific energy density, they may find important applications as power sources in miniaturized electronic devices such as <b>electric</b> <b>watches,</b> hear ing aids, and pacemakers. In recent years several materials have been investi...|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} {{perimeter}} protection {{still in use}} is razor wire fencing. While U.S. ranchers in the 19th century kept the cattle in and the rustlers out with barbed wire, World War I saw the advent of specialized barbed wire to secure military operations. The 1965 escalation of the Vietnam conflict was accelerated by the successful penetration of ten foot high concertina wire (razor wire) fencing around Camp Holloway. Variations {{of this type of}} perimeter protection were used prolifically throughout the 20th century. Booby traps, <b>electric</b> fencing, <b>watch</b> towers and night flares were also vigorously employed to keep enemy forces out.|$|R

5000|$|Sheila O'Malley of Slant Magazine {{praised the}} movie {{as well as}} Hedyeh Tehrani's performance: [...] " [...] Hedyeh Tehrani, a delectable actress, plays Mozhde, the {{depressed}} wife. This is a marvelous performance, layered, painful, heartfelt. It's a difficult part... Tehrani has one of those malleable expressive faces so beloved by cameras everywhere. She thinks something, and it shows. She feels something, and we get it. The scenes of the fights with her husband are <b>electric,</b> exhilarating to <b>watch.</b> They feel like real arguments and have a jagged chaos to them that is truly frightening." ...|$|R
5000|$|In May 1905, a {{confrontation}} at Watts Station prompted a remarkable ethnic commentary by the Times.

40|$|Often ignored, for unseen, {{permanent}} magnets are increasingly becoming valuable components for electronical and electrotechnical devices, {{used in a}} large scale for loud-speakers, doors latches, low power motors, [...] ., as well as in measuring systems, separators, microwaves devices. The total number of unit magnets produced per year in a large plant amounts to several hundreds of millions, since the small magnet weighing 4 mg in a high quality material as Cobalt-Rare Earth and used in <b>electric</b> <b>watches,</b> till the big 40 kg magnet, directly cast in Ticonal 600, for the stator of an electric generator. The same 107 factor in the weight {{can be found in the}} coercivities of ferromagnetic materials, going from 10 - 2 Oe for very soft materials to 105 Oe for very hard materials. This review deals with the various hard materials now in production, illustrated by a few new laboratory results. If the old theory of pinned Bloch walls, initially developed for magnet steels, comes back again for cobalt-rare earths alloys substituted with copper and iron, the origin of the properties of most modern hard materials is interpreted in terms of single domain fine — particle theory : in one case, magnetization reversal is governed, either by a shape anisotropy (Ticonals, powder magnets) or a crystal anisotropy (platinum-cobalt alloy, hard ferrites) — in the other case, it is governed by nucleation of reversed domains or unpinning of Bloch walls (sintered cobalt-rare earths magnets). The study of first magnetization curves, as well as intrinsic curves or recoil curves, is very useful to distinguish between various mechanisms of coercivity, and is illustrated here by new results obtained on high coercivity materials, as Ticonal 2000 ((BHmax) = 6. 5 × 106 G. Oe), Sermalloy P, Plasto-Ferrite magnets Ferriflex 10 very well oriented ((BH) max = 2. 0 x 106 G. Oe) and Cobalt-Rare Earth Coramag. Although an increase in coercivity is usually followed by a decrease in remanence, this does not appear in intermetallic compounds based on transition and rare earth metals, thus allowing very high specific energies. Synthesis, mechanical and magnetic shaping, thermal properties of these compounds are showed and discussed...|$|R

50|$|The mercury oxide-zinc {{battery system}} was known more than 100 {{years ago but}} did not become widely used until 1942, when Samuel Ruben {{developed}} a balanced mercury cell which was useful for military applications such as metal detectors, munitions, and walkie-talkies. The battery system had the advantages of long shelf life (to 10 years) and steady voltage output. After the Second World War the battery system was widely applied for small electronic devices such as cardiac pacemakers and hearing aids. Mercury oxide batteries were made {{in a range of}} sizes from miniature button cells used for hearing aids and <b>electric</b> wrist <b>watches,</b> cylindrical types used for portable electronic apparatus, rectangular batteries used for transistor radios, and large multicell packs used for industrial applications such as radio remote control for overhead crane systems. In the United States, mercury oxide batteries were manufactured by companies including P. R.

There were a dozen things which he ought to have said, which came flashing from his brain to find themselves somehow imprisoned behind his tightly locked lips. He said nothing. She passed slowly, almost unwillingly, down the hall. The maid wrapped her coat around her--still he stood like a statue.

30|$|Due {{to their}} high energy density, long cycle life, and {{environmental}} friendliness, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are widely utilized in {{portable electronic devices}} [1] (e.g., mobile phones and <b>watches),</b> <b>electric</b> vehicles [2, 3], and renewable energy storage [4 – 8]. Graphite is {{the most widely used}} anode materials in commercial LIBs, benefiting from its low working voltage, good conductivity, and low cost [9 – 11]. However, the characteristic structure of graphite leads to feasible generation of LiC 6, allowing only one lithium ion intercalation in every six carbon atoms which results in a low theoretical specific capacity of 372  mAh g−[*] 1, which is far away from the current business requirements [12].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the multiple {{benefits of the}} adoption of Solar Home Systems (SHS) and discusses the dissemination potential for sustainable rural livelihoods in developing countries. Based on a household survey conducted in rural Bangladesh, we first identify the impact of SHS on the reduction in energy costs and compare purchasing costs. We then examine household lifestyle changes following the adoption of SHS. Finally, we consider several price-reduction scenarios to examine the potential demand for SHS and to evaluate its future dissemination potential. The results of the analysis indicate that households with SHS successfully reduce their consumption of kerosene and dependency on rechargeable batteries, with the cost reductions accounting for some 20 - 30 % of monthly expenditures on SHS. Moreover, most households with SHS can enjoy its benefits, including <b>electric</b> lighting, <b>watching</b> television, and the ease of mobile phone recharging at home. Further, the price reduction can make possible potential demand in more than 60 % of households without SHS, while additional price reductions promote the purchase of even larger SHS packages. This study concludes {{that even though the}} scale of single SHS is small, the micro-benefits for each household and the dissemination potential are substantial.

In those days, when there was no cable, it was not easy for foreign observers to appreciate what was really going on; they could not see clearly the true state of affairs, as {{in the last year of}} the nineteenth century we have been able, by our new <b>electric</b> vision, to <b>watch</b> every event at the antipodes and observe its effect. The Rebel emissaries, sent over to solicit intervention, spared no pains to impress upon the minds of public and private men and upon the press their own views of the character of the contest.

5000|$|As {{evidence}} supporting U.S. and British claims about Iraqi WMDs weakened, the Bush Administration {{began to focus}} more upon the other issues that Congress had articulated within the Iraq Resolution such as human rights violations of the Hussein government as justification for military intervention. [...] That the Hussein government consistently and violently violated {{the human rights of}} its people is in little doubt. During his more than twenty-year rule, Hussein killed and tortured thousands of Iraqi citizens, including gassing and killing thousands of Kurds in northern Iraq during the mid-1980s, brutally repressing Shia and Kurdish uprisings following the 1991 Gulf War, and a fifteen-year campaign of repression and displacement of the Marsh Arabs in Southern Iraq.

40|$|Abstract — It is a {{well known}} fact that women’s {{empowerment}} is the key for the world development. Now a day’s women’s are facing more troubles physically in countries like India. The main reason {{for this type of}} troubles is the lack of safety for women from the government. But can’t provide safety to every woman. It can only provide some safety measures. It is the duty of every woman to prevent them. But they are not physically stronger than men. Hence additional equipments are needed for the women to protect themselves. The main aim of our project is to design an <b>electric</b> shock antenna <b>watch</b> in which ordinary watch is fitted with antenna on its side which is actuated by small push button. The end of the antenna will be given electric shock so that when they are in danger, they can use its help. At the same time, the sms informer is connected to the button so that when the antenna is actuated, the sms will be sent automatically to the nearest police station so that they can reach the spot quickly. To prevent the miscellaneous activities, these watches should be distributed under government license...|$|R
50|$|Some {{research}} suggests that people are more {{able and willing to}} empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). Paul Bloom an anti-empathy crusader claims emotional engagement of empathy leads to racism and prejudice. In 2010, team led by Grit Hein and Tania Singer gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported. Each participant received a mild <b>electric</b> shock, then <b>watched</b> another go through the same pain. When the wristbands matched, both brains flared: with pain, and empathic pain. If they supported opposing teams, the observer was found to have little empathy. Bloom calls improper use of empathy and social intelligence as a tool can lead to shortsighted actions and parochialism, he further defies conventional supportive research findings as gremlins from biased standards. He ascertains empathy as an exhaustive process that limits us in morality and if low empathy makes for bad people, bundled up in that unsavoury group would be many who have Asperger’s or autism and reveals his own brother is severely autistic.|$|R
