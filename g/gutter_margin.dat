5|$|A third {{issue was}} made up of seven labels and issued in decimal {{currency}} in the following values: 1p, 1p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 7p and 8p. In the fourth issue the 3p, 4p and 5p values were reissued in non-watermarked paper on 20 March 1978. A new design, printed by photogravure, and appeared on 20 June 1980 in ten values: 1p, 2p, 4p, 6p, 8p, 18p, 20p, 24p, 30p and 50p made up the fifth issue. The sheet format was two panes of 100 divided by a <b>gutter</b> <b>margin.</b> The sixth issue consisted of ten newly designed labels by Q Design and lithographically printed by ISSP on non-watermarked paper on 6 October 1988. The values were: 1p, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 17p, 20p, 24p, 30p, 50p and £1. No Euro currency postage dues have been produced.|$|E

30|$|Technical {{analysis}} {{of the book of}} hours was undertaken in conjunction with a conservation project to examine and consolidate flaking and powdery media in preparation for digitization of the entire manuscript prior to its exhibition. A team of six conservators at the Weissman Preservation Center, Harvard Library, performed the conservation work over 18  months. All 248 leaves of the manuscript were closely examined under various lighting conditions (transmitted, raking) and using a stereomicroscope. Both volumes were treated following the Weissman Consolidation Protocol [7]. Because of the high artistic and research value of this book of hours, detailed notes on each leaf were recorded in a spreadsheet. The goal was to tabulate visual observations that could potentially identify the original sequence of the manuscript, such as earlier binding and collation evidence, possible locations of missing leaves, and artist attributions. In addition, compiling notes as part of the treatment procedure improved the visual acuity of the conservators and provided a platform to share information among the team. The spreadsheet recorded areas of pigment transfer related or unrelated to the pigments on the facing leaf; evidence of page trimming that removed or bisected graphite foliation numbers; unused sewing holes; pink and green stains and associated fibers in the <b>gutter</b> <b>margins,</b> indicating removal of “silk curtains”, small squares of fine fabric sewn or adhered to manuscript leaves (a medieval practice to protect miniatures from rubbing).|$|R
5000|$|In page layout, {{illustration}} and sculpture, {{white space}} {{is often referred}} to as negative space. It is the portion of a page left unmarked: <b>margins,</b> <b>gutters,</b> and space between columns, lines of type, graphics, figures, or objects drawn or depicted. The term arises from graphic design practice, where printing processes generally use white paper. White space should not be considered merely [...] "blank" [...] space — it is an important element of design which enables the objects in it to exist at all; the balance between positive (or non-white) and the use of negative spaces is key to aesthetic composition. Inexpert use of white space, however, can make a page appear incomplete.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, Matt Roberts, {{chief of}} the {{circulation}} department of the Washington University library, first documented the drawbacks of oversewn bindings. [...] It is especially threatening to books with acidic paper; the tight sewing in the <b>gutter</b> <b>margin</b> may cause shards of this paper, in its weakened, embrittled state, to tear and flake off. Oversewn bindings are also often very tightly bound, so {{it is difficult for}} books' spines to open fully and lie flat. From a conservation standpoint, a primary concern about oversewing is that it is essentially irreversible. In order for an oversewn text block to be re-bound again, more of the inside margin has to be cut or ground off. Some librarians believe that it is a hasty practice which favors cost over artifactual value, as original bindings may potentially be restorable.|$|E

5000|$|Oversewn {{bindings}} are {{a type of}} bookbinding {{produced by}} sewing together loose leaves of paper to form a text block. Threads pass through small holes that have been punched in the signature's <b>gutter</b> <b>margin</b> (nearest the spine), forming overlock stitches that attach it to previously attached sections. [...] This method of stitching is sometimes called stab sewing. A piece of linen is then glued to the text block spine for further support. The book's spine may be rounded and backed {{to keep it from}} caving in, but if the text block is too thick, the spine is sometimes left flat. A strip of cloth called a super is then often affixed to the spine of the text block and then to the boards of the case. Oversewing can be done by hand but is usually done with a machine in a bindery.|$|E
