30|$|We {{have also}} had {{occasion}} to examine extension agreements that support sectoral bargaining by making it less risky for employers to sign such agreements. Whatever the usefulness of extensions in this regard, our discussion {{has suggested that the}} cost of automatic extension may be severe. Allowing <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty</b> to opt out and exempting the long-term unemployed would be obvious temporary palliatives. Carefully refining thresholds to ensure that the bargaining parties represent a majority of employers and employees in the industry would be a more thorough-going means of reducing the costs of these ordinances. One nagging issue that remains, however, is the role of ordinances in stimulating the informal sector.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{work has}} shown that the success of an economy depends largely on how successful it is in allocating inputs and outputs across businesses efficiently with minimum disruption and frictions. Market institutions that impact this allocation potentially account for productivity differences across countries. Existing studies use quite broad measures of institutions, mostly at the country level and/or using survey data with questionable representativeness. This paper is the first to use census micro level data on a market institution with a potentially very distortive effect, namely state aid for the rescue and restructuring of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Such aid can postpone the exit of unprofitable firms and thus shift the burden of structural adjustment onto more efficient firms who are managing without it. We investigate the impact of this aid on static and dynamic efficiency of Slovenian manufacturin...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{valuation}} {{has become}} an inherent part of business environment which has experienced dynamic changes in economic activity through mergers and acquisitions, organizational restructuring and repurchasing of shares. The dynamic centre of all these activities is valuation, whose methods are needed not only for accounting purposes, but to serve as information support to all stakeholders. Although there are many individual techniques of assessment businesses in difficulty, selecting the most suitable method of valuation is often difficult. The paper is a mini-guide that {{should be taken into}} account by all actors involved in the assessment of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty</b> when they pursue to carry out such activities. In this regard, we compare the financial and accounting aspects with the national regulation on insolvency, highlighting the usefulness or, where appropriate, the lack of consistency based on assessments completed to date.

The analysis includes companies from Germany, Canada, Spain, France, Italy, UK and USA, which cover {{a wide spectrum of}} different institutional environments. The methodology used is panel data estimation using the Generalized Method of Moments (System-GMM), thereby allowing control of both unobservable heterogeneity and the problems of endogeneity in explanatory variables. The results show that the influence of financial distress on investment is different according to the investment opportunities available to companies. So, companies <b>in</b> <b>difficulties</b> with fewer opportunities have the greatest propensity to under-invest, while <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulties</b> with better opportunities do not present different investment behavior than healthy companies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{work has}} shown that the success of an economy depends largely on how successful it is in allocating inputs and outputs across businesses efficiently with minimum disruption and frictions. Reallocation of factors of production {{plays a major role in}} productivity growth and it is driven by technological and market forces, coupled with institutional factors. We examine the impact of institutions on allocative efficiency, job flows and wage structure, using longitudinal micro level databases. First, we estimate the impact of state aid for the rescue and restructuring of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty</b> on productivity and allocative efficiency. We use treatment effects estimators allowing for selection on unobservables and exploit variables that affect the chances of getting aid before 2002, but not after, to identify this impact. The empirical analysis indicates that state aid hindered the efficient allocation of resources and prolonged the life span of aid-receiving firms. Next, we assess the importance of technological factors that characterize different industries in explaining cross-country differences in job flows. We find that industry/technology and size factors explain a large fraction of the overall variability in job flows, but there remain significant differences in job flows that could reflect differences in business environment conditions. We use a difference-in-difference approach to examine the impact of regulations on worker hiring and firing. The empirical results suggest that stringent hiring and firing costs reduce job turnover and distort the patterns of industry/size flows. Finally, we study the structure of wages and the importance of firm and person fixed effects in explaining the variance of log real hourly wages in Slovenia, using a longitudinal matched employer-employee database. Most significant changes in employment and wage setting policies occurred in 1991, but incomes policies still suppressed the growth of managerial wages until 1997. We find that this change brought about a change in the wage structure, with an increase in returns to education for the most educated workers. Our results also indicate that person fixed effects account for an overwhelming majority of variation in log real hourly wages, whereas firm fixed effects are not nearly as important...|$|E

30|$|First, various schemes {{allowing}} {{older workers}} to withdraw earlier from {{the labor market}} coexist. The most important one, the collectively agreed (or “conventional”) early-retirement regime, entitles old workers who loose their jobs to UB with an additional allowance paid by the previous employer. The requirement is a minimum age of 58 with at least 25 years of career. People that benefit from this early retirement scheme are exempted from job search, and pension coverage is continued during that period. The employer has to replace the early retired {{for a period of}} at least three years, although exemptions to this obligation are awarded in 57 % of the cases (OECD 2003, p. 75). However, several exceptions to the age requirement exist. For instance, the age threshold can be set to 56 for night work and between 50 and 55 for <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>difficulties</b> or <b>in</b> restructuring. Specific eligibility conditions can also be defined at the sectoral level by collective agreements. There is also an “unofficial early retirement scheme.” As in the collectively agreed pre-retirement regime, the employer who lays off a worker under this scheme pays a supplement to UB. This scheme is however more flexible for the employer since there are no specific requirements to fulfill apart {{from the fact that the}} worker is at least 45 years old. The conditions of the early retirement (such as the minimal notice period, the amount and duration of the lump-side payment) are defined by a private agreement between the employer and the worker.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Banks are {{the major}} {{suppliers}} of external funds for companies in China. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine whether Chinese banks exercise effective monitoring over borrowers in two lending decisions, including loan interest rates and loan renewals. Design/methodology/approach – Using a sample of Chinese public industrial firms from 2000 to 2005, the authors perform multivariate regression analysis to investigate whether banks adjust their loan interest rates and consider loan renewal decisions in response to borrowers financial performance. The authors also examine these bank lending decisions before and after 2003, when the major banking reforms started to take place in China. Findings – A negative relation was found between the loan interest rate spread and the financial performance of borrowers. However, a negative relation was found between loan renewals and the financial performance of borrowers, consistent with <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>difficulties</b> being <b>in</b> need of more funding and hence more likely to get its bank loans renewed. Additionally, it was found that the factors banks consider when making loan decisions vary before and after 2003. Originality/value – The authors' findings suggest that Chinese banks play a limited role in monitoring and disciplining borrowers through adjustments of loan interest rates, and that their loan renewal decisions for firms with poor financial performance highlight banks' financing, instead of monitoring role in this transition economy. These findings provide empirical evidence on bank governance in a transition economy dominated by state-owned enterprises.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the current {{literature}} on corporate asset writedowns. Design/methodology/approach – The paper explains the anomalous price responses to asset writedowns by examining both stock and bond price responses. It applies bond and stock event study methodologies using daily prices. Firms are analyzed by partitioning them according to their financial viability. This analysis is based on the logic that it is more difficult to assess the prospects of <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>difficulty</b> from publicly available information. Findings – The study reveals that while asset writedowns have no information content for stockholders of healthy firms, stockholders of financial distressed firms suffer a significant adverse effect. This differential stock price reaction provides an explanation for the anomalous results reported in previous studies. Similar price responses are found for bondholders. The results indicate that the market interprets an asset writedown announcement by a financially distressed firm as a strong negative signal about the firm's prospects. It is also found that the firm's financial health, the subordination status of the bond, the bond's maturity, the bond rating, the amount of the write-off undertaken by a <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> distress, and the leverage change experienced by the firm are all important determinants to bond price response. Long-run analysis reveals significant differences in performance and leverage change between healthy and financially distressed firms undertaking asset writedowns. Practical implications – The paper resolves the anomalous results on information content of corporate asset writedown announcements on stockholders and bondholders. Broadly, the findings have important implications for both finance and accounting literatures in terms of semi-strong market efficiency and security market signaling issues and the importance of considering financial viability of firms when testing market efficiency in the presence of publicly available information. Originality/value – This is the first study to address this issue by examining the information content of asset writedown announcements for both stockholders and bondholders. Past studies document a significant negative stock price response to asset writedown announcements, while there is no bond price response to such official acknowledgment of asset impairment.

40|$|Frictions to {{efficient}} bargaining {{provide an}} opportunity for a hedge fund to invest <b>in</b> distressed <b>firms,</b> facilitate reorganizations, and capture some of the rents from doing so. This paper considers a sample of 184 financially distressed firms for the period from 1998 to 2009, and finds that distressed investing has become an important avenue for activism by hedge funds. Distress-focused hedge funds utilize a „fulcrum ‟ investment strategy so as to maximize their influence on the reorganization process. Empirical evidence is consistent with the view that hedge funds capture some of the rents they create by reorganizing the distressed firms. First, distress-oriented hedge funds tend to target economically healthy <b>firms</b> <b>in</b> which contracting <b>difficulties</b> are likely to prevent efficient reorganization. Second, hedge funds ‟ presence as creditors leads to effective restructuring through both debt-equity swaps and pre-packaged filings. In addition, when hedge funds inject new equity capital into targeted firms, the duration of distress is significantly reduced. Both debt and equity investments by hedge funds are associated with significantly higher probabilities of successful restructuring.
