[...] For the years 1909 through 1912, the taxpayer filed tax returns under the 1909 Act, showing gross receipts from the sale of manufactured lumber and, in arriving at the amount of net income subject to tax under the 1909 Act, deducted an amount based on the $40-per-acre value, rather than the actual cost of about $20 per acre. [...] The Commissioner of Internal Revenue argued that the taxpayer should be able to deduct only an amount based on the taxpayer’s <b>historical</b> <b>cost</b> basis of $20, rather than the $40 fair market value at the time the 1909 Act became effective. (Essentially, if the taxpayer were allowed to use the $40 per acre value as its basis rather than the actual $20 <b>historical</b> <b>cost</b> basis, a portion of the taxpayer’s gain [...] the increase in value from 1903 to December 31, 1908 [...] would go untaxed.) ...|$|E

The capital and operating cost {{per unit of}} power were also cheaper with central stations. The cost of electricity fell dramatically in {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century due to the introduction of steam turbines and the improved load factor after the introduction of AC motors.
