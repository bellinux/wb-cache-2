50|$|Although {{prime ministers}} have {{answered}} questions in parliament for centuries, until the 1880s {{questions to the}} prime minister were treated the same as questions to other Ministers of the Crown: asked without notice, on <b>days</b> <b>when</b> ministers were <b>available</b> in whatever order MPs rose to ask them.

40|$|Studying {{farmland}} evaporative fraction (EF) {{plays an}} important role in interpreting the components of energy budget and evapotranspiration (ET). The present study examines the pattern of vineyard EF after monitoring energy components by eddy covariance for 2 years, and estimates the crop ET by EF in the arid desert region of Northwest China. Main results indicate that EF during daytime is nearly constant on sunny <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the <b>available</b> energy exceeds 200  W m- 2, but EF becomes relatively unsteady <b>when</b> the <b>available</b> energy is lower than 200  W m- 2. Furthermore, daytime average EF is relatively low in the early growth stage, nearly constant in the mid-later stage, and significantly reduced in the later stage; Moreover, mean EF in different periods of daytime is in good agreement with daytime average EF, mean EF during 10 : 00 - 15 : 00  h is relatively close to daytime average EF and mean EF during 14 : 00 - 15 : 00  h is approximately equal to daytime average EF. The estimated daytime ET from mean EF during 14 : 00 - 15 : 00  h is highly correlated to the measured ET by Bowen ratio-energy balance though the value is partially underestimated. This study demonstrated that daytime ET can be estimated from midday EF and the relationship can be used to guide irrigation practice in the arid region. ...|$|R

30|$|For many, {{holidays}} {{are far from}} being their main concern, since the priority of water availability is acutely felt. Roving water merchants and tankers of the ADE crisscross {{every corner of the}} districts to supply families with this valuable liquid. The inhabitants try to be patient and adapt to the situation. In a number of districts of the city, one sees groups of three or four, each carrying a jerry can or an empty can, begging for water. “It is hot and we need water for drinking, for household chores and to wash. And when we are deprived of water for 3  days, the situation becomes unbearable. We spend the whole day looking for water. <b>When</b> it is <b>available</b> in the taps, we fill everything from jerry cans to every barrel, and all possible containers and try to save it to the maximum; it “evaporates” very quickly. One can do nothing, it is summer”, deplores a mother of a family. “During the <b>days</b> <b>when</b> water is <b>available</b> in the taps, we try to do the utmost: such as the laundry which has accumulated for several days, baths for children and for us as well as other domestic tasks.

40|$|Co-occurrence of {{closely related}} species may be {{achieved}} in environments with fluctuating dynamics, where competitively inferior species can avoid competition through dispersal. Here we present an experiment in which we compared active dispersal abilities (time until first dispersal, number and gender of dispersive adults, and nematode densities at time of dispersal) in Litoditis marina, a common bacterivorous nematode species complex comprising four often co-occurring cryptic species, Pm I, II, III, and IV, {{as a function of}} salinity and food distribution. The experiment was conducted in microcosms consisting of an inoculation plate, connection tube, and dispersal plate. Results show species-specific dispersal abilities with Pm I dispersing almost one week later than Pm III. The number of dispersive adults at time of first dispersal was species-specific, with one dispersive female in Pm I and Pm III and a higher, gender-balanced, number in Pm II and Pm IV. Food distribution affected dispersal: in absence of food in the inoculation plate, all species dispersed after ca four <b>days.</b> <b>When</b> food was <b>available</b> Pm I dispersed later, {{and at the same time}} and densities irrespective of food conditions in the dispersal plate (food vs no food), suggesting density-dependent dispersal. Pm III dispersed faster and at a lower population density. Salinity affected dispersal, with slower dispersal at higher salinity. These results suggest that active dispersal in Litoditis marina is common, density-dependent, and with species, gender- and environment-specific dispersal abilities. These differences can lead to differential responses under suboptimal conditions and may help to explain temporar...|$|R
