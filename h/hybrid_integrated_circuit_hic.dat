5000|$|A <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit,</b> <b>HIC,</b> hybrid microcircuit, {{or simply}} hybrid is a {{miniaturized}} electronic circuit constructed of individual devices, such as semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors and diodes) and passive components (e.g. resistors, inductors, transformers, and capacitors), bonded to a substrate or {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). If the components are on Printed Wiring Board (PWB) then, according {{to the definition of}} MIL-PRF-38534, it is not considered hybrid. A PCB can be called PWB if does not contain embedded components. Hybrid circuits are often encapsulated in epoxy, as shown in the photo. A hybrid circuit serves as a component on a PCB {{in the same way as}} a monolithic integrated circuit; the difference between the two types of devices is in how they are constructed and manufactured. The advantage of hybrid circuits is that components which cannot be included in a monolithic IC can be used, e.g., capacitors of large value, wound components, crystals, inductors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays alumina ceramic {{substrates}} {{are widely}} used for high precision applications in electronic devices, such as <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> (<b>HIC).</b> Usually, the alumina ceramic substrates are shaped through tape casting method and sintered in continuous slab kilns. The sintering aids used to enhance densification during sintering give rise {{to the formation of}} an alumino-silicate liquid phase, which is of crucial importance in pressureless and low-temperature sintering (< 1600 °C) of alumina ceramics. The preferential migration of liquid phase to the surface of alumina substrates under the capillary action and its transformation into glassy phase during cooling affects the subsequent processing steps of HIC. A smoothening effect on surface with its enrichment in glassy phase is accompanied by a decrease of the surface toughness. On the other hand, the accumulated glassy phase onto the surface has a great effect on laser cutting. The high temperatures developed during laser cutting turn the superficial glassy phase into liquid again, while rapid solidification will occur after removing laser beam. The fast cooling of the liquid phase causes formation of extensive network of cracks on the surface of alumina substrate. Apparently, the presence of such faults degrades mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance of alumina substrates. Meanwhile, the recast layers and spatter deposits at the periphery of the hole has been observed...|$|R
