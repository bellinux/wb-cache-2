Stressing the importance of embodiment to <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> (without reifying an essential female body), I argue that bodies inhabit specific social, historical and discursive contexts which shape our corporeal experience and our opportunities for political contestation. Beginning with the assertion that we cannot think of agency without the body, I examine a historical instance of <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> in which women’s bodies were central to the articulation of political dissent, namely the British suffragette movement. In particular, I focus on the suffragette career of Mary Leigh and argue that it represents a <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> derived from corporeal performance. Through daring acts of protest which drew attention to the comportment and capacities of their bodies, suffragettes like Leigh contested the constitution of the political domain and the nature of citizenship...|$|E

Using gender both as category and process we see clear gendered patterns throughout the Irish crisis including patterns of gender inequality in gendered institutions and changes in the process of gendered agency. Reviewing the extent to which Irish political and public spheres, banking and budgetary processes are gendered raises questions about how this impacts on post crisis outcomes. The gendered lens draws attention to the risks inherent in hyper-masculine institutions and culture and questions whether greater gender balance might alter the risk oriented culture of Irish financial services. It also draws attention to the gendered nature of Irish austerity budgets which disproportionately impacted women, and low income women in particular. The crisis also impacted on <b>feminist</b> <b>agency.</b> Examining women's political agency {{in the context of the}} crisis we find examples of defensive agency that sought to protect women's interests from fiscal retrenchment. These exist alongside examples of offensive <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> that use the crisis as an opportunity to strengthen gender equality in the political and policy processes. We find the gender infrastructure negatively impacted but despite such damage, we find <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> remains crucial to realising gender equality in public and private decision-making and despite the crisis, hopeful signs of renewed <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> are present...|$|E

40|$|My goal in this {{dissertation}} is {{to articulate}} an Arendtian conception of <b>feminist</b> <b>agency,</b> that is, agency that aims at resistance from within oppressive situations. There {{is a tendency}} in feminist literature to depict women in the global south {{as if they are}} passive victims of their oppression, with no opportunities to resist. This tendency is replicated in feminist responses to transnational contract pregnancy, the practice in which people travel across national borders to hire a woman to gestate an embryo. I argue that the feminist literature on contract pregnancy is polarized and unable to resolve the problematic trend of ignoring women’s agency. On one side, some feminists argue that contract pregnancy can enhance women’s agency by challenging oppressive norms or by expanding women’s choices. On the other side, some feminists argue that contract pregnancy obstructs women’s agency by perpetuating oppressive norms and by inappropriately commodifying women’s reproductive labor. To depolarize the debate, I propose a conception of <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> that allows for women to exercise agency against aspects of their oppression. Drawing from Hannah Arendt, I contend that <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> is a relational enterprise by which the agent comes to know herself, and by which others come to know her. Moreover, <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> necessarily contains an element of resistance. The central feature <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> is drawn from Arendt’s conception of thinking, which refers to critical reflection that enables people to reject certain beliefs and commitments. I suggest a contract pregnant woman may be motivated to think by lived contradictions within her experience. In other words, the inability of dominantly held social beliefs to explain the woman’s experiences can prompt her to think. The rejection of oppressive social norms allows the contract pregnant woman to understand contract pregnancy in a new way, and can encourage individual acts of resistance to oppression. Thus, <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> is able to appreciate how women in oppressed circumstances may resist aspects of their oppression. In addition to using Arendt to resolve a problematic tendency in feminist theory, I also argue that feminist theory helps to open up Arendt’s work to new application, specifically with respect to reproductive justice...|$|E

These are important theoretical developments that have shaped recent scholarship on girls 2 ̆ 7 identities and cultures. In this paper, we seek {{to give them some}} further sociological grounding by thinking through their resonance for the specific debate about young women and what <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> consists of, or looks like today. What we wish to further flesh out is how more familiar, modernist ideas about girls 2 ̆ 7 agency have started to reach their limits not merely because of the post-structuralist turn, but because of the socio-cultural conditions of neoliberalism, post-feminism and post-girlpower. We unpack some recent shifts and complexities around three concepts: choice, empowerment and voice.

40|$|This study aims {{to bring}} forward the {{phenomenon}} of trans death, underscoring the challenges that trans women in İstanbul experience, endure and confront during the posthumous scenes of autopsy, funeral and burial. Departing from and developing the concept of trans necropolitics, I examine trans death in two explanatory layers. First, I endeavor to theorize the mortuary processes of death {{within the context of}} Turkey and construe the necropolitical structures that interrupt and demarcate the trans death in the margins of sociality. Second, I examine the ways trans community and trans/feminist activism react, build remembrances and protest against the hate murders and the administrative violence in respect to the afterlife of the Hande Kader and Werde. As the last discussion, I engage in diffractive analysis of the transgender image in terms of its temporal and spatial materiality in the postmortem activisms and performance art. Adhering to a multifaceted methodology, I share the narratives from the semi-structured indepth interviews that I conducted with seven research participants who identify trans women. My research questions travel between two premises throughout the research: 1) What kind of challenges, conflicts and contingencies occur in the event of trans death and the afterlife? 2.) In what circumstances and solidarities can or cannot trans women in İstanbul procure recognition for their funerals and establish remembrances for their loss? The posthumous trans activism in İstanbul not only engenders the juxtapositions of different <b>feminist</b> <b>agencies</b> in the protests as a necrospace but also various segments of the society converge in an effort to construct a proper remembrance. Expounding these vulnerabilities and juxtapositions within the limits of cultural analysis, I also take notice of the entangled nature of gender, labor, and class...|$|R

The article looks at three key fields of gender equality public intervention and scholarly research: gender mainstreaming, electoral gender quotas and policies against gender-based violence. Our results align with the conditional approach of the gender and federalism scholarship. While competition has stimulated policy diffusion across regions and <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> has frequently benefited from the multilevel opportunity structure, the lack of well-established intergovernmental mechanisms has brought about negative side-effects like ‘patchwork’ policies that fail to guarantee equal rights for all Spanish women.

Rather than gesture to their poetry in a strategy of recuperation I contend that their powerful narratives compel us to reevaluate the parameters of contemporary feminist historiography and discourses of nationalism in South Asia. The poems of Fahmida Riaz and Kishwar Naheed are informed by a different set of paradigms about self and community (Islam) {{and at the same time}} reflect an archive (poetry) as crucial to feminist critiques of nationalism.

40|$|The acute {{sensitivity}} of feminism to violence, in its many different forms and contexts, {{makes it a}} particularly interesting case for {{the examination of the}} relationship between politics and violence in theory and practice. Our purpose in this paper is not to adjudicate the normative question of whether feminism implies a commitment to pacifism or to the use of non-violence. Rather, we are interested in examining how the relation between feminist politics and violence is construed as feminists struggle to develop a politics in which opposition to patriarchal violence is central. We begin with the feminist critique of violence, and move to examine how particular articulations of that critique shape and are shaped by practices of <b>feminist</b> political <b>agency</b> in specific contestation over the goals and strategies of feminism. We use the well-known case of feminist debates over the Greenham Common Peace Camp in the UK in the 1980 s to demonstrate how negotiating women's political agency in relation to opposition to male violence poses problems, both for feminists who embrace non-violence and prioritize the opposition to war, and for feminists who are suspicious of non-violence and of the association of feminism with peace activism. In both cases, the debates over Greenham demonstrate the fundamentally political character {{of the ways in which}} the relation and distinction between violence and politics are conceptually and practically negotiated...|$|R

A post-modern pastiche that plays between reality and fantasy, the artist uses herself as subject and her body as object to represent the multiple personalities existing in one queer changing body.

40|$|Book synopsis: This {{collection}} aims {{to think}} critically about agency and explore the relationship between agency and coercion in greater depth. In academic, activist, and policy circles alike, feminist work has re-focused attention onto women as agents rather than as passive victims of overwhelming structures of male institutional power, or less capable of exercising agency {{by virtue of their}} class, race, gender or culture. These broadly positive moves are not without risks. Most notably, they can encourage a triumphalist disregard for constraints through an exclusive emphasis on 'discovering' agency even in the least favourable situations, thereby obscuring domination, inequality, and subordination. So how does bringing agency and coercion into closer interplay impact our understanding of the two? How might the stories of <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> change if we locate agency and coercion on the same intellectual frame? What would it mean to disrupt the existing constellation of ideas accompanying agency so as to include coercion, subordination and oppression alongside ideas of freedom, autonomy, and independence?

40|$|The {{transmission}} {{and interpretation of}} information generated from full-body scanners is increasingly becoming a site of contestation in airport security queues all over the world. Body scanning technology raises questions surrounding the rights of governments to images of human bodies, acts of surveillance {{and to what extent}} technologies such as full-body scanners are helping to make us more 'secure' - or are disadvantaging particular groups of bodies. We examine the use of full-body scanners and their consequences from a feminist perspective, demonstrating how the scanners constitute both a 'gendered technology' and a 'gendered practice'. In addition we present a typology outlining several forms of feminist resistance that have manifested in reaction to the use of this technology. While these acts do not necessarily pose an overt challenge to the larger airport security structure, as they occur within rigidly defined boundaries, they do offer the space for individuals to exercise some autonomy and control over their bodies. By engaging with feminist security scholarship as well as theoretical approaches concerned with reclaiming the 'everyday' as a space for <b>feminist</b> <b>agency,</b> we begin to unravel the complicated web of full-body scanning technology...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} materialist feminist {{theories}} to rethink relationships between girls' bodies and <b>agency.</b> New <b>feminist</b> onto-epistemologies redefine <b>agency</b> as ‘becomings’ that dynamically emerge through assemblages comprising moving bodies, material, mechanical, organic, virtual, affective and less-than-conscious elements. Vignettes from a multi-modal, ethnographic study conducted {{over three years}} are used to demonstrate how place influenced young teen girls' body-movement repertoires. The place was a former coal-mining locale with a proud tradition of masculine, working-class labour. The vignettes focus on corporeality and demonstrate wide variations and fluctuations in girls' experiences of agency, which we theorise through the Deleuzeo-Guatarrian concept of ‘becoming’. We discuss how material feminism(s) helps us to understand girls' becomings as emergent within assemblages that carry legacies of the past. Some girls experienced becomings that could not easily be spoken about yet which allowed them to imagine expansive futures while others felt unable to move on in life...|$|R

Drawing upon qualitative research conducted with owners of these agencies, the text looks into the ways how the child care is constructed. The analysis consists of two parts. In the first one the agencies are understood as expert systems generating specific trust. In the second part, the issues of qualified, specialized, and professionalized care are discussed.

40|$|In this paper, I situate Canadian {{political}} anarchist Anne Hansen’s writing {{within the}} genre of feminist memoir, and her activism within feminist history. On November 22 1982, the firebombing of three Red Hot Video stores in Vancouver’s Lower Mainland made national media headlines. The nascent feminist group the Wimmin’s Fire Brigade—of which Hansen was a part—claimed responsibility for the action, declaring it an act of “self-defense against hate propaganda. ” I suggest that the firebombing marks {{a turning point for}} Canadian feminist activism not simply because of the use of violence by women against the state and private capital, but because of the failure of the state to intervene on a new form of capitalism that commodifies violence against women. In demonstrating how the materiality of violence against women was undergoing a remarkable historical shift through the creation of and distribution of commercial representations of sexualized violence against women, I argue that feminists in early 1980 s Canada were facing unchartered political terrain. Despite the novelty of the firebombing, the only publication that examines this event thoroughly is Ann Hansen’s memoir. I suggest that Hansen’s memoir may be overlooked within feminist literary studies due to her theorization of women as active participants in oppositional violence and criminal sabotage. Through an examination of her personal writing, communiqués, and court statements, I examine her politicization via anarchist and feminist principles. I argue for the importance of disrupting what counts as <b>feminist</b> <b>agency</b> under particular historical conditions, and for the inclusion of narratives of women’s violence within our own stories of what counts as feminism...|$|E

The earlier issue addressed “the complex cultural mechanism which placed gender {{at the center of the}} nationalist discourse” in early twentieth‐century works by both male and female authors and questioned how the uncertainty of discourses on gender and nation “opens up space for creating subversive cultural imaginaries and challenging colonial discourses. ” This issue builds on and expands these critical investigations of gendered subjectivity, women’s writing, and creative endeavors, by engaging updated studies on contemporary women’s writings and films. The selected essays in this special issue examine how female writers and filmmakers today contribute in different ways to cultural transformations in a rapidly changing country in a globalizing world. Their works both embody and transcend <b>feminist</b> inquiries about <b>agency,</b> writerly authority, and gendered subjectivity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} young women participating in anarchist and environmental activism within the UK {{as a means of}} exploring the relationship between youth, gender, and political participation in a postfeminist, neoliberal context. Recent scholarship has identified young women as the ideal subjects of neoliberalism, where flexibility and reflexivity are prized and rewarded. Young women have been presented with new subject positions and forms of citizenship engagement but these are, for the most part, individualised and depoliticised. Concurrently theorists have warned of an impending crisis of democracy precipitated by youth political disengagement, while governments have condemned ‘incorrect’ or ‘disruptive’ forms of youth civic engagement. This thesis intervenes in these debates by exploring the significance of social movement participation for young women in contributing to their political agency and gendered subjectivity. The research utilised a qualitative feminist methodology, analysing data from 20 semi-structured interviews, three diaries completed by interview participants, and 200 hours of participant observation. The thesis finds little evidence that young activist women are individualised or disengaged. Instead, their participation in collective action and their identification as feminists contribute to my theorisation of them as ‘wilful women’, whose conscious, reflexive political engagement marks them apart from individualised neoliberal subjects. Through a relational, <b>feminist</b> political <b>agency</b> they are able to reframe femininity as active and compassionate rather than passive and compliant, and engage politically on this basis. The study also finds that the non-hierarchical organisational structures of activist organisations effectively contribute to the creation of anti-oppressive pedagogic strategies for confronting inequality within activist cultures. This thesis makes an original contribution by developing a set of theoretical concepts that enable an understanding of the means by which young activist women construct dissident, wilful gendered subjectivities that confront sexism and inequality both within their own activist communities and within society at large...|$|R
40|$|The thesis investigates {{a diverse}} range of feminist postmodern philosophy, {{distinguished}} by its varying rearticulation {{of the relationship between}} modernism and postmodernism and feminism’s own position vis-à-vis that debate. Drawing on postmodernism’s primary tenet that substantive, binary identity categories comprise discursive, performative constructs, feminist postmodernism theorises a range of strategies for their subversive re-performance. This is realised in the mobilisation of parodic, “failed” repetitions and identities embodied, for instance, by transsexual, transgender, and transvestite personae. Hence the reformulation of postmodern versions of agency, resistance, and choice. In the second instance, the thesis examines the combination of feminist postmodern philosophy with the narrative techniques of postmodernism and its sister genre, the fantastic mode. As a heterogeneous, open-ended, self-reflexive form, the “postmodern fantastic” challenges conventional realism and its correlative sovereign subject. The postmodern fantastic is redeployed by feminist practitioners, whose inscription of both textual and topographical re-performance, such as is manifest in the cyborg and the grotesque, represent the literary counterparts of <b>feminist</b> postmodern <b>agency.</b> The above provide critical contexts for a reading of four late-twentieth-century women writers, focusing in particular on their intervention in the modernism/postmodemism debate and their deployment of the feminist postmodern fantastic as a means of destabilising sexed, gendered, and sexual identity. The selected authors Hélène Cixous, Monique Wittig, Jeanette Winterson, and Angela Carter represent distinct and diverse, culturally specific, literary and feminist traditions, reformulating the relationship between modernism and postmodernism in different ways and with varying degrees of success. They coalesce, however, in their contribution to the feminist postmodern fantastic. It is the general purpose of the thesis to demonstrate how this particular mode embodies one of feminist postmodernism’s most powerful means of literary and ideological critiqu...|$|R
