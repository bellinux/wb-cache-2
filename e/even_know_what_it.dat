500|$|Thompson was {{critical}} of the judge's decision, telling the judge [...] "You {{did not see the}} game... You don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was you saw," [...] as well as accusing the Take-Two employee who demonstrated the game of avoiding the most violent parts. Blank Rome subsequently filed a motion to have Thompson's behavior declared [...] "contempt for the court". Judge Friedman then recused himself from ruling, and instead filed a complaint against Thompson with The Florida Bar, calling Thompson's behavior [...] "inappropriate {{by a member of the}} bar, unprofessional and contemptible".|$|E
500|$|Van der Sloot later {{retracted}} this confession in {{a prison}} cell interview with De Telegraaf, claiming {{that he had been}} coerced and [...] "tricked" [...] by police with a promise to be transferred to the Netherlands. He stated that at the time he signed the confession documents, he did not understand the content as it was in Spanish. He was quoted: [...] "In my blind panic, I signed everything, but didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> said." [...] Van der Sloot said that he was lured to Peru and framed by another gambler, named Elton Garcia, who he claimed was working undercover for the FBI. Van der Sloot's attorney Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro stated his intention to resign because the case [...] "created many problems" [...] for him. He had been threatened and harassed for taking the case, and Van der Sloot's family was unable to afford his legal expenses. However, Navarro stayed on to file a motion to void the confession on the grounds that his client was not properly represented during his interrogation. On 25 June, Superior Court Judge Wilder Casique Alvizuri rejected the motion, noting that Van der Sloot was represented by a state-appointed lawyer and provided a translator by the Dutch embassy. Navarro said that Van der Sloot was as [...] "depressed" [...] as anyone in prison would be.|$|E

The room shorted out, the sky opened up, and I was like, 'This {{is going to be}} good.'" [...] Pattinson has admitted; [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} play the part when I went in, and it was a good thing to find during the audition. I really wanted it after that, but I didn’t really <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. I hadn’t really read any of the books. And just from that, ‘I want this job.’ It was pretty much because of Kristen." [...] In early 2008, Pattinson spoke of a fan backlash against his casting, disclosing Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I stopped reading [...] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else.'" [...] He revealed to the Evening Standard that; [...] "The books have a huge following, and I’ve already got bags of letters from angry fans, telling me that I can’t possibly play Edward, because I’m Diggory.

40|$|Abstract: This paper distinguishes three {{conceptual}} {{problems that}} attend philosophical accounts of consciousness. The first concerns {{the problem of}} properly characterizing the nature of consciousness itself, {{the second is the}} problem of making intelligible the relation between consciousness and the physical, and the third is the problem of creating the intellectual space for a shift in philosophical framework that would enable us to deal adequately with the first two problems. It is claimed that physicalism, in both its reductive and non-reductive forms, fails to deal adequately with either the first or second problem. The diagnosis of this failure is connected to the fact that consciousness cannot be treated in its own terms while being simultaneously fitted into an object-based conceptual schema. In light of this, it is proposed that a Bradleian version of absolute idealism may provide a metaphysical and epistemological framework which would enable us to recognize the conceptual diversity required to treat conscious phenomena on their own terms without forcing us to abandon naturalism. Nobody has the slightest idea how anything material could be conscious. Nobody <b>even</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would be like to have the slightest idea about how anything material could be conscious. So much for the philosophy of consciousness.

40|$|Having {{worked in}} the field of child abuse for 30 years, I became acquainted with vicarious traumatization through first hand {{experience}} before I <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. It wasn’t until I entered Shirley Turcotte’s 2 -year certification program in the use of Focusing with PTSD that I learned the difference between vicarious traumatization and burnout. Burnout can occur to anyone working long term in an emotionally demanding job where there is inadequate support, where the workload is unmanageable, or where the person lacks the training required to do the job effectively (Baird & Jenkins, 2003). The likelihood of burnout is associated more closely with the work environment than with the presence of a trauma history on the part of either the client or the therapist (Jackson, 1999). The effects of burnout can include emotional exhaustion, de-personalization and reduced feelings of accom-plishment (Jackson, 1999). Burnout may be preventable on the organizational level, as lower levels are associated with factors such as adequate supervision, communication and positive feedback, as well as with manageable workload and adequate training. Vicarious tramatization, on the other hand, {{is the result of the}} cumulative effect of traumatic material, and is now viewed as an inevitable effect of working with trauma sur...|$|R

40|$|What is consciousness? The {{conference is}} about consciousness, {{one of the}} most {{fascinating}} but also most problematic phenomena studied by contemporary empirical science. While be attractive enough for philosophers to produce an endless stream of hot debates, empirical scientists have long hesitated or refused to consider consciousness a valid or fruitful scientific problem. Even worse, many people would be happy to see the workings of the human mind not being explained away, because it touches so fundamentally the way we see ourselves in the universe, shaking the hope for our own personal survival, which many see very much in terms of the continuity of their own consciousness. All that may end up in curiously sardonic definitions of consciousness, like “Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon; it is impossible to specify <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> does, or why it evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written about it ” (Sutherland 1989), or, even more cynical, “Nobody has the slightest idea how anything material could be conscious.
