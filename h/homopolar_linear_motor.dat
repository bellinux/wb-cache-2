50|$|High-acceleration linear motors are {{typically}} used {{in studies of}} hypervelocity collisions, as weapons, or as mass drivers for spacecraft propulsion. They are usually of the AC linear induction motor (LIM) design with an active three-phase winding {{on one side of}} the air-gap and a passive conductor plate on the other side. However, the direct current <b>homopolar</b> <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> railgun is another high acceleration linear motor design. The low-acceleration, high speed and high power motors are usually of the linear synchronous motor (LSM) design, with an active winding {{on one side of the}} air-gap and an array of alternate-pole magnets on the other side. These magnets can be permanent magnets or electromagnets. The Shanghai Transrapid motor is an LSM.|$|E

Two propulsion variants are considered:- the short stators of the <b>linear</b> <b>homopolar</b> <b>motors</b> are fixed with the tunnel tracks;- the stator of the motors is on board of the vehicles. The levitation, the guidance and the transfer of energy are independent. The authors investigate the possibilities to combine the propulsion with the levitation and the guidance.

Generally the Joule heat loss associated with copper lead is considered as the main loss in motors while the iron loss is ignored at a lower frequency operation, not only because it’s regarded as small enough but also it’s difficult to measure or calculate. This paper introduces an experimental method to measure the iron loss for <b>linear</b> <b>motors.</b> Two kinds of moving-magnet <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> have been tested, one is known as single coil and magnet <b>linear</b> <b>motor,</b> and the other as double coils and magnets <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> Dependence of iron loss on frequency and displacement are investigated.

As for the double coils and magnets <b>linear</b> <b>motor,</b> there is a 1. 3 power exponent relation between iron loss and frequency, and its iron loss percentage is only 15 % at 120 Hz compared with 68 % in the single-coil <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> Iron loss is proved to be significant in <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> especially at higher frequency...|$|R
50|$|Motors that {{directly}} produce linear motion are called <b>linear</b> <b>motors.</b> The advantage of <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> {{is that they}} can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrewsleadscrew, rack-and-pinion, cam, gears or belts, that would be necessary for rotary motors.

Direct drive, brushless DC <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> consist of a slotted stator with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and coil windings. To obtain <b>linear</b> motion, a <b>motor</b> controller excites the coil windings in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion.

30|$|When {{the pole}} number of a <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> is {{not less than}} six, the values of negative-sequence current and zero-sequence current are much small {{compared}} with the positive sequence current; thus their influence on the cascaded <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> can be ignored [5, 6]. In this case, the asymmetry of three-phase current will not be considered. With three-phase symmetrical current flowing into three-phase winding, <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> will produce a traveling magnetomotive force (MMF) wave in the air-gap between primary and secondary windings. Since the energy exchange in mechanic-electronics is achieved by the air-gap magnetic field of <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> [7], the time and space characteristics of the MMF wave directly affect the operating efficiency and energy consumption in <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> The motor can work efficiently with the waveform of the MMF close to a sinusoidal traveling wave [8].|$|R
