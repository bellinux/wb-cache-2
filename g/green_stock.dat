60|$|The {{proceedings}} of the evening were opened by Mr. Percy Noakes. After successfully urging on the gentlemen present the propriety of their mixing some brandy-and-water, he briefly stated {{the object of the}} meeting, and concluded by observing that the first step must be the selection of a chairman, necessarily possessing some arbitrary—he trusted not unconstitutional—powers, to whom the personal direction of the whole of the arrangements (subject to the approval of the committee) should be confided. A pale young gentleman, in a <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> and spectacles of the same, a member of the honourable society of the Inner Temple, immediately rose for the purpose of proposing Mr. Percy Noakes. He had known him long, and this he would say, that a more honourable, a more excellent, or a better-hearted fellow, never existed.—(Hear, hear!) The young gentleman, {{who was a member of}} a debating society, took this opportunity of entering into an examination of the state of the English law, from the days of William the Conqueror down to the present period; he briefly adverted to the code established by the ancient Druids; slightly glanced at the principles laid down by the Athenian law-givers; and concluded with a most glowing eulogium on pic-nics and constitutional rights.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{comprehensive}} data set comprising 13 countries, 22 industries and {{a period of}} 30 years we investigate the impact of internal and external knowledge pools of both green and other than green technologies on green patent activities. It {{turned out that the}} internal <b>green</b> knowledge <b>stock</b> is positively related to green patent activities with a considerably large marginal value. The country's <b>green</b> knowledge <b>stock</b> and the <b>green</b> knowledge <b>stock</b> of the same industry in other countries are also positively related with industries' green patent activities, although with a significantly lower marginal value.

40|$|Green {{supply chain}} {{management}} (GSCM) has emerged to address the rising recognition of environmental considerations in {{supply chain management}} since the 1990 s. Much has already been discussed {{about the use of}} green purchasing and ecodesign in the construction industry to achieve environmental benefits. However, {{it should be noted that}} the role of stock management, which is an integral part of supply chain management, to achieve GSCM should not be overlooked following a life cycle perspective. This paper therefore aims to identify the barriers in current stock management practices to achieving <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> management. Precast concrete is chosen as the research target owing to the large demand for public housing projects in Singapore. A weighted factor model comprising 17 precasters in Singapore is adopted. The results indicate that the most significant barriers in current stock management practices are large inventory, lack of sufficient care, inappropriate battens, inappropriate staffing arrangements and unclear identification marks. The analysis provides good practice guidance and can be used as a checklist for precasters to achieve <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> management. The results of this study will also be useful for regulatory agencies to provide recommendations for the precast concrete industry to reduce waste and achieve <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> management...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine how}} the ownership, analyst {{coverage}} and stock market valuation of U. S. firms vary with their environmental performance. Relative to environmentally neutral firms, both positive (“green”) and negative (“toxic”) environmental performers have {{a larger number of}} shareholders but lower institutional ownership. Socially responsible investing (SRI) may explain why institutions invest less in toxic stocks but not why they also invest less in <b>green</b> <b>stocks.</b> Institutions may shun <b>green</b> <b>stocks</b> due to a belief that corporate investment in positive environmental performance detracts from shareholder value. In contrast to institutions, individual investors are attracted to both <b>green</b> and toxic <b>stocks,</b> and analyst coverage is higher for toxic firms. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the stock market does not reward either greenness or toxicity; toxic firms, in particular, have significantly lower valuations than environmentally neutral firms. Our findings shed light on the inconsistent conclusions across recent studies of SRI performance by showing that the manner in which negative and positive SRI screens ar...|$|R

The present study assessed the genetic variation of three S. formosus stocks cultured in ponds using 39 polymorphic microsatellite primer combinations. The results showed the middle level of genetic diversity among all three stocks. The average values of observed Heterozygosity (Ho) expected Heterozygosity (He) for the red stocks are the highest which were 0. 509 and 0. 552, respectively. Genetic diversity of the <b>green</b> <b>stocks</b> was higher than the golden group. The inbreeding coeffcients within the subpopulation (Fis) and the differentiation index of population (Fst) analyses showed low genetic differentiation among three cultured stocks.

40|$|Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) {{is listed}} by CITES {{as a highly}} {{endangered}} fish species. The genetic diversity and population structure of three Asian arowana captive stocks was analyzed using microsatellites and AFLP markers on 32 randomly collected individuals from each stock. Six AFLP primer pairs amplified a total of 324 bands across the three sample sets. The <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> showed {{the highest percentage of}} polymorphic bands (15. 6 %) and expected heterozygosity (0. 26), followed by the red (13. 0 % and 0. 24), then the golden one (12. 7 % and 0. 22). Microsatellite analysis showed high allelic and gene diversity in all three varieties. The <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> showed higher allele number (100) and higher gene diversity (0. 75) than the red (98 and 0. 74) and golden ones (85 and 0. 71), respectively. The estimates of long-term effective population size by two different methods ranged from 4741 to 7288 and from 25, 056 to 64, 641, respectively. Tests of heterozygosity and allele frequency distribution indicate that a recent bottleneck in any of the three captive populations is highly unlikely. Altogether, the data suggest that the captive breeding program for conservation and sustainable use of the endangered Asian arowana will be successful. In addition, we found that the differentiation among populations was intermediate (FST= 0. 047, RST= 0. 103) and the genetic distance was the smallest between the green and red, whereas the largest between the red and golden varieties...|$|E

40|$|Sustainability ('green') {{stock market}} indices are {{intended}} {{to focus attention on}} environmental credentials, to reward superior performance and to help channel investments. Such indices often incorporate clean energy, waste, water and waste water treatment, recycling and other 'pure play enviro' companies. This paper contends that in keeping with the philosophy of Green Economics, which advocates an expansive view of humankind's interaction with the environment, true environmental performance ('greenness') is indexed by the eco-sensitivity of mainstream businesses, by the level of stakeholder involvement and by the extent of information readily made available to society. Effective enforcement of environmental regulation requires contributions from all stakeholders concerned. With voluntary participation from businesses not readily forthcoming, and given the price-sensitivity of consumers, investors, through the incentive structures they face, could contribute to better enforcement of regulatory standards. Broad-basing the green index could be interpreted as recognising and rewarding the superior environmental performance of mainstream businesses and/or ensuring adequate representation in emerging markets, where a large number of 'pure play enviro' related instruments are unlikely to be listed. green economics; <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> markets; stock market indices; eco-sensitive business; emerging markets; environmental goodwill; sustainability; sustainable development; environmental performance. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} green exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and propose a market-wide proxy for green returns and a green volatility factor. Design/methodology/approach – Identifying a unique sample of green funds, this paper investigates the time-series behavior of returns for these investment vehicles and their associated conditional volatility dynamics via GARCH methodology. In this study, green ETFs are defined as index funds replicating market indices that invest in stocks exhibiting positive environmental, social, and governance characteristics. Findings – Cumulative market-wide green returns are found to be positive from inception year 2005 through 2008. Estimating a t-GARCH (1, 1) specification, the author finds strong evidence in favor of volatility persistence for the 15 green ETFs identified in this study. Additionally, the results suggest that a 1 percent volatility-based value-at-risk forecast ranges from $ 24, 150 through $ 26, 000 on a daily basis. Finally, the empirical evidence provides support for weak-form market efficiency when examining the green universe of stocks. Research limitations/implications – Green ETFs are relatively recent financial instruments and exhibit important implications for volatility timing strategies and the cross-section of <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> returns. Practical implications – Knowledge of green price behavior is important in constructing optimal hedging and risk management strategies. Social implications – Green ETFs provide a natural channel for sustainable investing. Originality/value – Green ETFs exhibit the advantage of including many companies that have undertaken positive measures towards the global environment in their respective business models. This paper provides the first investigation of green ETFs. Corporate social responsibility, Ethical investment, Investment funds...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} mentioned problems in relation to processing beetle-killed wood in the British Columbia Interior is that of kiln drying charges consisting of both green and partly dried stock. This results from the fact that dead beetle-killed stems are currently harvested and processed along with green stems from the same stands. The losses, or additional costs, associated with the current procedures include the following: 1. extra cost to kiln dry already dry wood, 2. excessive degrade in the already dry stock, and 3. increased planer breakage due to overdry wood, and related planer production delays. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine some possible alternatives available for dealing with this problem, the equip-ment changes required, the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives and some related considerations. This is done within the framework of a series of studies designed to evaluate the economic merits of the alternatives. PROPOSAL In order to reduce the losses referred to above, it is proposed that the dry beetle-killed wood and green normal wood be segregated and the lumber dried separately. MILL TYPE The type of operation examined in the following alternatives is a typical British Columbian Interior spruce-pine-fir (S-P-F) dimension mill producing 2 x 4 to 2 x 10 in lengths from 8 to 20 feet, requiring 28 basic length and width sorts. SORTING ALTERNATIVES Four basic alternatives for sorting have been identified: 1. No change (control) : continue to run mixed dry and <b>green</b> <b>stock</b> throughout the operation; 2. Sort in woods: segregate dead (red top or older) from live stems as early as possible during harvesting. Haul them separately to the mill and store them separately in the yard; 3. Double the sorts: this alternative requires doubling the number of sorts in a typical bin sorter, and adding an in-line moisture meter to identify and separate the dry from the green pieces...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to compare the investment performance of <b>green</b> and non-green <b>stocks</b> across four investment styles. Recent literature suggests a lack of consensus among researchers in respect {{of the performance of}} green investing, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, or Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) relative to more traditional forms of investing. Previous research has focused predominantly on the performance of funds thereby taking into account the skills of fund managers in selecting stocks. Additionally, the existing literature’s focus has been on SRI relative to traditional investing or green relative to SRI investing. This research therefore contributes to closing a gap in the literature by investigating the performance of <b>green</b> <b>stocks</b> versus non-green stocks in the market. Monthly investment returns of green portfolios for four investment styles were compared to their non-green equivalent, over four different time periods. Time weighted returns and Sharpe ratios, to measure risk-adjusted returns, were also computed for further analysis. The research indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} between the monthly returns of green portfolios versus non-green portfolios in the four investments styles over all periods investigated. Time weighted returns showed that green portfolios outperformed non-green portfolios in 14 of the 16 style/periods investigated. The Sharpe ratios showed risk-adjusted returns were consistent with the findings of the time-weighted returns. However, the non-green value/mid-cap portfolio was the only portfolio to have positive returns and Sharpe ratio for the 2008 - 2009 crisis period.
