40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} scattering of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> in semiconductors by both acoustic and optical phonons on the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption in quantizing magnetic fields. We find that for electromagnetic radiation polarized either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field, the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption is an oscillatory function of the magnetic field. The origin of this oscillatory magneto-absorption is due to phonon assisted transitions between the various Landau levels of the <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> in quantizing magnetic fields. From the periods of the oscillations in the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption, the frequencies of those phonons which interact most strongly with the <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> can be found...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} impact of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> on the zone-center optical phonon {{frequency}} in germanium (Ge). By {{taking advantage of the}} Ge-on-insulator structure, we measured the Raman spectroscopy by applying back-gate bias. Phonon softening by accumulating holes in Ge film was clearly observed. This fact strongly suggests that the phonon softening in heavily-doped Ge is mainly attributed to the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> effect rather than the dopant atom counterpart. Furthermore, we propose that the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> effect on phonon softening is simply understandable from the viewpoint of covalent bonding modification by <b>free</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{dynamics}} of photogenerated carriers in Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) single crystals using femtosecond transient reflectivity (TR) and optical pump-THz probe transient absorption (THz-TA) spectroscopy. The TR and THz-TA decay dynamics consistently showed that <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> have long lifetimes of up to a few nanoseconds. The excitation-photon-energy-dependent TR measurements revealed a slow picosecond energy relaxation of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> to the band edge in CZTS. The relaxation and recombination dynamics of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> were affected by nonradiative recombinations at the surface.

The PL spectrum and the TA decay component {{due to the}} band-to-band recombination of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> were observed in the picosecond time region. From excitation-photon-energy-dependent TA measurements, we identified a slow intraband relaxation of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> in the CIGS thin films. Collectively, the combination of PL and TA experiments reveal a global feature of energy relaxation and recombination processes of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> in the femtosecond to nanosecond time regions...|$|R

Simulations of Raman scattering suggest that net gain can be achieved in certain cases without the need for an integrated diode in reverse bias to remove the photo-generated <b>free</b> <b>carriers.</b> (c) 2008 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
30|$|Bouloudein et al. [44] have {{considered}} {{in their study}} that the ferromagnetism in DMS is originated from the exchange interaction between <b>free</b> delocalized <b>carriers</b> and the localized d spins of the cobalt ions. Presence of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> is therefore necessary for the appearance of ferromagnetism. <b>Free</b> <b>carriers</b> can be induced either by doping or by defects or by cobalt ions in another oxidation state like Co 3 +. Above explanation suggests that our samples have limited number of impurities or defects, which may explain the absence of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> and consequently the ferromagnetism.|$|R
40|$|In semiconductors, {{nonlinear}} {{generation and}} recombination processes of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> and nonlinear charge transport can {{give rise to}} non-equilibrium phase transitions. At low temperatures, the basic nonlinearity {{is due to the}} autocatalytic generation of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> by impact ionization of shallow impurities. The electric field accelerates free electrons, causing an abrupt increase in <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> density at a critical electric field. In static electric fields, this nonlinearity is known to yield complex filamentary current patterns bound to electric contacts...|$|R
40|$|We perform frequency- and time-resolved all-optical {{switching}} of a GaAs-AlAs micropillar cavity {{using an}} ultrafast pump-probe setup. The switching {{is achieved by}} two-photon excitation of <b>free</b> <b>carriers.</b> We track the cavity resonances in time with a high frequency resolution. The pillar modes exhibit simultaneous frequency shifts, albeit with markedly different maximum switching amplitudes and relaxation dynamics. These differences stem from the non-uniformity of the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> density in the micropillar, and are well understood by {{taking into account the}} spatial distribution of injected <b>free</b> <b>carriers,</b> their spatial diffusion and surface recombination at micropillar sidewall...|$|R

40|$|Monolayer {{transition}} metal dichalcogenids (TMDs) feature valley degree of freedom, giant spin-orbit coupling and spin-valley locking. These exotic natures stimulate efforts of exploring the potential applications in conceptual spintronics, valleytronics and quantum computing. Among all the exotic directions, a long lifetime of spin and/or valley polarization is critical. The present valley dynamics studies {{concentrate on the}} band edge excitons which predominates the optical response due to the enhanced Coulomb interaction in two dimensions. The valley lifetime of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> remains in ambiguity. In this work, we use time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy to probe the valley dynamics of excitons and <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> in monolayer tungsten diselinide. The valley lifetime of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> is found around 2 ns at 70 K, about 3 orders of magnitude longer than the excitons of about 2 ps. The extended valley lifetime of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> evidences that exchange interaction dominates the valley relaxation in optical excitation.

40|$|Undoped InP layers {{grown at}} low {{temperature}} by atomic layer {{molecular beam epitaxy}} have been studied by Hall measurements and deep level transient spectroscopy. The <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration at room temperature increases linearly with phosphorus pressure {{and it has been}} possible to obtain layers with a <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration of 1 × 1016 cm- 3 and an electron mobility of about 3000 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, which are similar to values for samples grown at high temperatures. Deep level transient spectroscopy shows the presence, in all the samples, of five electron traps with emission energies of 0 · 60, 0 · 40, 0 · 25, 0 · 16, and 0 · 11 eV from the conduction band, with concentrations independent of the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration {{with the exception of the}} 0 · 40 eV trap concentration, which increases slightly with <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration. © 1996 The Institute of Materials.

40|$|We {{study the}} ac {{anomalous}} Hall conductivity σ_xy(ω) of a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry. Even {{in the absence}} of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> these materials exhibit a "universal" anomalous Hall response determined solely by the locations of the Weyl nodes. We show that the <b>free</b> <b>carriers,</b> which are generically present in an undoped Weyl semimetal, give an additional contribution to the ac Hall conductivity. We elucidate the physical mechanism of the effect and develop a microscopic theory of the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> contribution to σ_xy(ω). The latter can be expressed in terms of a small number of parameters (the electron velocity matrix, the Fermi energy μ, and the "tilt" of the Weyl cone). The resulting σ_xy(ω) has resonant features at ω∼ 2 μ which may be used to separate the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> response from the filled-band response using, for example, Kerr effect measurements. This may serve as diagnostic tool to characterize the doping of individual valleys. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to enhancing the visible light absorption, doped ions further influence {{the concentrations of}} the <b>free</b> <b>carriers.</b> Because <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption is the main photon absorption mechanism in the NIR region, the NIR reflectance of oxide pigments can be improved by controlling the concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>carriers.</b> In addition, the NIR reflectance is also connected to the TiO 2 host material properties, such as crystal structure, particle morphology, and size. In view of the different mechanisms influencing VIS and NIR reflectance, doped TiO 2 pigments {{should be able to}} be prepared with dark color and high NIR reflectance. This would simultaneously satisfy the need for energy savings and a pleasing color palette.|$|R

30|$|Vice versa, the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> {{concentration}} can {{be calculated}} if the frequency of SO phonon mode {{and the size of}} the NWs are known. Here, the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration in sample B is estimated to be 2.25 × 1017 cm- 3 using the measured diameter (42 nm) and SO phonon frequency (230.0 cm- 1). This result is close to the value obtained through electrical measurements in [5]. This high <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration in the InAs NWs might be caused by the unintentional doping due to carbon background incorporation [5]. To get more understanding of this SO phonon mode in InAs NWs, temperature-dependent Raman measurements are also performed on the InAs NWs in sample B, the results are shown in Figure 2 c. It is observed that the SO phonon peak shifts to lower frequency with increasing the temperature, which is similar to the temperature behavior of the LO and TO mode of InAs NWs, and can be explained by the lattice expansion in NWs. It should be noted that though the SO feature is not apparent at high temperatures (> 173 K) the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration should still be around the value (2.25 × 1017 cm- 3) at low temperatures considering the fact that the <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration induced by unintentionally doping is much higher than that of intrinsic carrier in InAs materials (~ 1 × 1015 cm- 3).|$|R
