50|$|Threats to {{this species}} include habitat loss and {{degradation}} via many processes. Urban development {{has led to}} the extirpation of a number of populations, including some within the Salt Lake City and Colorado Springs metropolitan areas. It continues to be a threat in many areas, including the vicinity of Boulder, Colorado. Threats associated with urban development include the introduction of weeds into the habitat and the loss of pollinating insects. Construction and maintenance of roads and other infrastructure, such as dams and pipelines, damages habitat. Recreational activities in the plant's riparian habitat, such as boating and off-road vehicle use, can be damaging. Some populations grow in irrigated fields and are susceptible to mowing and other <b>farm</b> <b>activity,</b> and the conversion to agricultural use consumes natural areas. As much as 65% of the plant's known habitat is affected by cattle and horse grazing; this can be harmful but it may also be beneficial in some ways, especially if the animals eat competing weeds. The orchid grows in wetland habitat, which is degraded by any process that alters the local hydrology; one estimate had 52% of all individuals in areas threatened by hydrological change. Water is diverted for irrigation and municipal use. The orchid grows in flood-prone river habitat and flood suppression via levees and other structures affects and prevents this natural process. River restoration activities have been known to negatively affect orchid populations that have become established or re-established in previously altered river habitat.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the COBO project (funded by EU FP 6), {{consequences}} of a fish <b>farm</b> <b>activity</b> on biogeochemistry composition and processes of bottom sediments below the fish farm cages have been evaluated. The fish farm was located in a northern fjord (Loch Creran, Scotland). The study was carried out three months after the removing of the cages. Seven cores in May and three cores in August 2006 were collected to study early diagenesis processes and to calculate benthic fluxes. Each core was extruded; pore waters were extracted and analyzed for nutrients (NH 3, NO 3, NO 2, PO 4, Si(OH) 4, and TCO 2), metals (Fe and Mn) and sulphates; diffusive fluxes at the sediment-water interface were calculated by applying Ficks first law. Preliminary results show sediments lying down to the fish farm were characterized by more intensive early diagenesis processes (from 2 to 4 times more than blank area). This means the fish farm produce high reactive organic matter snow that increases the reactivity of bottom sediments. Seasonal variations with increased diagenetic processes in summer were also recorded. In spring and in summer sediments both from the impacted area and the control sites were affected by strong bio-irrigation processes. Calculated benthic fluxes reflect the early diagenesis patterns with more intensive nutrient fluxes to the overlying water in the fish farm affected area and in the summer season, this suggests sediments affected by fish <b>farm</b> <b>activity</b> contribute more to eutrophication of confined coastal waters...|$|E
