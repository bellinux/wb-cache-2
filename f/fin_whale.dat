5|$|The <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> {{is usually}} {{distinguished}} by its tall spout, long back, prominent dorsal fin, and asymmetrical colouration.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{predator}} of the <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> is the killer whale, {{with at least}} 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack. Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. In October 2005, 16 killer whales attacked and killed a <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> in the Canal de Ballenas, Gulf of California, after chasing it for about an hour. They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area. In June 2012, a pod of killer whales was seen in La Paz Bay, in the Gulf of California, chasing a <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> {{for over an hour}} before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass. The whale bore numerous tooth rakes over its back and dorsal fin; several killer whales flanked it on either side, with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw. In July 1908, a whaler reportedly saw two killer whales attack and kill a <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> off western Greenland. In January 1984, seven were seen from the air circling, holding the flippers, and ramming a <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> in the Gulf of California, but the observation ended at nightfall.|$|E

5|$|In October 2006, Iceland's {{fisheries}} ministry {{authorized the}} hunting of 9 <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> through August 2007. In 2009 and 2010, Iceland caught 125 and 148 <b>fin</b> <b>whales,</b> respectively. An Icelandic company, Hvalur, caught {{over a hundred}} <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> in 2014, and exported a record quantity of 2071 tonnes in a single shipment in 2014. Since 2006, Hvalur has caught more than 500 <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> and exported more than 5000 tonnes of whale meat to Japan.|$|R
40|$|For many years, {{researchers}} {{have speculated that}} <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> are year-round residents in the Sea of Cortez (= Gulf of California). Previous work by Berube and co-workers {{has shown that the}} degree of genetic diversity among <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> in the Sea of Cortez at nuclear and mitochondrial loci is highly reduced. However, the relatively unobstructed connection with the North Pacific Ocean argues that Sea of Cortez <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> are part of a much larger eastern North Pacific population given the extensive migratory ranges observed in <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> and baleen whales in general. The low degree of genetic variation might thus simply be due to historic fluctuations in the effective population size of an eastern North Pacific population. In order to test if the reduced genetic variation detected among <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> in the Sea of Cortez is due to small population size or a past bottleneck in an otherwise large eastern North Pacific population, we analyzed the geographic distribution of genetic variation at a single mitochondrial (control region) and 16 nuclear loci in samples collected from <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> in the eastern North Pacific (n = 12) as well as the Sea of Cortez (n = 77). Our results showed that <b>fin</b> <b>whales</b> observed in the Sea of Cortez constitute a highly isolated and thus evolutionary unique population, which warrants special conservation measures given the current low estimate of abundance of approximately 400 individuals...|$|R

5|$|The IWC {{prohibited}} {{hunting in}} the Southern Hemisphere in 1976. The Soviet Union engaged in the illegal killing of protected whale species in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere, over-reporting <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> catches to cover up illegal takes of other species. In the North Pacific, they reported taking over 10,000 fin whales between 1961–79, while the true catch was less than 9,000. In the Southern Hemisphere, they reported taking nearly 53,000 between 1948 and 1973, when the true total was a little over 41,000. The <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> was given full protection from commercial whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific in 1976, and in the North Atlantic in 1987, with small exceptions for aboriginal catches and catches for research purposes. All populations worldwide remain listed as endangered species by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and the International Conservation Union Red List. The <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> is on Appendix 1 of CITES.|$|E

Whether the current stock boundaries define biologically isolated units is uncertain, and confirmation or revision awaits input from techniques such as molecular genetics or telemetry.

50|$|The {{sei whale}} looks {{similar to other}} large baleen whales. The best way to {{distinguish}} between it and Bryde's whale, apart from differences in baleen plates, is {{by the presence of}} lateral ridges on the dorsal surface of the Bryde's whale's rostrum. Large individuals can be confused with <b>fin</b> <b>whales,</b> unless the <b>fin</b> <b>whale's</b> asymmetrical head coloration is clearly seen. The <b>fin</b> <b>whale's</b> lower jaw's right side is white, and the left side is grey.

5|$|In the 19th century, the <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, but it {{was relatively}} safe, because it could easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: the <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> (B. physalus), the Sei whale (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. brydei), Eden's whale (B. edeni), the blue whale (B. musculus), the common minke whale (B. acutorostrata), the Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), Omura's whale (B. omurai), and the {{humpback}} whale (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals. They recommend that the genus Balaenoptera {{be limited to the}} <b>fin</b> <b>whale,</b> have minke whales fall under the genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain the Sei whale, Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, the blue whale, and Omura's whale.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the <b>fin</b> <b>whale,</b> Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale.

5|$|Though clearly {{related to}} the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the {{humpback}} is the sole member of its genus.

5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species.

5|$|Like {{all other}} large whales, the <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> was heavily hunted during the 20th century {{and is an}} {{endangered}} species.

5|$|Like {{many large}} rorquals, the <b>fin</b> <b>whale</b> is a {{cosmopolitan}} species. It {{is found in}} all the world's major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical.
