30|$|Three {{scenarios}} {{were analyzed}} under different policies including market regulation, market deregulation and environmental subsidies targeted at RE. The obtained results show that: (1) The competitiveness of NGFE can be promoted greatly through price reforms. Through deregulation, the NG price decreases from the fixed 1.9 RMB/Nm 3 {{to the average}} level of 1.31 RMB/Nm 3, which will increase the share of NGFE from 2.7 % to 6.3 %; (2) The utilization ratio of renewable energy in power generation can be improved significantly through subsidies targeted at RE. The share of RE and the utilization ratio can reach 7.1 % and 70.0 %, respectively; (3) The deregulation in NG and electricity markets can enhance the users’ welfare greatly, with the power price decreasing from 0.56 RMB/(kW h) to 0.35 RMB/(kW h) on average, and the total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>power</b> consumption declines correspondingly from 10.47 billion to 6.55 billion RMB per day; (4) A renewable subsidy of 0.18 RMB/(kW h) {{is found to be}} most efficient to improve the power generation mix and RE utilization ratio, in which the share and utilization ratio of RE reach at 4.0 % and 95.2 %, respectively. Our analytical and numerical results imply that a market-oriented NG pricing system and a RE-targeted subsidy to power sectors are of vital importance in promoting the penetration of NGFE and RE.|$|E

50|$|To {{reach this}} figure {{a more general}} formula is {{employed}} that simplifies its calculation. The starting point is a basis that takes account of: State <b>expenditure</b> in Spain <b>on</b> untransferred powers; what the State collects due to income {{not included in the}} agreement; and, {{in order to avoid the}} quota representing an extra burden over and above the generation of effective resources of the State, the deficit. A proportion of this expenditure and income had to be assigned to the Basque Country. Through an approximate calculation, which takes account of the weight of the income and population within the Spanish total, it was stipulated that the proportion was 6.24%. The Quota has a five-yearly periodicity, although there is an annual adjustment of the quantity on the basis of the figures budgeted for and liquidated by the State. This is an essential difference from the design of the Quota up until that time, inasmuch as it involves the unilateral risk represented for the Basque Country of assuming a part of the <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>powers</b> that have not been transferred and that depend exclusively on the State, independent of how the conjuncture of the country evolves or whether the tax collection increases or not.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate the relationships between different factors affecting educational competitiveness, which is crucial to enhancing national competitiveness in every country, and to put forward policy implications whereby each country may raise the level of its educational competitiveness. PISA score was selected as an indicator representing the educational competitiveness of 22 OECD countries, and this included some independent variables, such as per capita GDP, total public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, and total per capita public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education (US dollars), affecting educational competitiveness. We employed the fuzzy set analysis method (FS/QCA) to analyze the complex causal relationships among the factors affecting educational competitiveness. The research results show that there are three significant combinations of variables affecting educational competitiveness (PISA score). Model 1 is a configuration of four variables (high total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, high total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education to GDP, and high GDP), and includes Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and Ireland.
