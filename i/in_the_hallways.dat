5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was present}} in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party with a male model, as well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running {{around the room and}} posing in front of the windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways,</b> plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E
25|$|The Capitol has a {{long history}} in art of the United States, {{beginning}} in 1856 with Italian/Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> of {{the first floor of the}} Senate side of the Capitol. The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors, reflect great moments and people in United States history. Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the Spirit of St. Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger shuttle crew.|$|E

25|$|Penn Manor's {{switch to}} a 4 x 4 block {{schedule}} coincided with the renovation project. Where a traditional schedule has students moving to eight classes a day, the block schedule has four 90-minute classes {{in the fall and}} four different classes in the spring. Considering the size of the building, eight minutes were needed between classes to get {{from one end of the}} building to the other. The block schedule decreased the amount of time students spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways.</b> Study halls were eliminated and graduation requirements were gradually increased from 21 to 28 credits required for graduation. All students are required to take four credits each in English, math, science and social studies. An honors program was developed and Advanced Placement offerings were increased.|$|E
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E
500|$|For [...] "The Asset", {{composer}} Bear McCreary wrote a {{theme for}} Ian Quinn. A [...] "bouncy and energetic" [...] {{version of this}} was performed on a bouzouki by guitarist Ed Trybek to evoke the music of Malta, while a simplified orchestral version is used as the primary Quinn theme. McCreary stated {{that he does not}} [...] "use it a lot, but it counts when I do. When he catches Skye <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> and steps forward menacingly, the low strings and woodwinds sneak in on this theme and underscore how dangerous he is." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Cosmatos, the [...] "rigid {{geometric}} world" [...] of the Arboria Institute visually {{fits the}} movie's control theme. This {{is especially true}} for the Dr. Nyle character, someone [...] "very knowledged, trying to create a very controlled environment to give himself a feeling of power." [...] The light triangle, responsible for dampening Elena's psychic powers, is another control symbol. The Institute's plethora of reflecting surfaces – the walls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways,</b> the giant piece of glass in the therapy room, the infinity-mirrored Sentionaut room, Margo's glasses – might somewhat hint at this idea. To many ancient cultures, the mirror was a symbol of self-awareness, consciousness and intelligence, but also a source of pride and vanity. The visual reference for Arboria Institute's interior design was THX 1138.|$|E
2500|$|A Finnish {{reporter}} from Helsingin Sanomat reported seeing rockets fired from near the Gaza Al-Shifa hospital. The IDF {{said that in}} several cases Hamas used Wafa hospital as a military base and used ambulances to transport its fighters. According to the Israeli Shabak, many of the militants it interrogated said that [...] "everyone knew" [...] that Hamas leaders were using hospitals for hiding. Hamas security reportedly wore police uniforms and blocked access to {{certain parts of the}} hospitals. One of the interrogated militants reportedly said that civilians seeking medical attention usually were thrown out by the security. The Washington Post described Al-Shifa hospital as a [...] "de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders, who can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> and offices." [...] Amnesty International reported that: [...] "Hamas forces used the abandoned areas of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, including the outpatients’ clinic area, to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise ill-treat suspects, even as other parts of the hospital continued to function as a medical centre".|$|E

2500|$|The Ex-monastery of Santiago Apóstol {{is located}} in the town of Cuilapan de Guerrero in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. [...] The fortress-like complex is easily seen from the highway as one travels south from the capital city of Oaxaca on the road leading to Villa de Zaachila, and it is visited by both Mexican and {{international}} tourists. The complex is located on a small hill which gives it a view of much of the valley area. It {{is one of the most}} extravagant and elaborate colonial era constructions in Oaxaca, but it is often overlooked in favor of churches and monasteries located in the Mexico City area. Built of green quarried stone and river rocks, it is a quiet place where footsteps can echo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways.</b> The extravagances of the site, including the tall basilica, the elaborate baptismal font, the Gothic cloister and murals remain as national treasures. The decorative work of the monastery, especially its murals, are important because they show a systematic blending of indigenous elements into the Christian framework, done in order to support the evangelization process in the local Mixtec and Zapotec peoples. The single-naved church is used for worship but the roofless basilica and cloister are under the control of INAH, which uses many of the second-floor rooms of the cloister as workshops for restoration projects and runs a small museum with important liturgical items from the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|Ebbitt House {{struggled}} {{to compete against}} the larger and more lavish Willard Hotel and the Raleigh Hotel (built in 1893). From the late 1860s until the 1910s, it was considered [...] "Army and Navy Headquarters" [...] {{because of the number}} of military personnel who lived there and the large number of veterans' meetings held there. In November 1889, Caleb Willard hired Henry C. Burch and Charles E. Gibbs (both veteran hotel managers in the city) to run Ebbitt House. Over the next two years, Burch and Gibbs completely refurnished all the rooms (adding new furniture and Belgian carpets), re-papered or added painted frescoes to the ceilings, and installed new furniture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways.</b> [...] On the east side was the now-famous Red Parlor, a gentleman's lounge fitted with rich red and gold draperies, fabric wall coverings, and upholstered furniture. [...] The restaurant, called [...] "cheerful and sunny" [...] by the Washington Post, fronted onto 14th Street NW, was lit with crystal chandeliers, and could seat up to 225 people. [...] It was completely remodeled by Burch and Gibbs: guests dined at tables set with tablecloths imported from Scotland, using Haviland & Co. Limoges porcelain china, silver-handled knives and forks manufactured by Reed & Barton, and Bohemian glassware. [...] Cut-glass flower vases, finger bowls, and water bottles were used for serving. [...] Diners sat in high-backed leather chairs. [...] At breakfast, the waiters wore brown cutaway jackets, vests, and pants with a gold stripe, while in the evening they changed into black tuxedos. [...] The kitchen was renovated, with new steam tables and massive coffee urns (manufactured by Brambull, Deane & Co. of New York City) installed. [...] The menu — served buffet-style — included Blue Point oysters, green sea turtle, Kennebec River salmon, mutton, chicken, hominy fritters, stewed diamondback terrapin, canvasback duck, English pheasant, and a variety of vegetables, fruits, cheese, crackers, nuts, pies, and puddings. [...] Wines, whiskeys, and brandies were served from two large storerooms. Despite the success of the changes, Gibbs left Ebbitt House in 1893 after purchasing Wormley's Hotel. Burch became the sole manager of the hotel. He conducted extensive renovations to the exterior of the hotel in 1895. An enormous two-story mansard roof, with central and corner pavilions influenced by the French Beaux-Arts movement, was added to the top floor, replacing the original single-story, restrained mansard roof.|$|E
60|$|Sleep {{refused to}} come back to Lane. As he lay there he was {{surprised}} at the many sounds he heard. The ramshackle old structure, which he had supposed almost vacant, was busy with life. Stealthy footfalls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> passed and repassed; a piano drummed somewhere; a man's loud voice rang out, and a woman's laugh faint, hollow and far away, like the ghost of laughter, returned in echo. The musical clinking of glasses, the ring of a cash register, the rattling click of pool balls, came up from below.|$|E

He throws insults and rudeness at her and ends their relationship brutally, leaving Fred in tears. Back at the hotel, Cordelia is distracted by crying that she hears out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> A tearful Fred stands out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and tells them there's something wrong with Gunn.|$|R
60|$|This {{noble and}} {{distinguished}} gentleman possessed in a brother an exact and perfect opposite to himself. Captain Obadiah Belford was a West Indian, an inhabitant of Kingston {{in the island}} of Jamaica. He was a cursing, swearing, hard-drinking renegado from virtue; an acknowledged dealer in negro slaves, and reputed {{to have been a}} buccaneer, if not an out-and-out pirate, such as then infested those tropical latitudes in prodigious numbers. He was not unknown in New Hope, which he had visited upon several occasions for a week or so at a time. During each period he lodged with his brother, whose household he scandalized by such freaks as smoking his pipe of tobacco in the parlor, offering questionable pleasantries to the female servants, and cursing and swearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> with a fecundity and an ingenuity that would have put the most godless sailor about the docks to the blush.|$|E
60|$|Her mother was, Una declared, so {{absolutely}} the lady {{that it was}} a crying shame to think of her immured here in their elevatorless tenement; this new, clean, barren building of yellow brick, its face broken out with fire-escapes. It had narrow halls, stairs of slate treads and iron rails, and cheap wooden doorways which had begun to warp the minute the structure was finished--and sold. The bright-green burlap wall-covering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> had faded {{in less than a year}} to the color of dry grass. The janitor grew tired every now and then. He had been markedly diligent at first, but he was already giving up the task of keeping the building clean. It was one of, and typical of, a mile of yellow brick tenements; it was named after an African orchid of great loveliness, and it was filled with clerks, motormen, probationer policemen, and enormously prolific women in dressing-sacques.|$|E
60|$|The door jerked open, {{and the man}} flung past Martin, with {{an angry}} countenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and {{clenching}} his fists. Martin decided not to enter immediately, and lingered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> {{for a quarter of}} an hour. Then he shoved the door open and walked in. It was a new experience, {{the first time he had}} been inside an editorial office. Cards evidently were not necessary in that office, for the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who wanted to see Mr. Ford. Returning, the boy beckoned him from halfway across the room and led him to the private office, the editorial sanctum. Martin's first impression was of the disorder and cluttered confusion of the room. Next he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking man, sitting at a roll- top desk, who regarded him curiously. Martin marvelled at the calm repose of his face. It was evident that the squabble with the printer had not affected his equanimity.|$|E
