The paper consist of five parts. Parts I and II present some aspects of the FDI influence on economic growth from the theoretical and empirical point of view. Part III defines conditions indispensable for the positive FDI impact on the economy of the host country. Part IV outlines changes of FDI flows in Poland in the period of 1994 - 2012. Part V includes the main assumptions of the Cobb-Douglas production function and an estimate of changes <b>in</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>value</b> for Poland <b>in</b> the period 1994 – 2012 with the use of the VECM. The factors significant for economic growth are also identified, including the significance of the net FDI inflows.

In 1999, agricultural production was 0.4% higher than during 1989-91. The fertile Cibao Valley is the main agricultural center. In 1998, arable land totaled 1020000 ha; with land under permanent crops at 480000 ha.|$|R
40|$|In {{the spirit}} of Harberger, we apply a dynamic computable general {{equilibrium}} (CGE) model and estimate the excess burden stemming from the tax-induced distortion in the allocation of capital across the corporate and the non-corporate sectors in Germany. In doing so, we perform a counterfactual analysis and ask how the allocation of capital across sectors would change compared with a sector-neutral tax system which assures an identical effective tax burden on both sectors. Our estimates suggest that the excess burden per period ranges from 2. 0 to 3. 6 billion Euros or from about 0. 1 to 0. 16 per cent of <b>GDP.</b> <b>In</b> present <b>value</b> terms, the excess burden translates to about 104 billion Euros or 4. 7 per cent of <b>GDP.</b> <b>In</b> order to identify {{the impact of the}} firm’s financial behaviour {{on the size of the}} emerging excess burden, we perform several sensitivity analyses with regard to debt financing, external equity financing and debt constraints via agency cost. capital income taxation, non-uniform taxation, computable general equilibrium modelling...|$|R

We answer this question by estimating the value creation for the stocks purchased by the government between the period starting with the market crash in mid-June and the market recovery in September. We find that the government intervention increased the value of the rescued firms with a net benefit between RMB 5, 697 and 6, 635 billion, which is about 10 % of the Chinese <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 2014.

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, {{we observe}} a global {{increase}} of current account imbalances. In 2007, before {{the climax of}} the financial crisis, they reached 2 % of world <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> absolute <b>value.</b> At the global level, the persistence of large current account imbalances is a threat to the macroeconomic and macrofinancial stability. This thesis analyses this phenomenon of global imbalances by using two complementary approaches: equilibrium exchange rates models and stock-flow consistent models. These two approaches can be considered as complementary insofar as they analyze the same problem from a different point of view. Equilibrium exchange rate models and particularly the FEER approach introduced by Williamson (1994) try to calculate exchange rate variations needed to reach a sustainable current account balance. Stock-flow consistent models à la Godley-Lavoie (2007) seek to analyze adjustments in terms of level of output and exchange rate dynamics in a context of imbalances. A return of large imbalances is not excluded. It appears that an international monetary cooperation aimed at preventing the return of large imbalances at the world and intra-European levels is a necessary condition to ensure global recovery. ...|$|R

50|$|For example, {{suppose a}} country's <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 1990 was $100 million and its <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 2000 was $300 million.

To meaningfully compare its <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 2000 to its <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 1990, we could multiply the <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 2000 by one-half, to make it relative to 1990 as a base year. The result would be that the <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 2000 equals $300 million × one-half = $150 million, in 1990 monetary terms. We would see that the country's GDP had realistically increased 50 percent over that period, not 200 percent, as it might appear from the raw GDP data.

40|$|Tourism is a {{socio-economic}} phenomenon exerting considerable economic, {{social and}} political impact, thus securing itself an important position in the overall economic growth. The principal {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the effects of the EU integration process on tourist movements in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro during the period 2006 - 2014, as 2006 was the year when one of the surveyed countries initiated EU accession negotiations, and tourism sector contribution to <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> these countries in the period from 2002 - 2013 based on the data available for these years. To that end, the authors have compared the relationship between the number of foreign tourist arrivals and overnight stays and the <b>GDP</b> rates <b>in</b> the surveyed countries. Upon reviewing the available sources, the authors have reached the conclusion that during the EU integration period, an increase in the number of foreign tourists and overnight stays positively correlated with the GDP growth. EU integration process has had a positive bearing on tourism movements in the surveyed countries. The panel regression method has shown that despite a continuous increase in the number of foreign tourist arrivals, tourism sector still makes a modest direct contribution to the overall economic growth of the surveyed countries (Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia). Also, the Granger causality test was applied to demonstrate that it is not possible to predict <b>GDP</b> <b>values</b> <b>in</b> any of the surveyed countries based on the tourism revenue growth, while tourism contribution to <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> Macedonia and Montenegro can be predicted based on their GDP...|$|R

40|$|The International Comparison Program {{requires}} all {{participating countries}} to provide national accounts estimates of expenditure on <b>GDP,</b> expressed <b>in</b> {{terms of their}} national currency and broken down into 155 detailed expenditure categories.

This splitting process is a major challenge in the National Accounts component of the ICP. Equally challenging is the need to ensure that the prices underlying the PPPs are consistent with the values estimated for the 155 detailed categories, which would be used as weights in the aggregation procedure. Both challenges are addressed in this paper where emphasis is laid on GDP exhaustiveness and consistency between prices and expenditures on GDP.

40|$|Large-value payment {{systems have}} evolved {{rapidly in the}} last 20 years, {{continually}} striking a balance between providing liquidity and keeping settlement risk under control. Changes to the design or to the risk management policies of such systems were needed, in part, due to the growth <b>in</b> the <b>value</b> of transactions on these systems. For example, in the United States the value of transactions on Fedwire, the Federal Reserve’s large-value payment system, increased from about 50 times <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 1989 to over 62 times <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 2003. This <b>value</b> exceeded $ 704 trillion in 2003. This growth raised concerns that the settlement failure of a large institution could pose severe economic consequences. The disruption in settlements after September 11, 2001, brought new focus to questions such as: How reliable are the payment systems? How should liquidity be provided to system participants? And how can central banks protect themselves from excessive risk? Martin considers the evolution of large-value payment systems {{in light of the}} trade-off between providing liquidity and limiting settlement risk. First, he provides some background on large-value payment systems and discusses the trade-off between providing liquidity and controlling settlement risk. Second, he describes the recent evolution of payment systems and explains how this evolution was spurred by increasing concerns about settlement failure, particularly in the EU, the United States, and Canada. Third, he explains some of the differences between three of the major large-value payment systems. Finally, he describes how technological progress and faster computers are allowing new systems to combine the best features of delayed net settlement and real-time gross settlement systems. These systems could offer a better trade-off between liquidity and risk. Payment systems...|$|R
