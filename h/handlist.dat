2500|$|A {{number of}} {{distinguished}} scholars from the British Museum accompanied the collections to Aberystwyth. Their {{senior member of}} staff was Deputy Keeper of Printed Books, Victor Scholderer, who responded to a [...] from the Director, Sir John Forsdyke, by insisting {{that he and his}} colleagues would continue to sleep in the Library so that the tunnel could be checked during the night to ensure that the air conditioning was functioning properly. Scholderer, an expert on incunabula, produced A <b>Handlist</b> of Incunabula in the National Library of Wales in gratitude to the hospitality that was afforded to them by the Library. Likewise, Arthur E. Popham, Keeper of Prints and Drawings, dedicated The Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci ″To the Librarian and staff of the National Library of Wales″. Several other institutions donated funds to the Library as an expression of their gratitude and Mrs. David Sassoon, London presented two works by Cicero that were printed at Venice in the fifteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Peniarth and Llanstephan manuscripts, the collection that Sir John Williams donated to the National Library included 500 manuscripts in the general collection (NLW MS 1–500). These manuscripts are an amalgamation of the various purchases that Sir John made between 1894 and 1899, including groups of manuscripts from the Welsh philologist Egerton Phillimore, Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle Hill, the Ashburn library and Sir Edmund Buckley of Plas Dinas Mawddwy. Descriptions of 446 of these manuscripts are provided by J. H. Davies in Additional Manuscripts in the Collections of Sir John Williams, which the Library published in 1921. The manuscripts in the National Library which {{are not part of}} the foundation collections are the focus of the <b>Handlist</b> of manuscripts, which was first published in 1941. All manuscripts acquired by donation or purchase are added to this open-ended series, either singly or in groups, if they are: a) in a format compatible with the collection, i.e. manuscript books or rolls, or unbound material that can be filed; and b) not integral to an archive or individual collection. There is, however, much archival material, most notably correspondence, held in the General Manuscript Collection. Individual manuscripts of particular interest include: ...|$|E

These books stand as {{permanent}} witnesses to an ephemeral event. Until quite recently {{they have not been}} subject to any thoroughgoing bibliographical study, however. This article explores the evidence that remains of readers’ ownership of and interactions with these works from the seventeenth century {{to the end of the}} eighteenth. Copies of these works were owned by collectors including Humphrey Dyson, Robert Burton, Anthony Wood, and John Philip Kemble. Through an exploration of <b>handlists</b> and annotations, one can discover how these books were collected and categorized. Such an analysis reveals not just the original cultural meaning of these works but also the ways in which owners and collectors identified them in generic terms, thus suggesting their changing value to readers...|$|R
