5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March 2011 it was {{reported}} that an AASM missile <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light ground attack/trainer jet, the first Libyan warplane to challenge the no-fly zone during the 2011 Libyan civil war, on the runway just after the plane had landed at Misrata Airport.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Beiyang Fleet. Jingyuen was part of a flotilla which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Jingyuan first saw action during the First Sino-Japanese War. At the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894, {{she was one of the}} surviving Chinese cruisers, although suffered fire damage. She was sunk the following February during the Battle of Weihaiwei from a shot <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> captured Chinese fort. She sank upright in shallow water, and Admiral Ding Ruchang gave orders for her to be destroyed by a naval mine. She was raised the follow year for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E

5|$|Gundamma Katha {{is based}} {{partially}} on William Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew. It {{focuses on a}} widow named Gundamma and her two daughters. The film's main theme is the step-daughter Lakshmi facing problems because of the widow, and the former's suitor teaching the latter a lesson. Using the first conversation between Gundamma and Lakshmi, in which the former abuses the latter for disturbing her sleep, Narasaraju introduces Gundamma's mindset and behaviour. Further incidents include the dismissal of a server <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> hotel after refusing {{to work as a}} servant in Gundamma's house, and Ghantaiah explaining Gundamma's character to Ramabhadraiah.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|The ideal {{solution}} was a proximity fuze inside an artillery shell, {{but there were}} numerous technical difficulties with this. The radar set {{had to be made}} small enough to fit inside a shell, and its glass vacuum tubes had to first withstand the 20,000 g force of being <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight. A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E

5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pistol), but it produces roughly 30percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability.

5|$|The Stone has {{suffered}} repeated desecrations and damage {{over the course}} of time. It {{is said to have been}} struck and smashed to pieces by a stone <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> catapult during the Umayyad Caliphate's siege of Mecca in 683. The fragments were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr using a silver ligament. In January 930, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern Eastern Arabia). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the Masjid al-Dirar, with the intention of redirecting the hajj away from Mecca. However, this failed, and pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.|$|E

5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dark alley through the glass door of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days. Since sieges were {{uncommon}} in Arabian warfare, the arriving confederates were unprepared {{to deal with}} the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered {{on either side of the}} trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Veitch {{became the}} head of JC's Girls and the 17,000-member Sandals Church became the organization's base of operations. The church {{is part of the}} California Southern Baptist Convention, which {{supports}} JC's Girls. The church gave JC's Girls a $10,000 budget in its first year. The organization's members continued visiting strip clubs across California, paying for private dances and then evangelizing the strippers. Within six months of its founding, the organization's members had persuaded several strippers to start attending a church and were only once asked to stop. One of these women was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> strip club because she started attending Sandals Church, but she continued attending the church, saying that Brown's preaching helped her get through the week.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where ingredients are <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle {{is filled with the}} correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as truffles and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E
5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E
