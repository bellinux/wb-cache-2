That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has <b>done</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's <b>done</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately" [...] is {{regarded}} as one of the singer's singles which helped establish her as a known artist.

Oprah Winfrey commented: [...] "What you're seeing in all the areas of arts and entertainment is black women internalizing the idea of black power and pride...

500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song. It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is about more than just what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately", {{peaked at}} number four on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and at {{number one on}} the Hot Black Singles chart.

500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately", which was {{originally}} penned {{for one of}} Jam and Lewis's own records, the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson's feelings about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. The song {{was chosen as the}} lead single for Control, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life. [...] "Nasty", which in Jackson's opinion was the most innovative song on the album, was inspired by her experience with street harassment in Minneapolis by a group of men outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately' were born, {{out of a sense of}} self-defense." [...] Jimmy Jam wrote and played the keyboard arrangement, with Jackson playing the accompaniment. Background vocals were sung by Jackson, Jam and Lewis. The distinctive triplet swing beat of the song was developed by Jam on an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard. [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] was centered on safe sex and abstinence, a subject of significant social commentary at the time. Jam commented that it is common practice for songwriters to use current events as a means of inspiration for lyrics and that the AIDS pandemic had raised awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. He commented, [...] "The theme of the song ('Let's Wait Awhile') was Janet's idea. She's not a preachy person. She's not telling people how to live their lives. All she's doing is offering an opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} during a [...] "frenzied" [...] medley of [...] "Control", [...] "The Pleasure Principle", and [...] "Nasty" [...] on The Velvet Rope Tour in 1998. The medley at the October 11, 1998 show in New York City, at the Madison Square Garden, was broadcast during a special titled The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden by HBO. It was also {{added to the}} setlist at its DVD release, The Velvet Rope Tour – Live in Concert in 1999. During the All for You Tour in 2001 and 2002, [...] "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately" [...] was performed in a re-worked version, during a medley with [...] "Control" [...] and [...] "Nasty". According to Denise Sheppard from Rolling Stone, it was [...] "another crowd favorite; perhaps best dubbed as the 'bitter' portion of the night", also adding that [...] "this performer - who has been performing onstage for twenty-eight years - knows what the crowd comes for and gives it to them in spades". The February 16, 2002 final date of the tour at the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, was broadcast by HBO, and included a performance of it. This rendition was also added to the setlist at its DVD release, , in 2002. For her first tour in seven years Rock Witchu Tour in 2008, she chose to open the show a medley with [...] "The Pleasure Principle", [...] "Control" [...] and [...] "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately".

500|$|... "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately", in {{particular}} its title, was referenced in the 1987 film Eddie Murphy Raw, {{as a common}} question that women ask their partners prior to breaking up. It is featured in the 1989 made-for-television Disney film Parent Trap III, when Jessie (Monica Creel) embarrasses herself during a karaoke dance skit called [...] "The Jackson Three", a parody of the Jackson Five, singing the song. American musician Prince started performing the track during his 1986 Parade tour stopping halfway through and asking the audience [...] "Who wrote that?" [...] then following up with his own [...] "Controversy" [...] track suggesting he did. He did it again during his 1990 Nude tour and during his shows in 2015 still stopping halfway through the song still asking [...] "Who wrote this?". There was a dispute regarding the paternity of the music. Prince believed Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis used an old demo he did {{with them in the}} early days of the Time. He performed [...] "What Have You <b>Done</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Lately" [...] again in late 2013 during shows in Uncasville, Connecticut. Jackson's sister La Toya Jackson sampled the song on her song [...] "Wild Side" [...] from her 1991 album No Relations. The song was interpolated for a medley sung in the 1993 comedy , and was covered by the American soul and funk band Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings in 2002 for their debut album, Dap Dippin' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings.
