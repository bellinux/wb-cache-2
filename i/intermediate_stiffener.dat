Stiffener rings are introduced to prevent cylindrical shells from buckling due to wind loads. The current top wind stiffener design rules used in the USA for such cylindrical storage tanks are specified in API 650. However, the design methodology of top stiffener rings is overly conservative.

40|$|New {{sections}} {{are continually}} being {{developed in the}} cold-formed steel world to improve the performance of existing sections. M-section development {{provides an example of}} improving C-sections’ shear resistance and web crippling resistance against C-sections’ concentrated loads. C-sections’ shear nominal strength can be achieved through locating tow web <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners</b> (M-sections) even though web crippling resistance cannot be increased in the same way. Such <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners</b> mean that M-section stresses and deflections cannot be analysed with traditional material mechanics. Concentrated loads cause this behaviour to become increased; 4 different models and 3 tests for each of then were thus developed, as well as determining M-sections’ theoretical resistance (based on 1996 AISI). The values obtained corresponded to maximum resistance load, visual identification of any possible type of failure, deflections (at middle span) and deformations (Ex, Ey, Exy). Mathematical models were also used for comparing the finite element method and simplified mathematical models’ test results for a detailed review of MM-section stress and deformation. These models were calibrated on the test results. After the failure mode was identified for each model, MM-section maximum resistance load was compared to nominal load (according to AISI formulation, also aiding formulating nominal strength calculation). The information obtained from tests and mathematical models was analysed to observe parameter (Δ, a y T) tendencies respecting applied load (P).

40|$|The {{advantages}} of using cold-formed steel are high strength-to-weight ratio, flexibility in fabricating different cross-section shapes, easy for construction and so on. Cold-formed steel sheets are usually manufactured into open sectional profiles by cold-rolling and brake-pressing methods. Doubly symmetric built-up sections, with {{the advantage of}} having larger torsional rigidity compared to traditional singly symmetric open sections, have great potential to extend the application of cold-formed steel to structural members with larger scale. The doubly symmetric built-up open and closed sections {{can be made by}} connecting two channel sections using self-tapping screws, which are also convenient for industrialized production. In this study, the structural performance of cold-formed steel built-up section beams with <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and built-up section beams with web perforations was examined through experimental and numerical investigations. The impact of different screw arrangements on the moment capacities of built-up section beams was also studied. A total of 113 beam tests that include simply supported beam tests of 16 pairs of channel sections with stiffened webs, 19 built-up sections with <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> 43 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 35 built-up sections with different screw arrangements was conducted. The material properties of the test specimens were also obtained by tensile coupon tests. The main objective of the experimental investigation is to obtain the section moment capacities and understand the structural behaviour of the built-up sections under bending. Finite element (FE) models of the beam specimens were also developed and numerical analysis that includes material nonlinearity, geometric nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity (for built-up section beams only) was performed and the results were verified against the test results. The validated FE models were employed for extensive parametric studies of 382 numerical simulations that include 101 channel sections with stiffened webs, 113 built-up sections with <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> 80 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 88 built-up sections having different screw arrangements. A wide range of section slenderness was considered in the built-up sections and different failure modes of beams were investigated. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the influence of stiffener features, different sizes of web holes, and various screw arrangements on the structural performance of cold-formed steel built-up section beams was carried out. The results obtained from the experimental and numerical studies were employed for evaluating the design rules of cold-formed steel built-up section beams. It should be mentioned that the existing direct strength method (DSM) for cold-formed steel members does not cover the design of built-up section beams. Hence, suitable design rules based on DSM have been proposed for cold-formed steel built-up section beams with <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and built-up section beams with web perforations under bending. The design equations for considering the screw spacings of built-up closed section beams have also proposed. Furthermore, the suitability of the modified design rules, as well as the existing DSM for cold-formed steel built-up section beams was also evaluated through a reliability analysis. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|This brief note {{discusses}} {{a change}} to the effective width determination for elements with intermediate stiffeners (e. g., the compression flange of deck sections) in local buckling. Current provisions (Section B 5. 1. 1 of AISI-S 100 - 07) can lead to erroneously conservative solutions, particularly for sections with a single stiffener located at mid-width of the element. The problem is easily rectified by using the more general expressions for local buckling already available in Specification section B 5. 1. 2. A ballot has been proposed to remedy the problem. The AISI Specification provisions for determining the effective width of elements with intermediate stiffeners have undergone significant revisions in recent editions. In 2001 entirely new provisions were adopted for stiffened and edge stiffened elements with multiple intermediate stiffeners {{based on the work}} of Schafer and Peköz (1998).

The basic basis of the current <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffener</b> provisions is the determination of (a) plate sub-element local buckling, and (b) distortional buckling of the intermediately stiffened element as illustrated in the AISI commentary, reprinted here as Fig. 1.

Very recently, the interactive behaviour of lipped channel columns with and without <b>intermediate</b> web <b>stiffeners</b> has fascinated several researchers. Young and Yan (2002) and Yan and Young (2002) discussed local and distortional buckling of plain channel with upright and complex edge stiffener under axial compression.

The high strength structural steel sheets had the measured 0. 2 % proof stress up to 586 MPa.

Tests were performed over a range of lengths such that column curves could be obtained. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the direct strength method in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Three different methods were used to obtain the local and distortional buckling stresses for the calculation of the direct strength method.

The two-strip model requires the ratio E*IE of the post-buckling to pre-buckling in-plane stiffness of the perfectly flat plate with stiffener to be known, It is explained how this ratio can be determined using finite element simulations of plates with imperfections. It is shown that the post-buckling behaviour is more sensitive to inaccuracies in the assumed deflection shape than the buckling stress.

40|$|The {{economic}} use of cold-formed steel members {{means that}} buckling {{and the possible}} loss of effectiveness it produces are important features of design. Cross-sectional instabilities in laterally-restrained cold-formed steel beams include local and distortional buckling. The prediction of the true buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel beams accounting for all governing features such as geometrical imperfections, spread of yielding, postbuckling etc. has been possible {{with the development of}} advanced numerical modelling. In this thesis, the finite element (FE) method (ABAQUS) has been used to develop numerical analyses to study the buckling behaviour of laterally-restrained cold-formed steel lipped Z-section beams. The FE models were verified against a series of four-point bending tests available from previous research, with special references to material and geometrical nonlinearities. Two sets of analyses have been conducted: FE analyses allowing for both local and distortional buckling and ones allowing for local buckling while distortional buckling is restrained using appropriate boundary conditions. For the former, the controlling buckling mode (local, distortional or combined) at different stages of loading (up to, at and beyond maximum load) has been realized. Comparing the results of two sets of analyses, the effect of distortional buckling on performance for different geometric proportions has been studied. The effect of the lip size, flange width, angle of inclination of the edge stiffener (lip), size and position of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffener</b> and material strength as well as the interaction between them on both the ultimate strength and the buckling of cold-formed Z-section beams has been investigated. Limits for optimum design of the section were proposed. Depending on the geometric properties and material strength of the section, transitions between local, distortional and combined local/distortional buckling were observed. The lip/flange interaction including the interaction between the edge stiffener (lip) and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffener</b> was the key governing feature of behaviour. The effect of the linear moment gradient and sharply varying bending moment on both the ultimate strength and the buckling of cold-formed Z sections was investigated. The latter occurred in two-span continuous beams subject to uniformly distributed loading. The results of moment gradient cases were compared with those of pure bending cases. The suitability of the design treatments available in Eurocode 3 (EC 3) for local, combined local/distortional and distortional buckling of cold-formed Z-section beams was assessed. Overall, the EC 3 predictions for cross-sectional bending resistances were unconservative. Shortcomings were identified and some suggestions for improvements were made.

40|$|A {{conventional}} {{plate girder}} {{involves the use}} of transverse <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> especially in a slender web to avoid catastrophic failure associated with shear buckling of the web. In this study, a profiled web was used to replace the transversely stiffened web. The process involves introducing coldformed ribs into a flat steel sheet to form alternative stiffeners. This study therefore seeks to establish comparative performance of conventionally stiffened plate girders and profiled web girders of a specially formed rib arrangement with single and also double webs. Nine numbers of specimens were tested to failure under a three-point-bending system. Failure of all the profiled web girders, with either a single or double webs, is characterized by a shorter yield plateau and a steeper descending branch, a failure mode that is commonly referred to as ‘brittle’. The results of the tests on girders with profiled steel sheets, PSS(s) have shown that profiling is extremely effective in increasing the shear buckling load because it moves the sheet material out of the plane of the web, thereby increasing the rigidity 1. 08 to 2. 0 times higher than the equivalent conventional flat web plate girders.

However, the corresponding demands on <b>intermediate</b> transverse <b>stiffeners</b> in curved I-girders are still largely unknown. Furthermore, a number of prior {{research studies}} have demonstrated that transverse stiffeners in straight I-girders are loaded predominantly by bending induced by their restraint of web lateral deflections at the shear strength limit state, not by in-plane tension field forces. This is at odds with present Specification approaches for the design of transverse stiffeners, which are based on (1) providing sufficient stiffener bending rigidity only to develop the shear buckling strength of the web and (2) providing sufficient stiffener area to resist the in-plane tension field forces. In this research, the behavior of one- and two-sided <b>intermediate</b> transverse <b>stiffeners</b> in straight and horizontally curved steel I-girders is investigated by refined full nonlinear finite element analysis. Variations in stiffener rigidity, panel aspect ratio, panel slenderness, and stiffener type are considered. New recommendations for design of transverse stiffeners in straight and curved I-girder bridges are developed by combining the solutions from the above FEA studies with the results from prior research.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 34). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goal of the project was to investigate the shear capacity of dapped ended steel plate girders. Dapped girders with no intermediate transverse-stiffeners between the bearing stiffener and the first interior diaphragm were the focus of this project. The motivation for minimizing the number of stiffeners is to reduce cost and fatigue sensitivity of the girder. The finite element method was used to estimate the ultimate shear capacity. A linear eigenvalue analysis was used to estimate the buckling capacity and to find the buckled mode shape. The mode shape was used to generate a mesh with an imperfection used to run a nonlinear Riks analysis. The Riks analysis resulted in estimated capacities that accounted for material properties and large deformations. Buckling capacities were found for three particular cases. However, several computer codes are presented that allow for the analysis to be completed {{for a wide variety of}} dapped girders. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study. First, it is conservative to assume a full height panel for design purposes. Second, dapped girders without <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners</b> can generate substantial shear capacities. Finally, dapped end panels develop post-buckling strength. This post-buckling strength accounts for a large portion of the shear capacity generated in the dapped end panel...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich Plate System (SPS) is a {{sandwich}} construction consisting of steel face sheets and polyurethane core. The main objective for the steel faces is to resist bending and in-plane loads, while the compliant core transfers shear between the faces. One important benefit with sandwich panels is {{the elimination of}} the need for <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> SPS panels are today used in stadium and arena terraces, bridges, ships and as structural flooring. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) is currently developing rules and guidelines for design and installation of SPS in ship newbuildings. To do this it is important to study how the SPS panels behave under a variety of loads such as lateral pressure load, in-plane shear load and in-plane uni-axial compression load. Combinations of these loads are important to study to establish strength criterias for SPS panels. Studying these load combinations is the objective for the current study as a collaboration between the University of Oslo (UiO) and Det Norske Veritas (DNV). In the current study the ultimate capacity of SPS panels under lateral pressure load and in-plane shear load has been studied both separately and in combination. In-plane uni-axial compression load is also included in three-way interactions. Both simply supported and clamped boundary conditions are studied to see the effect of these. Theories that can model the separate load cases are described and compared {{to each other and to}} the finite element results. Some theory for load combinations are reviewed, and a slightly conservative interaction curve for different load combinations on SPS panels is suggested...|$|R
40|$|What differentiates a beam from a plate girder? This {{may seem}} to be a trivial question. However, it is a {{necessary}} and important part of plate girder design when applying the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specification. 1 A beam can be a rolled or a welded shape, but it does not have <b>intermediate</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and its web width-thickness ratio hc/tw must not exceed yfF/ 970, where hc is twice the distance from the neutral axis to the compression flange (Fig. 1). Plate girders have stiffeners or hc/tw is greater than yfF/ 970, or both. Making this distinction and the compactness classification early in plate girder design is important when using the LRFD Specification. The significance of these items {{can be seen in the}} LRFD Manual flowcharts (Figs. 2 and 3) for the determination of flexural and shear design strength. With these flowcharts, this discussion will focus on the design of plate girders according to LRFD rules. An explanation of plate girder design in the LRFD Specification will include: flexural design strength, shear design strength, flexure-shear interaction, bearing strength under concentrated loads and stiffener design. Application of the LRFD method will show there is actually little difference between it and Allowable Stress Design (ASD) 8 of plate girders. FLEXURAL STRENGTH The design flexural strength is calculated to provide an adequate section modulus. The first criterion necessary to separate a beam from a plate girder, yfF/ 970, relates to flexural design strength. Although there are preliminary steps, LRFD Specification Appendix G 2 * gives the flexural capacity for a plate girder, whereas Appendix F 1. 7 is applicable to beams. Entering the flowchart (Fig. 2) with a trial web and flange plate size, the initial step is to determine whether plastic or elastic design is appropriate. Plastic design is permitted if the section is compact and adequate bracing is provided in accordance with Sect. F 1. 1, such that "the laterally unbraced length Lb of the compression flange at plastic hinge locations associated with the failure mechanism " does not excee...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on the structural potential of thin-walled timber structures compared to cold-formed steel and aluminium structures. The paper shows that manufacturing thin-walled timber profiles is possible. The manufacturing process is introduced herein. Specifically, short composite thin-walled timber Cee-sections (500 mm long) were fabricated by gluing together thin softwood (Araucaria cunninghamii) veneers (1 mm thick). Two types of Cee-sections were considered, {{one with an}} <b>intermediate</b> web <b>stiffener</b> to increase the local buckling capacity of the profile and one without. The profiles were tested in compression and the test results are presented and discussed in the paper in terms of structural behaviour and performance. A Finite Element model was also developed. Non-linear geometric analysis was carried out, with assumptions on observed delaminated areas, and the model was found to match the test results with reasonable accuracy. Further research directions are proposed {{in order to provide}} efficient and lightweight sustainable structural products to the construction industry.
