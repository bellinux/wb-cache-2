5|$|The {{mourning}} dove is monogamous and forms strong pair bonds. Pairs typically reconvene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area</b> the following breeding season, and sometimes may remain together throughout the winter. However, lone doves will find new partners if necessary.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area</b> for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E

5|$|Five {{thousand}} people were evacuated to emergency shelters as Winifred neared. With {{the approach of}} the hurricane, watches and warnings were issued.

5|$|Only certain traits may be {{required}} to deceive predators; for example, tests on the sympatry/allopatry border (where the two are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area,</b> and where they are not) of the mimic Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed that color proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, but that the order of the colored rings was not.|$|E

5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area,</b> for example flat horizontal webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in horizontal flight. Web-building spiders have poor vision, but are extremely sensitive to vibrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was also made to bring Freddy's physical appearance {{closer to that}} of an actual burn victim, {{and the use of}} computer-generated imagery was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision. A Nightmare on Elm Street was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming other films <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began {{within the first}} six days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, {{to the extent of}} one of two siblings living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area</b> was likely killed by the other.|$|E
5|$|Although the Industrial Revolution did {{not much}} affect the rural parts of Clwyd, there was {{considerable}} industrial activity in the North Wales Coalfield in the north-east of the county, particularly around Wrexham. The Bersham Ironworks at Bersham, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area,</b> was {{at the forefront of}} technological advances and was most famous for being the original working site of the industrialist John Wilkinson who invented new processes for boring cannons. The Williams-Wynn family of Wynnstay had become rich after the dissolution of the monasteries and owned vast estates in Clwyd with resources including lead, tin and copper as well as corn and timber.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area</b> include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} people from Pakistan have also immigrated to South Africa {{following}} the end of apartheid. They often, but not always, live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>areas</b> as <b>the</b> Indian South Africans.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He could have maintained contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area</b> until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E
5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>area.</b> Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E
50|$|The San Lucan skink occurs only on {{the southernmost}} tip of Baja California, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{mountains}} around La Paz. They tend to nest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>areas</b> as western skinks, and are visibly similar.|$|R
50|$|Three {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} whipbird include: Psophodes nigrogularis oberon found within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>areas</b> as <b>the</b> western whipbird; Psophodes nigrogularis lashmari found on Kangaroo Island; and Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>areas</b> as <b>the</b> main western whipbird.|$|R
50|$|At least 18 species {{included}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Bathypterois. Similar {{species are}} often observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>areas.</b> A 2001 report included observations of Bathypterois dubius {{as far as}} 50Â°N <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Biscay.|$|R
