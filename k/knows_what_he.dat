He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E

500|$|Bart is Prince Hamlet in this Simpsons {{version of}} William Shakespeare's classic. His uncle Claudius (Moe) marries Gertrude (Marge) after killing King Hamlet (Homer) {{by way of}} poison. The King returns to his son as a ghost, telling him of the {{betrayal}} and requesting that his death be avenged. Prince Hamlet (Bart), {{with the help of}} a professional actor (Krusty), puts on a play to make Claudius reveal himself to be guilty; however, Hamlet's reaction leads everyone to believe that he is crazy, so Ophelia (Lisa) decides to [...] "out-crazy" [...] him by prancing around and singing a stupid song, eventually jumping out the window and into the moat where she drowns. Because Hamlet <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, Claudius attempts to kill him. Hamlet, aiming to kill Claudius, accidentally kills Polonius (Chief Wiggum). His son, Laertes (Ralph Wiggum), proposes to duel Prince Hamlet for revenge. As his [...] "practice stab," [...] Laertes kills himself, and Hamlet proceeds to murder Claudius. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Carl and Lenny), meanwhile, have been covered in poison and kill each other with a high five. Hamlet walks away to celebrate, but he slips on some blood and dies. Seeing a big mess she does not want to clean up, Gertrude commits suicide by hitting herself in the head with a mace.|$|E
500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E

500|$|The Times {{newspaper}} {{gave the}} film a generally favourable assessment: its critic wrote, [...] "Mr. Val Guest, the director, certainly knows his business {{when it comes}} to providing the more horrid brand of thrills... The first part of this particular film is well up to standard. Mr. Brian Donlevy, as the American scientist responsible for the experiment, is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly a man who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing. Mr. Jack Warner, representing Scotland Yard, is indeed a comfort to have at hand when Things are on the rampage." [...] Positive reviews also came from Peter Burnup in the News of the World, who found that [...] "with the added benefit of bluff, boisterous Brian Donlevy… all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it" [...] while the reviewer in The Manchester Guardian praised [...] "a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual" [...] and Today's Cinema called it [...] "one of the best essays in science fiction to date" [...] Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews. For instance, Paul Dehn in the News Chronicle said, [...] "This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War. How jolly that it is also British!". Similarly, William Whitebait in the New Statesman, who found the film to be [...] "better than either War of the Worlds or Them!", also called for [...] "a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I have spoken to Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment on my part, he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has to do and what he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and decides what is best for him.

500|$|The band {{arrived at}} Pachyderm Studio without their {{equipment}} and {{spent much of}} the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail. [...] However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly. [...] On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued work through midnight. [...] Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band. [...] The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like [...] "Very Ape" [...] and [...] "tourette's", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural reverb. [...] Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones. [...] Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals. [...] The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape. [...] Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes. [...] He said, [...] "Generally speaking, [...] <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks is acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...] He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable." [...] Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours. [...] The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard [...] "was supposedly this sexist jerk", but called the process [...] "the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down". [...] The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain. [...] The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones. It's like he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> needs to do but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them." [...] Additionally, DC began focusing on films [...] "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" [...] DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the Joker.|$|E

It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. Because he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman." [...] Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot deal with all that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. [...] Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot point was to have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, [...] "Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all your words in, believe me." [...] Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former [...] "off the hook" [...] for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. [...] "She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women.
