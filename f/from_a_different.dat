5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East.

McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but {{recorded by the}} camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Assaf's other son <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> wife, Qa'itbay, {{sought to}} usurp power from his brothers. In the ensuing power struggle, Qa'itbay {{was forced to}} flee and {{received}} refuge in Choueifat, before relocating to Beirut; there, he accrued funds to bribe the governor of Damascus, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, to replace Hasan as the tax farmer of Keserwan. Hasan and Husayn sought to reconcile with their half-brother, but as they entered Beirut, they were killed in an ambush ordered by Qa'itbay. In his subsequent assertion of control over Keserwan, Jbeil and Beirut, Qa'itbay was backed by Janbirdi al-Ghazali, the ex-Mamluk Ottoman governor of Damascus Eyalet. Despite al-Ghazali's revolt against the Ottomans and its subsequent suppression in 1521, the authorities did not punish Qa'itbay for his alliance with al-Ghazali. However, the death of al-Ghazali represented {{the loss of a}} major political patron of the emir.|$|E

[...] They also created the story to be different from Diamond and Pearl, commenting that they wanted to make Giratina seem [...] "more fun, more interesting, cooler." [...] They added Giratina's new area to make the story [...] "more appealing". While Diamond and Pearl had gym leaders who sometimes had Pokémon not in keeping with the type they focus on, Platinum changes this so all Pokémon belonging to gym leaders were the appropriate type.|$|R

5|$|Beauchamp was {{admitted}} to the bar in April 1823. He and Anna Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green.

When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace.

5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed it in the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
