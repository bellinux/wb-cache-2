40|$|Omorgus suberosus (Fabricius, 1775) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential predator of the eggs of the turtle Lepidochelys olivacea (Eschscholtz, 1829) on one of the main turtle nesting beaches in the world, La <b>Escobilla</b> in Oaxaca, Mexico. This study presents an analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of the beetle on this beach (in areas of high and low density of L. olivacea nests over two arrival seasons) and an evaluation, under laboratory conditions, of the probability of damage to the turtle eggs by this beetle. O. suberosus adults and larvae exhibited an aggregated pattern at both turtle nest densities; however, aggregation was greater in areas of low nest density, where we found the highest proportion of damaged eggs. Also, there were fluctuations in the temporal distribution of the adult beetles following the arrival of the turtles on the beach. Under laboratory conditions, the beetles quickly damaged both dead eggs and a mixture of live and dead eggs, but were found to consume live eggs more slowly. This suggests that O. suberosus may be recycling organic material; however, its consumption of live eggs may be sufficient in some cases to interrupt the incubation period of the turtle. We intend to apply these results when making decisions regarding the L. olivacea nests on La <b>Escobilla</b> Beach, {{one of the most important}} sites for the conservation of this species...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Olive ridley {{sea turtles}} (Lepidochelys olivacea) present an {{interesting}} {{case study of}} the conservation of wildlife species that aggregate in high densities and have served as resources for human consumption. Ridleys exhibit synchronized mass-nesting behavior, during events called "arribadas," where thousands of females lay eggs together in a small area over the span of a few consecutive nights. Some of the largest arribadas occur at La <b>Escobilla,</b> Mexico, with over a million nests estimated per season. These aggregations have made olive ridleys vulnerable to negative impacts from harvest and density-dependent influences on nest success. There are many interconnected determinants of nest success, including intraspecific competition for space, temperature, and predation. Nest destruction by conspecifics is an apparent potential impact of high density nesting, as later-arriving turtles often dig up previously laid nests. Nest destruction is the main scientific argument for "sustainable" egg harvest, since local communities could utilize eggs otherwise destroyed as an economic resource. In 2009 at La <b>Escobilla,</b> I explored 1) the historical context of harvest and community members' current perceptions of turtles through 12 semi-structured interviews with key informants; 2) nest destruction rates during arribadas through a field study to quantify nesting behavior. My first objective {{was to understand the}} shifting human-turtle relationship and how it informs current community dynamics and future conservation and research at arribada beaches. Historical research and interviews indicated that many local residents are familiar with turtle behavior and agree on the importance of conservation efforts for turtles and the local community. Nevertheless, residents struggle for economic stability within what has largely been an externally-imposed protectionist framework. Future efforts should integrate long-term employment with local involvement in research, conservation, and non-consumptive use. The second objective of my project was to quantify nesting activity and investigate the relationship between nest densities and nest destruction. Nesting behavior of 1293 turtles was observed in 26 sample plots during two consecutive arribadas. Cumulative nest densities estimated over two arribadas ranged from around 1 to 8 nests/m².

40|$|Chemical ecology {{comprises}} {{the study of}} interactions of organisms with their environment that are mediated by the chemicals they produced. In general, chemicals that mediate interactions between organisms are called semiochemicals. Semiochemicals are divided into two major groups {{depending on whether the}} interactions are intraspecific (pheromones) or interspecific (allelochemics). The development of chemical ecology has been stimulated by the interest in knowing the details of the chemical interactions between organisms and the benefit of exploring new semiochemicals. In recent years, studies of chemical ecology have contributed to the conservation of biodiversity, demonstrating how valuable this can be in many ways. In the present context, chemical ecology studies open up a field of knowledge for the conservation of the olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), specie in danger of extinction. This study provides a powerful basis {{for the development of a}} new control method for reducing the impact of the beetle Omorgus soberosus Fabricius (Coleoptera: Trogidae), which significantly affects the survival of eggs of L. olivacea on Santuario La <b>Escobilla</b> Beach in Oaxaca, Mexico...|$|E
40|$|By {{the late}} 1980 s, {{ecotourism}} became officially recognised as a sustainable development strategy, {{and a way}} {{to improve the quality of}} life of marginalised communities. Yet today it is still a field of contested discourses and paradigms, especially in developing countries, where environmental legislation is still often ambiguous and not powerful enough to ensure enforcement of the outcomes of planning and assessment instruments. It has been argued that impact assessment procedures are not only meant to identify potential impacts of a proposed development, but should endorse responsible environmental management practices, and active community involvement in the decision-making process. This study compares the theory and practice behind ecotourism assessment and management of the La <b>Escobilla</b> Turtle Sanctuary and the Xixim Ecolodge through the analysis of initial project impact assessments, semi-structured interviews with representatives of different sectors of Mexican society, and a survey of tour operators. It aims to determine whether or not current Mexican environmental legislation for assessment procedures is providing an adequate framework for the adoption of sustainable tourism practices. It is argued that impact assessment procedures often poorly incorporate social and cultural variables, and hence fail to acknowledge tour operators 2 ̆ 7 management and operation skills, and therefore decrease the quality of impact prediction and monitoring strategies for future ecotourism management...|$|E

40|$|The beetle Omorgus suberosus (F.) is a facultative {{predator}} of eggs of {{the olive}} ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea (Eschscholtz). Laboratory and field investigations were conducted in order to characterize volatile attractants of O. suberosus and to explore the potential for application of these volatiles in a selective mass trapping method. Headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE) coupled to thermo-desorption gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) analysis of the volatile constituents from beetles or turtle nests revealed 24 potential compounds. However, electroantennographic (EAG) measurements revealed antennal sensitivity only to indole, linoleic acid, trimethylamine, dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide and ammonia. Behavioural tests showed that these compounds are highly attractive to O. suberosus. Field trapping experiments revealed that indole and ammonia were more attractive than the other volatile compounds and showed similar attractiveness to that produced by conventional baits (chicken feathers). The use of a combined bait of indole and NH 3 would therefore {{be the most effective}} trap design. The data presented are the first to demonstrate effective massive capture of O. suberosus using an attractant-based trapping method.
