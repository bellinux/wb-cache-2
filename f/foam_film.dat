In pure water, {{it was not}} possible to produce <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> due to weak film elasticity and the strong attractive hydrophobic force in <b>foam</b> <b>films,</b> despite the presence of strong repulsive double-layer force. In the presence of a very small amount of an electrolyte, however, the hydrophobic force was dampened, allowing metastable <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> to form. As the NaCl concentration was raised above 10 - 6 M, the film stability diminished as a result of double-layer compression. The TFPB technique was also used to measure the equilibrium film thicknesses (He) in 10 - 5 M NaCl solutions of varying pH; He reached a maximum of approximately 130 nm at pH 6. 0 - 7. 3, and decreased on either side of this pH range as a result of the increased ionic strength caused by the HC 1 and NaOH added to control the pH.

In the present work, we studied a cyclic alcohol, methyl cyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) with a high flash point (approximately 110  °C) and compared its coal flotation performance with that of MIBC. A bottom-driven mechanical flotation cell and two coking coals of distinct floatability, namely A and B, were used. Collectorless flotation tests were carried out with process water for coal A.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between lipid bilayers in {{water has been}} intensively studied over the last decades. Osmotic stress was applied to evaluate the forces between two approaching lipid bilayers in aqueous solution. The force–distance relation between lipid mono- or bilayers deposited on mica sheets using a surface force apparatus (SFA) was also measured. Lipid stabilised <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> offer another possibility to study the interactions between lipid monolayers. These films can be prepared comparatively easy with very good reproducibility. <b>Foam</b> <b>films</b> consist usually of two adsorbed surfactant monolayers separated by a layer of the aqueous solution from which the film is created. Their thickness can be conveniently measured using microinterferometric techniques. Studies with <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> deliver valuable information on the interactions between lipid membranes and especially their stability and permeability. Presenting inverse black lipid membrane (BLM) <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> supply information about {{the properties of the}} lipid self-organisation in bilayers. The present paper summarises results on microscopic lipid stabilised <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> by measuring their thickness and contact angle. Most of the presented results concern <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> prepared from dispersions of the zwitterionic lipid 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphorylcholine (DMPC) and some of its mixtures with the anionic lipid — 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -[phospho-rac-(1 -glycerol) ] (DMPG). The strength of the long range and short range forces between the lipid layers is discussed. The van der Waals attractive force is calculated. The electrostatic repulsive force is estimated from experiments at different electrolyte concentrations (NaCl, CaCl 2) or by modification of the electrostatic double layer surface potential by incorporating charged lipids in the lipid monolayers. The short range interactions are studied and modified by using small carbohydrates (fructose and sucrose), ethanol (EtOH) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Some results are compared with the structure of lipid monolayers deposited at the liquid/air interface (monolayers spread in Langmuir trough), which are one of most studied biomembrane model system.

40|$|Antifoams {{are widely}} used {{for control of the}} foam {{stability}} in various products (detergents, paints, pharmaceuticals, and many others). A significant progress in the understanding of the foam destruction mechanisms by oil-containing antifoams has been achieved recently. Experiments with antifoams comprising silicone oil and hydrophobic silica showed that the antifoam entities (emulsified globules or lenses floating on the solution surface) easily form unstable oil bridges between the two surfaces of the <b>foam</b> <b>film.</b> These bridges rapidly stretch in radial direction, due to uncompensated capillary pressures at the oil-water and oil-air interfaces, and eventually rupture the foam films. As a result, the foam is destroyed within several seconds by the mixed solid-liquid antifoams. In contrast, drops of silicone oil deprived of silica are unable to enter the <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> surface due to significant entry barriers. In these systems, the oil drops are expelled into the neighbouring Plateau borders (PBs), and the foam collapse is observed at a much later stage of the foam evolution, when the drops are compressed by the walls of the narrowing PBs (defoaming time on the order of minutes and hours). The magnitude of the entry barriers can be quantified by the so called Film Trappin...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{scientific}} research on foam films, traditionally known as soap films, dates back to {{as early as the}} late 17 th century when Boyle and Hooke paid special attention to the colours of soap bubbles. Their inspiration was transferred to Newton, who began systematic study of the science of foam films. Over the next centuries, a number of scientists dealt with the open questions of the drainage, stability and thickness of foam films. The significant contributions of Plateau and Gibbs in the middle/late 19 th century are particularly recognized. After the “colours” method of Newton, Reinold and Rücker as well as Johhonnot developed optical methods for measuring the thickness of the thinner “non-colour” films (first order black) that are still in use today. At the beginning of the 20 th century, various aspects of the <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> science were elucidated by the works of Dewar and Perrin and later by Mysels. Undoubtedly, the introduction of the disjoining pressure by Derjaguin and the manifestation of the DLVO theory in describing the film stability are considered as milestones in the theoretical development of foam films. The study of foam films gained momentum with the introduction of the microscopic <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> methodology by Scheludko and Exerowa, which is widely used today.

The surface tension kinetics of the dispersions were studied {{in order to}} ensure equilibration of the <b>foam</b> <b>films.</b> These measurements showed that the rate of surface coverage depends slightly on the temperature and does not reach equilibrium values within reasonable time intervals for the dispersions containing only one amphiphile (DPPE-PEG- 2000). The destruction of the vesicles at the air/(aqueous dispersion) interface was much faster for the dispersions containing DMPC/DPPE-PEG- 2000 mixtures above 23 °C, the temperature of the chain-melting phase transition of the main lipid component (DMPC). The dependence of the equilibrium thickness of the <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> on the electrolyte concentration was measured for 1 and 9 mol% DPPE-PEG- 2000 at 28 °C in the range 10 − 3 to 0. 5 M NaCl.

The results were analyzed in view of the Reynolds equation to determine the role of surface forces in film thinning. It was found that film thinning is controlled by surface forces at thicknesses below approximately 200 nm. It was found also that hydrophobic force plays an important role particularly at low SDS and NaCl concentrations. The values of the hydrophobic force constant (K- 232) estimated from the film thinning experiments were used to predict the disjoining pressure isotherms using the extended DLVO theory, which were found to be in excellent agreement with experiment. The TFPB technique was also used to measure the equilibrium thicknesses (H-e) of the <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> stabilized by a non-ionic surfactant, n-octanol, in the presence of NaCl.

40|$|Raw coal is {{typically}} subjected to beneficiation processes to remove mineral matter before being sold to market. The coal industry wants to improve combustible recovery, reduce beneficiation unit costs, and attain efficiency optimization, especially for fines and ultrafines. A key beneficiation method for fine and ultrafine coals is froth flotation, where frothing reagent {{is used to}} generate and stabilize air bubbles that capture and carry hydrophobic particles. Use of frothing reagent constitutes {{the main part of}} the flotation operation cost. A widely used frothing reagent is an aliphatic alcohol, methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), but it has safety concern owing to its low flash point (approximately 40 degreesC). There is a pressing need for seeking a safer and cheaper frother. In the present work, we studied a cyclic alcohol, methyl cyclohexamethanol (MCHM) with a high flash point and compared its flotation performance with that of MIBC. The flotation tests were carried out using simulated process water. The results showed that MCHM was a more effective coal flotation frother than MIBC. Comparative studies of froth, foam, and thin <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> stabilities with these two frothers were undertaken to understand the observed difference in coal flotation performance. The results showed that MCHM generated more stable froth than MIBC. However, at a given concentration, both frothers gave almost equal foam stability and <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> stability.

40|$|The {{influence}} of counterions and co-ions on {{the stability and}} thickness of <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> stabilized by anionic dodecyl sulfate (DS(-)) has been studied in a thin film pressure balance. Particularly, {{the effect on the}} properties of <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> of (i) the counterions Li(+), Na(+), and Cs(+) of DS(-) and (ii) monovalent inorganic salts added to sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions is considered. Generally, addition of salt improved the stability of the <b>foam</b> <b>films.</b> As a second order, an increasing ionic size led to an increased adsorption, which in the case of cations gave thinner and less stable films {{and in the case of}} anions led to thicker and more stable films. Hence, an effect of anions was observed though the film surfaces were already negatively charged by the anionic DS(-), leading to the conclusion that adsorption of anions to the film surface is governed by ion specific rather than electrostatic interactions. At a fixed surfactant and varying salt concentration, a maximum in film thickness could be identified at a salt concentration well below the surfactant concentration.

40|$|Drainage of a mobile, symmetric, plane-parallel thin {{liquid film}} between two gas bubbles (<b>foam</b> <b>film)</b> is studied. An {{analytical}} {{solution for the}} rate of thinning of such a liquid film with an insoluble surfactant and having both film elasticity and surface viscosity is presented for the first time. Analysis is extended to the more general case of a soluble surfactant and compared with previous analyses. Surfactant material parameters affecting the rate of thinning are identified and grouped into a single dimensionless parameter, the surfactant number which describes {{the transition from a}} mobile to an immobile film. Significant deviation from the Reynolds velocity is found when this dimensionless parameter is small. Since draining foam or emulsion films are generally of nonuniform thickness with a thick region or 'dimple' as the central part and separated from the Plateau border by a thinner 'barrier ring', an analytical solution is not possible. Hence a numerical model was developed. This model simulates the hydrodynamics associated with the drainage of an axisymmetric, dimpled, mobile <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> with an insoluble surfactant. This extends the work of Joye (1994) which was limited to immobile films. Results of the parametric study indicate that the rate of drainage of these films is dependent on surfactant properties viz. elasticity, surface dilatational viscosity, surface shear viscosity and surface diffusivity. These properties are grouped into a single dimensionless parameter which is the same as obtained by our analytical solution for a plane parallel film and which correlates with the rate of drainage of the <b>foam</b> <b>film.</b> This parameter describes the transition from a mobile film to an immobile film. The simulations indicate considerable motion of the interface for draining mobile foam films. Foam texture in a porous medium is governed by the hydrodynamics of individual foam films (lamellae) flowing through pores of varying size. The stability of foam in a particular application depends upon the stability of a lamella in the porous medium, especially as the lamella expands in translating from a small pore (pore throat) to a larger pore (pore body). The numerical simulator developed above is extended to translating foam films to model the effect of various parameters on foam stability. The model predicts that the travelling lamella is unstable only for certain ranges of surfactant properties, porous media geometry and flow conditions, for e. g. gas flow rate and capillary pressure. Simulations show that mobile foam films stretch in going from a pore throat to a pore body and may thin down to the critical thickness and break, under certain conditions. In contrast immobile foam films are very stable due to an entrainment effect which occurs as the film expands in going from a pore throat to a pore body. The critical capillary pressure at which a moving lamella will break is determined as a function of film and porous medium properties. Further the concept of asymmetric drainage of foam films in porous media has been explored...|$|E

40|$|Shear induced {{drainage}} of a foamy {{yield stress}} fluid is investigated using MRI techniques. Whereas the yield stress of the interstitial fluid stabilizes the system at rest, a fast drainage is observed when a horizontal shear is imposed. It is shown that the sheared interstitial material behaves as a viscous fluid {{in the direction of}} gravity, the effective viscosity of which is controlled by shear in transient <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> between bubbles. Results provided for several bubble sizes are not captured by the R^ 2 scaling classically observed for liquid flow in particulate systems, such as foams and thus constitute a remarkable demonstration of the strong coupling of drainage flow and shear induced interstitial flow. Furthermore, <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> are found to be responsible for the unexpected arrest of drainage, thus trapping irreversibly a significant amount of interstitial liquid.

30|$|Foam {{injection}} in {{oil reservoir}} was first proposed by Bond and Holbrook and reported by Bernard and Holm in 1965 (Boud and Holbrook 1958; Bernard and Jacobs 1965). Foam {{is defined as}} a dispersed system consisting of bubbles that are separated by <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> and plateau boarders (Karakashev and Grozdanova 2012). In porous media, foam surfactants are used in near wellbore flow treatments such as foam–acid matrix stimulation and plugging of unwanted phases (Chang et al. 2002; Wassmuth et al. 2004), in fractured fluids (Blauer and Kohlhaas 1974; Wheeler 2010), in shallow subsurface environmental remediation (Hirasaki et al. 1997; Mamun et al. 2002; Hirasaki 1989) and in EOR processes to control the gas mobility and overcome in situ permeability variations (Blaker et al. 2002). This method can be applied by simultaneously injecting gas and surfactant solution or alternating gas with brine-added surfactant solution (Dholkawala et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{insightful}} {{discussion on the}} implications of foam transport inside porous media based on an improved algorithm for the estimation of model parameters. A widely used texture-implicit local-equilibrium foam model, STARS, is {{used to describe the}} reduction of gas mobility in the state of foam with respect to free gas. Both the dry-out effect and shear-dependent rheology are considered in foam simulations. We estimate the limiting capillary pressure Pc* from fmdryvalues in the STARS model to characterize <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> stability in a dynamic flowing system. We find that Pc* is a good indicator of foam strength in porous media and varies with different gas types. We also calculate Pc* for different foaming surfactants and find that foam stability is correlated with the Gibbs surface excess concentration. We compare our improved parameter estimation algorithm with others reported in literature. The robustness of the algorithm is validated for various foam systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{introduced}} for the spreading of an isolated viscous <b>foam</b> <b>film</b> over a deep viscous fluid pool. The {{effects of the}} bubbles rising in the foam are neglected, but the O(1) alteration to the density and viscosity of the foam due to the bubbles are accounted for. It is assumed that the foam phase is well modelled by the Stokes-flow equations. By exploiting the slenderness of the spreading layer, asymptotic techniques are used to analyse the flow in the foam. It is shown that in this regime the dominant horizontal force balance is between the hydrostatic pressure and the tangential stress induced in the layer by the underlying pool. Boundary-integral techniques are {{used to determine the}} form of the flow in the pool and from this an expression for the evolution of the spreading foam is given analytically. In this parameter regime it is found that this expression does not depend upon the viscosity of the foa...|$|E
40|$|Determination of the {{thickness}} of emulsion films by using the film interferometric images is usually less accurate than that of <b>foam</b> <b>films,</b> due to the close values of the refractive indices of the liquid film and adjacent liquid phases (hence, low contrast and high level of noise at high magnification). A new technique was developed to improve {{the thickness}} determination by obtaining the interferometric images without directly filtering the illuminating light, as is usually done in the classical Scheludko interferometric technique. The new method then uses digital filtration during the off-line image post-processing to obtain monochromatic interferometric images required for the thickness determination. The technique was tested with <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> stabilised by sodium dodecyl sulfate and successfully applied to determine thickness of toluene–water–toluene emulsion films using the green and red digital filters. Results for emulsion film thickness determined by either the green or red digital filtration are comparable, thus validating the new technique developed here for emulsion films...|$|R
40|$|The {{thin film}} {{pressure}} balance (TFPB) technique {{was used to}} determine the surface forces in <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> stabilized with flotation frothers such as n-pentanol, n-octanol, methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), and polypropylene glycol (PPG). The results were compared with the foam stabilities measured experimentally and the film elasticities calculated using a model developed by Wang and Yoon [Wang, L., Yoon, R. -H., 2006 a. Role of hydrophobic force in the thinning of <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> containing a nonionic surfactant. Colloids Surfaces A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects, 282 – 283, 84 – 91. ]. It was found that foam stabilities are controlled by both film elasticity and disjoining pressure, the relative contributions from each changing with frother type and concentration. At relatively low concentrations, frother dampens the hydrophobic force, an attractive component of the disjoining pressure, that destabilizes foams. At higher concentrations, elasticity plays a more important role in stabilizing foams. Copyright © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{control of the}} {{stability}} of ionic surfactant (tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> {{by the addition of}} oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. In the two cases of low and high polyelectrolyte concentrations, a common black film is formed. This is due to an electrostatic repulsion (in the latter case, according to the hitherto assumption) caused by a charge reversal at film surfaces at high polyelectrolyte concentration. But what happens around the nominal isoelectric point (IEP), where the net charge of the whole film is close to zero? Is a Newton black film formed or does the film break? Disjoining pressure isotherms show a strong reduction in stability close to the IEP. The comparison between surface tension and elasticity measurements and disjoining pressure isotherms leads to a surprising conclusion: The stability of <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> seems not to be dominated by the net charge of the polyelectrolyte/surfactant complexes at the surface, which was the former hypothesis, but by the overall net charge of the film...|$|R
