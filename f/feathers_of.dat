5|$|Longrich's {{conclusions}} {{were supported}} {{in a paper}} first published online in the journal Nature in January 2010. Fucheng Zhang and colleagues examined the fossilized <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> several dinosaurs and early birds, and found evidence that they preserved melanosomes, the cells that give the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> modern birds their colour. Among the specimens studied was a previously undescribed specimen of Sinosauropteryx, IVPPV14202. By examining melanosome structure and distribution, Zhang and colleagues were able to confirm the presence {{of light and dark}} bands of colour in the tail <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> Sinosauropteryx. Furthermore, the team was able to compare melanosome types to those of modern birds to determine a general range of colour. From the presence of phaeomelanosomes, spherical melanosomes that make and store red pigment, they concluded that the darker <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> Sinosauropteryx were chestnut or reddish brown in colour. More research on the coloration of Sinosauropteryx reveals that it had a raccoon-like bandit mask and countershading patterns most likely associated with an open habitat, indicating that the Jehol likely had a range of habitat types.|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E

5|$|The <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical. This {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as evidence {{that it was a}} flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> Archaeopteryx fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in Archaeopteryx is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.|$|E

5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{are similar in}} appearance. Juvenile birds are {{slightly}} browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the wings and back. Juveniles have a duller, less streaked appearance than adults. Juveniles moult into adult plumage at around one year old. There is no seasonal difference in the plumage of breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|T. m. achrusterus breeds from {{southern}} Oklahoma east to Maryland and western Virginia and south to northern Florida and the Gulf states.

5|$|Tail <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the extinct huia {{are very}} rare {{and they have}} become a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for NZ$8,000, {{much higher than the}} $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most {{expensive}} feather ever. The previous record price for a single feather was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a bald eagle feather at auction in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The red wattlebird begins {{moulting}} {{after the}} breeding season, {{starting with the}} primary flight feathers in November or December and finishing between the following March and May. The <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the breast, back, median and lesser covert feathers are moulted before those of the crown, remiges and retrices.|$|E
5|$|There {{are often}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers are grown at once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> adults, which are moulted {{over a longer period}} of time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, {{cementing}} their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E

5|$|If {{the green}} parrots Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may {{explain some of the}} discrepancies. The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of Psittacula species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.|$|E
5|$|More specifically, the {{nominate}} subspecies has a grey forehead, crown, nape, ear-coverts {{and throat}} {{with the face}} a darker grey-black. The <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the throat are longer, giving rise to hackles there. The upperparts and underparts are a brownish-grey and become more brown with age. Towards the belly, the feathers are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have white edges which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
