Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E
500|$|Munroe {{stated in}} terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but {{eventually}} <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart. When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could do really well, but we wanted to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!" [...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book. Karai was one of Munroe's favoriite characters from the comics and he [...] "was the one who really pushed for Karai" [...] to appear in the film. TMNT co-creator Peter Laird stated it takes place in its own universe separate from the previous films. However, director Munroe says the film exists in the same continuity as the other films, which was supported by the memento wall {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1990 interview, Page {{said that}} the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill. One of the primary reasons for the short {{recording}} time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin's tour of Scandinavia in September 1968. As Page explained, [...] " [...] had begun developing the arrangements on the Scandinavian tour and I knew what sound I was looking for. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> together incredibly quickly." ...|$|E

[...] Despite concerns over the song's drug references, the key lyric [...] "they trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night" [...] was kept for the final version. Elsewhere for [...] "Sloop John B", Wilson's lyric change from [...] "this is the worst trip since I've been born" [...] to [...] "this is the worst trip I've ever been on" [...] has also been suggested to be another subtle nod to acid culture.|$|E

All the evidence shows there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It's called The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> out, 2006, from Oxford University Press. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact — or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous." ...|$|E

2500|$|Negotiations for the writer's return {{came to an}} end {{after the}} {{publication}} of his Memoirs (Воспоминания, 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life.

I wouldn't have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather Noah. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime". Reportedly, the infamous Zhdanov decree {{was one of the reasons}} for Bunin's change of mind. On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: [...] "I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: how your book was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!'
