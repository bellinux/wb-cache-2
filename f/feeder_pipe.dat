40|$|Abstract: The {{primary heat}} {{transport}} system {{of a typical}} CANDU®- 6 nuclear power reactor contains 760 <b>feeder</b> <b>pipes.</b> These <b>feeders</b> carry the coolant between the inlet or outlet headers and the individual fuel channels. Inspection requirements that developed in feeders in the 1990 ’s led to rapid development of NDE technology to evaluate feeder integrity. The NDE technology {{had to deal with}} the complex and variable geometry of feeders and access constraints inherent in feeder inspections. The first feeder inspection requirement was ability to detect Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC). This led to an evolution in wall thickness measurement techniques for feeders that is continuing. The leading edge technique for wall thickness measurement is the METAR Crawler that scans feeder bends with 14 wall thickness probes. This system uses motors to push the bracelet along the feeder bend. Second, cracking was detected in a feeder in 1997. This led to development of a specialized, manual inspection technique to deal with access problems. This technique has been extended to use a Hydro Quebec developed drive system to move the probes over a raster scan. The presentation will explain feeder degradation modes and the NDE developed to evaluate feeder integrity.

40|$|Cold bending, warm bending (bending {{with local}} heating) and {{induction}} bending are three manufacturing processes widely {{used to produce}} pipe bends. The cold and warm bending processes {{have been used for}} the fabrication of carbon steel feeder bends for CANDU® 1 reactors, and the induction bending process was considered for the fabrication of stainless steel <b>feeder</b> <b>pipes</b> for an advanced CANDU reactor. Bending processes result in plastic deformation, and inevitably, introduce residual stresses in the deformed pipes. Residual stresses in feeder bends are believed to be a very important contributing factor in feeder cracking. Different bending processes result in widely different residual stress patterns and magnitudes in pipe bends. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} the effect of bending processes and the process parameters used on the residual stress distribution in the bent pipes. Numerical models have been successfully developed to predict the residual stresses and the deformed shapes induced by cold, warm and induction bending processes. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the predicted residual stress distributions, ovality and wall-thickness variations of the cold, warm and induction bends. The predicted results were compared to earlier measurements of spare CANDU feeder bends and test bends. Advantages and disadvantages of the three bending processes are summarized. Numerical approaches for the modeling of residual stresses could be of benefit to engineering estimates of residual stresses in <b>feeder</b> <b>pipes</b> for safety evaluation of nuclear reactors. 1 CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium) is a registered trademark of Atomi...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Bulk {{water supply}} systems are usually {{designed}} according to deterministic design guidelines. In South Africa, design guidelines specify that a bulk storage reservoir {{should have a}} storage capacity of 48 hours of annual average daily demand (AADD), and the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> a capacity of 1. 5 times AADD (CSIR, 2000). Nel & Haarhoff (1996) proposed a stochastic analysis method that allowed the reliability of a reservoir to be estimated based on a Monte Carlo analysis of consumer demand, fire water demand and pipe failures. Van Zyl et al. (2008) developed this method further and proposed a design criterion of one failure in ten years under seasonal peak conditions. In this study, a method for the optimal design of bulk water supply systems is proposed with the design variables being {{the configuration of the}} <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> system, the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> diameters (i. e. capacity), {{and the size of the}} bulk storage reservoir. The stochastic analysis method is applied to determine a trade-off curve between system cost and reliability, from which the designer can select a suitable solution. Optimisation of the bulk system was performed using the multi-objective genetic algorithm, NSGA-II. As Monte Carlo sampling can be computationally expensive, especially when large numbers of simulations are required in an optimisation exercise, a compression heuristic was implemented and refined to reduce the computational effort required of the stochastic simulation. Use of the compression heuristic instead of full Monte Carlo simulation in the reliability analysis achieved computational time savings of around 75 % for the optimisation of a typical system. Application of the optimisation model showed that it was able to successfully produce a set of Pareto-optimal solutions ranging from low reliability, low cost solutions to high reliability, high cost solutions. The proposed method was first applied to a typical system, resulting in an optimal reservoir size of approximately 22 h AADD and <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> capacity of 2 times AADD. This solution achieved 9 % savings in total system cost compared to the South African design guidelines. In addition, the optimal solution proved to have better reliability that one designed according to South African guidelines. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated the effects of changing various system and stochastic parameters from typical to low and high values. The sensitivity results revealed that the length of the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> system has the greatest impact on both the cost and reliability of the bulk system. It was also found that a single <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> is optimal in most cases, and that parallel feeder pipes are only optimal for short <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> lengths. The optimisation model is capable of narrowing down the search region to a handful of possible design solutions, and can thus be used by the engineer as a tool to assist with the design of the final system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn case of KAPS and KGS, {{different}} ingots {{were used}} for manufacturing the coolant channels. Due to difference in the creep related material properties of different ingots, the coolant channels in these reactors experienced different creep rate. Due to the differential creep rates, especially in the neighboring channels, the coolant channels {{came into contact with}} each other. This is a serious deviation from as installed conditions wherein the gaps and spacing between closely assembled coolant channel components are decided based on accurate assessment of known loads and forces. Differential creep results in closing of gaps between neighboring feeder pipes or between <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> and gray-loc clamp. Depending on the orientation of the clamp and direction of the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> at that location, worst contact could be between the first elbow of <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> and the sharp edge of the crown nut on clamp. Several such contacts have been detected in KAPS and KGS. Seriousness of the contact emerges {{from the fact that the}} coolant channel and the feeder pipes vibrate due to coolant flow with high velocity. With time the contact conditions like the contact force and location(s) of contact change and this has significant influence on the life and performance of the coolant channel as a whole. Since feeder pipes are constantly vibrating, the contacting locations are likely to be dented or damaged. Whenever and wherever possible, NPCIL has tried to remove the contact locally. Since the process of creep is ongoing, more and more feeder pipes are likely to come in contact and those in which the local corrections for removing the contact are made could also need correction as the time progresses. In order to assess the severity of damage, a full scale setup was erected. Contact was established between <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> and the hard locking nut of gray-loc clamp. Based on previous vibration data collected from feeder pipes and end fittings, and the ASME‘s O&M guidelines on acceptable level of piping vibration in nuclear piping, vibration was induced in the contacting feeder pipes. The test was continued for more than 1007 cycles. On the basis of damage seen on the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> due to contact, R 6 method has been employed to determine the critical crack size in the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> with a postulated axial part-through semi-elliptical crack. The failure assessment diagram was constructed in the K-L plane. The lowest critical crack depth was calculated as 4. 67 mm as against observed depth of dent of 1. 1 mm.

40|$|During {{operation}} under flow accelerated corrosion (FAC) favourable conditions, CANDU outlet <b>feeder</b> <b>pipes</b> experience {{general and}} local wall thinning. The wall thickness of such feeders is monitored {{as part of}} the life cycle management plans developed and used by the utilities.

50|$|The {{start and}} {{lift-off}} went well. At T+90 seconds, a programmed shutdown {{of the core}} propulsion system (the six center engines) was performed to reduce structural stress on the booster. Because of excessive dynamic loads caused by a hydraulic shock wave when the six engines were shut down abruptly, lines for feeding fuel and oxidizer to the core propulsion system burst and a fire started in the boattail of the booster, in addition the #4 engine exploded. The first stage broke up starting at T+107 seconds and all telemetry data ceased at T+110 seconds. The launch escape system activated and pulled the Soyuz 7K-LOK to safety. The upper stages were ejected from the stack and crashed into the steppe. An investigation revealed that the abrupt shutdown of the engines led to fluctuations in the fluid columns of the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipes</b> which ruptured and spilled fuel and oxidizer onto the shut down, but still hot, engines. A failure of the #4 engine turbopump was also suspected.

The common GPS-gravity profile traverses the summit area of Mt Etna, between the summit craters (about 3000 m) and the northernmost {{tip of the}} eruptive fractures (2500 m). Displacements (up to 2 m in both the horizontal and vertical directions) and gravity variations (up to 350 μGal, after having removed the effect of elevation changes) observed during this period are among the largest ever recorded at Etna.

40|$|The {{project area}} is {{situated}} within the Tugela Valley, {{located in the}} Northern Marginal Zone of the Natal Structural and Metamorphic Province, and this work outlines the different styles of gold mineralization found in the Tugela Valley. Two different styles have been recognized and both have economic significance:- 1) Epigenetic shear zone-hosted gold occurs in late-stage relatively undeformed thin quartz veins confined to shear zones, and is present in both the greenschist facies Natal Thrust Belt and the amphibolite facies Natal Nappe Complex. However {{the vast majority of}} these occurrences are concentrated within the thrust front (i. e. the Natal Thrust Belt). The gold grades (up to 7 g/t) and the hydrothermal alteration assemblages associated with the epigenetic deposits have been documented. 2) An as yet unrecognized occurrence of syngenetic gold mineralization is found associated with the sediment-hosted exhalative massive, to semi-massive, sulphides of the iThuma prospect, located within the amphibolite facies Natal Nappe Complex. Here gold (up to 3 g/t) is concentrated together with the main sulphide are, as well as some gold enrichment (230 ppb) in the hydrothermally altered footwall <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe.</b> It is proposed that the epigenetic mineralization was formed {{as a consequence of the}} northward directed abduction of the major thrust slices of the Natal Nappe Complex.

The earliest folds, F•, are large and overturned to the north and are related to coeval thrusting. These folds have not been recognized previously. The main orebody folds are upright, isoclinal, locally downward-facing structures of the F 2 generation.

40|$|Four cold seeps are {{studied in}} Lake Baikal’s South Basin using {{side scan sonar}} in {{combination}} with detailed bathymetry, measurements of near-bottom water properties, and selected seismic profiles. The cold seeps occur at {{the crest of a}} fault block in the hanging wall of a large normal fault (the Posolsky fault), at a waterdepth of 1340 m to 1420 m. They were named Bolshoy (large), Stari (old), Malenki (small), and Malyutka (very small). The seeps at the lake floor are identified on side scan sonar and echosounding data and interpreted as flat-topped (craters, e. g. Malenki) and/or conical-shaped mud volcanoes (e. g. Bolshoy). Each vent is characterized by a near-bottom acoustic anomaly in the water column. Measurements of near-bottom water properties indicate a negative oxygen anomaly and a small but consistent positive temperature anomaly but no difference in salinity. The expelled fluids appear to be not much different from the lake water and most likely originate from shallow depth, probably from gas hydrate dissociation between 300 m and 150 m below the lake floor. Combination with subsurface data from seismic profiles shows that the seeps occur where the base of gas hydrate layer (BGH) is irregular and shallowing rapidly towards the vent sites. Coincident with the shallowing BGH, positive heat flow anomalies occur. Local dissociation of gas hydrates from the base to the top is attributed to a pulse of hydrothermal heat flow along an active fault segment. Volumetric expansion associated to hydrate dissociation probably caused a high-pressure compartment bounded at the top by the elevated BGH. From the top of the domeshaped BGH a vertical <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> extends to the mud volcano at the lake floor, disrupting the horizontally stratified seismic facies. The mud volcanism seems to be shortlived, as is illustrated by the Bolshoy mud volcano that seems to be in a final phase of mud extrusion despite its recent initiation. The mud volcanoes and cold seeps are interpreted to be an example of a vigorous gas and fluid expulsion caused by gas hydrate dissociation due to a hydrothermal event. The duration of fluid and mud expulsion is limited by the amount of hydrate, by the duration of the hydrothermal pulse, or by the time needed for a new equilibrium to be installed. This mechanism may be an explanation for traces of short-lived mud volcanism in other gas hydrate areas in a tectonically active setting...|$|E
40|$|The risk-based {{life-cycle}} management of engineering systems {{in a nuclear}} power plant is intended to ensure safe and economically efficient operation of energy generation infrastructure over its entire service life. An important element of {{life-cycle management}} is to understand, model and forecast the effect of various degradation mechanisms affecting the performance of engineering systems, structures and components. The modeling of degradation in nuclear plant components is confounded by large sampling and temporal uncertainties. The reason is that nuclear systems are not readily accessible for inspections due to high level of radiation and large costs associated with remote data collection methods. The models of degradation used by industry are largely derived from ordinary linear regression methods. The main objective of this thesis is to develop more advanced techniques based on stochastic process theory to model deterioration in engineering components with the purpose of providing more scientific basis to life-cycle management of aging nuclear power plants. This thesis proposes a stochastic gamma process (GP) model for deterioration and develops a suite of statistical techniques for calibrating the model parameters. The gamma process is a versatile and mathematically tractable stochastic model {{for a wide variety of}} degradation phenomena, and another desirable property is its nonnegative, monotonically increasing sample paths. In the thesis, the GP model is extended by including additional covariates and also modeling for random effects. The optimization of age-based replacement and condition-based maintenance strategies is also presented. The thesis also investigates improved regression techniques for modeling deterioration. A linear mixed-effects (LME) regression model is presented to resolve an inconsistency of the traditional regression models. The proposed LME model assumes that the randomness in deterioration is decomposed into two parts: the unobserved heterogeneity of individual units and additive measurement errors. Another common way to model deterioration in civil engineering is to treat the rate of deterioration as a random variable. In the context of condition-based maintenance, the thesis shows that the random variable rate (RV) model is inadequate to incorporate temporal variability, because the deterioration along a specific sample path becomes deterministic. This distinction between the RV and GP models has profound implications to the optimization of maintenance strategies. The thesis presents detailed practical applications of the proposed models to <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> systems and fuel channels in CANDU nuclear reactors. In summary, a careful consideration of the nature of uncertainties associated with deterioration is important for credible life-cycle management of engineering systems. If the deterioration process is affected by temporal uncertainty, it is important to model it as a stochastic process...|$|E

[...] The oldest rocks in the study area are arc plutonic rocks of the Crippleback Lake Quartz Monzonite which forms the original basement to theTally Pond Group. The Lake Ambrose Formation is a sequence of dominantly mafic volcanic rocks comprised of vesicular and amygdaloidal, generally pillowed, flows and mafic to andesitic tuff, agglomerate and breccia that were unconformably deposited upon the Crippleback Lake Quartz Monzonite. The mafic volcanic rocks are intercalated with felsic volcanic rocks of the Boundary Brook Formation that consist of flow banded and massive rhyolite, felsic breccia, lapilli tuffs and quartz porphyry. Both of these rock units were intruded by small stocks and dykes of quartz porphyritic rhyodacite that may be coeval with the volcanic rocks in places. [...] An extensive unit of black shale melange is in tectonic contact with the volcanic rocks of the Tally Pond Group. The melange consists of volcanic and sedimentary clasts set in a matrix of fine-grained black shale. The melange unit is also in contact with a volcaniclastic and epiclastic sequence of sedimentary rocks, the Bumt Pond Formation. This unit is dominated by greywacke and conglomerate containing volcanic detritus interpreted to be derived from the adjacent and underlying volcanic rocks. Dykes, stocks, and small plutons of medium-grained gabbroic-dioritic rocks intrude all of the rocks of the Tally Pond Group. [...] The youngest rocks in the study area are conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones of the Rogerson Lake Conglomerate. The unit was deposited during the Silurian and contains volcanic clasts from the underlying volcanic sequences of the Tulks belt and Tally Pond Group. [...] Geochemical analysis indicates that the volcanic rocks of the Tally Pond belt are bimodal, with geochemical affinities consistent with a volcanic arc paleotectonic environment. Mafic rocks vary from sub-alkalic basalts to basaltic-andesites, consistently exhibit an arc signature, and are depleted arc tholeiites with moderate LREE enrichments. The felsic rocks are rhyolite to rhyodacite, are variably LREE-enriched island arc rocks, and are tholeiitic in nature; however, some have transitional to slight calc-alkaline affinities. Subalkalic gabbro and diorite intrusions are transitional in nature and exhibit LREE enrichment relative to the MREE and HREE. The altered footwall felsic rocks that lie beneath the Duck Pond VMS deposit exhibit REE depletions of different magnitudes; Eu being depleted in all of the altered samples to varying degrees. The hanging wall felsic rocks do not define a fractionation trend with the mafic varieties and the two sequences are not genetically related. [...] The U-Pb geochronological data for a quartz crystal tuff indicate that the volcanic succession of the Boundary Brook Formation is confined to an age of 509 Ma. These data coupled with field relationships, confirm that the main episode of felsic volcanism in the Tally Pond Group is Middle Cambrian. The 465 Ma age for the Harpoon Gabbro indicates that the mafic intrusions in the Tally Pond Group are Ordovician and therefore much older than previously thought, as they were considered to be Silurian-Devonian. This Ordovician age represents the youngest magmatism recognized in the Tally Pond Group and is comparable to similar Arenig-Llanvim ages from the Red Indian Lake area. The age of the Harpoon Gabbro temporally correlates with other Early and Mid- Ordovician arc sequences in the Exploits Subzone, namely the Wild Bight and Exploits groups. [...] Chemical compositions of the alteration minerals chlorite, sericite and carbonate are quite variable in the samples analyzed from the Duck Pond deposit. Chlorites from the Duck Pond deposit contain a broad range of Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratios and atomic Si concentrations. Those from the chaotic carbonate alteration zone have a restricted Si content and have Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratios typical of high Mg chlorites. Chlorites from the <b>feeder</b> <b>pipe</b> to the Duck Pond deposit contain the highest atomic Si amounts and have intermediate Fe and Mg contents. The most ferroan-rich chlorites are those from the altered rhyolite rocks of the hanging-wall to the Duck Pond deposit. Sericites from the Duck Pond deposit are all classified as muscovite with little variation in composition. Carbonates from the Duck Pond deposit are dominantly dolomite with small compositional variations between the samples from the different alteration zones. [...] Geochronological data from the Rogerson Lake Conglomerate indicate that the age spectra in these rocks is dominated by Paleozoic zircons with minor Mesoproterozoic input. A large majority (- 50 %) of zircons from samples of the Rogerson Lake Conglomerate have Paleozoic ages of between 420 and 550 Ma; however the majority of these grains have ages in the 490 - 540 Ma range. These ages correspond well with the ages of Exploits arc/backarc volcanic sequences in the Victoria Lake Supergroup that are unconformably beneath the Rogerson Lake Conglomerate. The conglomerate detritus also contains zircon populations that are Ordovician, approximately 440 - 480 Ma. The source of these grains is most likely the adjacent rocks of the Notre Dame arc. [...] A minor quantity of zircons from Laurentian basement were identified in the Rogerson Lake Conglomerate. Neoproterozoic age groups (890, 1030 and 1250 Ma) correspond with rocks of the Grenville Orogen, while the Middle Mesoproterozoic ages (ca. 1500) are correlated with basement gneisses of the Grenville Orogen that are currently exposed in westem Newfoundland. The high proportion of Paleozoic zircons relative to Proterozoic grains is presumably the result of Middle Ordovician exhumation of the Notre Dame arc and its subsequent collision and accretion to Laurentia. [...] Lead isotope data from the Tally Pond belt show a very small variation in ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁴ Pb ratios and are relatively more radiogenic than other VMS deposits in Newfoundland. The lead isotope data for the Tally Pond belt define three groups, 1) a primitive group; 2) a slightly more radiogenic group; and 3) a much more radiogenic group. The relatively more radiogenic lead ratios are found in the deep sections of the Upper Duck lens and may indicate the influence of a continental lead source in the initial hydrothermal ore system, followed by introduction of more mantle-derived lead when the fluid system became better developed. The high levels of the Upper Duck lens contain less radiogenic lead, which is almost certainly derived from a mantle source. Comparison with VMS deposits elsewhere in the Dunnage Zone indicate that there are two general groups of deposits: a primitive group in the Notre Dame Subzone, and a relatively more radiogenic group represented by deposits in the Exploits Subzone. Deposits in the Notre Dame Subzone were influenced by lead that evolved from the Laurentian margin while those in the Exploits Subzone appear to have been influenced by Gondwanan continental crust. [...] Sulphides for the Tally Pond belt in the area surrounding the Duck Pond and Boundary deposits are characterized by a wide range of δ³⁴S values (- 17 to + 13), representing sulphur from a variety of potential sources. Sulphide minerals hosted by mafic volcanic rocks from the Upper block of the Duck Pond Deposit, from the South Moose Pond zone, and from a mafic intrusion in the Upper block contain sulphur isotope values that fall within the range of igneous rocks with a mantle origin. This suggests that the sulphides in the mafic volcanic rocks were derived from reduced sulphur from a deep-seated magmatic source. [...] Sulphide minerals from the Mineralized block of the Duck Pond Deposit consist of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite and are hosted by altered rhyodacitic flows, intensely chlorite altered feeder zones, and the massive sulphide lens. The felsic ash-tuff hosted Boundary Deposit has sulphur isotope ratios (+ 10 to + 13) that are slightly higher than those of the Duck Pond Deposit (+ 5 to + 11). Both the Duck Pond and Boundary deposits have sulphur isotope ratios that are higher than the normal mantle value for igneous rocks and show a shift towards a seawater sulphate value. The sulphur in these deposits is most likely derived from inorganic high-temperature reduction of seawater sulphate. [...] The lowest δ³⁴S values (- 17 to - 13) are from sediment-hosted pyrite in the Upper block of the Duck Pond Deposit, while slightly higher δ³⁴S values of- 7 and - 8 [per thousand] are from the North Moose Pond area, located northeast of the Duck Pond Deposit. The sulphur in these sedimentary-hosted samples are interpreted to result from biogenic reduction of seawater sulphate...|$|E

40|$|As {{so-called}} second-generation power reactors {{are approaching}} {{the end of}} their original design lives, assessments are being made to determine the feasibility and economics of extending plant life. Although components exposed to neutron and gamma irradiation are often those of most concern in terms of in-service ageing and continued fitness for service, ageing of out-of-core components can also limit the possibility of extended service life beyond design life. In CANDU® reactors, life extension decisions occur when the Zr- 2. 5 Nb pressure tubes reach end of life, typically after about 25 years of service for the first CANDU- 6 units. At the time of pressure tube replacements, the remaining life predictions for several other major components or systems provide the information required to determine life extension feasibility. Several CANDU reactors are currently being refurbished, with others planned, and experience todate shows that the steam generators, heat transport system piping and various balance of plant piping systems are typically those requiring careful assessment to ensure successful refurbishment. In this paper, we discuss AECL R&D that is oriented towards providing the chemistry and materials inputs required to assess current condition and predict future ageing of CANDU reactor out-of-core components and systems, and in particular steam generators (Alloy 800 tubing and carbon steel internals), <b>feeder</b> <b>pipes</b> and related heat transport system piping (carbon steel flow accelerated corrosion, feeder cracking). Systems and components that may impact future life will also be discussed, along with the related R&D, and this includes balance of plant system piping (feedwater piping and buried piping), cables and concrete structures...|$|R
40|$|The project's overall {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} commercially viable dynamic signature based sensing system that is used to infer the flow rate and fineness of pulverized coal. This eighteen month effort will focus on developments required to transfer the measurement system from the laboratory to a field ready prototype system. This objective will be achieved through the completion of the laboratory development of the sensor and data algorithm followed by full scale field tests of a portable measurement system. The sensing system utilizes accelerometers attached externally to coal <b>feeder</b> <b>pipes.</b> Raw data is collected from the impingement of the coal particles as well as the acoustic noise generated from the flow and is transformed into characteristic signatures through proper calibration that are meaningful to the operator. The laboratory testing will use a portable version of the sensing system to collect signature data from a variety of flow conditions including coal flow rates, flow orientations, and coal particle characteristics. This work will be conducted at the Coal Flow Measurement Laboratory that is sponsored by EPRI and operated by Airflow Sciences. The data will be used to enhance the algorithm and neural network required to perform real time analysis of the nonspecific signature data. The system will be installed at two full scale power plants to collect data in a real time operating scenario. These short term duration tests will evaluate the ability of the algorithm to accurately infer coal flow rates and determine if the measurement system can be used effectively in an active control loop for combustion diagnostics and burner balancing. At the completion of this project, prototype versions of both a portable system and a permanent installation will be available for final packaging and commercialization by one of the team members. Both types of systems will be marketed for conducting combustion diagnostics and balancing of individual flows to pulverized coal burners. The benefits sought through the use of this system include improvements to a plant's feed utilization rate as well as the overall efficiency of a pulverized coal combustion system...|$|R
