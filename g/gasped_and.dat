25|$|Cassidy {{administered}} {{an overdose}} of ether, which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue {{out of his mouth}} with a pair of forceps, {{and at the same time}} forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger <b>gasped</b> <b>and</b> resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Lowrey then persuaded a friend, Colonel William C. Falkner, {{to run his}} {{railroad}} {{near the}} college. Since he was a major shareholder of Falkner's Railroad, the plan was soon carried out. The school became quite a success and 3 generations of Lowrey's became presidents of the school himself, two of his sons and a grandson. Following several years of teaching at the Blue Mountain College, Lowrey became very sick and, in 1882, his doctors alerted him that his heart was very weak. Then, on February 27, 1885, while buying a train ticket at Middleton, Tennessee, he turned, <b>gasped,</b> <b>and</b> {{fell to the floor}} dead.|$|E
500|$|Midazolam {{has been}} used as part of a three-drug cocktail, with vecuronium bromide and {{potassium}} chloride in Florida and Oklahoma prisons. [...] Midazolam has also been used along with hydromorphone in a two-drug protocol in Ohio and Arizona. Ohio used midazolam in the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014; it took McGuire 24 minutes to die after the procedure started, and he <b>gasped</b> <b>and</b> appeared to be choking during that time, leading to questions about the dosing and timing of the drug administration, as well as the choice of drugs.|$|E

500|$|Now on foot, {{the knights}} drew swords and {{returned}} to battle, Le Gris again proving stronger than his opponent and slowly gaining the upper hand. After several minutes of engagement, Carrouges slipped and Le Gris was able to stab his rival through the right thigh. As the crowd <b>gasped</b> <b>and</b> murmured, Le Gris stepped back to view his opponent's injury and Carrouges desperately counter-attacked, wrestling Le Gris to the ground. Le Gris' heavy armour prevented him from regaining his feet and Carrouges repeatedly stabbed at his floored opponent, his blows denting but not puncturing the thick plate steel. Realising that his sword was inadequate, Carrouges straddled Le Gris and used the handle of his dagger to smash the lock holding Le Gris' faceplate in position. Even as his opponent struggled beneath him, Carrouges tore the plate off and demanded that Le Gris admit his guilt. Le Gris refused and cried out [...] "In the name of God and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent". Infuriated, Carrouges drove his dagger through Le Gris' neck, killing him instantly.|$|E

2500|$|After he had {{finished}} speaking and handing out the notes to his staffers, Dwyer then produced a manila envelope with a blued Smith & Wesson Model 27 [...]357 Magnum revolver in it. When {{the crowd in the}} room saw what Dwyer had pulled out of the envelope, the mood changed immediately from one of waiting to see whether he would resign his office to one of panic as nobody else but Dwyer knew what he was planning to do with the gun. People <b>gasped</b> <b>and</b> he backed up against the wall, pointing the weapon into the air. Dwyer calmly stated to his audience, [...] "Please, please leave the room if this will...if this will affect you." ...|$|E
