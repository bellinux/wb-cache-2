40|$|Part 5 : Secure SystemsInternational audienceCommercial anti-malware systems {{currently}} rely on signatures or patterns {{learned from}} samples of known malware, and {{are unable to}} detect zero-day malware, rendering computers unprotected. In this paper we present a novel kernel-level technique of detecting keyloggers. Our approach operates {{through the use of}} a decoy keyboard. It uses a low-level driver to emulate and expose keystrokes modeled after actual users. We developed a statistical model of the typing profiles of real users, which regulates the times of delivery of emulated keystrokes. A kernel filter driver enables the decoy <b>keyboard</b> to shadow <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> such as one single keyboard appears on the device tree at all times. That <b>keyboard</b> is <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> when <b>the</b> actual user types on it, and the decoy keyboard during time windows of user inactivity. Malware are detected in a second order fashion when data leaked by the decoy keyboard are used to access resources on the compromised machine. We tested our approach against live malware samples that we obtained from public repositories, and report <b>the</b> findings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper. The decoy keyboard is able to detect 0 -day malware, and can co-exist with a real keyboard on a computer in production without causing any disruptions to the user’s work...|$|R

50|$|On-screen {{keyboards}} {{can be used}} to {{type and}} enter data without using <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard.</b> An on-screen keyboard may contain all the standard keys including all letters, numbers, symbols, and system keys like Home, End, Insert, Page Up and Page Down, Ctrl, Alt, Caps, and Shift, and can even extend the set of characters available by simulating alternative layouts. These keys can be selected using the mouse or another pointing device, or a single key or small group of keys {{can be used to}} cycle through the keys on the screen. The on-screen keyboard is {{the most common type of}} virtual keyboard. The accuracy of this keyboard depends only on hitting the right key. The main purpose of an on-screen keyboard is to provide an alternative mechanism for disabled users who cannot use a <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> or to provide text input on devices lacking a <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> such as smartphones and tablets.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologySmartphones have {{dominated}} the American mobile phone market since mid- 2012 (Nielsen, 2012). Forty-five percent of American adults own smartphones (Smith, 2012), and report frequently using their devices for the same tasks: text messaging, emailing, and social networking (comScore, 2013), {{all of which are}} dependent on text entry. Hardware and/or software text input options are available, but recently vendors have begun to abandon <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> in their device portfolios. Empirical research does not indicate, comparatively, which smartphone text entry methods are the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred by consumers. Furthermore, potential relationships that users' anthropometry, voice qualities and age-related limitations may have with the accuracy and satisfaction of these input methods have not been addressed. Two experiments explored the impact that five frequently used smartphone input methods (physical and onscreen Qwerty keyboards, tracing, handwriting, and voice recognition) had on novice user performance, perceived workload, satisfaction, and preference. Relationships between anthropometry, speech and voice qualities with the input methods were also examined. Results from Study 1 demonstrate that younger adults were fastest with voice recognition, but committed fewer errors, reported lower workload, higher satisfaction, and preference with <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Results from Study 2 revealed that older adults were fastest, most accurate, reported lower workload, higher satisfaction and preference for voice recognition. A comparison between age groups suggested that older adults were generally slower and committed more errors. However, performance differences were not found between age groups for voice recognition entry rates and word error rates, as well as for physical Qwerty uncorrected error rates. Additionally, both groups had similar satisfaction and preference ratings for most methods...|$|R
