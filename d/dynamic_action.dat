As was common throughout the Kennedy presidency, decision making would be centralized and housed within the secret Special Group (SG-A). At this time, Operation Mongoose was underway.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and widely imitated artists in the American comics industry. His style is {{attributed}} as a direct influence on the artists who would found Image Comics, and the other popular artists of the 1990s associated with that era, such as Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld. Timothy Callahan of Comic Book Resources points to the use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> poses, idealized figures, costume designs featuring numerous accessories, a preference for copious crosshatching over brushwork in rendering, and the depiction of cybernetic limbs and other reflective surfaces seen in those artists' styles as being derived from Adams' work, in particular his run on Longshot. Callahan also points out that the detailed webbing for which Todd McFarlane became known during his run on [...] had previously been used by Adams on the cover of Longshot #4. Though Callahan notes that Adams did not necessarily originate these elements, but was influenced himself by Michael Golden and Micronauts, he states that Adams popularized them. Noting also that Adams' Longshot pencils were inked by Whilce Portacio and an uncredited Scott Williams, Callahan refers to that book as [...] "early Image, in primal form". Artists whose work has been viewed as imitative of Adams' style, or who have named Adams as an influence include Joe Madureira, J. Scott Campbell, Aaron Kuder, Shelby Robertson, and Nick Bradshaw.|$|E

2500|$|Although Knight {{sometimes}} made musculoskeletal {{studies of}} living animals, {{he did not}} do so for his dinosaur restorations, and he restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips (Paul, 1996). In the 1920s, studies by the celebrated palaeontologists Alfred Romer and Gerhard Heilmann (Heilmann, 1926) had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a typical reptile. Knight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in very <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts (Paul, 1996). In his catalogue to Life through the Ages (1946), he reiterated views that he had written earlier (Knight, 1935), describing the great beasts as [...] "slow-moving dunces" [...] that were [...] "unadaptable and unprogressive" [...] while conceding that small dinosaurs had been more active. Some of his pictures are now known to be wrong, such as the tripod kangaroo-like posture of the hadrosaurs and theropods, whereas their spinal column was roughly horizontal at the hip; and the sauropods standing deeply in water whereas they were land-dwellers. Knight also drew dinosaur tails dragging on the ground, whereas they were held out approximately horizontally.|$|E

40|$|Steel and {{composite}} (steel-concrete) highway bridges {{are currently}} subjected to <b>dynamic</b> <b>actions</b> of variable magnitude due to convoy of vehicles crossing {{on the deck}} pavement. These <b>dynamic</b> <b>actions</b> can generate the nucleation of fractures or even their propagation on the bridge deck structure. Proper consideration {{of all of the}} aspects mentioned pointed our team to develop an analysis methodology with emphasis to evaluate the stresses through a dynamic analysis of highway bridge decks including the action of vehicles. The design codes recommend the application of the curves S-N associated to the Miner's damage rule to evaluate the fatigue and service life of steel and composite (steel-concrete) bridges. In this work, the developed computational model adopted the usual mesh refinement techniques present in finite element method simulations implemented in the ANSYS program. The investigated highway bridge is constituted by four longitudinal composite girders and a concrete deck, spanning 40. 0 m by 13. 5 m. The analysis methodology and procedures presented in the design codes were applied to evaluate the fatigue of the bridge determining the service life of the structure.

2500|$|Although Vivekananda did {{not write}} any commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, his works {{contained}} numerous references to the Gita, such as his lectures on the four yogas – Bhakti, Gyaana, Karma, and Raja. Through {{the message of the}} Gita, Vivekananda sought to energise the people of India to claim their own dormant but strong identity. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay thought that the answer to the problems that beset Hindu society was a revival of Hinduism in its purity, which lay in the reinterpretation of Bhagavad Gita for a new India. Aurobindo saw Bhagavad Gita as a [...] "scripture of the future religion" [...] and suggested that Hinduism had acquired a much wider relevance through the Gita. Sivananda called Bhagavad Gita [...] "the most precious jewel of Hindu literature" [...] and suggested its introduction into the curriculum of Indian schools and colleges. In the lectures Chinmayananda gave, on tours undertaken to revive of moral and spiritual values of the Hindus, he borrowed the concept of Gyaana yajna, or the worship to invoke divine wisdom, from the Gita. He viewed the Gita as a universal scripture to turn a person from a state of agitation and confusion to a state of complete vision, inner contentment, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>action.</b> Teachings of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organisation which spread rapidly in North America in the 1970s and 1980s, are based on a translation of the Gita called Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is by A.C.

The first issue of The Akali appeared on 21 May 1920 with Lyallpuri as its Owner, Manager, Publisher and Chief Editor. He was assisted by Giani Hira Singh Darad and S Mangal Singh Gill etc. It was the first Punjabi daily to be published and in its very first issue, it had outlined in its editorial note its programme advocating: (1) Panthic control over the Gurdwaras; (2) Panthic control of Khalsa College, Amritsar; (3) repairing the demolished wall of Gurudwara Rakabganj, Delhi; (4) creation of religious and political awakening among the Sikh masses and to line them up for more effective roles in India's struggle of independence; and (5) creation of a Sikh organisation and choosing its members democratically through elections based on Panchayat rules. The writings in The Akali were so effective and bold compared to the Urdu dailies of the times that some Hindus and even Muslims had especially learnt Gurmukhi to read The Akali The paper effectively and forcefully raised the wall issue of Gurdwara Rakabganj Delhi and roused the Sikh community into <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> and participation.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} for publishers to include the right links in documents, because they cannot predict all actions their users might want to perform. Existing adaptive navigation systems can generate relevant links, but doing this on a Web scale is non-trivial, especially if the targets are <b>dynamic</b> <b>actions.</b> As a result, adaptation often happens in a centralized way on a limited or closed document and action set. Distributed affordance is a technology to automatically generate links from any Web resource to matching actions from an open set of Web services, based on semantic annotations.

40|$|Background: Physiological {{studies of}} {{perfectly}} still observers have shown interesting correlations between increasing effortfulness of observed actions {{and increases in}} heart and respiration rates. Not much {{is known about the}} cortical response induced by observing effortful actions. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the time course and neural correlates of perception of implied motion, by presenting 260 pictures of human actions differing in degrees of dynamism and muscular exertion. ERPs were recorded from 128 sites in young male and female adults engaged in a secondary perceptual task. Principal Findings: Our results indicate that even when the stimulus shows no explicit motion, observation of static photographs of human actions with implied motion produces a clear increase in cortical activation, manifest in a long-lasting positivity (LP) between 350 – 600 ms that is much greater to dynamic than less <b>dynamic</b> <b>actions,</b> especially in men. A swLORETA linear inverse solution computed on the dynamic-minus-static difference wave in the time window 380 – 430 ms showed that a series of regions was activated, including the right V 5 /MT, left EBA, left STS (BA 38), left premotor (BA 6) and motor (BA 4) areas, cingulate and IF cortex. Conclusions and Significance: Overall, the data suggest that corresponding mirror neurons respond more strongly to implied dynamic than to less <b>dynamic</b> <b>actions.</b> The sex difference might be partially cultural and reflect a preference of young adult males for highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>actions</b> depicting intense muscular activity, or a sporty context...|$|R
