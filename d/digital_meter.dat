25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or <b>digital</b> <b>meter</b> responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E

50|$|The input is impedance-matched {{with the}} {{rejection}} circuit {{with the help}} of an attenuator and an impedance matcher. This signal is then pre-amplified to a desired level. The following section consists of a Wien bridge notch filter tuned to reject the fundamental frequency and balanced for minimum output by adjusting the bridge controls. The output, which is the remaining signal after the fundamental has been suppressed, is amplified to a measurable level. A feedback loop from the bridge amplifier output to the pre-amp input helps to eliminate any remaining contribution from the fundamental frequency. The output from these blocks is measured, typically using an instrumentation amplifier driving an analog or <b>digital</b> <b>meter.</b> The voltage at the meter is due to the harmonic distortion products plus noise.|$|E

Among the factors as-sociated with these losses electricity theft is of a major concern. Meter tampering is one kind of electricity theft that causes significant revenue losses for the power companies. In this research, a novel protection circuit is designed for conventional analog and <b>digital</b> <b>meters</b> to prevent tampering. The circuit has protection against the common tampering methods like shorting the current coil of the meter, reversing the direction of current flow, disconnecting the neutral line from the meter etc. At first the methods of tampering are described for both analog and <b>digital</b> <b>meters.</b> It is found from the research that though <b>digital</b> <b>meters</b> are better protected than the analog meters it can still be tampered by discon-necting the neutral line. The working principle of the proposed device is described afterwards. Subsequently the paper also illustrates the ef-fectiveness of the device in protecting the meters from common tampering methods. Finally, the financial impacts of this research on the elec-tricity distribution and billing systems are depicted, a few policy implications are drawn considering {{the impact of the}} research and some rec-ommendations are also provided for better and efficient utilization of the device...|$|R
