25|$|The third Bronze Age {{design of}} fibula {{consisted}} of <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> spirals. The spectacle fibula (brillen in German) {{consisted of two}} spirals joined together. It resembles a pair of spectacles or eye glasses. These fibulae, such as the Haslau type and the St. Lucija type, {{were found in the}} 9th to 7th centuries BC. Some spectacle fibula were very large with spirals up to 10cm across. A variant that appeared in the 6th century BC had four small spirals with a square, or squarish, cover plate on the middle, the Vierpass type.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> dipole antennas {{are popular}} {{for use on}} the HF shortwave bands, both for {{transmitting}} and shortwave listening. [...] They are usually constructed of two lengths of wire joined by a strain insulator in the center, which is the feedpoint. The ends can be attached to existing buildings, structures, or trees, taking advantage of their heights. If used for transmitting, {{it is essential that}} the ends of the antenna be attached to supports through strain insulators with a sufficiently high flashover voltage, since the antenna's high voltage antinodes occur there. Being a balanced antenna, they are best fed with a balun between the (coax) transmission line and the feedpoint.|$|E
2500|$|Figure 7 shows a {{clock signal}} with its four stages {{and the effects}} on a cell at each clock stage. A typical QCA design {{requires}} four clocks, {{each of which is}} cyclically 90 degrees out of phase with the prior clock. If a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> consisted of say, 8 cells and each consecutive pair, starting from the left were to be connected to each consecutive clock, data would naturally flow from left to right. The first pair of cells will stay latched until the second pair of cells gets latched and so forth. In this way, data flow direction is controllable through clock zones ...|$|E

5000|$|The antenna {{consists}} {{of one or}} more <b>horizontal</b> <b>wires</b> suspended between two supporting radio masts or buildings and insulated from them at the ends. A vertical wire is connected {{to the center of the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>wires</b> and hangs down close to the ground, connected to the transmitter or receiver.

2500|$|In modern times, when {{housing is}} not {{typically}} organized into walled courtyards, rabbinic interpretation has permitted this requirement {{to be met}} by creating a continuous wall or fence, real or symbolic, surrounding the area to be aggregated. The fence is required to have certain properties and consist of structural elements such as walls or doorframes. [...] When the fence is symbolic, the structural elements are often symbolic [...] "doorframes" [...] made of wire, with two vertical wires (often connected to utility poles) and one <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> on top connecting them (often using utility wires). The use of symbolic elements permits an eruv {{to make use of}} utility poles and the like to enclose an entire neighborhood of a modern city within the legal aggregation. In contemporary Jewish discourse, [...] "an eruv" [...] frequently refers to this symbolic [...] "fence" [...] that creates and denotes the boundaries of a symbolic [...] "walled courtyard" [...] in which a halakhicly (from [...] "halakha," [...] meaning the body of Jewish law) valid property aggregation can take place, rather than to the aggregation or legal status of the properties.|$|E
6000|$|... 114. The {{relation}} {{which holds}} between the magnetic pole, the moving wire or metal, {{and the direction}} of the current evolved, i.e. the law which governs the evolution of electricity by magneto-electric induction, is very simple, although rather difficult to express. If in fig. 24, PN represent a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> passing by a marked magnetic pole, so that the direction of its motion shall coincide with the curved line proceeding from below upwards; or if its motion parallel to itself be in a line tangential to the curved line, but {{in the general direction of}} the arrows; or if it pass the pole in other directions, but so as to cut the magnetic curves[A] in the same general direction, or on the same side as they would be cut by the wire if moving along the dotted curved line;--then the current of electricity in the wire is from P to N. If it be carried in the reverse directions, the electric current will be from N to P. Or if the wire be in the vertical position, figured P' N', and it be carried in similar directions, coinciding with the dotted horizontal curve so far, as to cut the magnetic curves on the same side with it, the current will be from P' to N'. If the wire be considered a tangent to the curved surface of the cylindrical magnet, and it be carried round that surface into any other position, or if the magnet itself be revolved on its axis, so as to bring any part opposite to the tangential wire,--still, if afterwards the wire be moved in the directions indicated, the current of electricity will be from P to N; or if it be moved in the opposite direction, from N to P; so that as regards the motions of the wire past the pole, they may be reduced to two, directly opposite to each other, one of which produces a current from P to N, and the other from N to P.|$|E

50|$|In {{observations}} of stars refraction {{was taken into}} account {{as well as the}} errors of graduation and flexure. If the bisection of the star on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> was not made in the centre of the field, allowance was made for curvature, or the deviation of the star's path from a great circle, and for the inclination of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> to the horizon. The amount of this inclination was found by taking repeated {{observations of}} the zenith distance of a star during the one transit, the pole star being the most suitable because of its slow motion.|$|E

[...] The width of the red area perpendicular to the wire at any point is proportional to the current. At resonance the current is the tail part of a sinusoidal standing wave. In the vertical antenna (a), the current must go to zero at the top. In the T (b), the current flows into the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire,</b> increasing the current in the top part of the vertical wire. The radiation resistance and thus the radiated power in each, is proportional to the square of the area of the vertical part of the current distribution.|$|E
50|$|Tables with <b>horizontal</b> <b>wires</b> {{are heavily}} used in {{construction}} and packaging. The cutting wire {{is attached to}} tracks {{on either side of}} the table enabling it to be moved up and down making cuts very exact. This table type can also perform angular cuts.|$|R

5000|$|To {{increase}} the top-load capacitance, several parallel <b>horizontal</b> <b>wires</b> are often used, connected {{together at the}} center where the vertical wire attaches. [...] The capacitance does not increase proportionally {{with the number of}} wires, however, because each wire's electric field is partially shielded from the ground by proximity to the adjacent wires.|$|R
50|$|In October 1973 Mi Amigos 180 ft lattice {{antenna mast}} (itself a {{replacement}} for the tubular steel mast that had collapsed a year earlier) fell into the sea during a storm. Caroline's engineers rigged up a temporary <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> antenna but this could only achieve very limited coverage.|$|E
50|$|The {{telescope}} was next {{brought up to}} the approximate declination of the target star by watching the finder circle. The instrument was provided with a clamping apparatus, by which the observer, after having set the approximate declination, could clamp the axis so the telescope could not be moved in declination, except very slowly by a fine screw. By this slow motion, the {{telescope was}} adjusted until the star moved along the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> (or if there were two, in the middle between them), from {{the east side of}} the field of view to the west. Following this, the circles were read by the microscopes for a measurement of the apparent altitude of the star. The difference between this measurement and the nadir point was the nadir distance of the star. A movable <b>horizontal</b> <b>wire</b> or declination-micrometer was also used.|$|E

25|$|One {{solution}} to this problem was developed by the Marconi company in 1905.
