Thus automatic analysis of user affective states have become inevitable for computer vision community. In this paper first we focus on understanding human visual system (HVS) when it decodes or recognizes facial expressions. To understand HVS, we have conducted psycho-visual experimental study with an eye-tracker, to find which facial region is perceptually more attractive or salient for a particular expression. Secondly, based on results obtained from psycho-visual experimental study we have proposed a novel framework for automatic analysis of affective states. Framework creates discriminative feature space by processing only salient facial regions to extract Pyramid Histogram of Orientation Gradients (PHOG) features. The proposed framework achieved automatic expression recognition accuracy of 95. 3 % on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial expression database for six universal facial expressions. We have also discussed generalization capabilites of proposed framework on unseen data. In the last paper discusses effectiveness of proposed framework against low resolution image sequences...|$|R

40|$|Operational {{sequence}} diagrams (OSDs) {{have been}} used to support human engineering in system develop-ment for decades (Kurke, 1961); however, due to variations in application domains, OSDs have had vary-ing degrees of SUCCESS in defining the critical aspects of system operation necessary for <b>human-centered</b> <b>designs.</b> One of the more significant evolutions to this method in recent years was a tailoring of the tech-nique to be more easily used and interpreted by subject matter experts (SMEs) and engineers (Wallace, Bohan, and Perry, 1997). This format also emphasized a tighter coupling of “information requirements ” as a design determinant to be tracked. Since then, this particular OSD methodology has been applied to a va-riety of programs and been used to support early system requirements reviews. Understandably, the wider “se of this methodology has enabled its users to learn of shortcomings in different applications. This paper discusses additional enhancements to the visual representation of OSD methodology currently employed.

Human-centered systems not onb allow greater involvement, but require higher user friendliness, end-user satisfaction. learnabiliiy, and so on.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a good balance and integration of the human aspects with enabling technologies for knowledge and decision making.
