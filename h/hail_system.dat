40|$|Prior to launch, {{the space}} shuttle might be {{described}} as a very large thermos bottle containing substantial quantities of cryogenic fuels. Because thermal insulation is a critical design requirement, the external wall of the launch vehicle fuel tank is covered with an insulating foam layer. This foam is fragile and can be damaged by very minor impacts, such as that from small- to medium-size hail, which may go unnoticed. In May 1999, hail damage {{to the top of the}} External Tank (ET) of STS- 96 required a rollback from the launch pad to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) for repair of the insulating foam. Because of the potential for hail damage to the ET while exposed to the weather, a vigilant <b>hail</b> sentry <b>system</b> using impact transducers was developed as a <b>hail</b> damage warning <b>system</b> and to record and quantify hail events. The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) <b>Hail</b> Monitor <b>System,</b> a joint effort of the NASA and University Affiliated Spaceport Technology Development Contract (USTDC) Physics Labs, was first deployed for operational testing in the fall of 2006.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study silver iodine (AgI) {{dispersion}} in Mendoza using the Weather Research and Forcasting model (WRF). Crystalline structure of AgI is similar to that of ice, allowing it to induce freezing by a process known as heterogeneous nucleation. Therefore, AgI is used to seed clouds in <b>hail</b> suppression <b>systems.</b> In particular, in Mendoza, cloud seeding is done through ground generators located in the western part of the province, were most storm cells are formed. The efficiency of this system has not been scientifically proven. This paper provides a methodology to include AgI sources in WRF in order to study its dispersion in the atmosphere. Because of the physical characteristics of ground generators, they are modeled as area sources using the Fire module of WRF. This module has been design to simulate biomass burning. We show how to simulate AgI generators through definition of a special fuel behavior model to use with WRF-Fire. Thorough dispersion modeling it is possible to see if AgI reaches storm cells. Furthermore, with simulation results it is possible to choose the best location for ground AgI generators. This paper shows simulation results for the <b>hail</b> suppression <b>system</b> currently working in Mendoza and for other possible scenarios using different locations for ground generators and different number of them.

40|$|Weather {{conditions}} at Kennedy Space Center are extremely dynamic, and they greatly affect {{the safety of}} the Space Shuttles sitting on the launch pads. For example, on May 13, 1999, the foam on the External Tank (ET) of STS- 96 was significantly damaged by hail at the launch pad, requiring rollback to the Vehicle Assembly Building. The loss of ET foam on STS- 114 in 2005 intensified interest in monitoring and measuring damage to ET foam, especially from hail. But hail can be difficult to detect and monitor because it is often localized and obscured by heavy rain. Furthermore, the hot Florida climate usually melts the hail even before the rainfall subsides.

40|$|The optical {{extinction}} of a laser due to scattering of particles {{is a well-known}} phenomenon. In a laboratory environment, this physical principle {{is known as the}} Beer-Lambert law, and is often used to measure the concentration of scattering particles in a fluid or gas. This method has been experimentally shown to be a usable means to measure the dust density from a rocket plume interaction with the lunar surface. Using the same principles and experimental arrangement, this technique can be applied to hydrometeor size distributions, and for launch-pad operations, specifically as a passive hail detection and measurement system. Calibration of a <b>hail</b> monitoring <b>system</b> is a difficult process. In the past, it has required comparison to another means of measuring hydrometeor size and density. Using a technique recently developed for estimating the density of surface dust dispersed during a rocket landing, measuring the {{extinction of}} a laser passing through hail (or dust in the rocket case) yields an estimate of the second moment of the particle cloud, and hydrometeor size distribution in the terrestrial meteorological case. With the exception of disdrometers, instruments that measure rain and hail fall make indirect measurements of the drop-size distribution. Instruments that scatter microwaves off of hydrometeors, such as the WSR- 88 D (Weather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler), vertical wind profilers, and microwave disdrometers, measure the sixth moment of the drop size distribution (DSD). By projecting a laser onto a target, changes in brightness of the laser spot against the target background during rain and hail yield a measurement of the DSD's second moment by way of the Beer-Lambert law. In order to detect the laser attenuation within the 8 -bit resolution of most camera image arrays, a minimum path length is required. Depending on the intensity of the hail fall rate for moderate to heavy rainfall, a laser path length of 100 m is sufficient to measure variations in optical extinction using a digital camera. For hail fall only, the laser path may be shorter because of greater scattering due to the properties of hailstones versus raindrops. A photodetector may replace the camera in automated installations. Laser-based rain and <b>hail</b> measurement <b>systems</b> are available, but they are based on measuring the interruption of a thin laser beam, thus counting individual hydrometeors.

In this current work, we adapted these algorithms to process data from a cluster of hail disdrometers positioned around Launch Pads 39 A or 39 B, along with the corresponding NWS radar data.

However, the high-reflectivity gradient cases indicated radar overestimation at further ranges, while the low-reflectivity gradient cases indicated significant radar underestimation at all ranges.

A single hail-echo model could not be derived because of the extreme variability found in all characteristics.

This paper reviews the origins, aspirations, philosophical limitations, and practical challenges of evidence-based medicine. Discussion EBM has long since evolved beyond its initial (mis) conception, that EBM might replace traditional medicine. EBM is now attempting to augment rather than replace individual clinical experience and understanding of basic disease mechanisms. EBM must continue to evolve, however, to address a number of issues including scientific underpinnings, moral stance and consequences, and practical matters of dissemination and application. For example, accelerating the transfer of research findings into clinical practice is often based on incomplete evidence from selected groups of people, who experience a marginal benefit from an expensive technology, raising issues of the generalizability of the findings, and increasing problems with how many and who can afford the new innovations in care.

40|$|Abstract: The {{number of}} hail {{days in the}} warm period of the year, June-September, at {{meteorological}} stations, {{is used for the}} evaluation of hail suppression activities in north-western Croatia. The mean number of hail days at the station is connected with the mean number of hail days in the experimental region and the mean area covered by individual hail falls in the region (Long, 1980). The assumptions of this analysis are that the regional frequency of hail days cannot be changed by hail suppression and that the change of the mean area covered by individual hail falls is a consequence of hail suppression. Multivariate linear regression has been chosen as the method of analysis. The frequency of hail days at stations is a dependent variable, and the year, the number of days with thunder, and the amounts of precipitation greater than 10, 20 and 50 mm, are independent variables. The assumption is that more stormy weather means more hail days in the region and that the chosen correlates can compensate the difference in the number of hail days between years in the region. The effect of hail suppression is represented by a step function, the value of which is one for years with hail suppression and zero otherwise. The regression coefficient of this function, according to analysis assumptions, reflects the effect of hail suppression. Data from seven meteorologicai stations in north-western Croatia. spread over an area of 11000 km 2, have been used in the analysis. The operational <b>hail</b> suppression <b>system</b> started working in this part of Croatia in I 971, and by 1974 it spread over the whole region, so that there were years during which some stations were under the influence of hail suppression while others were not. The number of meteorological stations in the region has changed over the years, too. The first station started working in 1862 and the most recent one in 1982. Analyses have been done with data from all years with at least one working station, and for the two periods, 1937 - 2000 and 1945 - 2000. The common characteristic of all three sets of data is a very low percentage of explained variance, 15 - 20 %, and a negative regression coefficient of the step function representing the effect of hail suppression. According to the value of this regression coefficient, the yearly mean number of days taken at all stations was 22 % lower for the years with hail suppression, but {{it was not possible to}} distinguish it from the long-term trend in all cases...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{contracts}} {{are widely used}} to reform state-owned enterprises. By June 1994, there were 565 such contracts in 32 developing countries, used prinicipally to reform large utilities and other monopolies, and roughly another 103, 000 in China, where they are also used to reform state manufacturing enterprises. A performance contract is a written agreement between {{the manager of a}} state enterprise (who promises to achieve specific targets in a certain time frame) and government (which [...] usually [...] promises to award achievement with a bonus or other incentive). Performance {{contracts are}} a variant of the pay-for-performance or incentive contracts often used to motivate managers in the private sector. In the public sector, they are viewed as a device to reveal information and motivate managers to exert effort. The authors analyze China's experience with performance contracts in more than 400 state enterprises. China is a good place for such a study because no country has ever used them on such a scale or with such a variety of enterprises (mostly in the competitive sector). China also uses many different kinds of contracts, with different targets (more profit-, tax-, or output-oriented). The authors find that performance contracts: a) on average, do not improve productivity in China's state enterprises and may even reduce it; b) are ineffective in competitive firms as well as monopolies; c) do more harm when they provide only weak incentives and when they do not reduce information asymmetry. They find no connection between variables for commitment and the effects of performance contracts. Design matters. When performance contracts contain all the"good"features [...] profit orientation,higher wage elasticity, and lower markup ratios [...] the firm's productivity growth rate could increase as much as 10 percent. The Chinese government was serious about implementing performance contracts, and used measures considerably more radical than other countries used, <b>hailing</b> the contract <b>system</b> as the official national mode for reforming state enterprises. But most of the contracts have had little or no effect on growth rates and the observed frequency of contracts with"good"provisions is exceedingly low. Perhaps the political economy of incentive contracts in government settings merits further study. Political considerations may preclude the design of incentive contracts for government actors could produce the sort of productivity gains some private firms have achieved. One observer (Byrd 1991) points out that the central government gave local governments a good deal of discretion in implementing performance contracts and local governments had a tendency to adopt the lowest common denominator, a"bare-bones"performance contract.

40|$|Often {{considered}} separated worlds, {{classical and}} quantum mechanics share numerous connections with one another. Indeed, as classical mechanics {{corresponds to a}} limiting case of quantum mechanics, certain concepts and elements of physical intuition developed in one theory can be and {{have been used to}} tackle issues in the other. Nevertheless, these connections do not only cover conceptual issues but also numerous techniques. Indeed, the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and its close resemblance to Markovian stochastic processes opens the door to the application of a broad range of powerful methods, initially developed for quantum mechanics, in classical equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this thesis we develop progress in three subjects by taking advantage of either a conceptual or a methodological connection between quantum and classical mechanics. First, we develop the well-known mapping between systems of strongly repelling, two-dimensional directed lines and systems of one-dimensional fermions in order to extend the directed polymer problem to richer geometries. By expressing path integrals in generalized curvilinear coordinates, we successfully generalize the model to settings such as polymers anchored to curved edges, polymers constrained to uneven walls, and polymers constrained to curved surfaces. In each case, we identify the Hamiltonian of an analogous quantum system, which, because of the new geometry of each setting, develops features such as a time- and position-dependent mass and an external electromagnetic vector potential. Along the way, we perform an in-depth analysis of the approximations made and establish regimes of their validity. Finally, in order to obtain analytical results, we employ an extension of the time-dependent perturbation theory scheme of quantum mechanics to imaginary time. Complementing this with the assumption of ground-state dominance, we obtain compact expressions for universal shifts in the free energies of the various systems that allows for isolation {{of the effects of the}} distinct geometrical properties of each system. The second piece of work presented into this thesis relates to the non-equilibrium setting of active particles. Strongly interacting, self-propelled particles can form a spontaneously flowing, polar (i. e. motionally aligned), active fluid. The study of the connection between the microscopic dynamics of a single, self-propelled particle and the macroscopic dynamics of a liquid comprising such particles can yield insights into experimentally realizable active flows, but this connection is well understood in only a few select cases. Here, we introduce a model of self-propelled particles that is based on an analogy with the motion of an electron subject to strong spin-orbit coupling. We find that, within our model, self-propelled particles experience an analog of the Heisenberg uncertainly principle that instead relates positional and rotational noise. An extension to many-component (and hence more classical) spinors, under which this uncertainty relation vanishes, contributes to the justification of this interpretation. Furthermore, by coarse-graining the microscopic model, we find expressions for the coefficients of the hydrodynamic Toner-Tu equations, established some time ago to describe an active liquid composed of “active spins. ” The connection between self-propelled particles and quantum spins may possibly provide a route for realizing exotic phases of matter using active liquids, via inspiration <b>hailing</b> from <b>systems</b> composed of strongly correlated electrons. The third and final piece of work to be presented on this thesis consists of a semi-classical approach to Transitionless Quantum Driving (TQD). TQD is a method, developed by means of a reverse engineering strategy, under which non-adiabatic transitions in time-dependent quantum systems are, in M. V. Berry's words, ``stifled'' through the introduction of a specific auxiliary Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian comes, however, expressed as a formal sum of outer products of the original instantaneous eigenstates and their time-derivatives. Generically, how to actually create such an operator in the laboratory is thus rarely evident. The operator may even be non-local. By following a semi-classical approach, we obtain a recipe that yields the auxiliary Hamiltonian explicitly, in terms of the fundamental operators of the system (e. g., position and momentum). By using this formalism, we are able to ascertain criteria for the locality of the auxiliary Hamiltonian, and also to determine its exact form in certain special cases. Lastly, the explicit connection between the auxiliary Hamiltonian and the observables of the system allows for a perturbation scheme in cases in which an exact solution is not easily achievable. This scheme shows that, even in situations in which an exact local auxiliary term cannot be achieved, under special circumstances it is possible to achieve an operator that is local and still approximately stifles non-adiabatic transitionsPh.
