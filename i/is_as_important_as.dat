Historically, the dominant method for consolidating the leaves together was to lay bricks across them, rather than running linearly.|$|E

25|$|In general, a {{capacitor}} {{is seen as}} a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an AC resistor. Especially aluminum electrolytic capacitors are used in many applications as a decoupling capacitors to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground or for capacitive coupling of audio AC signals. Then the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC resistance, the impedance <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the capacitance value.|$|E

25|$|It is {{recognised}} that an epidemiological {{account of}} the plague <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered {{by the lack of}} reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.|$|E

How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren.

25|$|Although Kant {{considered}} {{these two}} interests of {{reason to be}} objective and universal, {{the distinction between the}} natural and human sciences was institutionalized in Germany, through the organization of scholarly research and teaching, following the Enlightenment. In Germany the Enlightenment was dominated by Kant himself, who sought to establish principles based on universal rationality. In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (an influence to Boas) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> human rationality. In 1795, the great linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. Humboldt founded the University of Berlin in 1809, and his work in geography, history, and psychology provided the milieu in which Boas's intellectual orientation matured.|$|E

500|$|A {{study from}} 2005 {{pointed out that}} {{environmental}} justice <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> [...] sustainable development. Ecological economist Herman Daly asked, [...] "what use is a sawmill without a forest?" [...] From this perspective, the economy is a subsystem of human society, which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere, and a gain in one sector is a loss from another. This perspective led to the nested circles figure of 'economics' inside 'society' inside the 'environment'.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, {{and other}} pop culture media have both praised and criticized Alphonse's character. Chis Beveridge from Mania Entertainment has praised Al for being [...] "quite the likeable character" [...] and liked {{his role in}} the first series. The character's madness and disbelief over his own existence has been praised; Beveridge said it [...] "could make up a series all by itself.." [...] In a later volume review, Beveridge said the series' change of focus to Alphonse [...] "as an actual young boy" [...] was [...] "a nice change of pace." [...] T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews' Samuel Arbogast wrote that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting and that Alphonse's armor was of the most notable characters designs from the series. The brothers were also noted to [...] "becoming men" [...] by Active's Anime Holly Ellingwood after the first appearance of Van Hohenheim in the manga as the two investigate ways to recover their bodies. Lydia Hojnacki said Al's character <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> his brother to the series after commenting on Edward as she considered Al to be Edward's yang.|$|E
500|$|Ridley Scott {{worked very}} closely with {{composer}} Hans Zimmer, during post-production on Hannibal. Scott believes the music to a film <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> dialogueâ€”"It is the final adjustment to the screenplay, being able to also adjust {{the performance of the}} actors in fact." [...] Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and [...] "not music". Zimmer used a symphony orchestra for the opera sequence, but would mostly use what he described as a [...] "very odd orchestra...only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range." [...] This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter. He explains: [...] "Anthony's character is for me somebody at the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow." [...] Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a [...] "modern day orchestra". The character Mason Verger had his own [...] "theme", which become more [...] "perverted" [...] as the film progressed, according to Zimmer. Dante's sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and Patrick Cassidy for the opera scene in Florence. Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer's score. [...] "Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans' full attention...the classical elements, and yes, even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience." [...] In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time, Hannibal ranked at [...] 59. Strauss's The Blue Danube is also played at several points in the film.|$|E

For timers or similar applications, capacitors are seen as a storage component to store electrical energy.
