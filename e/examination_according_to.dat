5|$|While the {{northern}} origin {{theory has been}} dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs <b>examination.</b> <b>According</b> <b>to</b> him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity {{may have been due}} to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin of their ancestors may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region. The writing of 12th century Kashmiri poet Bilhana suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the Shudra caste while other sources claim they were Kshatriyas.|$|E

[...] "We will give him a funeral service." [...] However, on November 18, the coroner in an interview announced that the body was released [...] "over a week ago".
