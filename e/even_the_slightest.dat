5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the gay community. Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> empathy from it, {{and even a few}} years earlier his case might have been doomed from the start on that basis alone.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{considerable}} amount of scholarship on Jinnah which stems from Pakistan; according to Akbar S. Ahmed, it is not widely read outside the country and usually avoids <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> criticism of Jinnah. According to Ahmed, some books published about Jinnah outside Pakistan mention that he consumed alcohol, but this is omitted from books published inside Pakistan. Ahmed suggests that depicting the Quaid drinking would weaken Jinnah's Islamic identity, and by extension, Pakistan's. Some sources allege he gave up alcohol {{near the end of his}} life. Yahya Bakhtiar, who observed Jinnah from close quarters, concluded that Jinnah was a very sincere, deeply committed and dedicated Mussalman.|$|E

5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at an easel outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype was taken by the French photographer Aymard Charles Th√©odore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that the date was Sunday, 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what apparently is his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, it is actually his right hand. This has been ascribed to the anxiety he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> detail.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to different subjects, rationalists sometimes vary {{the strength of}} their claims by adjusting their understanding of the warrant. Some rationalists understand warranted beliefs to be beyond <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> doubt; others are more conservative and understand the warrant to be belief beyond a reasonable doubt.|$|E
60|$|The {{last few}} steps were, indeed, almost precipitous. Fragments of rock, {{protruding}} {{through the grass}} and bushes, served as steps.

25|$|Because {{both the}} {{pavilion}} and crown are comparatively shallow, step cut stones {{are generally not}} as bright and never as fiery as brilliant cut stones, but rather accentuate a diamond's clarity (as <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> flaw would be highly visible), whiteness, and lustre (and therefore good polish).|$|E
25|$|Steak tartare is a French dish {{made from}} finely chopped or ground (minced) raw meat (often beef). More accurately, {{it is scraped}} {{so as not to}} let <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> of the sinew fat get into the scraped meat. It is often served with onions, capers, {{seasonings}} such as fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes raw egg yolk.|$|E
25|$|Much {{like the}} role of {{sacrifice}} elsewhere in the world, it thus seems that these rites functioned {{as a type of}} atonement for Aztec believers. Aztec society viewed <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> tlatlacolli ('sin' or 'insult') as an extremely malevolent supernatural force. To avoid such calamities befalling their community, those who had erred punished themselves by extreme measures such as slitting their tongues for vices of speech or their ears for vices of listening. Other methods of atoning wrong doings included hanging themselves, or throwing themselves down precipices.|$|E

5000|$|On the poem's {{publication}} in the author's collection Where the Pelican Builds and Other Poems, a reviewer in the Queensland Figaro and Punch opined that the poem [...] "though very short, is as striking a poetic deliverance as I have seen {{for a long}} time, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slight</b> obscurity of meaning {{in the last few}} lines lends an air of mysticism to a conclusion which contrasts strongly with, and not unpleasingly tempers the intense realism of, the opening." ...|$|R
25|$|If special {{relativity}} is true, then each observer {{will have their}} own plane of simultaneity, which contains {{a unique set of}} events that constitutes the observer's present moment. Observers moving at different relative velocities have different planes of simultaneity hence different sets of events that are present. Each observer considers their set of present events to be a three-dimensional universe, but <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> movement of the head or offset in distance between observers can cause the three-dimensional universes to have differing content. If each three-dimensional universe exists, then the existence of multiple three-dimensional universes suggests that the universe is four-dimensional. The argument is named after the discussions by Rietdijk (1966) and Putnam (1967). It is sometimes called the RietdijkPutnamPenrose argument.|$|E
25|$|The flag of Saudi Arabia {{bears the}} shahada or Islamic {{declaration}} of faith. Because the shahada is considered holy, Saudi Arabia's flag code is extremely strict and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> violation amounts to desecration {{not only of}} the flag but is also blasphemous to Islam. This has led to several incidents of controversy. In 1994, McDonald's printed carry-out bags bearing the flags of all nations participating in the FIFA World Cup (with a green flag with Saudi Arabia's coat of arms superimposed, rather than the Saudi flag), while Coca-Cola did the same on cans of soda. Because of Saudi outrage, the companies stopped producing those items. Also during the FIFA World Cup, in 2002, Saudi officials protested against printing the flag on a soccer ball on the belief that kicking the creed with the foot was totally unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the walls}} of a sukkah can be {{constructed}} from any material that will withstand a normally anticipated terrestrial wind. If the material is not rigid and therefore will sway in the wind, the sukkah is not kosher (Talmud, Sukkah 24b). Accordingly, there is a discussion among contemporary halakhic authorities whether canvas may be used for walls: Some, such as R. Ovadiah Yosef (Shu"t Yechaveh Da'at 3:46) hold that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> degree of swaying in the wind will disqualify the sukkah walls, and thus canvas cannot realistically be employed. Others, such as the Chazon Ish, permit motion to and fro of less than three handbreadths, thereby facilitating the usage of canvas walls. The specific details of what constitutes a wall, the minimum and maximum wall heights, whether there can be spaces between the walls and the roof, and the exact material required for the s'chach (roofing) can be found in various exegetical texts.|$|E
60|$|On the whole, the {{evidence}} {{which we have}} adduced tends to establish some links between the ancient [Greek] and gens, and the totem kindreds of savages.

25|$|Ikeda {{graduated}} from the literature department of Waseda University in 1974, but became involved in filmmaking while still a student. According to Ikeda, his entry into the film industry was accidental, {{the result of a}} drunken barroom bet. His first job was at a small independent production company, Ishihara Productions, but he later moved to the major studio Nikkatsu, which at the time produced only films of the Roman porno genre, big budget versions of the pink film. At both companies, he began working as an Assistant Director, whose duties could include anything from cleaning floors to shaving actresses {{at a time when it}} was illegal to show <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> hint of pubic hair in Japanese media. Ikeda continued as an Assistant Director at Nikkatsu throughout the 1970s in such films as Flower and Snake (1974), Wife to be Sacrificed (1974) and Noble Lady: Bound Vase (1977), all directed by Masaru Konuma.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{critical}} reaction varied, by November 2005, the album had achieved platinum {{status in the}} US. Entertainment Weekly described the release as [...] "hilarious", and [...] "no mere comedy record". AllMusic wrote that the album [...] "rocks so damn hard", but lamented the absence {{of some of the}} songs from the television show. Flak Magazine criticised the band's use of skits between songs, describing them as [...] "distracting" [...] and a [...] "nuisance". In addition, The Independent remarked that the album was full of [...] "swearing and scatology" [...] and was [...] "bereft of <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> skidmark of humour".|$|E
500|$|Scores {{of persons}} were arrested, {{including}} many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann, a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati {{at the time}} of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford; James Pumphrey, from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd, the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac.|$|E

60|$|When John Thornton froze {{his feet}} in the {{previous}} December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson.

She looked past her, {{and it might}} have been thought that she was considering very critically the pattern of the curtains. Another advantage of the basement, from Mrs. Milvain's point of view, was that it made it necessary to sit very close together, and the light was dim compared with that which now poured through three windows upon Katharine and the basket of flowers, and gave <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slight</b> angular figure of Mrs. Milvain herself a halo of gold.|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert {{praised the}} {{production}} design, scale model work, matte paintings, cinematography, and characters. [...] "But {{the problem with}} the movie is that it's all surface and no substance," [...] Ebert wrote. [...] "Not <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> attempt is made to suggest that the film takes its own story seriously. Everything is style. The performances seem deliberately angled as satire." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described The Hudsucker Proxy as being [...] "pointlessly flashy and compulsively overloaded with references to films of the 1930s. Missing in this film's performances is a sense of humanity, the crucial ingredient in the movies Hudsucker is clearly trying to evoke. Hudsucker isn't the real thing at all. It's just a proxy." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Bertin {{wrote in}} his 1735 {{textbook}} The Noble Game of Chess, [...] "He that plays first, is understood to have the attack." [...] This {{is consistent with the}} traditional view that White, by virtue of the first move, begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame, while Black should strive to neutralize White's initiative and attain equality. Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, [...] "Black players cannot afford to make <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> mistake ... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different: White has to strive for a win, Black‚Äîfor a draw!" ...|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} Sholes {{discovered a}} problem while recording Presley. RCA Victor had always insisted their performers stay still as they sang so the microphone {{would pick up}} the vocals; <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> tilt of the head would result in missing sound. Sholes had told Presley to stand on a painted X on the floor, telling him [...] "Whatever you do, don't move". During the recording of [...] "I Got a Woman", Sholes noticed that Presley's voice and guitar were not always being {{picked up by the}} microphone. Presley explained to Sholes that he had to [...] "jump around to sing it right. It's something that just happens‚Äîjust a part of the way I sing". Sholes arranged for the whole studio to be re-miked so that Presley's voice and guitar could be picked up from anywhere in the studio, and recording continued.|$|E

40|$|Academics and {{practitioners}} have long maintained that internationally diversified portfolios are more efficient‚Äîoffer better risk-return performance‚Äîthan a purely domestic portfolio. We examine {{the effectiveness of}} international diversification {{in the presence of}} periodic rebalancing and associated transaction costs. We find that the benefits of international diversification are much smaller than previously understood. Our findings suggest that only a small allocation (10 %) of a domestic equities portfolio to international securities may be justified. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>slight</b> advantage of <b>the</b> international diversification may disappear when taxes are incorporated in portfolio evaluation. ¬© 2004 Academy of Financial Services.
