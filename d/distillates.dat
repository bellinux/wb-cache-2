5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{knew of the}} {{technique}} of distillation, {{but it was not}} practiced on a major scale in Europe until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water-cooled glass alembics were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term for all kinds of <b>distillates.</b> The early use of various <b>distillates,</b> alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic <b>distillates</b> were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum <b>distillates.</b> It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed <b>distillates,</b> are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to a Presidential request, this study examines how the <b>distillate</b> fuel oil market (and related energy markets) in the Northeast behaved {{in the winter of}} 1999 - 2000, explains the role played by residential, commercial, industrial, and electricity generation sector consumers in <b>distillate</b> fuel oil markets and describes how that role is influenced by the structure of tie energy markets in the Northeast. In addition, this report explores the potential for nonresidential users to move away from <b>distillate</b> fuel oil and how this might impact future prices, and discusses conversion of <b>distillate</b> fuel oil users to other fuels over the next 5 years. Because the President's and Secretary's request focused on converting factories and other large-volume users of mostly high-sulfur <b>distillate</b> fuel oil to other fuels, transportation sector use of low-sulfur <b>distillate</b> fuel oil is not examined here...|$|R

40|$|<b>Distillate</b> fuels have {{specifications}} on {{flow properties}} at low temperature. Catalytic dewaxing {{is an important}} process to upgrade fuels to meet these specifications. Mobil Oil Corporation, a predecessor of ExxonMobil Corporation, patented the zeolite ZSM- 5 catalyst in 1972. ZSM- 5 catalyzed <b>distillate</b> dewaxing was first introduced after intensive pilot tests in 1978 and has been continuously improved upon. Today, the ExxonMobil <b>Distillate</b> Dewaxing (MDDW) process is used worldwide more than 30 licensees who have a combined dewaxing capacity in excess of 160, 000 BPD. A more recent <b>Distillate</b> dewaxing process via isomerization, which uses proprietary bifunctional molecular sieve – metal catalys. ExxonMobil catalyst was first introduced in ExxonMobil’s Jurong refinery in 1990. This process gives higher <b>distillate</b> yield by isomerizing waxy materials in a feedstock, rather than removal by cracking. The technology lends itself to use with other catalysts in units to produce low pour point, ultra-low sulfur <b>distillate</b> products with premium qualities.

50|$|When the {{distillation}} is complete: {{the heat}} is removed, the vacuum connection is closed, and inert gas is purged through the distillation head and the <b>distillate</b> receiver. While under the inert gas purge, remove the <b>distillate</b> receiver and cap it with an air-tight cap. The <b>distillate</b> receiver can be stored under vacuum or under inert gas by using the side-arm on the distillation flask.|$|R
500|$|An {{alternative}} to continuous distillation is batch distillation, where {{the mixture is}} added to the unit {{at the start of the}} distillation, <b>distillate</b> fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. [...] Because each of the <b>distillate</b> fractions are taken out at different times, only one <b>distillate</b> exit point (location) is needed for a batch distillation and the <b>distillate</b> can just be switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. [...] Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. [...] In a continuous distillation, each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. [...] In practice when there are multiple <b>distillate</b> fractions, the <b>distillate</b> exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column. The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit, but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} antibacterial and antifungal activity of steam <b>distillate</b> of Moringa oleifera Lam, a pan-tropical species {{known for its}} nutritional and medicinal properties. A considerable reduction {{in the growth of}} test bacteria was observed by <b>distillate</b> suggesting antibacterial effect. Among bacteria tested, more inhibition was observed in case of E. coli followed by S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis. Inhibition of fungi was observed as reduced colony diameter in plates poisoned with <b>distillate</b> as compared to control plates. More inhibition of A. niger was observed followed by A. oryzae, A. terreus and A. nidulans. The antimicrobial activity of steam <b>distillate</b> of M. oleifera could be attributed to the inhibitory components present in the <b>distillate</b> fraction. Further studies involving separation of active constituents and determining biological efficacy are to be carried out...|$|R
25|$|If the point, A {{had been}} chosen {{to the right of}} the {{azeotrope}} rather than to the left, the <b>distillate</b> at point C would be farther to the right than A, which is to say that the <b>distillate</b> would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. So in this case too, the <b>distillate</b> moves away from the azeotrope and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes. No amount of distillation, however, can make either the <b>distillate</b> or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture. This is characteristic of all azeotropes.|$|R

25|$|Under {{negative}} pressure, {{power for}} a vacuum source is needed and the reduced boiling {{points of the}} <b>distillates</b> requires that the condenser be run cooler to prevent distillate vapours being lost to the vacuum source.

25|$|Metaxa's {{smoothness}} {{comes from}} its Muscat wine. The resulting <b>distillates</b> {{are kept in}} cellars, in limousin French oak barrels.

25|$|Since {{the most}} common {{aromatic}} compounds are derivatives of benzene (an aromatic hydrocarbon common in petroleum and its <b>distillates),</b> the word “aromatic” occasionally refers informally to benzene derivatives, {{and so it was}} first defined. Nevertheless, many non-benzene aromatic compounds exist. In living organisms, for example, {{the most common}} aromatic rings are the double-ringed bases in RNA and DNA. An aromatic functional group or other substituent is called an aryl group.|$|E
25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a positive azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the <b>distillate</b> being closer in composition to the azeotrope than the starting mixture. For example, if a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water is distilled once, the <b>distillate</b> will be 80% ethanol and 20% water, which is closer to the azeotropic mixture than the original. Distilling the 80/20% mixture produces a <b>distillate</b> that is 87% ethanol and 13% water. Further repeated distillations will produce mixtures that are progressively closer to the azeotropic ratio of 95.5/4.5%. No numbers of distillations will ever result in a <b>distillate</b> that exceeds the azeotropic ratio. Likewise, when distilling a mixture of ethanol and water that is richer in ethanol than the azeotrope, the <b>distillate</b> (contrary to intuition) will be poorer in ethanol than the original but slightly richer than the azeotrope. This means the solution left behind will be richer in ethanol.|$|R

40|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} for enhanced condensation in air gap {{membrane distillation}} (AGMD) may provide significantly improved <b>distillate</b> production rates and increased thermal efficiency. While AGMD {{is one of}} the most thermally efficient membrane distillation desalination configurations, large transport resistances in the air gap limit <b>distillate</b> production rates. AGMD experiments were performed with combinations of untreated, hydrophobic, and superhydrophobic condensation surfaces. A nanostructured copper oxide coated condensing surface produced durable 164 °± 4 ° contact angles and jumping droplet condensation. Tests were also performed on the air gap spacer, in this case a small diameter support mesh, to judge the effects of superhydrophobic treatment and conductivity on <b>distillate</b> production for AGMD. A novel visualization technique was implemented to see through PVDF membranes and confirm air gap behavior. The experiments were compared with numerical modeling of AGMD film-wise condensation and flooded-gap MD. The results indicate that the introduction of superhydrophobic surfaces can result in improvements in <b>distillate</b> production in excess of 60 % over standard AGMD. However, for high <b>distillate</b> production, condensation on the superhydrophobic plate transitions from a partially wetted droplet morphology to Wenzel flooded (wetting) conditions. Mildly hydrophobic condensing surfaces were found to provide moderate improvement in <b>distillate</b> production. Superhydrophobic support meshes made a negligible difference in <b>distillate</b> production, but high conductivity support meshes showed significant increases in flux at the expense of increased conduction losses. The results outline recommended superhydrophobic condensation conditions at varied feed and cold side temperatures for substantial improvement to <b>distillate</b> production rate for AGMD systems in a flat plate configuration.

25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the smell and taste of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing <b>distillates</b> matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve.
