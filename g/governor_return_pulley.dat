50|$|They {{also built}} {{ploughing}} engines. Unlike the better-known Fowlers, the Howard used {{a pair of}} winding drums. This allowed a single engine and an anchored <b>return</b> <b>pulley</b> to plough, rather than the Fowler system that used a pair of engines, each one pulling alternately. The two drums were too large to fit in the usual position beneath the boiler and so were moved to a horizontal axle behind the engine's scuttle, {{with a pair of}} sheaves beneath the boiler to guide the cables.|$|R

50|$|The four galleys served {{during the}} 1779 Siege of Savannah, a failed Franco-American attempt to retake {{the city from}} the British.

5000|$|I {{made three}} errors, such {{it was right}} that the realm is rebelling against me! First, I {{extracted}} {{the money from the}} circuits.

60|$|No, {{there was}} no one; {{but after a few}} minutes the chief-officer {{appeared}} to be overcome by Harold's earnest entreaties, and said that he could take upon himself to act, that he would suspend the punishment till the <b>Governor's</b> <b>return,</b> when Harold might prefer his petition to him in person.|$|R

60|$|The Spanish <b>governor</b> <b>returned</b> a very {{civil and}} obliging answer, and {{immediately}} permitted us to buy what provisions we pleased for our supply, {{or anything else}} for our use; but added, that, as for allowing any exchange of merchandises, or giving leave for European goods to be brought on shore there, he was not empowered to grant.|$|R
60|$|This courteous {{correspondence}} was continued by the <b>Governor</b> <b>returning</b> {{the pistol}} and balls with thanks, and also sending Morgan a handsome gold ring {{with the message}} that he need not trouble himself to come to Panama; for, if he did, he would meet with very different fortune from that which {{had come to him}} at Porto Bello.|$|R

50|$|The <b>governor</b> <b>returned</b> to Acadia in 1632 {{after the}} signing of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Governor Isaac de Razilly decided to move the capital from Port Royal, Nova Scotia, to LaHave and built the fort. The fort was {{abandoned}} in 1636 after the death of the governor. The site of the fort was registered as an historic site on 4 June 1924.|$|R
50|$|The {{expedition}} {{was deemed}} {{a great success}} and Ovando appointed Ponce de León governor of San Juan Bautista. This appointment was later confirmed by Ferdinand II on August 14, 1509.

The new <b>governor</b> <b>returned</b> to the island as instructed, bringing with him his wife and children.|$|R

50|$|Fort Meigs was a United States {{fortification}} {{along the}} Maumee River in Ohio during the War of 1812.

Gone to buy our lands notwithstanding the book proclamation of the Governor." ...|$|R

50|$|Back in Woodbury, The Governor assembles and passionately rallies {{his troops}} against the enemy. Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman) informs The Governor {{that he and}} Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) will fight walkers, not humans, and offers to stay behind to guard the {{children}} and elderly. After The <b>Governor</b> <b>returns,</b> Tyreese says he and Sasha will leave if The Governor wants them to. After a tense moment, The Governor consents, hands Tyreese a rifle, and gruffly thanks him.|$|R
5000|$|Dom Francisco de Sousa, general {{governor}} of Brazil (1591 to 1602), {{believing in the}} existence of gold in the region, settled the Pelourinho—a Portuguese translation of the English [...] "pillory", symbol of the Royal power, as the village Nova Vila de Nossa Senhora da Ponte de Mont Serrat. When gold wasn't found there, the <b>governor</b> <b>returned</b> to the Royal Court. Twelve years later, Dom Francisco de Sousa changed the name of the village to Itavuvu.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1812, Indians {{from the}} Potawatomi and Miami tribes, led by Chief Winamac, {{gathered}} around Fort Wayne.

[...] The growing Indian threat outside the fort led Rhea to begin drinking heavily. On several occasions Rhea invited Indian delegates into the fort to discuss terms of peace with the Indians (mostly to ensure his own personal safety).|$|R

50|$|Begging the court's indulgence, Cardigan {{abruptly}} {{announces that}} his assistants will handle {{the rest of}} the case. He then confesses that he had been sent to reform school—with Powers—for burglary and will therefore not run for <b>governor,</b> <b>returning</b> to his defense attorney status immediately. (Powers had threatened to blackmail him if Cardigan prosecuted him.) Outside, June congratulates him for his courage and for choosing his values over his ambition. They embrace and leave hand in hand.|$|R
50|$|Both groups depart {{after the}} meeting and though reluctant, Andrea chooses to go with The Governor and his group.

Milton takes exception to the ruthlessness of the plan but does not press the issue, while The Governor keeps the agreement terms from Andrea.|$|R

5000|$|The other {{gate was}} the Porta Triumphalis. A <b>governor</b> <b>returning</b> from his {{province}} could not enter through this gate unless {{he had been}} awarded a triumph. It therefore must have been routine to use the Porta Scelerata for entering, and the Triumphalis for exiting. Funeral processions reversed the normal direction of traffic flow for the Scelerata, as the triumphal procession did for the Triumphalis. Augustus was accorded the special honor of having his funeral procession exit by the Triumphalis.|$|R
