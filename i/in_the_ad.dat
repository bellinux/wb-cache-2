5|$|Deva Victrix, {{or simply}} Deva, was a legionary {{fortress}} and {{town in the}} Roman province of Britannia {{on the site of}} the modern city of Chester. The fortress was built by the Legio II Adiutrix <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> 70s as the Roman army advanced north against the Brigantes, and rebuilt completely over the next few decades by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix. In the early 3rd century the fortress was again rebuilt. The legion probably remained at the fortress until the late 4th or early 5th century, upon which it fell into disuse.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March, a 15-second {{television}} ad aired during Saturday Night Live (SNL) depicting an animated, stylized {{version of}} the band's logo and the aforementioned image of the helmets. The music featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> {{was a result of}} the collaboration with Rodgers, who noted that various fan remixes of the clip appeared online after the airing. A second TV ad also premiered that was similar to the first on Saturday Night Live, but with a different music clip and the title Random Access Memories in place of the stylized Daft Punk logo. During the first night of Coachella Festival 2013, a third trailer debuted that featured Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams and Rodgers performing, as well as a list of collaborators on the album. The trailer also aired during Saturday Night Live the following evening, but without a list of collaborators.|$|E
5|$|Since Nintendo did {{not have}} many products, it made only a few {{commercials}} a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could reach US $5 million, easily {{four or five times}} more than most companies spent. One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the Legend of Zelda, which received {{a great deal of attention}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy (John Kassir) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda.|$|E

5|$|The Einsatzgruppen had {{its origins}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich {{following}} the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Two units of Einsatzgruppen were {{stationed in the}} Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action {{turned out not to}} be necessary because of the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. The Einsatzgruppen also followed Wehrmacht troops and killed potential partisans. Similar groups were used in 1939 for the occupation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|The Einsatzgruppen {{were formed}} under the {{direction}} of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. The Einsatzgruppen had its origins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Originally part of the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action {{turned out not to be}} necessary due to the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. From September 1939, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen.|$|E
5|$|Outmaneuvering the {{opposition}} of Vogoride and his group of conservative followers during new elections for the Divan, Kogălniceanu was able to promote Cuza in Moldavia on January 17, 1859, leading to Cuza's election for a similar position in Wallachia (February 5)—the de facto union {{of the two countries}} as the United Principalities. In October 1858, he made a clear proposal regarding the unification, which, as he noted, carried the vote with only two opposing voices (Alecu Balș and Nectarie Hermeziu, the Orthodox vicar of Roman Bishopric), being publicly acclaimed by Ion Roată, the peasant representative for Putna County. During 1859, Kogălniceanu again stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> hoc Divan and rallied support for Cuza from all factions of the unionist camp, while promoting his candidature in Bucharest—thus profiting from ambiguities in the Paris Treaty. On the day Cuza took the throne, to begin his rule as Domnitor, Mihail Kogălniceanu welcomed him with an emotional speech.|$|E

25|$|A {{nationwide}} controversy surrounded Tebow's {{decision to}} appear in an ad funded by the socially conservative organization Focus on the Family that was broadcast February 7, 2010, during Super Bowl XLIV on CBS.

25|$|An {{extensive}} {{account of}} the native tribes in Dacia {{can be found in}} the ninth tabula of Europe of Ptolemy's Geography. The Geography was probably written in the period AD 140–150, but the sources were often earlier; for example, Roman Britain is shown before the building of Hadrian's Wall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> 120s. Ptolemy's Geography also contains a physical map probably designed before the Roman conquest, and containing no detailed nomenclature. There are references to the Tabula Peutingeriana, but it appears that the Dacian map of the Tabula was completed after the final triumph of Roman nationality. Ptolemy's list includes no fewer than twelve tribes with Geto-Dacian names.|$|E
25|$|The Notitia {{does not}} record {{the number of}} personnel. Given that and the paucity of other {{evidence}} of unit sizes at that time, the size of individual units and the various commands cannot be ascertained. In turn, this {{makes it impossible to}} assess accurately the total size of the army. Depending on the strength of units, the late AD 4th century army may, at one extreme, have equaled the size of the AD 2nd century force, i. e. over 400,000 men; and at the other extreme, it may have been far smaller. For example, the forces deployed in Britain circa AD 400 may have been merely 18,000 against circa 55,000 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> 2nd century.|$|E

25|$|In July 2014, Americas PAC, a Political Action Committee {{designed}} to elect conservative Republicans, released a radio advertisement attacking Durbin {{on his staff}} salaries.

In response, lawyers representing Durbin submitted a letter claiming the information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was false and that the radio stations would be liable for airing the ad, {{with the possibility of}} losing their FCC license.

If these stipulations are met, the reward can be given out in a number of ways. The money, which can be issued both in cash or in a bank account, will be rewarded proportionally to the number of people located, and to the utility of the information provided. If two or more people provide useful information to authorities, only the first person will receive the reward.

5000|$|A popular {{series of}} well-received {{advertisements}} uses cavemen as pitchmen. Also {{developed by the}} Martin Agency, <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> center on Neanderthal-like cavemen, no different from modern-day individuals (outside of the somewhat prehistoric facial features), encountering either an ad or commercial with the tagline [...] "GEICO: so easy a caveman could do it," [...] followed by their disgust with the supposed stereotype of caveman stupidity. <b>The</b> <b>ads</b> posit a world where cavemen are still alive and active members of society <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present day, behaving and living nothing {{at all like the}} stereotypical caveman. The main characters presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> are affluent, educated, and cultured, eating at fancy restaurants, going to exclusive parties, and seeing their therapists (portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> commercials by two-time Oscar-nominated actress Talia Shire). The humor revolves around the relative normality of the cavemen's presence and their reactions to <b>the</b> stereotype represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ads,</b> and their attempts at defending themselves from the stereotype.|$|R
