25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: Precisely where and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> mathematical entities exist, {{and how do}} we know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E
25|$|Some natural {{questions}} are: {{under what}} circumstances does this formalism work, and for what operators L are expansions in series of other operators like this possible? Can any function f be {{expressed in terms of}} the eigenfunctions (are they a Schauder basis) and {{under what circumstances}} does a point spectrum or a continuous spectrum arise? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E

2500|$|The {{archaeology}} of shipwrecks [...] can {{be divided}} into a three-tier hierarchy, of which the first tier considers the wrecking process itself: how does a ship break up, how does a ship sink to the bottom, and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> remains of the ship, cargo and the surrounding environment evolve over time? The second tier studies the ship as a machine, both in itself and in a military or economic system. The third tier consists of the archaeology of maritime cultures, in which nautical technology, naval warfare, trade and shipboard societies are studied. Some consider this {{to be the most important}} [...] tier. [...] Ships and boats are not necessarily wrecked: some are deliberately abandoned, scuttled or beached. [...] Many such abandoned vessels have been extensively salvaged.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sociology}} of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding {{the positive and}} negatives {{of what happens when}} religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that “religion is the opium of the people” - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like France or Scandinavia outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, [...] "Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> latter achieve superior societal health while having {{little in the way of}} the religious values or institutions?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Cage is seen {{wearing a}} black hoodie {{throughout}} the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to Trayvon Martin and Black Lives Matter. Colter said {{it was meant to}} invoke [...] "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn’t necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero." [...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s one of the things I wanted to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black. If you’re black living in the community and you want to change things, {{there are going to be}} things that happen." [...] He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on [...] "identity", which he saw as a common element in all black art.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{transformation}} of the thematic structure of Události, the main news segment of the Czech Television. Apart from the changes in the thematic structure, it deals with formal transformations at the basic level. For the purpose of this work, a research sample, which included one week of broadcasting in 1994, 2005 and 2011, was selected. A total of 27 news segments, which contained 341 reportages, were analyzed in the three research periods. A subsequent comparison of data provided answers to <b>the</b> following questions: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> ratio of foreign and domestic topics changed? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> ratio of hard and soft news change within a single news segment?

40|$|The {{objective}} of the diploma thesis was {{to find out how}} an athletic club in Radotín functioned and was transformed mainly over the period from 1963 to 2010. The diploma thesis provides deeper findings about the relationship of local and all-national trends in sport as well as the institutional framework of sport in ČSSR and ČR. Nine research questions were defined to restrict the otherwise very wide problem area: Is there any similarity in the development of athletics at the local and all-national level? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> performance of athletes change in an athletic club? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> content of data registered in training diaries change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> catchment area for an athletic club change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> competition of an athletic club represented by other sports clubs or leisure time interest groups change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> hinterland and the equipment of an athletic club change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> approach of schools in the catchment area of an athletic club change? How has the institutional framework of approach to sport (athletics) changed after 1989 ? The questions were answered using quantitative and qualitative data.
