5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
5|$|The condor's <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> {{have few}} feathers, {{and the skin}} of the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E

5|$|Elix Skipper fought Sonjay Dutt in {{the second}} encounter.

2500|$|Spines, however, require {{maturation}} after formation. Immature spines have impaired signaling capabilities, {{and typically}} lack [...] "heads" [...] (or have very small heads), only necks, while matured spines maintain both <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> <b>necks.</b>|$|R

5|$|If it is {{necessary}} to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion of the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all {{appeared to have been}} large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E

5|$|Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> <b>necks,</b> but sturdy compact bodies. They {{have long}} pointed wings and {{sometimes}} tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes {{at dawn and}} dusk. Their legs are feathered down to the toes.|$|R
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, the typical male's <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> decorations and the bare facial skin are lost and {{the legs and}} bill become duller. The upperparts are grey-brown, and the underparts are white with grey mottling on the breast and flanks.|$|E
5|$|Pulsed-dose rate (PDR) {{brachytherapy}} involves short {{pulses of}} radiation, typically once an hour, {{to simulate the}} overall rate and effectiveness of LDR treatment. Typical tumour sites treated by PDR brachytherapy are gynaecological and <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancers.|$|E
5|$|The vulture's <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are featherless as an {{adaptation}} for hygiene, {{though there are}} black bristles on parts of the head; this lack of feathers prevents bacteria from the carrion it eats from ruining its feathers and exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of the sun.|$|E

5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E
5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} {{a high level of}} social {{interaction}} between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved {{to the front of the}} body, and <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> hunched, and general hunching of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E
5|$|Tony Gardner ({{designer}}) and {{his company}} Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta.

500|$|Pinnipeds {{can move}} around on land, {{though not as}} well as {{terrestrial}} animals. Otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and under the body so they can [...] "walk" [...] on all fours. The fore-flippers move in a transverse, rather than a sagittal fashion. Otariids rely on the movements of their <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> <b>necks</b> more than their hind-flippers during terrestrial locomotion. By swinging their <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> <b>necks,</b> otariids create momentum while they are moving. Sea lions have been recorded climbing up flights of stairs. Phocids are less agile on land. They cannot pull their hind-flippers forward, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced. Some species use their fore-flippers to pull themselves forward. Terrestrial locomotion is easier for phocids on ice, as they can sled along.|$|R
