25|$|The third {{generation}} TL {{was also the}} first car in the American market to include a 6-disc DVD-Audio system, output through an 8-speaker 225-watt system, engineered by Panasonic and tuned by Grammy-award winning Elliot Scheiner. The system also plays back regular audio CDs as well as DTS audio discs, CD-Audio, CD-Rs and CD-RWs but not MP3s. In the United States, all models were also equipped with a Bluetooth <b>HandsFree</b> Link (HFL) system, integrated with the audio system, to allow for hands-free usage of one's cell phone (provided the phone also supports Bluetooth and is compatible with the HFL's hands-free profile). In Canada, the HFL feature was not available on the base model (standard with A-Spec, Technology, and Navigation packages), though the 2005 model year saw HFL becoming standard in all Canadian models. With the built-in XM Radio tuner, owners can elect to pay a monthly subscription after the complimentary 3 months subscription expires from Acura for XM radio, which provides over 100 digital channels via satellite.|$|E
500|$|MY11: {{revisions}} to the styling identify this update, marketed by Holden as the [...] "Series II". Announced on 31 August 2010, and launched on 10 September, MY11 heralded styling changes across the range by way of new front fascias, the addition of aerodynamic lip detailing to the decklids of sedans, and new alloy wheel designs on the Berlina specification and higher. Front-end changes comprise partially reshaped headlamps, redesigned bumpers, and an enlarged grille with restyled inserts that differ throughout the model range. Inside, the interiors receive a redesigned centre console stack incorporating a new 6.5-inch touchscreen, new dashboard, rearranged controls, reconfigured ventilation outlets, and updates to trimmings and illumination colours. SV6, SS and SS V interiors are differentiated via the application of circular air vents. Standard on all models is the 6.5-inch infotainment system developed primarily by Siemens VDO. Dubbed [...] "Holden-iQ", this integrates media playback and control functions. The iQ head unit replaces the previous mechanical CD stacker with a single slot and built in storage for approximately 15 CDs worth of music (internal storage optional on the Omega). The system also features full iPod integration, USB and auxiliary input, and incorporates Bluetooth <b>handsfree</b> telephone compatibility and music streaming. On V-Series specifications, iQ incorporates satellite navigation with live traffic updates, speed zone alerts and traffic camera notification. Sedans and wagons specified with navigation also receive a reversing camera.In terms of powertrain, the MY11 brought flex-fuel capability for the 3.0-litre V6 and 6.0-litre V8, allowing them to run on E85 bio-ethanol (see above). With the MY11 update, Holden also introduced a new [...] "Redline" [...] sports package as an option on V-Series models. The package includes lightweight, forged and polished 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels from the Pontiac G8 GXP. Other Redline additions encompass four-piston Brembo high-performance brakes, stiffer [...] "FE3" [...] suspension and chromed window surrounds for sedans, and the fitment of the tyre inflater kit on the Redline Ute.|$|E
2500|$|Hydration backpacks [...] {{are also}} available. These light daypacks are {{especially}} {{designed to hold}} water in a special water bladder (also known as reservoir), and their purpose is to allow the carrier constant fluid hydration <b>handsfree,</b> so that the carrier can focus on the mission ahead without having to stop for water breaks. This is possible because of the tube that leads from the bladder (which sits within the backpack), to the front strap of the bag, which is long enough to reach {{the mouth of the}} carrier. These packs are used in extreme conditions such as military operations, during performing extreme sports and also for different competitions, races (such as Spartan or marathon) and even music festivals.|$|E
2500|$|Offered {{in three}} levels of luxury: [...] "G", [...] "G Limited Edition", and [...] "G Dignis Edition", AWD is {{optional}} on the two base trims ("G Four" [...] and [...] "G Four Limited Edition").
